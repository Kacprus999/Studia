Title = {{Vibration control based metamaterials and origami structures: A
   state-of-the-art review}},
Journal = {{MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2021}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Vibration and sound control is critical to many practical engineering
   systems in order to minimise the detrimental effects caused by
   unavoidable vibrations and noises. Metamaterials and origami-based
   structures, which have attracted increasing interests in
   interdisciplinary research fields, possess many peculiar physical
   properties, including negative Poisson's ratios, bi- or multi-stable
   states, nonlinear and tuneable stiffness features, and thus offer
   promising applications for vibration and sound control. This paper
   presents a review of metamaterials and origami-based structures as well
   as their applications to vibration and sound control. Metamaterials are
   artificially engineered materials having extremal properties which are
   not found in conventional materials. Metamaterials with abnormal
   features are firstly discussed on the basis of the unusual values of
   their elastic constants. Recent advances of auxetic, band gap and
   pentamode metamaterials are reviewed together with their applications to
   vibration and sound mitigations. Origami, as the ancient Japanese art of
   paper folding, has emerged as a new design paradigm for different
   applications. Origami-based structures can be adopted for vibration
   isolation by using their multi-stable states and desirable stiffness
   characteristics. Different origami patterns are reviewed to show their
   configurations and base structures. Special features, such as bi- or
   multi-stable states, dynamic Poisson's ratios, and nonlinear
   force-displacement relationships are discussed for their applications
   for vibration control. Finally, possible future research directions are
   elaborated for this emerging and promising interdisciplinary research
   field. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Reconfiguring graphene to achieve intrinsic negative Poisson's ratio and
   strain-tunable bandgap}},
Journal = {{NANOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{32}},

Month = {{OCT 8}},
Abstract = {{A new two-dimensional carbon-based material consisting of pentagonal and
   hexagonal elements is identified by numerical experiments, which is
   called phgraphene and possesses not only a tunable semimetallic feature
   but also a direction-dependent even sign-changed Poisson's ratio. The
   structural stability of such a new material is first checked
   systematically. It is found that phgraphene has a similar energy as the
   gamma-graphyne, a thermally stable structure from the room temperature
   to 1500 K, and elastic constants satisfying the Born-Huang criterion.
   Both the band structure and density of states are further verified with
   different techniques, which demonstrate a Dirac semimetallic
   characteristic of phgraphene. A more interesting finding is that the
   band structure can be easily tuned by an external loading, resulting in
   the transition from semimetal to semiconductor or from type I to type
   III. As a new material that may be applied in the future, the mechanical
   property of phgraphene is further evaluated. It shows that phgraphene is
   a typically anisotropic material, which has not only direction-dependent
   Young's moduli but also direction-dependent even sign-changed Poisson's
   ratios. The microscopic mechanisms of both the electrical and mechanical
   properties are revealed. Such a versatile material with tunable band
   structure and auxetic effect should have promising applications in the
   advanced nano-electronic field in the future.}},

Title = {{A nonlinear molecular mechanics model for graphene subjected to large
   in-plane deformations}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{167}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{In this paper we present a fully nonlinear stick-and-spring model for
   graphene subjected to in-plane deformations. The constitutive behaviors
   of sticks and springs are defined, respectively, by the modified Morse
   potential and a nonlinear bond angle potential. The equilibrium
   equations of the representative cell are written considering large
   displacements of the nodes (atoms) and the stability of the solutions is
   assessed using an energy criterion. The solutions for the uniaxial load
   cases along armchair and zigzag directions show that graphene is
   isotropic for small deformations, while it exhibits anisotropy when
   subjected to large deformations. Moreover, graphene shows a negative
   Poisson's ratio after a critical value of deformation. In the case of
   equibiaxial load, multiple solutions of the equilibrium are found and
   graphene can experience asymmetric deformations despite the symmetry of
   the external loads. The nonlinear formulation of the equilibrium is then
   linearized by introducing the hypothesis of small displacements. The
   expressions of Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio are derived. (c) 2021

Title = {{Effect of negative Poisson's ratio on the postbuckling behavior of
   pressure-loaded FG-GRMMC laminated cylindrical shells}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{243}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic materials have emerged to be a new type of novel engineering
   materials with unique material properties. This paper reports the
   postbuckling behaviors of pressure loaded graphene-reinforced metal
   matrix composite (GRMMC) laminated cylindrical shells under the
   influence of in-plane negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) in temperature
   environments. The GRMMCs have temperature-dependent material properties
   which can be determined using an extended micromechanical model of
   Halpin-Tsai type. A cylindrical shell is made of GRMMC layers of
   different graphene volume fractions to achieve a piece-wise functionally
   graded (FG) pattern. The postbuckling equations for the pressure-loaded
   GRMMC laminated cylindrical shells are derived using the Reddy's third
   order shear deformation shell theory with the effects of von K ` arm `
   an-type kinematic nonlinearity and temperature variation being included.
   Applying the singular perturbation technique in conjunction with a
   two-step perturbation approach, the governing equations for the shell
   postbuckling problem are solved. The results show that the postbuckling
   behaviors of pressure-loaded GRMMC laminated cylindrical shells are
   affected substantially by the in-plane NPR.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the in-plane negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) effect
   on the thermal postbuckling of graphene-reinforced metal matrix
   composite (GRMMC) laminated beams subjected to a uniform temperature

   modeling. Numerical investigations are carried out for
   (10/-10/10/-10/10)S and (10/-10/10)S GRMMC beams with in-plane NPR. The
   results show that the buckling temperature of (10/10/10)S UD beam is
   slightly higher than that of (10/-10/10/-10/10)S UD beam. The thermal

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED MECHANICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{88}},

Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{Metamaterials are man-made materials engineered to possess certain
   desired and often counterintuitive properties. It is well-known that
   elastic metamaterials may exhibit unusual bulk elastic properties when
   subject to dynamic loads at certain frequencies, such as negative
   Poisson's ratio, negative modulus, and/or negative mass density. This
   paper focuses on the modeling of a one-dimensional micropolar-type
   elastic metamaterial subject to transient dynamic loading. The
   metamaterial consists of unit cells that support both translational and
   rotational motion and can be modeled as a micropolar-type continuum.
   Interestingly, the equations governing the dynamics of the new
   micropolar-type continuum possess remarkable similitude with those
   governing the transient response of an elastic bar with elastic
   supports. The resulting governing equation is solved using the Fourier
   transform technique. The transient dynamic response of the metamaterial
   subject to an axial impact is then studied based on both the developed
   continuum model and the original discrete model. Finite element analysis
   of the equivalent bar model is also conducted. The results from the
   developed continuum model is compared with the discrete model and the
   finite element analysis to evaluate its suitability. This work presents
   a novel micropolar-type model for a specific metamaterial and
   investigates its transient response using both continuum modeling and
   discrete unit cell modeling. The results indicate that the
   micropolar-type model can accurately capture the transient behavior of
   the propagation of the strain pulse in the metamaterial}},

Abstract = {{The auxetic cellular structures with two different chiral geometries
   (tetrachiral and hexachiral) were fabricated using laser powder bed
   fusion (LPBF) technology from two different materials (aluminium alloy
   AlSi10Mg and stainless steel AISI 316L). The specimen's microstructure,
   porosity and surface texture were observed by X-ray diffraction, optical
   and electron microscopy and micro-computed tomography. The mechanical
   properties of all specimens were determined experimentally with a simple
   tensile test. The results show that hexachiral and tetrachiral auxetic
   structures have similar initial stiffness, whereas the former provides a
   more ductile response with more than four times larger failure strain.
   The AISI316L steel provides for a much more ductile response than
   AlSi10Mg at comparable normalised load-carrying capability. The samples'
   deformation behaviour was analysed with the digital image correlation
   and tracking method, where it was shown that hexachiral samples exhibit
   a lower Poisson's ratio. The experimental results were used to validate
   the corresponding computational models, providing a more detailed
   analysis of deformation behaviour. They allow for cost-effective
   parametric studies and the development of new optimised chiral
   geometries.}},

Title = {{An isogeometric approach to topological optimization design of auxetic
   composites with tri-material micro-architectures}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{271}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic composites, which can be viewed as a type of rationally man-made
   meta-composites with Negative Poisson's Ratios (NPRs), have received
   widespread discussions and applications because of the promising,
   multifunctional and advanced properties. Micro-architectures work as
   building blocks of unit cells to make up composites, which possess
   complex topologies of auxetic multi-material. However, it should be
   noted that a computational design approach with the reasonability and
   powerful capability of optimizing auxetic composites cells-by-cells is
   still in need, particularly for composites with three or more materials.
   In this study, the main focus is to develop an effective and efficient
   computational design framework for auxetic composites with the
   tri-material using Isogeometric Topology Optimization (ITO) method, in
   which a tri-material topology representation model is constructed by
   non-uniform rationally B-splines (NURBS) to effectively represent
   microstructural topology with clear and smooth boundaries. Numerical
   examples are discussed to present the effectiveness of the computational
   design framework, where a series of novel and interesting auxetic
   microarchitectures with the re-entrant or chiral deformation mechanisms
   can be found. The significance of the current work contributes to
   developing a platform that enables a scientific design of auxetic
   composites, rather than heavily depending on human intuition.}},

Title = {{Electro-induced shape memory effect of 4D printed auxetic composite
   using PLA/TPU/CNT filament embedded synergistically with continuous
   carbon fiber: A theoretical \& experimental analysis}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITES PART B-ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{220}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{A novel strategy is proposed to fabricate continuous fiber-reinforced
   electro-induced shape memory auxetic composites (CFRSMCs) by combining
   conductive filaments and continuous carbon fiber through 3D printing
   technology. In the first step, the conductive filaments were
   manufactured based on Poly-lactic-acid/
   Thermoplastic-urethane/Carbon-nanotube (PLA/TPU/CNT) blend
   nanocomposite, and the CFRSMCs were then prepared, composing different
   carbonaceous fiber content with a variety of extrusion width. The main
   aim of the present work is to evaluate the mechanical, electrical, and
   thermal properties as well as the shape memory effect (SME). With regard
   to this, the negative Poisson's ratio effect of the printed CFRSMCs was
   precisely assessed through tensile measurement, and a well-adjusted
   theoretical model was employed for further predictions. Accordingly, as
   compared to free-fiber printed samples, the CFRSMCs exhibited superb
   mechanical properties and rapid electro-induced SME (a recovery ratio of
   94\% under 10 V within 25 s). Moreover, due to tailoring coconductive
   networks by the CNTs and carbon fibers in the printed composites, a
   great deal of activation capability in the auxetic CFRSMCs could be
   revealed by various stimuli and for smart applications. This advanced
   strategy indicates a great potential to fabricate various auxetic
   electro-induced CFRSMCs used in small scale of deployable trusses or
   other lightweight smart components like adaptive energy absorption
   devices and humanscale orthopedic materials.}},

   material with a negative Poisson's ratio}},

Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{559}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{Motivated by the recent experimental exfoliation of tellurium thin film,
   and the amazing physical and chemical properties of various
   theoretically tellurene allotropes, we design a novel and stable
   pentagonal structure of tellurene (SP-type Te), and make a detailed
   comparison with other possible Te allotropes, related to their
   mechanical, electronic and thermoelectric properties. SP-type Te shows
   the higher expandability than other Te allotropes, due to its lower
   layer modulus and Young's modulus. More interestingly its Poisson's
   ratio along x (y) direction is unusually negative (similar to -0.01)
   which can be further decreased by applying coaxial strain. Three-layers
   SP-type Te can turn into a topological insulator (TI) with a nontrivial
   band gap similar to 0.03 eV when uniaxial compressional strain sigma(x)
   = 7\%. Moreover the higher the number of layers in SP-type Te, the lower
   sx inducing its topological transition requires. At room temperature,
   lattice thermal conductivity k(L) of SP-type Te is the lowest in all Te
   allotropes, and meanwhile its peak ZT for n-type doping even can reach
   up to 2.84. Thus if SP-type Te can be synthesized in future, these
   extraordinary properties would promote it with great potential in
   designing low-dimensional mechanical, spintronic and thermoelectric
   devices.}},

Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{270}},
Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{In this study, wave propagation characteristics of the Star-3/6
   structures are studied, and the effects of geometric parameters on the
   wave propagation are analyzed. Especially, Poisson's ratio is studied
   based on the long wavelength approximation of band structure. The
   Star-3/6 structures are assembled to be hexagonal and triangular
   topologies with re-entrant angles. By using the finite element method
   and Bloch's theorem, the dynamic models of the Star-3/6 structures are
   established, and the elastic wave behaviors are calculated. The effects
   of geometric parameters on distribution of band gaps are studied in
   detail. By applying the long wavelength approximation of band structure,
   the Poisson's ratio of the macrostructure is predicted, which is also
   obtained by the commercial finite element software for the comparisons.
   This paper confirms that the Star-3/6 structures have a positive
   Poisson's ratio rather than the visual negative Poisson's ratio.
   Additionally, the isotropic features of the Star-3/6 structures are
   evaluated by the group velocity. The Star-3/6 structures show effective
   isotropic features in the low frequency range. As the frequency of
   elastic waves increases, the propagation speed of elastic waves
   decreases, and the wave propagation gradually becomes anisotropic.}},

Abstract = {{Two dimensional (2D) auxetic materials with large negative Poisson's

   40.50 N/m and the moderate critical strain ranging from 0.06 to 0.16
   guarantee its extraordinary flexibility and moderate ductility. Owing to
   its unique crystal structure, the anisotropy of basic mechanical
   parameters, electrical conductance, and optical absorption are
   concentrated on the CaAs3 monolayer. Moreover, the electric
   field-induced tunability of optical absorption also emerged in the CaAs3

Title = {{Design and development of auxetic structure using a two-step hybrid
   optimization technique}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN MATERIALS AND PROCESSING TECHNOLOGIES}},
Abstract = {{Structures that possess Negative Poisson's Ratio are known as auxetics.
   The successful application of auxetics requires appropriate design
   optimisation. Hence, in the present work, customised auxetics namely
   re-entrant honeycomb, missing rib and anti-tri-chiral has been developed
   using a two-step hybrid optimisation technique. The technique is based
   on the amalgamation of multiobjective optimisation and topological
   optimisation. A combined objective is set as maximum elastic moduli and
   minimum Poisson's ratio with prioritised objective as maximum elastic
   moduli and mass as the response constraint. Initially, an optimal shape
   of a unit cell based on the Pareto front has been chosen considering the
   prioritised objective. Thereafter, finite element simulation was
   performed to evaluate the auxetic behaviour followed by topological
   optimisation using the density-based method. Using the developed model,
   the morphological and mechanical properties of the designed auxetics
   have been compared. The re-entrant honeycomb structure has been found as
   the most reliable auxetics with the highest elastic modulus and auxetic
   behaviour. The induced maximum stress in the array and structure of
   re-entrant honeycomb was 320.7 MPa and 168.77 MPa respectively. The
   results revealed that the developed methodology can be utilised as an
   advanced tool for achieving topologically optimised auxetics with
   desired properties.}},

Title = {{A review of fused deposition modelling for 3D printing of smart
   polymeric materials and composites}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN POLYMER JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{156}},
Month = {{AUG 5}},
Abstract = {{Over the last 10 years, a dispersion of applications of additive
   manufacturing (AM) into various fields has emerged. One area in which AM
   has created a surge of research interest and innovation in recent years
   relates to the fabrication of smart materials, which is fueled by the
   ever-broadening scope of deployment of functional devices. As
   researchers embrace this new paradigm, the spread merits a careful
   appraisal of the trends to understand the dynamics of evolution of this
   technology in different sub-fields. In light of the aforesaid, this
   paper chronicles the recent progress and presents a snapshot of reported
   resources and processing considerations enabling the accelerated
   adoption of fused deposition modelling (FDM) for polymeric smart
   structures. Sections of the review capture reported processing
   conditions and properties of components fabricated with FDM using either
   piezoelectric poly(vinylidene fluoride) polymer along with its
   composites or shape memory polymers/ composites. The review highlights
   applications that range from simple planar structures, lattice/auxetic
   structures, energetic composites, adaptive/shape-morphing metamaterials,
   to thermo-/optical-/hydro-sensitive components. It is surmised that
   while the adoption of FDM in this area has been rapid, more concerted
   efforts are needed concerning the synthesis of smart polymer feedstocks,
   process simulation for defect minimization, tuning of the FDM process,
   and standardization of tests for characterizations of fabricated
   samples.}},

Abstract = {{Pristine germanene is a zero-gap semi-metal, which may hinder its
   practical application in semiconducting devices. Here, on the basis of
   the structural characteristics of digermyl ether, we theoretically
   design a two-dimensional crystal, namely germanether. Germanether
   exhibits excellent dynamical and thermal stability. It possesses an
   indirect band gap of 1.37 eV and a high electron mobility of 2.32 x
   10(3) cm(2) V-1 s(-1). The uniaxial strain and layer stacking order can
   trigger an indirect-to-direct band gap transition. More interestingly,
   germanether has remarkable in-plane negative Poisson's ratios with the
   largest one (similar to-0.2) five times of borophenes and three times of
   penta-graphene. The negative Poisson's ratio arises from the interplay
   of Ge-O tetrahedron symmetry and Ge-4d orbitals involvement, which is
   different from previously reported auxetic materials. All these findings
   render germanether is a competitive material for the future application
   in nanomechanics and nanoelectronics.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the noticeable structural similarity and being neighborhood in
   periodic table of group-IV and -V elemental monolayers, whether the
   combination of group-IV and -V elements could have stable nanosheet
   structures with optimistic properties has attracted great research
   interest. In this work, we performed first-principles simulations to
   investigate the elastic, vibrational and electronic properties of the
   carbon nitride (CN) nanosheet in the puckered honeycomb structure with
   covalent interlayer bonding. It has been demonstrated that the
   structural stability of CN nanosheet is essentially maintained by the
   strong interlayer sigma bonding between adjacent carbon atoms in the
   opposite atomic layers. A negative Poisson's ratio in the out-of-plane
   direction under biaxial deformation, and the extreme in-plane stiffness
   of CN nanosheet, only slightly inferior to the monolayer graphene, are
   revealed. Moreover, the highly anisotropic mechanical and electronic
   response of CN nanosheet to tensile strain have been explored.}},

Title = {{The effect of pore shape on the Poisson ratio of porous materials}},

Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{8, SI}},
Pages = {{1191-1203}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{A brief review is given of the effect of porosity on the Poisson ratio
   of a porous material. In contrast to elastic moduli such as K, G, or E,
   which always decrease with the addition of pores into a matrix, the
   Poisson ratio nu may increase, decrease, or remain the same, depending
   on the shape of the pores, and on the Poisson ratio of the matrix phase,
   nu o . In general, for a given pore shape, there is a unique critical
   Poisson ratio, nu c , such that the addition of pores into the matrix
   will cause the Poisson ratio to increase if nu o < nu c , decrease if nu
   o > nu c , and remain unchanged if nu o = nu c . The critical Poisson
   ratio for spherical pores is 0.2, for prolate spheroidal pores is close
   to 0.2, and tends toward zero for thin cracks. For two-dimensional
   materials, nu c = 1 / 3 for circular pores, 0.306 for squares, 0.227 for
   equilateral triangles, and again approaches 0 for thin cracks. The
   presence of a ``trapped{''} fluid in the pore space tends to cause nu c
   to increase, and for the range of parameters that may occur in rocks or
   concrete, this increase is more pronounced for thin crack-like pores
   than for equi-dimensional pores. Measurements of the Poisson ratio
   therefore may allow insight into pore geometry and pore fluid. If the
   matrix phase is strongly auxetic, small amounts of porosity will
   generally not cause the Poisson ratio to become positive.}},

Title = {{Comparison of Pediatric Otolaryngology clinical and operative case
   volume among surgical specialties in the COVID-19 pandemic}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{147}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: To report changes in clinical and surgical volume impacting
   a Pediatric Otolaryngology division one year prior to and following the
   onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in comparison to five other pediatric
   surgical subspecialties. Methods: The number of clinical visits and
   surgical cases per month for six pediatric surgical specialties
   (Otolaryngology, Orthopedic Surgery, Urology, Neurosurgery, Plastic
   Surgery, and General Surgery) for 12 months prior to the pandemic and 12
   months following the onset of the pandemic was collected. Poisson
   regression analysis was performed for the number of visits and cases per
   season adjusting for specialty, season, staffing changes, and the
   pandemic to determine adjusted rate ratios (aRR) post-pandemic for the
   surgical fields compared to Otolaryngology. Results: A percentage
   decrease in median visits per paired month (-15.63\%, IQR = -23.01,
   -1.66) and operative cases (-19.86\%, IQR = -29.39, -10.17) was seen for
   Pediatric Otolaryngology. Regression analysis showed a significant
   negative effect on the number of visits (aRR = 0.74, 95\% CI =
   0.70-0.77) and cases (aRR = 0.65, 95\% CI = 0.60-0.71) due to the
   pandemic. While many of the other specialties had predicted reductions
   in volume (notably Orthopedics), they all experienced significant
   predicted increases in productivity following the pandemic compared to
   Otolaryngology. Conclusions: These findings suggest that Pediatric
   Otolaryngology is particularly vulnerable to this change in clinical
   pattern, which could be due to a decline in community infections from
   mask wearing and social distancing, and may result in a longer-term
   volume deficit when compared to other pediatric surgical subspecialties.}},

Abstract = {{Oblique impact loading conditions are common in automobile collision
   accidents, which strongly influence the energy absorption performance of
   thin-walled structures. In this paper, a novel three-dimensional (3-D)
   hexagonal structure-filled crash box with better comprehensive
   crashworthiness under multiple working conditions is proposed. First,
   the finite element models of four 3-D typical cellular structures
   (hexagon structure, re-entrant hexagon structure, star-shape structure,
   double arrow structure) are established. The dynamic responses of four
   structures under different impact angles (from 0 degrees to 30 degrees)
   and impact velocities (from 5 to 15 m/s) are discussed. The results
   reveal that the 3-D hexagonal structure has great advantages in terms of
   the energy absorption at varying inclination angles. Second, the 3-D
   hexagonal structure is filled in the crash box in the form of gradient
   distribution. The multi-island genetic algorithm (MIGA) based on the
   response surface model (RSM) is utilized to explore the optimal design
   of crash box. Compared with the traditional crash box, the optimal 3-D
   hexagonal structure-filled crash box increases 18.9\% in specific energy
   absorption and decreases 21.7\% in maximum peak force, which
   demonstrates great potential for applications in impact engineering.}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel lattice structure for energy absorption
   application is proposed that is modified from the traditional
   face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice by introducing a cross-rod at the
   center of the cell. A thorough study is carried out to investigate the
   quasi-static crushing behavior of the proposed lattice through
   theoretical modeling, numerical simulation and experimental tests. The
   experimental specimens are fabricated via additive manufacturing
   technique of selective laser melting (SLM). The plateau stress and
   energy absorption obtained from the theoretical, numerical and
   experimental approaches are consistent with each other. It indicates
   that the new lattice structures have larger plateau stress and better
   energy absorption performance than the traditional FCC structure. Both
   2D and 3D configurations are examined and show the same tendency. A
   numerical parametric study is carried out to investigate the effect of
   the geometric parameters, which indicates that the proposed lattice
   structures with appropriate length coefficient have larger energy
   absorption capacity compared with the traditional FCC lattice. In

Abstract = {{Due to the noticeable structural similarity and being neighborhood in
   periodic table of group-IV and -V elemental monolayers, whether the
   combination of group-IV and -V elements could have stable nanosheet
   structures with optimistic properties has attracted great research
   interest. In this work, we performed first-principles simulations to
   investigate the elastic, vibrational and electronic properties of the
   carbon nitride (CN) nanosheet in the puckered honeycomb structure with
   covalent interlayer bonding. It has been demonstrated that the
   structural stability of CN nanosheet is essentially maintained by the
   strong interlayer sigma bonding between adjacent carbon atoms in the
   opposite atomic layers. A negative Poisson's ratio in the out-of-plane
   direction under biaxial deformation, and the extreme in-plane stiffness
   of CN nanosheet, only slightly inferior to the monolayer graphene, are
   revealed. Moreover, the highly anisotropic mechanical and electronic
   response of CN nanosheet to tensile strain have been explored.}},

Title = {{In-plane compression behaviors of the auxetic star honeycomb:
   Experimental and numerical simulation}},
Journal = {{AEROSPACE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{115}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{In this study, two types of star honeycombs with different cell-wall
   angles were fabricated by additive manufacturing technology for in-plane
   compression tests. Experiment results show that the cell-wall angle has
   no evident effect on the deformation modes, but the small cell-wall
   angle can improve the energy absorption capacity of star honeycombs. In
   addition, the unilateral horizontal maximum strain (UHMS) is proposed to
   evaluate the deformation stability of the honeycomb. Subsequently,
   numerical simulations are conducted to further investigate the
   influences of macro and micro geometric parameters on the in-plane
   compression behavior of star honeycombs. The results show that reducing
   the orthogonal array ratio and length of the ligament can significantly
   enhance the deformation stability and energy absorption capacity.
   Moreover, in accordance with the deformation mechanisms of a typical
   cell, a theoretical model is established to predict the plateau stress
   of star honeycomb under quasi-static loading. The theoretical results
   are in good agreement with the simulation results. Finally, three types
   of improved star honeycombs (ISH) are constructed by adjusting the
   ligament length, which improved the specific energy absorption by 30\%
   compared with the classic star honeycomb. Besides, the ISH-II exhibits a
   stable deformation mode with a significant NPR effect. The results are
   expected to provide references for designing and optimizing the star
   honeycomb structure. (C) 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The double V-wing honeycomb can be applied in many fields because of its
   lower mass and higher performance. In this study, the volume, in-plane
   elastic modulus and unit cell area of the double V-wing honeycomb were
   analytically derived, which became parts of the theoretical basis of the
   novel equivalent method. Based on mass, plateau load, in-plane elastic
   modulus, compression strain and energy absorption of the double V-wing
   honeycomb, a novel equivalent method mapping relationship between the
   thickness-width ratio and the basic parameters was established. The
   various size factor of the equivalent honeycomb model was denoted as n
   and constructed by the explicit finite element analysis method. The
   mechanical properties and energy absorption performance for equivalent
   honeycombs were investigated and compared with hexagonal honeycombs
   under dynamic impact. Numerical results showed a well coincidence for
   each honeycomb under dynamic impact before 0.009 s. Honeycombs with the
   same thickness-width ratio had similar mechanical properties and energy
   absorption characteristics. The equivalent method was verified by
   theoretical analysis, finite element analysis and experimental testing.
   Equivalent honeycombs exceeded the initial honeycomb in performance
   efficiency. Improvement of performance and weight loss reached 173.9\%
   and 13.3\% to the initial honeycomb. The double V-wing honeycomb
   possessed stronger impact resistance and better load-bearing capacity
   than the hexagonal honeycomb under impact in this study. The equivalent
   method could be applied to select the optimum honeycomb based on
   requirements and improve the efficiency of the double V-wing honeycomb.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To evaluate a low-cost multimodal intervention on the
   acquisition of carbapenem-non-susceptible Acinetobacter baumannii,
   Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa by patients in
   low-resource intensive care units. Materials and methods: We performed a
   quasi-experimental study in a referral hospital in Jakarta, Indonesia:
   pre intervention phase 1 (2013-2014), intervention phase 2 (2014-2015)
   and post-intervention phase 3 (2015-2016). The intervention was hand
   hygiene promotion and environmental cleaning and disinfection combined
   with patient disinfection and cohorting. The primary outcome was
   acquisition of resistant bacteria per 100 patient-days at risk, which
   was assessed by active microbiological surveillance and analysed with a
   multilevel Poisson segmented regression model. Results: In phase 1 (387
   patients), the acquisition rate was 4.3/100 days for
   carbapenem-non-susceptible A. baumannii versus 1.1/100 days for both K.
   pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa. There was a significant step change from
   phase 1 to phase 3 (361 patients) in the acquisition of
   carbapenem-non-susceptible strains, the incidence rate ratio (IRR) was
   0.343 (99\%CI: 0.164-0.717). This significant change was mainly due to
   reduced acquisitions of resistant A. baumannii (IRR 0.4, 99\%CI:
   0.181-1.061). Negative confounding was observed. Conclusion: A
   multimodal intervention to prevent acquisition of resistant pathogens is
   feasible and may be effective in ICUs in lower-middle income countries.

Abstract = {{In order to efficiently evaluate and design honeycomb structures with
   excellent energy-absorbing ability, inplane dynamic response and
   multi-objective optimization of negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) honeycomb
   structures with sinusoidal curve are performed in this work. By
   establishing the in-plane impact finite element model, the deformation
   modes and in-plane dynamic responses of the sinusoidal NPR honeycomb
   structures under different impact velocities are detailed studied. And
   the geometric parameters (e.g., the amplitude and period) of the
   sinusoidal curve that affect the energy absorption performance of the
   structure are analyzed. Combining the optimal latin hypercube design
   method with the double-points infilling criterion, the highprecision
   adaptive Kriging models of the peak crush force (PCF) and the specific
   energy absorption (SEA) with respect to the amplitude and period are
   constructed. And then, a multi-objective crashworthiness optimization is
   carried out by non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II). The
   Pareto optimal solution set is gained and the final compromise solution
   is then obtained based on the fitness function. The optimized results
   show the PCF of the sinusoidal NPR honeycomb structure decreases by
   30.53\%, while the SEA increases by 38.55\%. It indicates that the
   optimized sinusoidal honeycomb structure has better energy absorption
   performance than the conventional concave hexagonal honeycomb. The
   results can provide some important design guidance for other honeycomb
   energy-absorbing structures.}},

Title = {{MXene/polyurethane auxetic composite foam for electromagnetic
   interference shielding and impact attenuation}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITES PART A-APPLIED SCIENCE AND MANUFACTURING}},
Year = {{2021}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Lightweight electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding and impact
   attenuating materials are vital to protect delicate components in
   portable electronics. While conductive foams are intriguing for
   lightweight EMI shielding, their impact attenuating properties remain
   unexplored. Herein, a MXene/auxetic polyurethane (MX/ APU) composite
   foam is developed for multifunctional EMI shielding and impact
   attenuation. The MX/APU composite presents a superior EMI shielding
   effectiveness (SE) of 76.2 dB, 31.2\% higher than its non-auxetic
   counterpart at the same density owing to the larger specific surface
   area arising from the auxetic structure. Given its ultralow density of
   0.063 g cm-3, it yields a specific SE of 1210 dB cm3 g-1, placing it
   among the best candidates for lightweight applications. The negative
   Poisson's ratio of MX/APU composite foam also delivers
   multifunctionalities of impact attenuation, reducing the peak force by
   51.4\% compared to a non-auxetic foam. This work provides a conceptually
   new approach to design lightweight multifunctional materials using
   auxetic structures.}},

   harvesting at low-frequency excitation}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{295}},
Month = {{AUG 1}},
Abstract = {{Here, we utilize the auxetic concept to improve output electrical power
   and reduce resonance frequency for the piezoelectric vibration energy
   harvesting. An energy harvester consists of a proof mass and two
   supporter beams with piezoelectric patches, is proposed. Presented
   energy harvester prototype is appropriate for applications with limited
   allowable displacement. Three different auxetic structures are proposed
   and their performances are compared to the conventional plain system.
   Finite element (FE) modelling is provided to evaluate these structures
   and optimize their geometrical parameters and electrical resistance to
   achieve the best energy harvesting performance. The FE model is
   validated through experimental tests in which the energy harvesters with
   optimized parameters are excited by an electrodynamic shaker in
   different frequencies. It is shown that the proposed designs are able to
   remarkably enhance the harvested electrical power with respect to the
   plain structure. The experimental tests show that the Auxetic-I, II and
   III could enhance the output electrical power with a magnification
   factor of 10, 6.7 and 6.1 respectively, compared to the conventional
   structure. The resonant working frequency reduced up to 30.45\%, 19.55\%
   and 27.53\% for different designs.}},

Title = {{Mechanotropism of single cells adhering to elastic substrates subject to
   exogenous forces}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICS AND PHYSICS OF SOLIDS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{153}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Adherent cells are able to actively generate internal forces, channelled
   by cytoskeletal protein filaments and transmitted through transmembrane
   receptors to the surrounding environment by means of focal adhesions.
   Cells also dynamically interact with extracellular matrix by sensing
   external chemo-mechanical stimuli and then inducing formation of stress
   fibres mediated by polymerization/de-polymerization processes which
   continuously redesign the interplay between structural organization and
   contractility activities in the cytoskeleton, so orchestrating selected
   signal pathways at the basis of many important cell's physiological
   functions like adhesion, migration and division. Despite chemo- and
   duro-taxis have been intensively studied in the last years to understand
   how cells move on a substrate, their polarization and reorientation -
   observed during gastrulation, wound healing and morphogenesis - are only
   partially understood. By starting from the evidence highlighted in some
   recent studies that cells reorient in response to substrata deformation
   by essentially obeying a pure mechanical interaction, we propose to
   interpret the seeming overall cells' rotation resulting from the
   reconfiguration of their cytoskeleton - here named mechanotropism - as a
   nonlinear optimization problem in which the adherent cell aims to align
   along directions leading it to minimize a physically coherent measure of
   work spent to deform the elastic substrate while retaining a prescribed
   level of homeostatic contractile force. To do this, the single-cell is
   simply modelled as a finite size contractile force dipole that acts on
   the boundary of a half-space perturbed by applied point loads. The
   effects of fences of forces acting orthogonally and tangentially on the
   boundary of the adhesion medium and encircling the cell are then
   investigated, so obtaining solutions that predict multiple non-trivial
   cell polarizations as functions of number, direction, relative magnitude
   and distance from the cell-dipole of the forces, as well as of the
   substrate's Poisson ratio, with unprecedented outcomes under the
   hypothesis of auxetic (i.e. negative Poisson ratio) materials. The
   results lead to envisage that the proposed theoretical model might
   contribute to unveil the mechanobiological principles ruling in vivo
   cells orientation processes by guiding the design of novel experimental
   strategies and to conceive new mechanics-based markers for guessing
   cells' pathological conditions from their mechanotropism.}},

Month = {{AUG 1}},
Abstract = {{A discrete Lagrangian approach is the basis for modelling the macroscale
   elastic response of a solid material, which can be homogeneous as well
   as a periodic composite. The basic topology is a square ``heuristic
   molecule{''} that is an assemblage of four rigid bodies with a definite
   shape bonded by elastic springs. This is the minimum unit cell, UC, that
   contains all the macroscopic mechanical properties of the solid
   material, object of study. The paper presents 4 unit cells, in
   progression from a basic molecule bonded by 2 types of central forces,
   to a refined ``Cosserat-auxetic{''} molecule that is connected by 4
   types of shear and central bond-springs. The emphasis is given to the
   isotropic response in relation to the value of the macroscopic Poisson
   ratio, and the four examples of UC topologies are presented showing
   their relationship to different materials at the macro-scale: from a
   ``rari-constant{''} continuum, through a standard isotropic Cauchy
   continuum, up to an isotropic centre-symmetric auxetic Cosserat solid.

Abstract = {{The importance of cellular materials continues to increase in
   lightweight structural applications as more industries realize these
   materials are becoming more reliable, repeatable and allowing for lower
   production costs. Among all the common structural applications of
   cellular architected materials, cores for sandwich panels may perhaps be
   the most important one, and therefore, were the focus of this work. On
   the other hand, the fast-paced growth of computational power, in
   combination with the development of software and numerical methods such
   as Meshless Methods provide the necessary conditions to study intricate
   topologies which may offer improved mechanical properties for each
   different application. In this work, two periodic cellular topologies
   which are typically used in the cores of sandwich structures were
   designed, namely conventional honeycombs and re-entrant honeycombs, for
   7 different values of relative density, and tested in two different
   in-plane directions in the linear-elastic domain. The Radial Point
   Interpolation Method (RPIM) is used in this study, for the first time in
   the literature, to simulate the elasto-static behaviour of honeycomb
   structures and provides advantages over the Finite Element Method (FEM)
   in this field.}},

Abstract = {{In this work we present a three-dimensional extension of pantographic

   displacement, as the semi-auxetic property is effectively described by
   first-order stiffness terms. For a homogenization technique, discrete
   asymptotic expansion is used. The material shows two positive (0 <=
   nu(yx) , nu(yz) <= 1) and one negative Poisson's ratios (-1 >= nu(xz) >=

Journal = {{ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS}},
Abstract = {{Kirigami, the ancient paper art of cutting, has recently emerged as a
   new approach to construct metamaterials with novel properties imparted
   by cuts. However, most studies are limited to thin sheets-based 2D
   kirigami metamaterials with specific forms and limited reconfigurability
   due to planar connection constraints of cut units. Here, 3D modular
   kirigami is introduced by cutting bulk materials into spatially
   closed-loop connected cut cubes to construct a new class of 3D kirigami
   metamaterials. The module is transformable with multiple degrees of
   freedom that can transform into versatile distinct daughter building
   blocks. Their conformable assembly creates a wealth of reconfigurable
   and disassemblable metamaterials with diverse structures and unique
   properties, including reconfigurable 1D column-like materials, 2D
   lattice-like metamaterials with phase transition of chirality, as well
   as 3D frustration-free multilayered metamaterials with 3D auxetic
   behaviors and programmable deformation modes. This study largely expands
   the design space of kirigami metamaterials from 2D to 3D.}},

Title = {{Technical note: A preliminary study of dual-tracer PET image
   reconstruction guided by FDG and/or MR kernels}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Abstract = {{Purpose Clinically, single radiotracer positron emission tomography
   (PET) imaging is a commonly used examination method; however, since each
   radioactive tracer reflects the information of only one kind of cell, it
   easily causes false negatives or false positives in disease diagnosis.
   Therefore, reasonably combining two or more radiotracers is recommended
   to improve the accuracy of diagnosis and the sensitivity and specificity
   of the disease when conditions permit. Methods This paper proposes
   incorporating F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) as a higher-quality PET
   image to guide the reconstruction of other lower-count C-11-methionine
   (MET) PET datasets to compensate for the lower image quality by a
   popular kernel algorithm. Specifically, the FDG prior is needed to
   extract kernel features, and these features were used to build a kernel
   matrix using a k-nearest-neighbor (kNN) search for MET image
   reconstruction. We created a 2-D brain phantom to validate the proposed
   method by simulating sinogram data containing Poisson random noise and
   quantitatively compared the performance of the proposed FDG-guided
   kernelized expectation maximization (KEM) method with the performance of
   Gaussian and non-local means (NLM) smoothed maximum likelihood
   expectation maximization (MLEM), MR-guided KEM, and multi-guided-S KEM
   algorithms. Mismatch experiments between FDG/MR and MET data were also
   carried out to investigate the outcomes of possible clinical situations.
   Results In the simulation study, the proposed method outperformed the
   other algorithms by at least 3.11\% in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
   and 0.68\% in the contrast recovery coefficient (CRC), and it reduced
   the mean absolute error (MAE) by 8.07\%. Regarding the tumor in the
   reconstructed image, the proposed method contained more pathological
   information. Furthermore, the proposed method was still superior to the
   MR-guided KEM method in the mismatch experiments. Conclusions The
   proposed FDG-guided KEM algorithm can effectively utilize and compensate
   for the tissue metabolism information obtained from dual-tracer PET to
   maximize the advantages of PET imaging.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JUL 27}},
Abstract = {{We demonstrate that the consideration of material uncertainty can
   dramatically impact the optimal topological micro-structural
   configuration of mechanical metamaterials. The robust optimization
   problem is formulated in such a way that it facilitates the emergence of
   extreme mechanical properties of metamaterials. The algorithm is based
   on the bi-directional evolutionary topology optimization and
   energy-based homogenization approach. To simulate additive manufacturing
   uncertainty, combinations of spatial variation of the elastic modulus
   and/or, parametric variation of the Poisson's ratio at the unit cell
   level are considered. Computationally parallel Monte Carlo simulations
   are performed to quantify the effect of input material uncertainty to
   the mechanical properties of interest. Results are shown for four
   configurations of extreme mechanical properties: (1) maximum bulk
   modulus (2) maximum shear modulus (3) minimum negative Poisson's ratio
   (auxetic metamaterial) and (4) maximum equivalent elastic modulus. The
   study illustrates the importance of considering uncertainty for topology
   optimization of metamaterials with extreme mechanical performance. The
   results reveal that robust design leads to improvement in terms of (1)
   optimal mean performance (2) least sensitive design, and (3) elastic
   properties of the metamaterials compared to the corresponding
   deterministic design. Many interesting topological patterns have been
   obtained for guiding the extreme material robust design.}},

   concrete-A review}},
Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{292}},
Month = {{JUL 19}},
Abstract = {{Plastic due to its versatility, lighter weight and durability properties
   has become an essential part of human lives. The global plastic
   production is growing significantly every year; while the amount of
   plastic being effectively recycled is comparatively low, imposing
   negative impacts on the environment and sustainability. Recently many
   efforts have been made to develop effective means for the consumption of
   plastic waste to diminish its environmental impact. In this regard, the
   incorporation of plastic waste, as received or shredded plastic
   particles (direct) or plastic-based synthetic aggregates (indirect) in
   concrete as a replacement for natural aggregate has been studied
   extensively in last few decades.
   The current paper put forwards a comprehensive and detailed review of
   the previous studies conducted to evaluate the effect of sustainable
   synthetic aggregate replacement on the fresh, hardened, physical and
   durability related properties of the resulting concrete. The difference
   in the direct and indirect replacement of plastic on the workability,
   fresh and dry density, mechanical strengths, modulus of elasticity,
   Poisson's ratio, failure mechanism, abrasion resistance, micro structure
   analysis, drying shrinkage, creep, fire resistance, thermal
   conductivity, water absorption and chloride ion penetration are
   presented in the current paper.

Year = {{2021}},

Month = {{JUL 15}},
Abstract = {{The work describes the out-of-plane properties of a curved wall
   honeycomb structure evaluated using analytical models and finite
   elements techniques. Out-of-plane properties are calculated using a
   theoretical approach based on energy theorems and validated using a
   full-scale finite element technique to simulate transverse shear tests.
   The effects of the curvature of the walls and the depth of the honeycomb
   cells on the out-of-plane elastic constants are evaluated and excellent
   agreement is observed between theoretical and numerical models. These
   curved cell wall honeycombs feature specific (i.e., relative density
   weighted) highly tailorable upper shear bounds that shift their maximum
   values with the radiuses of the curved cell walls at different internal
   cell angles. Finally, it is also shown that these honeycombs exhibit a
   particular topology with a specific upper boundary independent of the
   non-zero curvature cell wall adopted and only dependent upon the

Abstract = {{Miniaturizing piezoelectric devices calls for the rational design of

   anisotropic in its mechanical properties with a negative Poisson's ratio
   in the {[}1 1 0] direction. Due to its non-centrosymmetric geometry and
   semiconducting characteristic, penta-CNP possesses a large spontaneous
   polarization of 4.33 x 10(-10) C/m and significant intrinsic
   piezoelectric response with d(16) = 1.80 pm/V, surpassing the previously

Abstract = {{We propose a novel two-dimensional SnS allotrope (monolayer delta-SnS)
   based on an auxetic delta-phosphorene configuration using
   first-principles calculations. This monolayer appears to have
   outstanding stability as revealed by its energetic, kinetic,
   thermodynamic, and mechanic calculations, and it can withstand
   temperatures as high as 900 K. Monolayer delta-SnS is a wide
   direct-bandgap (2.354 eV) semiconductor, and its electron mobility is as
   high as similar to 1.25 x 10(3) cm(2) V-1 s(-1), higher than that of
   monolayer KTlO (similar to 450 cm(2) V-1 s(-1)) and MoS2 (similar to 200
   cm(2) V-1 s(-1)). Optical absorption spectra, reaching up to the order
   of similar to 10(5) cm(-1), are obviously excellent in the visible-light
   region, suggesting efficient harvesting of solar radiation. Because of
   its unique atomic motif, monolayer delta-SnS presents an unusual
   bidirectional auxetic effect: a high negative in-plane Poisson's ratio
   (-0.048 and -0.068), which is larger than those for many recently
   reported two-dimensional auxetic materials, e.g., black phosphorene
   (-0.027), borophene (-0.04), and monolayer penta-B2N4 (-0.02). The
   bandgap and band edge can be substantially manipulated under strain to
   meet the requirement of the water-splitting reaction. Particularly, when
   pH = 7, suitable band-edge alignments and small overpotentials of the
   photocatalytic OER (oxygen evolution reaction) and HER (hydrogen
   evolution reaction) appear, endowing monolayer delta-SnS with great
   potential as an efficient visible-light-driven bifunctional
   photocatalyst for water splitting.}},

Title = {{Acceptability of an mHealth App That Provides Harm Reduction Services
   Among People Who Inject Drugs: Survey Study}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 14}},
Abstract = {{Background: Harm reduction services reduce the negative consequences of
   drug injection and are often embedded within syringe service programs
   (SSPs). However, people who inject drugs (PWID) suboptimally engage with
   such services because of stigma, fear, transportation restrictions, and
   limited hours of operation. Mobile health (mHealth) apps may provide an
   opportunity to overcome these barriers and extend the reach of SSPs
   beyond that of the traditional brick-and-mortar models.
   Objective: This study aims to assess the prevalence of smartphone
   ownership, the level of comfort in providing the personal information
   required to use mHealth apps, and interest in using an mHealth app to
   access harm reduction services among PWID to guide the development of an
   app.
   Methods: We administered a survey to 115 PWID who were enrolled via
   respondent-driven sampling from July 2018 to July 2019. We examined the
   extent to which PWID had access to smartphones; were comfortable in
   providing personal information such as name, email, and address; and
   expressed interest in various app-based services. We measured
   participant characteristics (demographics, health status, and behaviors)
   and used binary logistic and Poisson regressions to identify independent
   correlates of mHealth-related variables. The primary regression outcomes
   included summary scores for access, comfort, and interest. The secondary
   outcomes included binary survey responses for individual comfort or
   interest components.
   Results: Most participants were White (74/105, 70.5\%), male (78/115,
   67.8\%), and middle-aged (mean=41.7 years), and 67.9\% (74/109) owned a
   smartphone. Participants reported high levels of comfort in providing
   personal information to use an mHealth app, including name (96/109,
   88.1\%), phone number (92/109, 84.4\%), email (85/109, 77.9\%), physical
   address (85/109, 77.9\%), and linkage to medical records (72/109,
   66.1\%). Participants also reported strong interest in app-based
   services, including medication or sterile syringe delivery (100/110,
   90.9\%), lab or appointment scheduling (90/110, 81.8\%), medication
   reminders (77/110, 70\%), educational material (65/110, 59.1\%), and
   group communication forums (64/110, 58.2\%). Most participants were
   comfortable with the idea of home delivery of syringes (93/109, 85.3\%).
   Homeless participants had lower access to smartphones (adjusted odds
   ratio {[}AOR] 0.15, 95\% CI 0.05-0.46; P=.001), but no other participant
   characteristics were associated with primary outcomes. Among secondary
   outcomes, recent SSP use was positively associated with comfort with the
   home delivery of syringes (AOR 3.29, 95\% CI 1.04-10.3 P=.04), and being
   older than 50 years was associated with an increased interest in
   educational materials (AOR 4.64, 95\% CI 1.31-16.5; P=.02) and group
   communication forums (AOR 3.69, 95\% CI 1.10-12.4; P=.04).
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that aside from those experiencing
   homelessness or unstable housing, PWID broadly have access to
   smartphones, are comfortable with sharing personal information, and
   express interest in a wide array of services within an app. Given the
   suboptimal access to and use of SSPs among PWID, an mHealth app has a
   high potential to address the harm reduction needs of this vulnerable
   population.}},

Title = {{Discrimination experienced by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
   males in Australia: Associations with suicidal thoughts and depressive
   symptoms}},
Journal = {{AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Globally, Indigenous populations have higher rates of
   suicidal behavior and psychological distress compared to non-Indigenous
   populations. Indigenous populations also report high rates of exposure
   to discrimination, which could potentially contribute to poor mental
   health outcomes. The objectives of this paper were to estimate the
   prevalence of discrimination among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
   males in Australia and to examine the role of discrimination in the
   association between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander status and
   suicidal thoughts and depressive symptoms. Methods: We used
   cross-sectional data on 13,697 males aged 18-55 years from the
   Australian Longitudinal Study on Male Health. We undertook a Poisson
   regression with robust standard error analyses to examine Aboriginal and
   Torres Strait Islander status and self-perceived exposure to
   discrimination in the past 2 years as correlates of recent suicidal
   ideation. We used zero-inflated negative binomial regression to assess
   Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander status and self-perceived exposure
   to discrimination as correlates of recent depressive symptoms. Results:
   Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander males have a twofold higher
   prevalence of self-perceived discrimination (39.2\% vs 19.3\%, p <
   0.001), suicidal ideation (21.8\% vs 9.4\%, p < 0.001) and moderate or
   worse depressive symptoms (24.0\% vs 12.2\%, p < 0.001) as compared to
   their non-Indigenous counterparts. After adjusting for sociodemographics
   and substance use, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander status was
   significantly associated with suicidal thoughts (odds ratio = 1.49, p =
   0.019) and depressive symptoms (prevalence rate ratio = 1.19, p =
   0.018). About 15.3\% and 28.7\% of the association between Aboriginal
   and Torres Strait Islander status and suicidal thoughts and depressive
   symptoms, respectively, was explained by discrimination. Conclusion: Our
   analyses add to evidence that discrimination is a contributor to mental
   health disparities between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander and
   non-Indigenous populations in Australia. Reducing discrimination ought
   to be considered as part of strategies to improve the social and
   emotional well-being of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.}},

Title = {{Evolution of twinning during cyclic loading of magnesium alloy examined
   by quasi-in-situ EBSD}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{820}},
Month = {{JUL 13}},
Abstract = {{Most complex engineering components experience varied loading in use. We
   conducted successive experiments of cyclic tensile deformation followed
   by electron-backscattered diffraction imaging of the same area on each
   of several magnesium alloy (ZM) sample to investigate the microstructure
   and texture evolution during cyclic loading. In this way we correlated
   the evolving deformed microstructure of cyclically loaded magnesium to
   the initial grain orientations. To investigate the effects of the strain
   path, the behaviour of samples with and without pre-compression was
   compared. Twins can propagate from grain to grain and twin chains will
   form in the material without any pre-deformation. Twin chains are a
   result of twin transmission at grain boundaries and twin transmission
   frequency decreases with increasing grain boundary angles. In the
   absence of pre-compression, the extension twin fraction rises from 0.003
   to 0.019 after two cycles of tensile loading to a strain of 0.03, after
   which it changes only slightly as strain is increased. Twin chains in
   the pre-compressed specimen are activated without any obvious dependence
   on the matrix orientation. The fraction of extension twinning is 0.2 for
   the precompressed specimen. After a cycle of tensile loading to a total
   plastic strain of 0.015, 90\% of the extension twins undergo detwinning.
   The detwinning starts just after reverse loading. Secondary twins
   forming within primary twin interfaces start to nucleate in the
   microstructure of the pre-compressed material at an early stage (at
   plastic strain values of 0.056). This is different from the nucleation
   of secondary twins in the material without pre-compression that occurs
   at a strain of 0.104. The early formation of secondary twinning is due
   to the presence of residual primary twins in the microstructure of the
   pre-compressed material as a result of detwinning of the initial twins.}},

Abstract = {{Honeycomb is considered an excellent structural material because of its
   high strength and shear rigidity, excellent energy absorbing property,
   high impact strength, lower weight, high crushing stress, and almost
   constant crushing force. Honeycomb being a cellular solid is a
   well-known core used to build a sandwich structure while making
   structural composites. Because of this excellent mechanical performance,
   honeycombs are frequently used in the aircraft industry as a core of
   sandwich panels and in the automotive industry as efficient impact
   attenuators. The hollow spaces in the honeycomb structure reduce weight
   but also ensure required strength, provided they are designed correctly.
   3D woven honeycomb composite has a promising future in the lightweight
   application areas and can be the real substitutes for aluminum and other
   metal alloys as these structures provide structural integrity. In this
   review, the basic concept of textile-based 3D woven honeycomb
   composites, engineering design, manufacturing process,
   structure-properties relationship, and applications of 3D woven
   honeycomb fabrics and their composites are discussed in detail.
   Geometrical modeling of 3D woven honeycomb fabric and theoretical
   analysis of impact, flexural, and compression behavior of their
   composites are summarized to appreciate the potential advantages of
   textile-based honeycomb structural composites.}},

Journal = {{TRANSPORT IN POROUS MEDIA}},
Abstract = {{This work proposes a novel two-dimensional (2D) graded core with
   anti-tetrachiral cells and evaluates the numerical vibroacoustic
   response of sandwich panels with these particular cores. First, a
   homogenization scheme is utilized to model the sandwich structure,
   followed by a modal analysis of the homogenized model in the frequency
   range of 0-200 Hz. The results have been compared with those obtained
   from an exact and full-scale finite element model of the sandwich
   structure. A general good agreement has been observed for the first six
   natural frequencies. Next, the radiated sound power level in the
   frequency band of 0-200 Hz is calculated and minimized for different
   geometry parameters of the sandwich structure. A hybrid design
   optimization approach using method of moving asymptotes and genetic
   algorithm is used. The optimized 2D gradient configurations show a
   significant 78\% reduction of the normalized radiated sound power level
   and a 15\% increase of the fundamental frequency, compared to the

Journal = {{MECCANICA}},
Abstract = {{A homogenization methodology for the construction of effective Cosserat
   substitution media for heterogeneous materials is proposed, combining a
   variational principle in linear elasticity with the extended Hill-Mandel
   lemma accounting for the introduced generalized kinematics. A general
   methodology is proposed which can be applied to a wide class of
   architected materials exhibiting such micropolar chiral effects. The
   tensors of effective micropolar moduli are formulated as integrals over
   a representative unit cell utilizing of the displacement localization
   operators, solution of classical and higher-order unit cell problems.
   The proposed method delivers size-independent higher-order effective
   moduli. The effective micropolar moduli of periodic lattice materials
   endowed with chirality and non-centrosymmetry are computed as an
   application of the developed homogenization method. The homogenized
   model is validated by comparing the local and global mechanical
   responses of fully resolved networks with those of plates and macrobeams
   architected with tetrachiral or anti-tetrachiral lattices.}},

Abstract = {{A novel negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) foam-filled corrugated tube, made
   up of a corrugated tube and NPR isotropic foam core, is established by
   the finite element method. The 3D NPR isotropic foam core is achieved by
   using the triaxial compression method on a cubic Voronoi model, which is
   created based on the Voronoi tessellation technique. The triaxial
   compression ratio is defined as eta. The Poisson's ratio of Voronoi foam
   decreases sharply and then increases gradually with an increasing eta. A
   minimum Poisson's ratio, -0.076, is obtained when eta = 0.2. Moreover,
   the Voronoi foam-filled corrugated tube with minimum Poisson's ratio
   foam core exhibits the highest energy absorption capacity, which is
   10.8\% higher than that of the Voronoi foam-filled corrugated tubes with
   uncompressed foam core.}},

Title = {{Sexually transmitted infections among HIV serodiscordant partners: A
   secondary analysis of HIV Prevention Trial Network 052}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STD \& AIDS}},
Abstract = {{Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) remain a public health concern
   because of their interaction(s) with HIV. In the HPTN 052 study, STIs
   were evaluated in both HIV-positive index cases and their HIV-negative
   partners at enrollment and at yearly follow-up visits. Our definition
   for STI was based on any infection with Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria
   gonorrhoeae, syphilis, or Trichomonas vaginalis. We used log-binomial
   regression models to identify factors associated with prevalent STIs.
   Generalized estimating equation models with the Poisson distribution
   were used to compare STI incidence between HIV-positive index cases and
   HIV-negative partners. 8.1\% of the participants had STIs at enrollment.
   The prevalence of STIs (8.9 vs. 7.2) was higher in HIV-positive index
   cases than HIV-negative partners. Being female (prevalence ratio (PR) =
   1.61; 95\% CI: 1.20-2.16) or unmarried (PR = 1.92; 95\% CI: 1.17-3.14)
   was associated with prevalent STIs. Compared to HIV-negative male
   partners, HIV-positive female index cases had a higher risk of STI
   acquisition (incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 2.25; 95\% CI: 1.70-2.97).
   While we are implementing HIV prevention interventions for HIV-negative
   people, we should also intensify targeted STI prevention interventions,
   especially among HIV-positive women.}},

Title = {{Changes in Use of Respiratory Support for Preterm Infants in the US,
   2008-2018}},
Journal = {{JAMA PEDIATRICS}},
Abstract = {{IMPORTANCE In preterm infants, mechanical ventilation (MV) is associated
   with adverse pulmonary and neurodevelopmental outcomes. Multiple
   randomized clinical trials over the past 2 decades have shown the
   effectiveness of early noninvasive ventilation (NIV) in decreasing the
   use of MV in preterm infants. The epidemiologic factors associated with
   respiratory support in US preterm infants and any temporal changes after
   these trials is unknown.
   OBJECTIVE To evaluate temporal changes in MV and noninvasive respiratory
   support in US preterm infants.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In a cohort design, 2 large national
   data sets (Pediatrix Clinical Data Warehouse for the clinical cohort and
   National Inpatient Sample for the national cohort) were used to collect
   data on preterm infants (<35 weeks' gestation) without congenital
   anomalies who received active intensive care and were discharged home or
   died in the birth hospital from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2018.
   Data analysis was conducted from December 10, 2019, to December 16,
   2020.
   EXPOSURE Discharge year.
   MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES In the clinical cohort, detailed respiratory
   support data were generated, including days of MV and NIV modalities,
   and temporal trends were evaluated using multivariable modified Poisson
   or negative binomial regression models with discharge year as a
   continuous variable. In the national cohort, observed and expected
   national MV use were calculated.
   RESULTS Among 259 311 infants (47.2\% female) in 359 neonatal intensive
   care units in the clinical cohort, decreases were noted in the use (from
   29.4\% of infants in 2008 to 18.5\% in 2018, relative risk for annual
   change, 0.96; 95\% CI, 0.95-0.96) and duration (mean days, from 10.3 in
   2008 to 9.7 in 2018; rate ratio for annual change, 0.98; 95\% CI,
   0.97-0.98) of MV. Noninvasive ventilation use increased from 57.9\% of
   infants in 2008 to 67.4\% in 2018 (adjusted relative risk for annual
   change, 1.02; 95\% CI, 1.02-1.03), and mean NIV duration increased by
   3.2 days (95\% CI, 2.9-3.6 days). With increased use of continuous
   positive airway pressure and nasal intermittent positive-pressure
   ventilation as the main factors in the increase, the mean duration of
   respiratory support increased from 13.8 to 15.4 days (adjusted rate
   ratio for annual change, 1.03; 95\% CI, 1.02-1.04) from 2008 to 2018.
   Among 1 169 441 infants in the national cohort, MV use decreased from
   22.0\% in 2008 to 18.5\% in 2018, with an estimated 29 700 fewer
   ventilated infants and 142 000 fewer days of MV than expected during
   this period.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These findings suggest that preterm
   respiratory support changed significantly from 2008 to 2018, with
   decreased use and duration of MV, increased use and duration of NIV, and
   an overall increase in respiratory support duration.}},

Title = {{Influence of pore shape on impact dynamics characteristics of
   functionally graded brittle materials}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STRAIN ANALYSIS FOR ENGINEERING DESIGN}},
Abstract = {{Improving the impact energy dissipation capacity of functionally graded
   brittle materials through pore design will help avoid or delay failure.
   In order to improve the impact energy dissipation capacity of
   functionally graded brittle materials, pores with specific shapes can be
   implanted inside them. The effect of pore shape on the impact properties
   of functionally graded brittle materials was investigated using a
   lattice-spring model that can quantitatively represent the mechanical
   properties of functionally graded brittle materials. The calculated
   results show that the pores with negative Poisson's ratio such as
   inner-concave triangle, fourth-order star, and inner-concave hexagon are
   easy to collapse under the impact, while the square and square-hexagon
   pores have the strongest resistance to deformation. For all seven pore
   shapes, the Hugoniot elastic limit of the samples decreased gradually
   with increasing porosity, and the Hugoniot elastic limit did not change
   with the change of piston velocity. The propagation velocity of the
   deformation wave increases with the piston velocity and the velocity of
   the particle corresponding to the Hugoniot state behind the deformation
   wave increases accordingly. The principle that pores can enhance the
   macroscopic impact energy dissipation capacity of functionally graded
   brittle material samples revealed in this paper will contribute to the
   prevention of sample impact failure and provide guidance for the optimal
   design of impact kinetic properties of samples.}},

Title = {{Super-elasticity at 4K of covalently crosslinked polyimide aerogels with
   negative Poisson's ratio}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JUL 2}},
Abstract = {{The deep cryogenic temperatures encountered in aerospace present
   significant challenges for the performance of elastic materials in
   spacecraft and related apparatus. Reported elastic carbon or ceramic
   aerogels overcome the low-temperature brittleness in conventional
   elastic polymers. However, complicated fabrication process and high
   costs greatly limited their applications. In this work, super-elasticity
   at a deep cryogenic temperature of covalently crosslinked polyimide (PI)
   aerogels is achieved based on scalable and low-cost directional dimethyl
   sulfoxide crystals assisted freeze gelation and freeze-drying strategy.
   The covalently crosslinked chemical structure, cellular architecture,
   negative Poisson's ratio (-0.2), low volume shrinkage (3.1\%), and
   ultralow density (6.1mg/cm(3)) endow the PI aerogels with an elastic
   compressive strain up to 99\% even in liquid helium (4K), almost zero
   loss of resilience after dramatic thermal shocks (T=569K), and fatigue
   resistance over 5000 times compressive cycles. This work provides a new
   pathway for constructing polymer-based materials with super-elasticity
   at deep cryogenic temperature, demonstrating much promise for extensive
   applications in ongoing and near-future aerospace exploration. The deep
   cryogenic temperatures present significant challenges for the
   performance of elastic materials. Here, the authors present a low
   density covalently crosslinked polyimide (PI) aerogels with
   super-elastic properties at deep cryogenic temperatures.}},

Title = {{Mechanics of penta-graphene with vacancy defects under large amplitude
   tensile and shear loading}},
Journal = {{NANOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{27}},
Month = {{JUL 2}},
Abstract = {{Penta-graphene is a new two-dimensional metastable carbon allotrope
   composed entirely of carbon pentagons with unique electronic and
   mechanical properties. In this work we evaluate the mechanical
   properties of new classes of defective penta-graphene (DPG) subjected to
   tensile and shear loading by using molecular dynamics simulations. The
   types of defects considered here are monovacancy at either 4-coordinated
   C1 site or 3-coordinated C2 site, and double vacancy (DV). We focus in
   particular on the effects of the different topologies of defects and
   their concentrations on the elastic constants and the nonlinear
   mechanics of this allotropic form of carbon. The results indicate that
   DPG has a plastic behavior similar to pristine penta-graphene, which is
   caused by the irreversible pentagon-to-polygon structural transformation
   occurring during tensile and shear loading. The tensile and shear moduli
   decrease linearly with the concentration of defects. Monotonic
   reductions of the tensile yield and shear stresses are also present but
   less pronounced, while the yield strains are unaffected. Penta-graphene
   with 4-coordinated and DVs feature a change of the Poisson's ratio from
   negative to positive when the defect concentration rises to about 3\%
   and 6\%. Temperature can trigger structural reconstruction for
   free-standing DPG. The critical transition temperature increases due to
   the vacancy defects and the defects can delay the structure transition.
   These findings are expected to provide important guidelines for the
   practical applications of penta-graphene based micro/nano
   electromechanical systems.}},

   honeycombs with negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) is smaller than that of
   conventional ones in the premise of the same cell-wall thickness. But on
   the condition that the honeycombs possess the same relative density,
   there exists an inverse tendency. The corresponding mechanisms
   responsible for those trends are revealed. The stress intensity factor
   (SIF) is defined to characterize the stress singularity at the corner of
   the punch. The influence of NPR on the magnitudes of SIF is evaluated. A
   punch toughness concept is defined by a novel multi-scale method as the
   failure criterion of brittle honeycomb ceramics in indentation tests.
   The effects of NPR on the punch toughness of honeycombs are discussed.
   And the empirical formulas of punch toughness varying with the cell-wall
   thickness and the relative density are summarized. Finally, the NPR
   effects on the collinear punches problem are detected; the results show
   that the auxetic performance can significantly weaken the interaction
   between the punches.}},

Title = {{Tunable compressive properties of a novel auxetic tubular material with
   low stress level}},
Journal = {{THIN-WALLED STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{164}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The auxetic tubular materials have attracted wide attention owing to
   their unusual mechanical properties and potential applications in
   designing foldable devices. However, most of auxetic tubular structures
   designed by incorporating re-entrant, chiral or penetrated
   microstructures remain great challenging in stress concentration because
   of the presence of shape corners in these structures. In this study, a
   novel auxetic tubular structure is designed by incorporating the smooth
   peanut-shaped hole pattern and then is fabricated via 3D printing
   technique. Subsequently its mechanical properties and deformation
   characteristics are investigated by uniaxial compression experiments and
   finite element simulation. Results reveal that the designed tube
   exhibits significant auxetic performance under compression and the
   stress level within the structure is significantly reduced, in contrast
   to the auxetic tubular structure with orthogonal elliptical hole
   pattern. Finally, the effect of controlling parameters of the designed
   auxetic tubular structure on Poisson's ratio is studied to better
   understand its auxetic behavior and also provide tunable design of
   auxetic tubular structures.}},

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional (2D) crystalline structures based on a honeycomb
   geometry are analyzed by computer simulations using the Monte Carlo
   method in the isobaric-isothermal ensemble. The considered crystals are
   formed by hard discs (HD) of two different diameters which are very
   close to each other. In contrast to equidiameter HD, which crystallize
   into a homogeneous solid which is elastically isotropic due to its
   six-fold symmetry axis, the systems studied in this work contain
   artificial patterns and can be either isotropic or anisotropic. It turns
   out that the symmetry of the patterns obtained by the appropriate
   arrangement of two types of discs strongly influences their elastic
   properties. The Poisson's ratio (PR) of each of the considered
   structures was studied in two aspects: (a) its dependence on the
   external isotropic pressure and (b) in the function of the direction
   angle, in which the deformation of the system takes place, since some of
   the structures are anisotropic. In order to accomplish the latter, the
   general analytic formula for the orientational dependence of PR in 2D
   systems was used. The PR analysis at extremely high pressures has shown
   that for the vast majority of the considered structures it is
   approximately direction independent (isotropic) and tends to the upper
   limit for isotropic 2D systems, which is equal to +1. This is in
   contrast to systems of equidiameter discs for which it tends to 0.13,
   i.e., a value almost eight times smaller.}},

Title = {{The perception of Italian pregnant women and new mothers about their

Abstract = {{BackgroundIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, drastic measures for
   social distancing have been introduced also in Italy, likely with a
   substantial impact in delicate conditions like pregnancy and puerperium.
   The study aimed to investigate the changes in lifestyle, access to
   health services, and mental wellbeing during the first Italian lockdown
   in a sample of Italian pregnant women and new mothers.MethodsWe carried
   out a web-based survey to evaluate how pregnant women and new mothers
   were coping with the lockdown. We collected data about healthy habits
   (physical exercise and dietary habits), access to health services (care
   access, delivery and obstetric care, neonatal care, and breastfeeding),
   and mental wellbeing (psychological well-being and emotive support).
   Descriptive analysis was performed for both groups of participants,
   whereas a Poisson analysis was used to measure the association between
   some structural variables (age, education, socio-economic data, partner
   support, contact, free time, previous children, and pregnancy trimester)
   and anxiety or depression, difficulties in healthy eating and reduction
   in physical activity after lockdown started. Chi2 and Adjusted
   Prevalence Ratios were estimated only for pregnant women.ResultsWe
   included 739 respondents (response rate 85.8\%), 600 were pregnant
   (81.2\%), and 139 (18.8\%) had delivered during lockdown (new mothers).
   We found a high score for anxiety and depression in 62.8\% of pregnant
   women and 61.9\% of new mothers. During the lockdown, 61.8\% of pregnant
   women reduced their physical exercise, and 44.3\% reported eating in a
   healthier way. 94.0\% of new mothers reported to have breastfed their
   babies during the hospital stay. Regarding the perceived impact of
   restrictive measures on breastfeeding, no impact was reported by 56.1\%
   of new mothers, whereas a negative one by 36.7\%.ConclusionsThe high
   prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms in pregnant women and new
   mothers should be a public health issue. Clinicians might also recommend
   and encourage ``home{''} physical exercise. On the other hand, about
   half of the sample improved their approach towards healthy eating and a
   very high breastfeeding rate was reported soon after birth: these data
   are an interesting starting point to develop new strategies for public
   health.}},

Title = {{Elasticity Approach to Predict Shape Transformation of Functionally
   Graded Mechanical Metamaterial under Tension}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{13}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The re-entrant structures are among the simple unit cell designs that
   have been widely used in the design of mechanical metamaterials.
   Changing the geometrical parameters of these unit cell structures, their
   overall elastic properties (i.e., elastic stiffness and Poisson's
   ratio), can be simultaneously tuned. Therefore, different design
   strategies (e.g., functional gradient) can be implemented to design
   advanced engineering materials with unusual properties. Here, using the
   theory of elasticity and finite element modeling, we propose a fast and
   direct approach to effectively design the microarchitectures of
   mechanical metamaterials with re-entrant structures that allow
   predicting complex deformation shapes under uniaxial tensile loading. We
   also analyze the efficiency of this method by back calculating the
   microarchitectural designs of mechanical metamaterials to predict the
   complex 1-D external contour of objects (e.g., vase and foot). The
   proposed approach has several applications in creating programmable
   mechanical metamaterials with shape matching properties for exoskeletal
   and soft robotic devices.}},

Title = {{Can Generalized Poisson model replace any other count data models? An
   evaluation}},
Journal = {{CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY AND GLOBAL HEALTH}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{JUL-SEP}},
Abstract = {{Background: Count data represents the number of occurrences of an event
   within a fixed period of time. In count data modelling, overdispersion
   is inevitable. Sometimes, this overdispersion may not be just due to the
   excess zeros but may be due to the presence of two or more mixtures.
   Hence the main objective is to examine for the presence of mixtures if
   any, with excess zeros and compare Generalized Poisson model, Mixture
   models with other count data models using real time and simulated data.
   Methods: Three real time over-dispersed datasets were used for the
   comparison of the models. The real time data models were compared using
   information criteria like AIC and BIC and regression coefficients. Data
   was also simulated using mixture Poisson with excess zeros. The
   simulation was repeated for different sample sizes were used to identify
   the better model.
   Results: Generalized Poisson showed consistently lower bias and MSE when
   compared to the other models for varying sample of sizes. AIC and BIC
   values were almost similar for Generalized Poisson, ZIP and Mixture
   Poisson model. Similar findings were also obtained from real time data.
   Conclusion: Generalized Poisson models provides a better fit for
   overdispersed data due to excess zeros, consistently in real time and
   simulated with varying sample sizes. Negative Binomial models can be
   redistricted or reevaluated against Generalized Poisson model.}},

Journal = {{SURGERY}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{170}},

Abstract = {{Background: There are conflicting reports of postoperative efficacy of
   negative pressure wound therapy in patients with obesity after cesarean
   delivery. Methods: Retrospective cohort study for patients with obesity
   and negative pressure wound therapy or abdominal dressing after cesarean
   delivery between April 1, 2014 and January 31, 2018. Postoperative
   surgical site infection was defined from medical record charting or
   positive wound culture and confirmed by the hospital's Infection
   Prevention team. Multivariable logistic regression model for surgical
   site infection was conducted including additional potential confounding
   variables. Mantel-Haenszel tests were conducted to stratify by body mass
   index class and operative time, and we performed quasi-Poisson
   regression to determine which factors were associated with an increased
   operative time. Results: We included 4,391 Black or White patients with
   obesity, 696 (15.9\%) underwent negative pressure wound therapy and
   3,695 (84.1\%) abdominal dressing after cesarean delivery. Incidence of
   surgical site infection after negative pressure wound therapy and
   abdominal dressing were 6.1\% and 3.4\%, respectively (2-sample test of
   proportions P < .001). The multivariable logistic regression
   (covariates: race, diabetes, body mass index category, insurance,
   scheduled/emergency, artificial rupture, previous c-section, operative
   time, age, closure type) found negative pressure wound therapy dressing
   was associated with an increased risk of surgical site infection
   (adjusted odds ratio 1.54; 95\% confidence interval, 1.01-2.34), as did
   a Mantel-Haenszel test which was stratified by body mass index (odds
   ratio 1.62; 95\% confidence interval, 1.08-2.43) and a Mantel-Haenszel
   test stratified by operative time (odds ratio 1.85; 95\% confidence
   interval, 1.28-2.65). Negative pressure wound therapy dressing also led
   to an increase in operative time in the Quasi-Poisson regression, which
   was the primary predictor of infection. Conclusion: Negative pressure
   wound therapy was associated with an increased the risk of postoperative
   surgical site infection after cesarean delivery in our obstetric
   patients with obesity. Future prospective studies are needed to
   determine a dressing type and other intervention to decrease
   postoperative cesarean surgical site infection in women with obesity.

Title = {{Achieving adjustable elasticity with non-affine to affine transition}},
Journal = {{NATURE MATERIALS}},
Abstract = {{For various engineering and industrial applications it is desirable to
   realize mechanical systems with broadly adjustable elasticity to respond
   flexibly to the external environment. Here we discover a
   topology-correlated transition between affine and non-affine regimes in
   elasticity in both two- and three-dimensional packing-derived networks.
   Based on this transition, we numerically design and experimentally
   realize multifunctional systems with adjustable elasticity. Within one
   system, we achieve solid-like affine response, liquid-like non-affine
   response and a continuous tunability in between. Moreover, the system
   also exhibits a broadly tunable Poisson's ratio from positive to
   negative values, which is of practical interest for energy absorption
   and for fracture-resistant materials. Our study reveals a fundamental
   connection between elasticity and network topology, and demonstrates its
   practical potential for designing mechanical systems and metamaterials.
   A non-affine to affine transition in elasticity occurs with the change
   of system topology in a packing-derived network, which enables the
   tuning of elastic moduli and Poisson's ratio.}},

   properties via additive manufacturing}},
Journal = {{MECHANICS OF MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{158}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic metamaterials have evolved growing beyond the cellular material
   structures and offering unique combinations of both auxetic and
   mechanical properties. However, the understanding and development of
   these promising material structures have been predominantly based on
   analytical evaluation methods, as practical implementation was
   restricted by manufacturing limitations. The manufacturing limitation
   has changed quite significantly with the advent of additive
   manufacturing methods, particularly with direct metal printing, such as
   selective laser melting. Ever since, the auxetic meta material
   structures began attracting renewed interests, and several different new
   structural forms and hybridisation of certain existing models followed,
   focussing specifically on enhancing auxeticity as well as other
   mechanical attributes. A recently developed and novel S-shaped unit cell
   based auxetic structure is hybridised with star re-entrant unit cells
   and analysed both numerically and experimentally based on physical forms
   produced by selective laser melting as part of the research reported
   here. Numerical and experimental results correlated sufficiently,
   depitcing significant enhanced auxeticity as high as -3, and mechanical
   property with the hybrid structures.}},

Title = {{Evaluation of serious bleeding signals during concomitant use of
   clopidogrel and hypnotic drugs}},
Journal = {{BIOMEDICINE \& PHARMACOTHERAPY}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{139}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Background: In a previous drug-drug interaction (DDI) screening study
   intended to generate hypotheses, clopidogrel + either eszopiclone or
   zolpidem (vs. clopidogrel alone) were associated with serious bleeding.
   Objectives: To confirm or refute these DDI signals and examine
   associations with other hypnotics in an independent population of United
   States Medicaid beneficiaries Methods: We employed a bi-directional
   self-controlled case series design in eligible individuals concomitantly
   exposed to one of 12 hypnotics (precipitants, exposures of interest)
   plus either clopidogrel (the object drug) or pravastatin (the negative
   control object drug). The outcome was hospital presentation with serious
   bleeding. Using conditional Poisson regression, we calculated
   confounder-adjusted rate ratios (RRs) and 95\% confidence intervals for
   serious bleeding during clopidogrel + precipitant use (vs. clopidogrel
   alone). To distinguish a DDI from a precipitant's inherent effect on
   bleeding, we divided effect measures by the adjusted RR for the
   corresponding pravastatin + precipitant pair to obtain ratios of RR
   (RRRs). Results: Among 23,194 users of clopidogrel and 3824 of
   pravastatin who experienced serious bleeding during an active
   prescription for one of these agents, confounder-adjusted RRRs for
   serious bleeding were 6.63 (0.39-113.01) and 0.77 (0.53-1.11) with
   eszopiclone and zolpidem, respectively, whereas confounder-adjusted RRRs
   for other hypnotics ranged from 0.18 (0.04-0.85) for triazolam to 1.79
   (0.16-20.44) for zaleplon. Statistical imprecision therefore precluded
   us from confirming or refuting these prior signals with eszopiclone and
   zolpidem. Conclusions: While we could not confirm or refute previously
   identified DDI signals, numerically elevated RRRs for serious bleeding
   with several clopidogrel + hypnotic pairs warrant further examination.}},

Title = {{Blast resistance of metallic double arrowhead honeycomb sandwich panels
   with different core configurations under the paper tube-guided air blast
   loading \& nbsp;}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{201}},
Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{A B S T R A C T Auxetic double arrowhead honeycombs (DAHs) featured by
   negative Poisson's ratio is attracting increasing attention owing to
   their tailorable mechanical properties and outstanding energy absorption
   capability. In this paper, the two-dimensional metallic DAHs were
   produced and used as the sandwich cores to construct the large-size
   double arrowhead honeycomb sandwich panels (DAHSPs). A comprehensive
   experimental investigation on their dynamic responses under the paper
   tube-guided air blasts was conducted. It majorly focused on the
   influence of core configurations induced by the variation of core wall
   thickness, horizontal distance, inclined angles, thickness allocations
   and foam filling on the deformation/failure modes, associated mechanisms
   and blast resistance of the target panels. Fair comparisons among
   different design strategies were performed to evaluate their relative
   performance. Experimental results show that relative to increasing the
   core wall thickness, the decrease of horizontal distance is more
   remarkable to reduce the back face deflection upon the similar weight
   expense, whereas the effect of inclined angles is limited due to the
   competition between enhanced bending stiffness and deteriorated
   transmitted load. A more efficient approach to decrease the back face
   deformation is to enlarge the inclined angles when the core relative
   density is relatively low but to decrease the horizontal distance at a
   high level of relative density. A further improvement of blast
   resistance can be achieved by allocating more mass to the stuffer wall
   rather than the tendon one, or by introducing a gradient DAH core
   instead of the homogeneous one. Compared to adjusting the metallic DAH
   core itself, the lightweight polyurethane (PU) foam filling is a more
   competitive manner to promote the blast performance. The preliminary
   numerical simulations confirmed the shock focusing effect of the paper
   tube support and indicated reasonable agreement with the experimental
   results. The present study is supposed to shed light on the design,
   manufacturing and optimization of auxetic sandwich structures for
   protection applications.}},

Abstract = {{Acoustic cloaks enable exciting object concealment by manipulating sound

   as transformation acoustics. However, the challenge still lies in the
   practical implementation of those cloaks that require complex material

   demonstrated to be able to automatically and passively fulfill the
   requirement of quasi-conformal mapping for cloak design. Such a

   used, and appropriate constitutive models were fitted to static and
   dynamic tensile and compressive data of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene
   (ABS) tested under various strain rates. A Johnson-Cook plasticity model
   demonstrated the best compromise between accuracy and computational
   efficiency. A simulation strategy using explicit FEM was developed to
   simulate additively manufactured auxetic metastructures under impact
   conditions. There was good agreement between the model prediction and
   the experimentally observed structural response. A parametric
   optimization was implemented to enhance the energy absorption capability

Title = {{Experimental and numerical investigation on in-plane impact behaviour of
   chiral auxetic structure}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{267}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an experimental study on impact behaviour and
   plastic evolution of chiral structure subjected to in-plane impact
   loading using a Split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB). The finite element
   (FE) model developed in ABAQUS/Explicit was validated and utilized for
   parametric study, and further developed as an extension of experimental
   work. The impact scenarios from both structure itself and external input
   are considered, including relative density, topology parameter r/R and
   initial impact energy. Results indicate that chiral structure exhibits
   three critical failure modes corresponding to various impact velocities
   ranging from 5 m/s to 50 m/s. Interestingly, chiral structure occurs
   with two densification stages induced by ligaments-dominated and
   nodes-dominated crushing deformation, respectively, proving the
   capability of independent energy management mechanism. Increasing the
   value of relative density from 0.19 to 0.39 contributes to a maximum of
   250\% increase in the specific energy absorption (SEA). Although
   increasing the value of r/R from 0.04 to 0.2 can dramatically decrease
   Poisson's ratio (PR) from 0.07 to - 0.63 (significant negative PR), high
   strainrate dependence of PR is also observed. In addition, the impact
   displacement is mostly influenced by initial impact energy but not by
   impact velocity and mass. The obtained results of this study provide a
   new insight into the impact performance of chiral structure, which
   contributes to the optimal design of auxetic crashworthiness system.}},

Title = {{Parameter optimization of bidirectional re-entrant auxetic honeycomb
   metamaterial based on genetic algorithm}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{267}},
Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{In this work, we design and test a parameter optimization method by
   Python script to meet the urgent demand for lightweight honeycomb
   metamaterial. The method mainly focuses on the selection of parameters
   according to the mass and Poisson's ratio of the honeycomb metamaterial.
   The bidirectional re-entrant honeycomb is proposed as an objective to be
   optimized and the formula of Poisson's ratio is deduced theoretically to
   establish the internal relation. Besides, the accuracy of the Python
   script results is verified by static compression experimental results
   and theoretical results. Combined the Python script programming model
   with the genetic algorithm optimization method, the optimal honeycomb
   metamaterial solutions are obtained. Results show that the parameter
   optimization method using multi-island genetic algorithm (GA) can avoid
   a local solution's appearance, and both the shell model and the solid
   model can obtain the ideal optimal solution. Furthermore, the 3D
   honeycomb has an admirable auxetic effect according to the optimized
   parameters, which provides a piece of strong evidence for the continuous
   application of optimization algorithms to improve the mechanical
   properties of honeycomb metamaterial.}},

Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},

Volume = {{267}},
Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, novel beam-like mechanical metamaterials (BLMMs) with
   different flexural rigidities in two directions are proposed. The BLMMs
   are composed of the rigid parts and the flexible parts, showing totally
   different flexural rigidities in rigid and flexible directions. The
   BLMMs exhibit quite small flexural rigidities in the flexible direction
   and easy to be rolled up, large flexural rigidities in the rigid
   direction and hard to be deformed. The rigid part is composed of the
   hollow or solid structures connected by concave-convex structures
   (CCSs), and the flexible part is composed of a thin rod. Moreover, the
   rod in the flexible part can be made of a material with a larger Young's
   modulus and narrower width to enhance/reduce the flexural rigidity in
   the rigid/flexible direction. Theoretical calculations, finite-element
   simulations and experiments are employed to investigate the properties
   of the proposed BLMMs. It is found that the depth of the vertex of the
   CCSs is the main factor affecting the flexural rigidities in the rigid
   direction. The proposed BLMMs with appropriate geometrical parameters
   have excellent mechanical properties, indicate great potential for
   application in fields of construction, collapsible equipment, and

Title = {{Quasi-static axial compressive properties and energy absorption of
   star-triangular auxetic honeycomb}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{267}},
Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{To systematically and comprehensively investigate the in-plane
   compression behavior of star-triangular honeycomb (STH) under
   quasi-static load, a group of specimens were fabricated by additive
   manufacturing technology and a compression test was carried out. The
   results show that the deformation of STH is stable, and negative
   Poisson's ratio (NPR) effect is obvious in the 1-direction. However,
   this effect is weakened in the 2-direction. Subsequently, numerical
   simulation models were established to understand the small and large
   deformation behaviors of STH in detail. In accordance with the
   deformation mechanism of STH in different directions, theoretical
   analysis models were developed to predict their elastic modulus and
   Poisson's ratio, and the results were highly consistent with the
   numerical simulation results. Detailed parameter analysis shows that the
   influence of inclined angle theta on the elastic modulus and Poisson's
   ratio of STH is more obvious than that of t/l. Additionally, with the
   increase in the inclined angle, the deformation of STH has no obvious
   difference in the 1-direction while it is considerably different in the
   2-direction. When the strain is small, the plateau stress of STH with
   the same cell-wall angle alpha is similar in different directions. Then,
   the value of plateau stress and duration of the plateau stage varies
   greatly with the increase of compression strain. Finally, the energy
   absorption capacity of STH in different directions was compared. The
   results show that the energy absorption capacity of STH in the
   2-direction is much higher than that in the 1-direction. Furthermore,
   two energy absorbing stages appear in the compression process of STH,
   among which the energy contribution of the second stage occupies the
   largest proportion. This study aims to provide guidelines for the
   engineering application of STH.}},

Abstract = {{Membranes of carbon allotropes comprised solely of densely packed
   pentagonal rings, known as penta-graphene, exhibit negative Poisson's
   ratio (auxetic behavior) and a bandgap of 3.2 eV. In this work, we
   investigated the structural stability, mechanical and fracture
   properties of nanotubes formed by rolling up penta-graphene membranes,
   the so-called penta-graphene nanotubes (PGNTs). Single-walled PGNT of
   three distinct configurations: (n, 0), and two types of (n, n) (here
   called alpha and beta) were studied combining first-principles
   calculations and reactive molecular dynamics simulations. Our results
   showed Young's modulus values of 680-800 GPa, critical strain of
   18-21\%, ultimate tensile stress of 85-110 GPa, and Poisson's ratio
   values ranging from -0.05 to -0.30 (auxetic behavior). During stretching
   at room temperature, we observed a transition from beta-(n, n) to
   alpha-(n, n) PGNT near the critical strain. Fracture of PGNTs starts at
   the bonds that are mostly aligned to the stretching direction and after

Abstract = {{It is well known that the Poisson's ratios for 3D isotropic elastic
   materials vary from -1 to +1/2. These results provide reference points
   for comparing the Poisson's ratios of anisotropic elastic materials.
   Sheet crystals (SCs) with remarkably anisotropic structures, in which
   sheet planes do not intersect, have recently attracted major fundamental
   and practical interest, while the bounds on the in-plane Poisson's
   ratios and linear and area compressibilities have not been generically
   established. Based on the theory of elasticity, we here predict the
   fundamental bounds on the inplane Poisson's ratios and linear and area
   compressibilities for SCs of any crystal system. These predictions are
   well supported by a data-driven investigation of numerically generated
   elastic tensors, elastic tensors from first principles calculations for
   both 2D and 3D SCs, and experimentally measured elastic tensors for 3D
   SCs. Based on these findings, the range of 2D and 3D SC materials that
   increase density or planar area or maintain constant density or planar
   area when stretched, and increase a dimension or planar area when
   hydrostatically compressed is established for special applications. This
   work provides fundamental insights and guidelines for the discovery,
   understanding, and applications of SCs having these properties in
   tensile strain and hydrostatic pressure environments.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic composites are one of novel metamaterials which exhibit an
   interesting feature of negative Poisson's ratio (NPR). The current study
   reports the impact of in-plane NPR on the postbuckling responses of
   axially loaded cylindrical shells made of graphene-reinforced metal
   matrix composite (GRMMC) layers. Each layer of a GRMMC laminated
   cylindrical shell can vary its graphene volume fraction so that a
   functionally graded (FG) shell is achieved. The GRMMC layers possess
   temperature-dependent material properties that can be evaluated using an
   extended micromechanical Halpin-Tsai model. The governing equations for
   the postbuckling of GRMMC laminated shells are based on the Reddy's
   third order shear deformation theory. The von Karman nonlinear
   strain-displacement relationships together with the foundation support
   and temperature effects are also included. Analytical solutions are
   obtained by using a singular perturbation technique in associate with a
   two-step perturbation approach for the postbuckling of perfect and
   imperfect FG-GRMMC laminated cylindrical shells. Numerical results
   explicitly show that the in-plane NPR has a substantial effect on the
   postbuckling response and imperfection sensitivity of GRMMC laminated
   cylindrical shells under axial compression.}},

   mechanics of periodic network materials}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICS AND PHYSICS OF SOLIDS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{152}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Bio-inspired network materials composed of regularly aligned repeating
   filamentary microstructures exhibit promising application prospects in
   tissue engineering and bio-integrated devices due to the typical
   J-shaped mechanics curve precisely matched to the biological tissues.
   During the tensile process, an evident nonlinear mechanical anisotropy
   is induced by the drastic changes of microstructure geometries, which is
   of great concern in some particular requirements such as identifying the
   direction with the lowest or highest tensile stiffness and inducing
   alternate positive and negative or nearly zero Poisson's ratio. An
   efficient theoretical model for nonlinear anisotropic mechanics is
   developed in this paper by introduction of equilibrium and deformation
   compatibility conditions of presentative unit cell under finite uniaxial
   stretching along arbitrary directions, which is then verified by finite
   element analyses (FEA) and experiments both graphically and
   quantitatively. Through this model, the anisotropic mechanical responses
   of the periodic network materials are studied thoroughly and
   systematically based on the precise prediction of stress-strain
   relation, transverse-longitudinal strain relation and the deformed
   configuration. The effects of both the geometric parameters and the unit
   cell topology on the anisotropic mechanical responses are analyzed
   thereafter, which implies that the proposed model can play an
   instructive role in the design, optimization, and application of the
   periodic network materials.}},

Title = {{Hyperbolic-Like Structure with Negative Poisson's Ratio: Deformation
   Mechanism and Structural Design}},
Journal = {{PHYSICA STATUS SOLIDI B-BASIC SOLID STATE PHYSICS}},
Abstract = {{Mechanical metamaterials with negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) effect
   possess important practical applications in aerospace, nanotechnology,
   and other fields. The microstructure and its deformation mode directly
   determine the NPR ability and mechanical performance of auxetic
   metamaterials. Herein, inspired by the double-negative-index ceramic
   aerogels, a novel NPR structural model is proposed in which symmetric
   reentrant oblique ligaments and short transversal ligaments constitute
   the main framework inside a square, which is different from the
   traditional reentrant structure due to the hyperbolic-like skeleton and
   deformation modes. The influence of structural parameters on the NPR
   effect is investigated using the Timoshenko beam model and finite
   element simulations. The structural model is then extended to design
   multiple reentrant structures and assembled structures, respectively.
   The multiple reentrant structures include multiple pairs of
   symmetrically hyperbolic-like skeletons, and the distribution of
   horizontal ligaments can be regulated to achieve a better NPR effect.
   For assembled structures under compression, the local rotational
   deformation and buckling result in structural instability, demonstrated
   by inflection points in the NPR curves. Moreover, one special assembled
   structure is found for which there is a linear relationship between the
   compressive strain and NPR value. The insights should be significant for
   designing mechanical metamaterials with the NPR effect.}},

Abstract = {{The structural, electronic, elastic, phonon, and thermodynamic
   properties of the cubic perovskite structure of the NaWO3 compound were
   calculated from first-principles studies based on density functional
   theory (DFT). These properties were computed within localized density
   approximation (LDA). The lattice constant (a) and bulk modulus (B) for
   NaWO3 are found as 3.857 angstrom, 225.314 GPa, respectively. The band
   structure displayed that the NaWO3 compound exhibits metallic behavior
   at zero pressure. For elastic properties, elastic constants (C-ij),
   isotropic shear modulus (G), Young's modulus (Y), Poisson's ratio (v),
   and anisotropy factor (A) were studied. At zero pressure, the calculated
   C-11, C-12, and C-44 are 558.933, 88.681, and 66.245 GPa, respectively.
   According to the results, NaWO3 is mechanically stable. A is not equal
   to 1. This reveals that NaWO3 is an anisotropic compound. Because of the
   Cauchy pressure and B/G ratio, NaWO3 behaves ductilely. The shear
   constants (C-12 and C-44) are less sensitive to pressure than C-11 which
   indicates little resistance to shear deformation. The negative phonon
   frequencies were observed in phonon dispersion curves. Therefore, NaWO3
   is dynamically unstable. Finally, heat capacity (C-V), entropy (S), and
   Helmholtz-free energy (F) were also calculated and discussed at 0-1000
   K. Consequently, NaWO3 is a potential candidate for future new device
   designs.}},

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional multiferroic materials have attracted great attention
   owing to their promising prospects for miniaturized electronic and
   memory devices. Here, we propose a highly stable 2D multiferroic VOF
   monolayer which is an intrinsic ferromagnetic half semiconductor with
   large spin polarization similar to 2 mu(B)/V and significant uniaxial
   magnetic anisotropy along the a-axis (410 mu eV/V). Meanwhile, it shows
   excellent ferroelectricity with a large spontaneous polarization of 32.7
   mu C cm(-2) and a moderate energy barrier (similar to 43 meV per atom)
   between two ferroelectric states, which can be ascribed to the
   Jahn-Teller distortions. Moreover, the VOF monolayer harbors an
   ultra-large negative Poisson's ratio in the in-plane direction (similar
   to-0.34). The Curie temperature evaluated from Monte Carlo simulations
   based on the Ising model is about 215 K, which can be further enhanced
   to room temperature by 4\% compressive biaxial strain. The combination
   of ferromagnetism and ferroelectricity in the VOF monolayer could
   provide a promising platform for future study of multiferroic effects

Title = {{Improving the strength and toughness of macroscale double networks by
   exploiting Poisson's ratio mismatch}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JUN 24}},
Abstract = {{We propose a new concept that utilizes the difference in Poisson's ratio
   between component materials as a strengthening mechanism that increases
   the effectiveness of the sacrificial bond toughening mechanism in
   macroscale double-network (Macro-DN) materials. These Macro-DN
   composites consist of a macroscopic skeleton imbedded within a soft
   elastic matrix. We varied the Poisson's ratio of the reinforcing
   skeleton by introducing auxetic or honeycomb functional structures that
   results in Poisson's ratio mismatch between the skeleton and matrix.
   During uniaxial tensile experiments, high strength and toughness were
   achieved due to two events: (1) multiple internal bond fractures of the
   skeleton (like sacrificial bonds in classic DN gels) and (2)
   significant, biaxial deformation of the matrix imposed by the functional
   skeleton. The Macro-DN composite with auxetic skeleton exhibits up to
   4.2 times higher stiffness and 4.4 times higher yield force than the sum
   of the component materials. The significant improvement in mechanical
   performance is correlated to the large mismatch in Poisson's ratio
   between component materials, and the enhancement is especially
   noticeable in the low-stretch regime. The strengthening mechanism
   reported here based on Poisson's ratio mismatch can be widely used for
   soft materials regardless of chemical composition and will improve the
   mechanical properties of elastomer and hydrogel systems.}},

Title = {{On the application of additive manufacturing methods for auxetic
   structures: a review}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN MANUFACTURING}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic structures are a special class of structural components that
   exhibit a negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) because of their constituent
   materials, internal microstructure, or structural geometry. To realize
   such structures, specialized manufacturing processes are required to
   achieve a dimensional accuracy, reduction of material wastage, and a
   quicker fabrication. Hence, additive manufacturing (AM) techniques play
   a pivotal role in this context. AM is a layer-wise manufacturing process
   and builds the structure as per the designed geometry with appreciable
   precision and accuracy. Hence, it is extremely beneficial to fabricate
   auxetic structures using AM, which is otherwise a tedious and expensive
   task. In this study, a detailed discussion of the various AM techniques
   used in the fabrication of auxetic structures is presented. The
   advancements and advantages put forward by the AM domain have offered a
   plethora of opportunities for the fabrication and development of
   unconventional structures. Therefore, the authors have attempted to
   provide a meaningful encapsulation and a detailed discussion of the most
   recent of such advancements pertaining to auxetic structures. The
   article opens with a brief history of the growth of auxetic materials
   and later auxetic structures. Subsequently, discussions centering on the
   different AM techniques employed for the realization of auxetic
   structures are conducted. The basic principle, advantages, and
   disadvantages of these processes are discussed to provide an in-depth
   understanding of the current level of research. Furthermore, the
   performance of some of the prominent auxetic structures realized through
   these methods is discussed to compare their benefits and shortcomings.
   In addition, the influences of geometric and process parameters on such
   structures are evaluated through a comprehensive review to assess their
   feasibility for the later-mentioned applications. Finally, valuable
   insights into the applications, limitations, and prospects of AM for
   auxetic structures are provided to enable the readers to gauge the
   vitality of such manufacturing as a production method.}},

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional (2D) auxetic materials with exceptional negative
   Poisson's ratios (NPR) are drawing increasing interest due to their
   potential use in medicine, fasteners, tougher composites and many other
   applications. Improving the auxetic performance of 2D materials is
   currently crucial. Here, using first-principles calculations, we
   demonstrated giant in-plane NPRs in MX monolayers (M = Al, Ga, In, Zn,
   Cd; X = P, As, Sb, S, Se, Te) with a unique V-shaped configuration. Our
   calculations showed that GaP, GaAs, GaSb, ZnS and ZnTe monolayers
   exhibit exceptional all-angle in-plane NPRs. Remarkably, the AlP
   monolayer possesses a giant NPR of -1.779, by far the largest NPR in 2D
   materials. The NPRs of these MX monolayers are correlated to the highly
   anisotropic features of the V-shaped geometry. The exotic mechanical
   properties of the V-shaped MX monolayers provide a new family of 2D
   auxetic materials, as well as a useful guidance for tuning the NPR of 2D
   materials.}},

Abstract = {{The application of phosphorene and graphane in different photoelectric
   devices and energy reserves has attracted wide attention. Here, we
   investigated the Raman spectra, phonon dispersion and vibration modes of
   four phosphorene monolayer polymorphs and four graphane allotropes with
   the corresponding crystal structures to analyze the structure
   correlation between them. Based on the ``three identical, one
   divergent{''} pattern found in the sp(3) hybrid atomic orbitals of
   phosphorene and graphane, four new graphane conformers with different
   hydrogenation modes named gamma delta-G, alpha gamma-G, beta gamma-G and
   alpha delta-G are successfully predicted. Among these four new graphane
   conformers, beta gamma-G has the lowest binding energy, which is only
   0.02 eV per atom higher than beta-G, the most stable one among all
   graphane theoretically predicted. This means that beta gamma-G may
   co-exist with beta-G during the experimental synthesis of graphane,
   which can be distinguished from the side views with threefold structures
   for beta gamma-G and twofold structures for beta-G. All the new graphane
   conformers are direct-band-gap semiconductors with band gaps more than 3
   eV, which indicate their great potential in optoelectronic devices.
   Furthermore, three of them exhibit in-plane negative Poisson's ratios
   under tensile deformation.}},

   a class of 2D auxetic materials with a special structural buckling,
   namely, MX2 monolayers (M = Zn, Cd and X = Cl, I). The calculated
   results indicate that four monolayers all exhibit an abnormal negative
   Poisson's ratio (NPR) with a maximum value of -0.24, which is fairly
   rare in 2D transition metal halides (TMHals). The origin of NPR can be
   explained by the unique local corner-sharing tetrahedral structural
   motif of MX2 monolayers under the low-dimensional effect. More
   importantly, ZnCl2 monolayer can be exfoliated from its bulk counterpart
   with an ultralow exfoliation energy of 8.37 meV angstrom(-2) (0.1341 J
   m(-2)), suggesting the feasibility of its experimental preparation. In
   addition, strain engineering studies on MX2 monolayers show effective
   band gap modulation, indirect-to-direct band gap transitions, and
   significant enhancement of light absorption in the visible and

Abstract = {{Auxetic structure and tunable phase transitions are fascinating
   properties for future application. Herein, we propose two
   three-dimensional (3D) carbon honeycombs (CHC), known as Cmcm -CHC and
   Cmmm-CHC. Based on first-principles calculations, these novel 3D
   materials exhibit auxeticity with a fascinating negative Poisson's
   ratio, which stems from (i) the puckered structure of Cmcm -CHC along
   the tube axis and (ii) significant change of angle-dominant deformation
   for Cmmm-CHC in the armchair direction. In addition, the moderate strain
   drives semimetal to semiconductor phase transition in CHCs, which
   thoroughly establishes its C-C bond formation. In the meantime, two new
   phases, namely P6(3)/mmc-CHC and P6/mmm-CHC, form and exhibit
   semiconductor characteristics. Our results also show that Cmcm -CHC and
   P6(3)/mmc-CHC are superhard materials. The outstanding negative

Title = {{Improving thermomechanical properties of cracked brittle honeycombs by
   negative Poisson's ratio effect}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{266}},
Month = {{JUN 15}},
Abstract = {{This work investigates the effects of cracking on the overall properties
   of brittle auxetic/non-auxetic honeycombs. The micro numerical model and
   macro theoretical model are established simultaneously. The analytical
   expressions of crack opening displacement (COD) are derived and the
   results agree well with numerical simulations. The fracture toughness of
   honeycombs is calculated by combining the stress in the numerical model
   and the stress intensity factor (SIF) in the theoretical model. The
   reductions in the equivalent stiffness and equivalent thermal stress
   coefficient (TSC) of the cracked honeycombs are predicted. The negative
   Poisson?s ratio (NPR) effects on those fracture mechanics parameters and
   equivalent thermomechanical properties are studied. And considering the
   orthogonal anisotropic properties of honeycombs, the cracking along two
   orthogonal directions is examined. It reveals that the significant NPR
   effects can only be detected in a single direction and the effects in
   another direction are inconspicuous. In addition, the effects of crack
   length, medium dimensions, and cell-wall angle of honeycomb cells on the
   overall performance of the cracked medium are also evaluated by
   parametric studies and the results are displayed graphically.}},

Title = {{Curvature Induced by Deflection in Thick Meta-Plates}},
Journal = {{ADVANCED MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{30}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The design of advanced functional devices often requires the use of
   intrinsically curved geometries that belong to the realm of
   non-Euclidean geometry and remain a challenge for traditional
   engineering approaches. Here, it is shown how the simple deflection of
   thick meta-plates based on hexagonal cellular mesostructures can be used
   to achieve a wide range of intrinsic (i.e., Gaussian) curvatures,
   including dome-like and saddle-like shapes. Depending on the unit cell
   structure, non-auxetic (i.e., positive Poisson ratio) or auxetic (i.e.,
   negative Poisson ratio) plates can be obtained, leading to a negative or
   positive value of the Gaussian curvature upon bending, respectively. It
   is found that bending such meta-plates along their longitudinal
   direction induces a curvature along their transverse direction.
   Experimentally and numerically, it is shown how the amplitude of this
   induced curvature is related to the longitudinal bending and the
   geometry of the meta-plate. The approach proposed here constitutes a
   general route for the rational design of advanced functional devices
   with intrinsically curved geometries. To demonstrate the merits of this
   approach, a scaling relationship is presented, and its validity is
   demonstrated by applying it to 3D-printed microscale meta-plates.
   Several applications for adaptive optical devices with adjustable focal
   length and soft wearable robotics are presented.}},

Title = {{The mechanistic analysis of founder virus data in challenge models}},
Journal = {{STATISTICS IN MEDICINE}},
Abstract = {{Repeated low-dose challenge studies provide valuable information when
   evaluating candidate vaccines since they resemble the typical exposure
   of natural transmission and inform on the number of exposures prior to
   infection. Traditionally, the number of challenges to infection has been
   used as the outcome. This work uses the number of infecting viruses, or
   founder viruses at the time of infection, to more efficiently
   characterize a vaccine's mechanism of action. The vaccine mechanisms of
   action we consider are a Null mechanism (the vaccine offers no
   protection), a Leaky mechanism in which the number of founder viruses is
   reduced by some factor in vaccinated subjects, the All-or-None mechanism
   in which the vaccine randomly provides either complete protection or no
   protection in vaccinated subjects, and a Combination mechanism with both
   Leaky and All-or-None components. We consider two discrete marked
   survival models where the number of founder viruses follows a Poisson
   distribution with either a fixed mean parameter (Poisson model), or a
   random mean parameter that follows a Gamma distribution (negative
   binomial model). We estimate the models using maximum likelihood and
   derive likelihood ratio testing procedures that are accurate for small
   samples with boundary parameters. We illustrate the performance of these
   methodologies with a data example of simian immunodeficiency virus on
   nonhuman primates and a simulation study.}},

   dimers for nanoelectronics and photocatalytic water splitting}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 9}},
Abstract = {{The discovery of novel materials with superior tailored properties is
   highly attractive for nano- and optoelectronics. Inspired by penta
   graphene, we introduce a novel family of two-dimensional group-IV
   materials with C-2 dimers, namely penta carbides. The first-principles
   calculations reveal that the unitary, binary, and ternary penta carbides
   have excellent energetic, dynamical, thermal, and mechanical stability
   with remarkable properties. The unitary penta carbide displays auxetic
   behavior whereas the binary and ternary penta carbides posses near zero
   and positive Poisson's ratio. The phonon dispersion curves of penta
   carbides indicate a remarkable phononic gap, which can be tuned by alloy
   engineering and hydrogenation. They are semiconductor in nature with
   band-gap energy ranging from 1.35 and 2.39 eV. Alloying and strain
   engineering enable the direct modification of atomic bonding and thereby
   tuning of electronic band gap of penta carbides. Such novel tunable
   electronic and phononic properties of penta carbides can find
   applications in the field of nanoelectronics, sensors, and frequency
   filter applications. The band edge positions of penta carbides (except
   for Sn-based ones) straddle the redox potentials of water. Remarkably,
   penta carbides exhibit very high optical absorption in the visible and
   ultraviolet regions (up to 10(-6) cm(-1)). They have small and
   anisotropic carrier effective masses, indicating fast carrier transport
   characteristics and promoting the photo-generated electron-hole
   separation efficiency. The high specific surface areas, suitable and
   sizable band gaps, appropriate band edges, small effective carrier
   masses, and excellent optical absorption capability, all these exotic
   properties taken together, make penta carbides promising candidates for
   photocatalytic water splitting.}},

Journal = {{STRUCTURAL AND MULTIDISCIPLINARY OPTIMIZATION}},
Abstract = {{This paper takes into consideration the excellent energy absorption
   ability of hierarchical honeycombs and auxetic structures and proposes a
   novel auxetic hierarchical crash box assembled by the auxetic
   hierarchical filling cores and the outer square thin-walled tube. The
   crushing performance of the auxetic hierarchical crash box is
   systematically investigated. The comparisons of energy absorption
   ability are made among the auxetic hierarchical crash box, aluminum
   foam-filled crash box, and the traditional crash box. In addition, a
   multi-objective optimization design is conducted based on the surrogate
   model with higher accuracy. The non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm
   (NSGA-II) and archive-based micro genetic algorithm (AMGA) are,
   respectively, employed to obtain the pareto sets. The results show that
   the optimum solution with AMGA has a smaller relative error, and the
   multi-objective optimization successfully improves the crushing
   performance of the auxetic hierarchical crash box. The electric vehicle
   crashworthiness is remarkably improved by the application of the auxetic
   hierarchical crash box. The conclusions of this paper can provide a new

Title = {{Understanding the physics of the auxetic response in a liquid crystal
   elastomer}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{JUN 8}},
Abstract = {{Synthetic materials that are auxetic (negative Poisson's ratio) at a
   molecular level have long been sought after. An auxetic liquid crystal
   elastomer (LCE) was reported recently, but the physical origin of the
   behavior has remained unclear. Here, we explain the physics behind the
   auxetic response of a uniaxial LCE under strain by the emergence of
   biaxial order. Our study relies on understanding order parameters (OPs),
   determined via Raman scattering, for LCEs strained either parallel or
   perpendicular to the director and explaining their relevance in terms of
   existing LCE theory. In particular, we consider a 3D interpretation of
   the orientational distribution function. We use uniaxial and biaxial
   models to deduce that (i) a changing nematic order drives the mechanical
   Freedericksz transition (MFT), (ii) the apparent semi-soft elasticity
   exhibited by this LCE is related to this change in order, (iii) there is
   also an emergence of biaxial order in the LCE, and (iv) the emergence of
   biaxiality explains the auxetic response. Uniaxial OPs, < P-200 > and <
   P-400 >, initially take values of 0.6 and 0.3 and, for strains parallel
   to the director, increase by 20\%. For perpendicular strains, the OPs
   reduce dramatically with increasing strain, becoming zero at the MFT,
   where the director reorients to align with the strain axis; the auxetic
   behavior emerges in the same strain regime. Our explanation identifies
   key parameters in determining the requirements for auxetic behavior in
   LCEs.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose
   This paper aims to focus on studying the influence of gradient
   parameters, namely, thickness coefficient, length coefficient and height
   ratio of auxetic structure on responses such as strength, stiffness and
   specific energy absorption (SEA) under compressive loading. Optimization
   of significant parameters is also performed to maximize responses.
   Further, efforts have also been made to develop regression models for
   strength, stiffness and SEA of auxetic structure.
   Design/methodology/approach
   Central composite design of response surface methodology is used for
   planning experiments. Auxetic structures of acrylonitrile butadiene
   styrene (ABS) and poly-lactic acid (PLA) materials are fabricated by the
   material extrusion (ME) technique of additive manufacturing. Fabricated
   structures are tested under in-plane uniaxial compressive loading. Grey
   relational analysis is used for the optimization of gradient parameters
   of the unit cell of auxetic structure to maximize responses and minimize
   weight and time of fabrication.
   Findings
   From the analysis of variance of experimental data, it is found that the
   compressive strength of auxetic structures increases with a decrease in
   length coefficient and height ratio. In the case of ABS structures,
   stiffness increases with a decrease in thickness coefficient and length
   coefficient, while in the case of PLA structures, stiffness increases
   with a decrease in length coefficient and height ratio. SEA is
   influenced by length coefficient and thickness coefficient in ABS and
   PLA structures, respectively. Based on the analysis, statistical
   non-linear quadratic models are developed to predict strength, stiffness
   and SEA. Optimal configuration of auxetic structure is determined to
   maximize strength, stiffness, SEA and minimize weight and time of
   fabrication.
   Research limitations/implications
   The present study is limited to re-entrant type of auxetic structures
   made of ABS and PLA materials only under compressive loading. Also,
   results from the current study are valid within a selected range of
   gradient parameters. The findings of the present study are useful in the
   optimal selection of gradient parameters for the fabrication of auxetic
   structures of maximum strength, stiffness and SEA with minimum weight
   and time of fabrication. These outcomes have wide applications in
   domains such as automotive, aerospace, sports and marine sectors.
   Originality/value
   Limited literature is available on studying the influence of gradient
   parameters of ME manufactured auxetic structure of ABS and PLA materials
   on responses, namely, strength, stiffness and SEA under compressive
   loading. Also, no work has been reported on studying the influence of
   gradient parameters on mechanical properties, weight and time of
   fabrication of auxetic structures. The present study is an attempt to
   fulfil the above research gaps.}},

Title = {{Simulation-based assessment of coupled frequency response of
   magneto-electro-elastic auxetic multifunctional structures subjected to
   various electromagnetic circuits}},
Journal = {{PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART L-JOURNAL OF
   MATERIALS-DESIGN AND APPLICATIONS}},
Abstract = {{This article deals with the modeling of magneto-electro-elastic auxetic
   structures and developing a methodology in COMSOL Multiphysics (R) to
   assess the free vibration response of such structures when subjected to
   various electromagnetic circuit conditions. The triple energy
   interaction between elastic, magnetic, and electric fields are
   established in the COMSOL Multiphysics (R) using structural mechanics
   and electromagnetic modules. The multiphase magneto-electro-elastic
   material with different percentages of piezoelectric and piezomagnetic
   phases are used as the material. In the solid mechanics module, the
   piezoelectric and piezomagnetic materials were created in stress-charge
   and stress-magnetization forms, respectively. The electric and magnetic
   fields are defined in COMSOL Multiphysics (R) through electromagnetic
   equations. Further, the customized controlled meshing constituted of
   free tetrahedral and triangular elements is adapted to trade-off between
   the accuracy and the computational expenses. The eigenvalue analysis is
   performed to obtain the natural frequencies of the MEE re-entrant
   auxetic structures. Also, the efficiency of smart auxetic structures
   over conventional honeycomb structures is presented throughout the
   manuscript. In addition, the discrepancy in the natural frequencies of
   the structures considering coupled and uncoupled state is also
   illustrated. It is believed that the modeling procedure and its outcomes
   serve as benchmark solutions for further design and analysis of smart
   auxetic magneto-electro-elastic structures.}},

Title = {{Impact of blast and mechanical loads on the shear deformable stiffened
   sandwich plate with an auxetic core layer in thermal environment}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SANDWICH STRUCTURES \& MATERIALS}},
Abstract = {{By using the first order shear deformation theory (FSTD), this paper
   presents the results of the nonlinear dynamic behavior and natural
   frequencies of sandwich plate supported by elastic foundations in
   thermal environment and subjected to mechanical load and blast loading.
   This work takes advantage of the sandwich plate configuration with three
   layers: graphene platelet -reinforced composite (GPL) layer - auxetic
   layer - FGM layer, to analyze the dynamic and vibration problem, in
   which the auxetic core layer has a negative Poisson's ratios and the FGM
   layer is reinforced by stiffeners made of full metal or full ceramic
   depending on a situation of stiffeners at the metal-rich or ceramic-rich
   side of the plate respectively. Corresponding to the combination of
   material layers, the mechanical quantities of the problem are processed
   and calculated to suit the structure and reinforcement conditions.
   Numerical results are provided to explore the influences of geometrical
   parameters, elastic foundation parameters, GPL volume fraction, blast
   and mechanical loads on the nonlinear dynamic behavior and vibration of
   sandwich plate resting on elastic foundation and in thermal environment.
   In addition, the study is not only assumed that the material properties
   depend on environment temperature variation, but also considered the
   thermal stresses in the stiffeners, as well as considered the effect of
   imperfections in the original shape of the structure.}},

Journal = {{POLYMER INTERNATIONAL}},
Abstract = {{This work involves the study of mechanical and antibacterial properties
   of auxetic polyurethane (APU) foams synthesized using castor oil (CO) to
   ascertain their suitability as seat cushions in wheelchairs. Firstly,
   CO-based PU foams (PU-CO) were synthesized by substituting 25\%
   synthetic polyol with CO in a polyol blend. Conventional PU foams and
   PU-CO foams were then converted to auxetic foams using triaxial
   compression and heating. The chemical composition, microstructure and
   thermal, mechanical and antibacterial properties of the foams were
   analyzed. It was found that addition of CO improved the antibacterial
   and mechanical properties of the foams. CO-based APU (CO-APU) foams
   showed highest compression strength and storage modulus. An increase in
   thermal stability of PU-CO was also observed as compared to PU foams.
   These CO-APU foams could be a better alternative to conventional PU
   foams for wheelchair seat cushions and in hospital bed applications. (c)

Title = {{Deformation Behaviors of Auxetic Warp Knitted Fabrics Based on Reentrant
   Geometry}},
Journal = {{PHYSICA STATUS SOLIDI B-BASIC SOLID STATE PHYSICS}},
Abstract = {{A series of auxetic warp knitted fabrics based on reentrant geometry
   were developed in our previous study and their Poisson's ratio in the
   wale direction and course direction can be as low as -0.5 and -0.15,
   respectively. However, the quantitative relationships between structural
   parameters and auxetic effect, which can offer a guide to the design and
   manufacture process, are still unknown. Herein, the aim is to find such
   relationships. Based on the geometrical analysis, two semiempirical
   equations between Poisson's ratio and tensile strain are established
   when stretched in the wale direction and course direction, respectively.
   The study shows that the established semiempirical equations fit well
   with experimental results and can be used to predict auxetic effect of
   fabrics made with the same type of materials and similar structures.
   With the relationships proposed, warp knitted fabrics can be designed
   and manufactured directly without trials to obtain the desired auxetic
   effect, which can largely save the time and cost of production.}},

Abstract = {{Metamaterials are complexes of elements that can create properties not
   found in naturally occurring materials, such as changing the direction
   of forces, creating negative stiffness, or altering vibration and impact
   properties. In the case of wood pile metamaterials that are easy to
   manufacture and have excellent performance in reducing vibration and
   shock in the vertical direction, basic research on variables affecting
   shock transmission is needed to reduce shock. Although research on
   impact reduction according to geometrical factors is being conducted
   recently, studies on the effect of material variables on impact
   reduction are insufficient. In this paper, finite element analysis was
   carried out by variablizing the geometrical properties (lamination
   angle, diameter, length) and material properties (modulus of elasticity,
   specific gravity, Poisson's ratio) of wood pile cylinders. Through
   finite element analysis, the shape of the wooden pile cylinder
   delivering impact was confirmed, and the effect of each variable on the
   reduction of impact force and energy was considered through main effect
   diagram analysis, and frequency band analysis was performed through fast
   Fourier transform. proceeded In order to reduce the impact force and
   vibration, it was found that the variables affecting the contact area
   oft he cylinder have a significant effect.}},

Title = {{Free vibration and sound insulation of functionally graded honeycomb
   sandwich plates}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SANDWICH STRUCTURES \& MATERIALS}},
Abstract = {{Based on the hyperbolic tangent shear deformation theory, free vibration
   and sound insulation of two different types of functionally graded (FG)
   honeycomb sandwich plates with negative Poisson's ratio are studied in
   this paper. Using Hamilton's principle, the vibration and vibro-acoustic
   coupling dynamic equations for FG honeycomb sandwich plates with simply
   supported edges are established. By applying the Navier's method and
   fluid-solid interface conditions, the derived governing dynamic
   equations are solved. The natural frequencies and the sound insulation
   of FG honeycomb sandwich plates obtained in this work are compared with
   the numerical results by the finite element simulation. It is proven
   that the theoretical models for the free vibration and the sound
   insulation are accurate and efficient. Moreover, FG sandwich plates with
   different honeycomb cores are investigated and compared. The
   corresponding results show that the FG honeycomb core with negative
   Poisson's ratio can yield much lower frequencies. Then, the influences
   of various geometrical and material parameters on the vibration and
   sound insulation performance are systematically analyzed.}},

Abstract = {{Electronic skins (e-skins)-electronic sensors mechanically compliant to
   human skin-have long been developed as an ideal electronic platform for
   noninvasive human health monitoring. For reliable physical health
   monitoring, the interface between the e-skin and human skin must be
   conformal and intact consistently. However, conventional e-skins cannot
   perfectly permeate sweat in normal day-to-day activities, resulting in
   degradation of the intimate interface over time and impeding stable
   physical sensing. Here, we present a sweat pore-inspired perforated
   e-skin that can effectively suppress sweat accumulation and allow
   inorganic sensors to obtain physical health information without
   malfunctioning. The auxetic dumbbell through-hole patterns in perforated
   e-skins lead to synergistic effects on physical properties including
   mechanical reliability, conformability, areal mass density, and adhesion
   to the skin. The perforated e-skin allows one to laminate onto the skin
   with consistent homeostasis, enabling multiple inorganic sensors on the
   skin to reliably monitor the wearer's health over a period of weeks.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction Mental health disorders may negatively impact HIV outcomes,
   such as viral suppression (VS) and antiretroviral (ART) adherence among
   people with HIV (PWH) with hazardous alcohol use. This study evaluates
   the longitudinal association between depression, anxiety symptoms, VS
   and complete ART adherence among ART clients with hazardous alcohol use
   in Vietnam; and examines alcohol dependence as a modifier in this
   association. Methods This was a secondary data analysis of a trial for
   hazardous drinking ART clients in Thai Nguyen, Vietnam. From March 2016
   to May 2018, 440 ART clients with an Alcohol Use Disorders
   Identification Test-Concise (AUDIT-C) score >= 4 for men and >= 3 for
   women were enrolled. Individuals were randomized to either a combined
   intervention, a brief intervention or a standard of care. Data on
   sociodemographics, depression, anxiety symptoms, alcohol use, VS and ART
   adherence were collected at baseline, three, six, and twelve months.
   Generalized estimating equation models controlling for intervention
   exposure were used to estimate time-lagged associations. Risk ratios
   were estimated using Poisson regression with robust variance estimation.
   Results The mean age of participants was 40.2. The majority was male
   (96.8\%), had at least some secondary school education (85.0\%) and had
   a history of injection drug use (80.9\%). No overall effect of
   depression and anxiety symptoms on VS was observed. When stratified by
   time, increased anxiety symptoms at six months were associated with VS
   at 12 months (adjusted risk ratio (aRR) = 1.09; 95\% CI 1.02 to 1.17).
   An increase in depression or anxiety symptoms was associated with a
   decreased probability of complete ART adherence (depression symptoms:
   aRR = 0.95; 95\% CI: 0.91 to 0.99; anxiety symptoms: aRR = 0.93; 85\%
   CI: 0.88 to 0.99). The negative effects of anxiety symptoms on ART
   adherence were stronger among participants with alcohol dependence,
   compared to those without. Conclusions Depression and anxiety symptoms
   had no overall effect on VS, although they were associated with a lower
   probability of complete ART adherence. Interventions focusing on mental
   healthcare for PWH with hazardous alcohol use are needed, and
   integration of mental healthcare and alcohol reduction should be
   implemented in HIV primary care settings.}},

Abstract = {{To evaluate the electrical heating performance by auxetic pattern,
   re-entrant honeycomb (RE), chiral truss (CT), honeycomb (HN), and truss
   (TR), using graphene/PLA (Polylactic acid) filament, were manufactured
   by CFDM (conveyor fused deposition modelling) 3D printer. In addition,
   HN and TR, which was indicated to have an excellent electrical heating
   property, were selected to verify the feasibility of applying fabric
   heating elements. The result of morphology was that the number of struts
   constituting the unit cell and the connected points were TR < HN < CT <
   RE. It was also influenced by the surface resistivity and electrical
   heating performance. RE, which has the highest number of struts
   constituting the unit cell and the relative density, had the highest
   value of surface resistivity, and the lowest value was found in the
   opposite TR. In the electrical heating performance of samples, the heat
   distribution of RE was limited even when the applied voltage was
   increased. However, HN and TR were diffused throughout the sample. In
   addition, the surface temperature of RE, CT, HN, and TR was about 72.4
   degrees C, 83.1 degrees C, 94.9 degrees C, and 85.9, respectively as
   applied at 30 V. When the HN and TR were printed on cotton fabric, the
   surface resistivity of HN/cotton and TR/cotton was about 10(3) omega/sq,
   which showed conductive material. The results of electrical heating
   properties indicated that the heat distribution of HN/cotton showed only
   in the region where power was supplied, but the TR/cotton was gradually
   expanded and presented stable electric heating properties. When 30 V was
   applied, the surface temperature of both samples showed more than 80
   degrees C, and the shape was maintained stably due to the high thermal
   conductivity of the cotton fabric. Therefore, this study ensured that HN
   and TR show excellent electrical heating performance among four types of
   auxetic patterns with continuity.}},

Journal = {{SYMMETRY-BASEL}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{13}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Boron arsenate, BAsO4, is crystalline material (I4 over bar group) that
   was recently shown to be auxetic in its (001) plane for loading in any
   direction in this plane, and, which exhibits negative linear
   compressibility at elevated pressured in its {[}001] direction. This
   work presents and discusses the results of extensive density functional
   theory (DFT) based simulations aimed at studying deformations that such
   crystals undergo when subjected to shear loading in an attempt to obtain
   a better insight into the manner in which this material responds to
   mechanical loads. The deformations for shearing in the (001) plane are
   described in terms of the `rotating squares' model, which was used to
   explain the auxeticity in the same plane where it was shown that shear
   loading results primarily in deformations which make the `squares'
   become `parallelogram-like' rather than rotate. This lack of rigidity in
   projected `squares' was discussed by looking at changes in bond lengths
   and bond angles.}},

Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{A chiral structure with a negative Poisson's ratio containing a hollow
   circle with varying diameters was designed, and the finite element
   method was used to investigate the variation in the Poisson's ratio when
   the hollow circle diameter was varied (d = 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 mm). The
   simulation results showed that the Poisson's ratio was sensitive to the
   hollow circle diameter, and the minimum Poisson's ratio was -0.43. Three
   specimens with different hollow circle diameters (d ` = 0, 1, and 3 mm)
   were 3D-printed from thermoplastic polyurethane, and the Poisson's ratio
   and equivalent elastic modulus were measured. In the elastic range, the
   Poisson's ratio increased and the equivalent elastic modulus decreased
   as the hollow circle diameter increased. The simulation and experimental
   results showed good agreement. The proposed structure is expected to be
   applicable to protective sports gear owing to its high energy absorption
   and the fact that its properties can be modified as required by
   adjusting the geometric parameters of the unit cell.}},

   Coupling Analysis Considering Specific Force Output}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2021}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Aiming at the problems of a complex structure or poor controllability of
   the existing bearing preload control devices, a method of
   self-regulation via a negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) spacer is proposed.
   Firstly, the principle of preload automatic adjustment at the bearing
   operation was introduced and the NPRs with three types of cell
   structures were analyzed. Furthermore, a thermo-mechanical coupling
   analysis model of the NPR spacer was established and the deformation and
   force output characteristics of the NPR spacer were studied and
   experimentally verified. It is found that the concave hexagonal cell
   structure has the optimal deformation characteristics for bearing
   preload adjustment. When the temperature is considered, the absolute
   value of Poisson's ratio of the NPR spacer decreases as the speed
   increases and the elongation of the NPR spacer and the output forces are
   much larger than those without temperature consideration. With the
   increase in temperature or rotating speed, the axial elongation and
   output forces of the NPR spacer increases while the effect of
   temperature is relatively larger.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Pedicle screws are widely used in fusion surgery, while
   screw loosening often occurrs. An auxetic structures based pedicle screw
   was proposed to improve the bone-screw fixation by radial expansion of
   the screw body under tensile force to resist pulling out. It was
   optimized to obtain excellent anti-pullout ability for a particular bone
   based on the biomechanical interaction between screw and surrounding
   bone.
   Methods: The screw was designed based on re-entrant unit cells. The
   mechanical properties of it were adjusted by the wall thickness (t) and
   re-entrant angle (theta) of the unit cell, and characterized using
   finite element (FE) method. The designed screws were manufactured using
   3D-printing, and Ti6Al4V as the materials. Subsequently, the pullout FE
   models were established, and verified by pulling the fabricated screws
   out of Sawbone blocks. The pulling out processes of screws from bone
   were simulated to explore the optimizing design of the screw.
   Results: The mechanical properties of the screw could be adjusted in a
   wide range. The biomechanical interaction between the screw and bone can
   affect the anti-pullout performance of the screw. With an identical
   elastic modulus (E), better auxiticity of the screw, resulted in a
   better anti-pullout performance; while an appropriate E is the necessary
   condition for its excellent anti-pullout performance for a particular
   bone.
   Conclusion: Appropriate mechanical properties are necessary for the
   auxetic pedicle screw with excellent screwbone fixation performance for
   a particular bone, which can be obtained by rationally designing the
   wall thickness and re-entrant angle of the unit cells.}},

Abstract = {{The elastic properties of f.c.c. hard sphere crystals with periodic
   arrays of nanoinclusions filled by hard spheres of another diameter are
   the subject of this paper. It has been shown that a simple modification
   of the model structure is sufficient to cause very significant changes
   in its elastic properties. The use of inclusions in the form of joined
   (mutually orthogonal) layers and channels showed that the resulting
   tetragonal system exhibited a complete lack of auxetic properties when
   the inclusion spheres reached sufficiently large diameter. Moreover, it
   was very surprising that this hybrid inclusion, which can completely
   eliminate auxeticity, was composed of components that, alone, in these
   conditions, enhanced the auxeticity either slightly (layer) or strongly
   (channel). The study was performed with computer simulations using the
   Monte Carlo method in the isothermal-isobaric (NpT) ensemble with a

   of cells drawn from the literature. The new auxetic cell is designed by
   topology analysis using classical Timoshenko beam theory. To validate
   the design, samples were constructed by fused filament fabrication with
   ABSplus, and tested under quasi-static compression to determine Young's
   modulus in the three orthogonal directions. The experimental results
   show good agreement with the topological analysis and reveal that the
   proposed cell can transmit a different mechanical behavior to the

   Stroke in Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy}},

Abstract = {{Vessel wall enhancement is associated with both acute and future stroke
   in patients with cerebral amyloid angiopathy.
   BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE:
   Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a known risk factor for ischemic
   stroke though angiographic imaging is often negative. Our goal was to
   determine the relationship between vessel wall enhancement (VWE) in
   acute and future ischemic stroke in CAA patients.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS:
   This was a retrospective study of patients with new-onset neurologic
   symptoms undergoing 3T vessel wall MR imaging from 2015 to 2019. Vessel
   wall enhancement was detected on pre- and postcontrast flow-suppressed
   3D T1WI. Interrater agreement was evaluated in cerebral amyloid
   angiopathy?positive and age-matched negative participants using a
   prevalence- and bias-adjusted kappa analysis. In patients with cerebral
   amyloid angiopathy, multivariable Poisson and Cox regression were used
   to determine the association of vessel wall enhancement with acute and
   future ischemic stroke, respectively, using backward elimination of
   confounders to P < .20.
   RESULTS:
   Fifty patients with cerebral amyloid angiopathy underwent vessel wall MR
   imaging, including 35/50 (70.0\%) with ischemic stroke and 29/50
   (58.0\%) with vessel wall enhancement. Prevalence- and bias-corrected
   kappa was 0.82 (95\% CI, 0.71?0.93). The final regression model for
   acute ischemic stroke included vessel wall enhancement (prevalence ratio
   = 1.5; 95\% CI, 1.1?2.2; P = .022), age (prevalence ratio = 1.02; 95\%
   CI, 1.0?1.05; P = .036), time between symptoms and MR imaging
   (prevalence ratio = 0.9; 95\% CI, 0.8?0.9; P < .001), and smoking
   (prevalence ratio = 0.7; 95\% CI, 0.5?1.0; P = .042) with c-statistic =
   0.92 (95\% CI, 0.84?0.99). Future ischemic stroke incidence with
   cerebral amyloid angiopathy was 49.7\% (95\% CI, 34.5\%?67.2\%) per year
   over a total time at risk of 37.5 person-years. Vessel wall
   enhancement?positive patients with cerebral amyloid angiopathy
   demonstrated significantly shorter stroke-free survival with 63.9\%
   (95\% CI, 43.2\%?84.0\%) versus 32.2\% (95\% CI, 14.4\%?62.3\%) ischemic
   strokes per year, chi-square = 4.9, P = .027. The final model for future
   ischemic stroke had a c-statistic of 0.70 and included initial ischemic
   stroke (hazard ratio = 3.4; 95\% CI, 1.0?12.0; P = .053) and vessel wall
   enhancement (hazard ratio = 2.5; 95\% CI, 0.9?7.0; P = .080).
   CONCLUSIONS:
   Vessel wall enhancement is associated with both acute and future stroke
   in patients with cerebral amyloid angiopathy.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials, including textiles, exhibit a negative Poisson's
   ratio (NPR), which is of interest for many applications. This research
   aims to optimize the structural parameters of helical auxetic yarns
   (HAYs) and to evaluate the auxetic performance of these yarns. The
   research reports on the improvement of auxetic yarn quality and the yarn
   auxeticity through studying the effect of helical angles, diameter ratio
   and tensile moduli of the two plies, as well as the binder filament
   feeding. The maximum NPR of the optimized auxetic yarns was
   experimentally achieved as low as -9.6, with the helical angle of around
   14.0 degrees on average using the optimal machine setting. The optimized
   yarn parameters enabled the making of high-quality auxetic yarns with a
   wider range of machine settings than before. In parallel, theoretical
   and numerical studies were carried out for the engineering design of
   auxetic yarns, which enabled comparisons among the experimental results,
   calculated results and results from finite element analysis. The
   comparison showed that a lower initial helical angle, higher tensile
   modulus of the wrap ply and lower tensile modulus of the core ply led to
   a higher auxetic effect. A new finding is reported in that a concave
   relationship between the diameter ratio and the NPR was discovered. The
   results of this study could assist researchers in producing HAYs, and
   this type of HAY could be used for many potential applications, such as
   filtration and impact protection.}},

Abstract = {{Irregular honeycomb structures occur abundantly in nature and in
   man-made products, and are an active area of research. In this paper,
   according to the optimization of regular honeycomb structures, two types
   of irregular honeycomb structures with both positive and negative

   honeycombs with varying structure angles were investigated through a
   combination of material mechanics and structural mechanics methods, in
   which the axial deformation of the rods was considered. The numerical
   results show that axial deformation has a significant influence on the
   elastic properties of irregular honeycomb structures. The elastic
   properties of the structure can be considered by the enclosed area of
   the unit structure, the shape of the unit structure, and the elastic
   properties of the original materials. The elastic properties considering
   the axial deformation of rods studied in this study can provide a

Abstract = {{We analyze the folding kinematics of a recently proposed origami-based
   tessellated structure called the Morph pattern, using thin, rigid panel
   assumptions. We discuss the geometry of the Morph unit cell that can
   exist in two characteristic modes differing in the mountain/valley
   assignment of a degree-four vertex and explain how a single tessellation
   of the Morph structure can undergo morphing through rigid origami
   kinematics resulting in multiple hybrid states. We describe the
   kinematics of the tessellated Morph pattern through multiple branches,
   each path leading to different sets of hybrid states. We study the
   kinematics of the tessellated structure through local and global
   Poisson's ratios and derive an analytical condition for which the global
   ratio switches between negative and positive values. We show that the
   interplay between the local and global kinematics results in folding
   deformations in which the hybrid states are either locked in their
   current modes or are transformable to other modes of the kinematic
   branches, leading to a reprogrammable morphing behavior of the system.
   Finally, using a bar-and-hinge model-based numerical framework, we
   simulate the nonlinear folding behavior of the hybrid systems and verify
   the deformation characteristics that are predicted analytically.}},

Abstract = {{This research presents a numerical method to design a two-dimensional
   auxetic microstructure with negative Poisson's ratios. The method is
   established by combining the finite element method (FEM) with two
   different optimization procedures called bi-directional evolutionary
   structural optimization (BESO) and solid isotropic material with
   penalization (SIMP), respectively. The results show that by choosing any
   of the two methods of optimization (FEM and BESO or FEM and SIMP), each
   with a different objective function, it is possible to create
   microstructures that show negative Poisson's ratio. In addition, there
   is a significant resemblance between the results of both optimization
   methodologies. The final part of this study is to verify the outcome of
   optimization, both numerically and experimentally using
   three-dimensional (3D) printing techniques.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies the fatigue behavior of auxetic honeycomb
   layer/substrate structures due to interfacial delamination damage.
   First, the interfacial thermal stress and cyclic interfacial thermal
   stress intensity factor (ITSIF) at the free ends of the structure are
   determined in terms of the thermal shock time, relative density, aspect
   ratio, and internal cell angle of the honeycomb. Then, a theoretical
   model for the service life analysis of the structures is established
   based on Paris?s law. The results show that the auxetic structures have
   a lower ITSIF level and a longer service life compared with those of the
   non-auxetic structures. Another interesting finding is that a reduction
   in the relative density of the honeycomb layer will increase the service
   life of the structures. This confirms the significance of applying
   auxetic materials in re-usable structures for thermal protection
   purposes. This research is the first attempt to evaluate the service

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{199}},
Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic metamaterials have received increasing interest due to their
   distinct mechanical properties. However, most developed auxetic
   metamaterials feature a uniform auxeticity in the elastic deformation
   stage, which limits their functional applications. Here, based on
   double-elliptic-ring (DER) partial auxetic structures, an enhanced
   double-elliptic-ring (EDER) structure with strain-dependent auxeticity
   is introduced. The proposed EDERs consist of DERs and an enhanced
   structure (ES). Under compression, the ES will exhibit directional
   instability owing to the shrinking of DERs, and these directional
   instabilities will enhance the auxetic behaviors of EDERs. Analytical
   and simulation models are carried out to explore the equivalent Young?s
   modulus and Poisson?s ratio of EDERs and are validated via experiments.
   The results show that the strain value in the shrinking direction is
   different in different regions due to the directional instability of the
   ES which occurs layer by layer. By varying the geometric parameters of
   the ES of the EDERs, its deformation can be programmed and EDERs display
   varying localized deformation mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a new vertical strut combined re-entrant auxetic

   An analytical model was established based on energy theorems considering

   were both carried out to confirm the validity of the analytical model
   based on beam theory. Results exhibited a good agreement between the
   refined analytical model, the numerical simulation and experimental
   study. Four deformation mechanisms were analyzed and the effect of
   deformation on the effective Poisson?s ratio (EPR) and elastic module
   were investigated. A parametric study was further performed to
   quantitatively illustrate the influences of the geometrical parameters
   on the effective elasticity properties of the designed structure. The
   results showed that the lightweight structures can significantly enhance
   the auxetic behavior and achieve a high degree of anisotropy with wide

Journal = {{THIN-WALLED STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2021}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, an analytical approach is proposed to investigate the
   nonlinear dynamic analysis of porous eccentrically stiffened (PES)
   double curved shallow auxetic shells with negative Poisson?s ratio (NPR)
   subjected to blast, mechanical and thermal loads resting on
   Visco-Pasternak foundation model. The three-layer double curved shallow
   shell consists of auxetic honeycombs core layer with NPR integrated,
   isotropic homogeneous materials at the top and bottom of surfaces.
   Besides, the outer surfaces of the system reinforced by PES are made of
   functionally graded materials (FGM) and auxetic shells are placed in
   thermal environments. Combining with the first-order shear deformation
   theory and Von-Karman strains, governing equations for nonlinear dynamic
   response of PES double curved shallow auxetic shells in thermal
   environments are derived. Then, the stress function and Galerkin methods
   are proposed to obtain the result equations: fundamental frequency,
   dynamic response, and frequency?amplitude relation. Compared with the
   published literature, the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed
   analysis approach are validated. Finally, the effects of stiffeners,
   Poisson?s ratio, cell inclined angle, mechanical, thermal and blast
   loads, elastic foundations, boundary conditions, geometrical parameters
   of auxetic honeycombs core and shell on the nonlinear dynamic response
   of PES double curved shallow auxetic shells in thermal environments are
   also carried out in the paper.}},

Journal = {{THIN-WALLED STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{163}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{This work describes the low-velocity impact behavior of composite
   sandwich panels with different types of auxetic (negative Poisson?s
   ratio) and non-auxetic prismatic core structures. Sandwich panels have
   been manufactured with carbon/fiber epoxy composite face sheets,
   polyurethane rigid foam core or 3D printed PLA plastic cellular
   honeycombs head (hexagonal, re-entrant, hexachiral and arrowhead). The
   material properties of the constituents have been determined via tensile
   and compression tests. The cellular core topologies have the same wall
   thickness and number of cells (39x4, except for the hexachiral
   topology). A rigid striker with a hemispherical head tip is dropped on
   the specimens with a speed of 2.6 m/s. Explicit finite element (FE)
   models are validated by the experimental results. Parametric numerical
   analyses using the validated FE have been carried out with different
   impact energies of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 and 76 J to identify the best
   core designs. The results show that non-auxetic cores could have
   advantages over the auxetic ones at small deformation (impact energy is
   equal to 10 J) thanks to the larger contact surface and higher thickness
   of the cellular structure. The auxetic core, however, provides greater
   impact resistance and energy absorption capability as the impact energy
   increases due to the larger densification and lower indentation during
   collapse. The arrowhead-based panels in particular possess 25\%, 13\%
   and 11\% larger crash efficiency than the other samples for impacts with
   50, 60 and 76 J. The hexachiral lattice provides the best performance at
   10, 20 and 30 J, and also possesses advantages over the other cellular
   configurations (except for the arrowhead core) in the case of 40, 50, 60
   and 76 J impact loading. As a result, the arrowhead and hexachiral
   configurations are those mostly recommended for applications involving

Abstract = {{A novel type of tubular structure has been proposed in this paper, which
   is the first tubular structure with auxeticity in the wall thickness as
   well as in the radial direction. This tubular structure exhibits good
   stability under axial compression. The most innovative feature is that
   its inner diameter and outer diameter have opposite deformation
   directions. When axially compressed (stretched), its outer diameter will
   become smaller (larger) while its inner diameter will become larger
   (smaller). Besides, its closed surfaces of tube wall can broaden its
   applications in the fields of civil engineering and mechanical
   engineering. The accuracy of the finite element model was verified by
   comparison between experiments and numerical analysis. Deformation
   characteristics of tubular models generated by offset method and
   rotation method were studied. The influence of cell layers, PSF (Pattern
   Scale Factor) value and t/R (the ratio of wall thickness t to diameter
   R) value was also studied by parametric analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Chiral metamaterials are widely studied for their unique mechanical
   properties, but still have problems such as low stiffness and few
   available scenarios. Based on the tetra-chiral metamaterial, a type of
   metamaterial with programmable stiffness and multistability is designed
   in this paper. The stiffness of two-dimensional (2D) metamaterial can be
   adjusted programmatically by changing its geometric parameters. The
   equivalent elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio were obtained by using an
   analytical solution and finite element method. Then the 2D metamaterials
   were extended to cylindrical tubes with multistability. The deformation
   patterns of the 2D metamaterials and cylindrical tubes with different
   geometric parameters were investigated. It is found that the cylindrical
   tubes can exhibit compression-torsion coupling and multistability
   deformation characteristics. This work can provide a valuable reference

Title = {{Examination of thermal postbuckling behavior of temperature dependent
   FG-GRMMC laminated plates with in-plane negative Poisson's ratio}},
Journal = {{THIN-WALLED STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{163}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic composite laminates are a new type of engineering materials that
   have unique features for important potential applications. This paper
   examines the effect of in-plane negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) on the
   thermal postbuckling behaviors of graphene-reinforced metal matrix
   composite (GRMMC) plates. The plates rest on an elastic foundation and
   are subjected to a uniform temperature rise. The GRMMC layers with
   different volume fractions of graphene reinforcement can be arranged to
   achieve piece-wise functionally graded (FG) patterns across the plate
   thickness and the material properties of the GRMMC layers are
   temperature-dependent. The Reddy's third order shear deformation plate
   theory and the geometric nonlinearity of von Karman-type are applied to
   formulate the thermal postbuckling equations for GRMMC laminated plates.
   The nonlinear problem can be solved by a two-step perturbation approach.
   Parametric study is performed for (+/- 10)(5T) and (+/- 10)(3T) GRMMC
   laminated plates possessing in-plane NPR. The results reveal that the
   buckling temperatures for (+/- 10)(5T) and (+/- 10)(3T) plates are
   significantly enhanced with an FG-X pattern for the plates. We found
   that due to the combined effect of FG and in-plane NPR, the thermal
   postbuckling strength of FG-X (+/- 10)(3T) plate is higher than that of
   FG-X (+/- 10)(5T) plate.}},

Title = {{A theoretical model for the estimate of plateau force for the crushing
   process of 3D auxetic anti-tetra chiral structures}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{199}},
Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic, anti-tetra-chiral structures designed as tubes subjected to
   axial quasi-static crushing were investigated in this research.
   Experimental work was carried on samples manufactured by laser cutting
   from a pipe. At the same time, numerical simulations were performed
   using a parametric numerical model of the structure. The experimental
   results analysis revealed that the crushing force presents a plateau
   region that extends up to the densification phase defined by the close
   contact between the ligaments joining the nodes. Subsequently, based on
   the representative unit's deformation characteristics, theoretical
   calculation models were established to estimate the plateau force.
   According to Bernoulli's beam model, the force calculation model was
   developed from the plastic hinge's structural design and theory.
   Sametime, the length or crushing distance with a constant force
   (plateau), can be estimated to provide the complete set of parameters
   for design activities. The analytical solution was validated against
   results obtained numerical simulation for various configurations. There
   is a good agreement between experimental, numerical, and theoretical
   results that proves the proposed model's reliability to estimate plateau
   force. Furthermore, individual parts were stacked to define graded
   structures. It was found that the crushing force displays successive
   stages according to each individual part. There is a possibility to
   reconstruct the response for stacked structure from the individual
   response using the analytical solution's results for force and length of
   individual plateau stages.
   The set of equations can design this structure when the capable load is
   one of the input parameters.}},

Abstract = {{This work analyses shear moduli of conventional and auxetic open-cell
   polymer foams. Shear moduli are i) measured directly and ii) calculated
   by applying elasticity theory for isotropic solid materials, using
   Young's moduli and Poisson's ratios from compression tests. Zero and
   negative Poisson's ratio foams are fabricated from conventional foams
   using a thermo-mechanical process. Fabricated and conventional foams are
   compression tested in three orthogonal directions, up to densification
   at similar to 60\% compression, with full-field strain measurements
   obtained using Digital Image Correlation. Compression testing is
   followed by shear testing. The measured shear moduli vary from 16 +/- 7
   kPa for negative Poisson's ratio foams to 38 +/- 2 kPa for zero
   Poisson?s ratio foams, with conventional foams in between with a mean
   value of 32 +/- 8 kPa. The calculated shear moduli are typically lower
   than the measured values. The results suggest that the application of
   elasticity theory to calculate the low strain shear modulus of open-cell
   foam from Young's modulus and Poisson?s ratio measured in compression
   tests is appropriate if the foam is isotropic.}},

Title = {{Enhancement of the vibro-acoustic performance of anti-tetra-chiral
   auxetic sandwich panels using topologically optimized local resonators}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ACOUSTICS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{177}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{This paper focuses on identifying parameters for optimized distributions
   of local internal resonators to enhance the vibro-acoustic performance
   of anti-tetra-chiral auxetic sandwich panels. The sandwich panel and its
   auxetic core are simulated using a full-scale finite element approach.
   An equivalent homogenized model is then employed to reduce the
   computational time of the optimization problem. The homogenized model is
   based on theoretical formulations and verified with the full-scale
   model. Clusters of resonators are added to the structure to act as local
   resonators. These resonators are parallel with the through-the-thickness
   direction of the panel and provide an Absorbing Tuned Auxiliary System
   (ATAS) to mitigate flexural vibrations over a frequency range. The
   mechanical parameters of the resonators and the geometrical topology are
   the design variables. The frequency-dependent radiated mean sound level
   (RMSL) and the maximum peak value of the Radiated Sound Power Level
   (RSPL) are two different objective functions for the optimization. The
   effects of the loading pattern, topology configuration and objective
   functions on the optimization results are investigated. The use of
   localized resonators in the anti-tetra chiral sandwich structures can
   enhance remarkably the sound attenuation of the panels, particularly in
   the case of local loading conditions. We observe 3.7 and 2.6 dB RMSL
   attenuations for the local and full coverage sound pressure loadings. In
   a similar fashion, 15.9 and 11.5 dB attenuation at RSPL peak are also
   observed in the auxetic panels for the two sound pressure loading
   conditions. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Impact of influenza vaccination in the Netherlands, 2007-2016: Vaccinees
   consult their general practitioner for clinically diagnosed influenza,

   non-vaccinees}},

Abstract = {{Introduction We aimed to develop an innovative population-based method
   to estimate the health effect of influenza vaccination based on
   electronic medical records collected within a general practitioner
   (GP)-based influenza surveillance system in the Netherlands.
   Methods In each season between 2006/07 and 2015/16, we fitted multilevel
   Poisson regression models to compare GP consultation rates for
   clinically diagnosed influenza, acute respiratory infections (ARI),
   pneumonia, and lower back pain (as a control) between vaccinated vs.
   unvaccinated individuals. Season-specific relative risks and 95\%
   confidence intervals (CI) were pooled into summary risk ratio (SRR)
   through random-effects meta-analysis models. Analyses were stratified by
   patient age (<45, 45-59, 60-74, <greater than or equal to>75 years) and
   medical indication for the vaccine (any vs. none, subjects aged <= 60
   years only).
   Results Overall, 12.6\% and 21.4\% of study subjects were vaccinated
   because of their age only or because of an underlying medical condition.
   Vaccine uptake declined over time, especially among subjects aged <= 74
   years with medical indications for vaccination. Vaccinated individuals
   had significantly higher GP consultation rates for clinically diagnosed
   influenza (SRR 1.24, 95\% CI 1.12-1.38, p-value <0.001), ARI (SRR 1.33,
   95\% CI 1.27-1.39, p-value <0.001), pneumonia (SRR 1.27, 95\% CI
   1.19-1.36, p-value <0.001), and lower back pain (SRR 1.21, 95\% CI
   1.14-1.28, p-value <0.001) compared to unvaccinated individuals.
   Discussion Contrary to expectations, influenza vaccinees have GP
   consultation rates for clinically diagnosed influenza, ARI and pneumonia
   that are 24-33\% higher compared to unvaccinated individuals. The lower
   back pain finding suggests that the increase in consultation rates is
   partially caused by confounding. Importantly, considering the data are
   not laboratory-confirmed, our results cannot be linked directly to
   influenza, but only to respiratory illnesses in general.}},

Abstract = {{A type of mechanical metamaterial is proposed, whereby the effective
   coefficients of thermal and moisture expansions (CTE and CME,
   respectively) can be tuned from positive to negative values while
   maintaining a consistently auxetic (negative Poisson's ratio) behavior
   for the overall structure. Each unit consists of a pair of equal-armed
   crosses pin jointed at their centers, whereas their ends are connected
   via bridging beams using pin joints to facilitate free rotation. The
   bridging beams are of lower modulus and higher hygrothermal expansivity
   to permit negativity in metamaterial's overall Poisson's ratio and
   hygrothermal expansion. Two sets of effective Young's modulus, CME and
   CTE models are developed-one set for large deformation and the other for
   infinitesimal deformation. Results indicate that the effective Young's
   modulus is reduced while the expansion coefficients become more negative
   as the inclination angle of the equal-armed crosses increases, and that
   the application of tensile and compressive loads increases and decreases
   the effective Young's modulus, respectively. The establishment of
   effective zero thermal and moisture expansion conditions facilitates the
   application of the metamaterial structure that requires auxetic property
   within highly fluctuating environmental condition.}},

   MECHANICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, the effects of lattice stiffeners and blast load on
   nonlinear dynamic response and vibration of auxetic sandwich honeycomb
   plates on Pasternak elastic foundations are considered. The remarkable
   point of this study is that the outer surfaces of the system reinforced
   by lattice stiffeners (including orthogonal stiffeners and oblique
   stiffeners) are made of functionally graded materials. Based on the
   analytical solution, the Reddy's FSDT, the Airy's stress functions, the
   Galerkin and the fourth-order Runge-Kutta methods, fundamental
   frequency, dynamic response and frequency-amplitude curves of the plates
   reinforced by lattice stiffeners under blast and mechanical loads are
   determined. Then, the result analyses the effect of lattice stiffeners,
   blast and mechanical loads, elastic foundations on nonlinear dynamic
   response and vibration of auxetic honeycomb plates. The optimal angle of
   oblique stiffeners which maximizes natural frequency and
   contemporaneously minimizes amplitude when changing geometrical
   parameters of auxetic honeycomb is also determined.}},

Abstract = {{Metasurfaces advanced the field of optics by reducing the thickness of

   This work explores mechanically reconfigurable devices that perform
   focusing, spectral demultiplexing, and polarization sorting based on
   mechanical configuration. As proof of concept, a rotatable device, a
   device based on rotating squares, and a shearing-based device are
   designed with adjoint-based topology optimization, 3D-printed, and

Abstract = {{Based on the butterfly pattern structure and the star-shaped honeycomb
   structure, a novel auxetic butterfly-shaped honeycomb structure (BSH)
   was constructed, which realized the coupling improvement of negative
   Poisson's ratio and in-plane stiffness. Under uniaxial tension, the
   equivalent elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio of the BSH structure were
   derived by the energy method. The relationship between Poisson's ratio
   and structural parameters of the BSH structure was discussed to optimize
   the structural parameters by numerical analysis. Poisson's ratio and
   relative elastic modulus were taken as the objective function groups.
   The Pareto solution set was obtained by the Gamultiobj multi-objective
   genetic algorithm method. The Pareto solution set was sorted based on
   the entropy-weight TOPSIS method, and the optimal solution was selected
   as the solution of the novel structure optimization design. The
   correctness of the theoretical results was verified by the finite
   element analysis and experiment results. Furthermore, compared with the
   traditional re-entrant hexagonal honeycomb structure and the star-shaped
   honeycomb structure, the relative elastic modulus and auxetic effect of
   the BSH structure were greatly improved, and the stiffness of the novel
   structure was improved while maintaining a high auxetic effect.

Title = {{Testing independence between discrete random variables}},
Journal = {{COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS}},
Abstract = {{In this paper we develop a likelihood ratio test for independence
   between multivariate discrete random vectors whose components may be
   dependent or may have different marginal distributions. A special case
   that tests independence between two discrete random variables is also
   discussed. The model under the null hypothesis is constructed based on
   the marginal distributions of the random variables, while the model
   under the alternative is built by adding a common random effect which is
   not restricted to follow the same distribution as those of the other
   variables. The test statistic is shown to admit an asymptotic
   distribution of a weighted sum of chi-square random variables, each with
   one degree of freedom. In order to avoid the high computational cost of
   finding the parameters of the asymptotic distribution, a
   permutation-based procedure is introduced. It is shown in simulations
   that the permutation-based realization yields empirical level close to
   the nominal level, while achieving power comparable to or higher than
   that of existing competitors in the literature. The application of the
   test is illustrated with a real data set.}},

Abstract = {{Mechanical metamaterials are artificial composites that exhibit a wide
   range of advanced functionalities such as negative Poisson's ratio,
   shape shifting, topological protection, multistability, extreme
   strength-to-density ratio, and enhanced energy dissipation. In
   particular, flexible metamaterials often harness zeroenergy deformation
   modes. To date, such flexible metamaterials have a single property, for
   example, a single shape change, or are pluripotent, that is, they can
   have many different responses, but typically require complex actuation
   protocols. Here, we introduce a class of oligomodal metamaterials that
   encode a few distinct properties that can be selectively controlled
   under uniaxial compression. To demonstrate this concept, we introduce a
   combinatorial design space containing various families of metamaterials.
   These families include monomodal (i.e., with a single zero-energy
   deformation mode); oligomodal (i.e., with a constant number of
   zero-energy deformation modes); and plurimodal (i.e., with many
   zero-energy deformation modes), whose number increases with system size.
   We then confirm the multifunctional nature of oligomodal metamaterials
   using both boundary textures and viscoelasticity. In particular, we
   realize a metamaterial that has a negative (positive) Poisson's ratio
   for low (high) compression rate over a finite range of strains. The
   ability of our oligomodal metamaterials to host multiple mechanical
   responses within a single structure paves the way toward multifunctional
   materials and devices.}},

Title = {{Double-core helical auxetic yarn: a Novel structure, geometrical
   modeling and experimental verification}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE TEXTILE INSTITUTE}},
Abstract = {{In this work, a new structure for designing auxetic yarn and its
   geometrical analysis is presented. The proposed structure is referred to
   as a double-core helical auxetic yarn (DC-HAY). It consists of two core
   components of soft yarn with a larger diameter and one wrap component of
   stiff yarn with a smaller diameter. A primary geometrical model for
   predicting the Poisson's ratio of the structure was presented through
   the deformation analysis of the DC-HAY during the tensile loading. Also,
   the primary proposed model was modified by considering the non-linear
   behavior of Poisson's ratio of the core components. For the verification
   of the proposed models, some experiments were conducted based on the
   initial wrapping angle, as well as the diameter ratio and modulus ratio
   of components. The results showed that the proposed yarn structure
   exhibits an apparent auxetic outcome. Moreover, the modified model is
   capable of predicting the maximum negative Poisson's ratio of the DC-HAY
   with a desirable error. Furthermore, it was found that the higher
   modulus ratio of components, higher diameter ratio of components and the
   lower initial wrapping angle will result in a higher maximum NPR, which
   were -8.23, -8.16 through the main lateral directions of samples.}},

   two-dimensional solids with circular inclusions}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{103}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 24}},
Abstract = {{Elastic materials with holes and inclusions are important in a large
   variety of contexts ranging from construction material to biological
   membranes. More recently, they have also been exploited inmechanical
   metamaterials, where the geometry of highly deformable structures is
   responsible for their unusual properties, such as negative Poisson's
   ratio, mechanical cloaking, and tunable phononic band gaps.
   Understanding how such structures deform in response to applied external
   loads is thus crucial for designing novel mechanical metamaterials. Here
   we present a method for predicting the linear response of infinite 2D
   solid structures with circular holes and inclusions by employing
   analogies with electrostatics. Just like an external electric field
   induces polarization (dipoles, quadrupoles, and other multipoles) of
   conductive and dielectric objects, external stress induces elastic
   multipoles inside holes and inclusions. Stresses generated by these
   induced elastic multipoles then lead to interactions between holes and
   inclusions, which induce additional polarization and thus additional
   deformation of holes and inclusions. We present a method that expands
   the induced polarization in a series of elastic multipoles, which
   systematically takes into account the interactions of inclusions and
   holes with the external stress field and also between them. The results
   of our method show good agreement with both linear finite element
   simulations and experiments.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the structural, electronic and optical properties of
   theoretically predicted C6N monolayer structure are investigated by
   means of Density Functional Theory-based First-Principles Calculations.
   Phonon band dispersion calculations and molecular dynamics simulations
   reveal the dynamical and thermal stability of the C6N single-layer
   structure. We found out that the C6N monolayer has large negative
   in-plane Poisson's ratios along both X and Y direction and the both
   values are almost four times that of the famous-pentagraphene. The
   electronic structure shows that C6N monolayer is a semi-metal and has a
   Dirac-point in the BZ. The optical analysis using the random phase
   approximation method constructed over HSE06 illustrates that the first
   peak of absorption coefficient of the C6N monolayer along all
   polarizations is located in the IR range of spectrum, while the second
   absorption peak occurs in the visible range, which suggests its
   potential applications in optical and electronic devices. Interestingly,
   optically anisotropic character of this system is highly desirable for
   the design of polarization-sensitive photodetectors. Thermoelectric
   properties such as Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity,
   electronic thermal conductivity and power factor are investigated as a
   function of carrier doping at temperatures 300, 400, and 500 K. In
   general, we predict that the C6N monolayer could be a new platform for
   study of novel physical properties in two-dimensional semi-metal
   materials, which may provide new opportunities to realize high-speed
   low-dissipation devices.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic metamaterials and structures have excellent mechanical
   properties such as shear resistance, impact resistance, fracture
   resistance, energy absorption and vibration isolation, permeability
   variability, synclastic curvature in bending, etc. Auxetic metamaterials
   have broad application prospects in the fields of aerospace, navigation,
   mechanical automation, biomedicine, national defense and military and
   textile industry. Based on the deformation mechanism of auxetic
   metamaterials and structure, the physical models of re-entrant
   mechanism, rotating rigid mechanism, chiral/antichiral mechanism,
   fibril/nodule mechanism, miura-folded mechanism, buckling-induced
   mechanism, helical auxetic yarn structure were reviewed. These models
   can be widely applied in various engineering applications such as light
   laminated plates, fluid transportation and yarn to improve their
   properties. Finally, prospects to the upcoming challenges and progress
   trends of auxetic metamaterials and structures are made. It is pointed
   out that the application of negative Poisson's ratio effect can help
   compensate the change of volume and area under the deformation of
   uniaxial loading. Then the shock resistance of turbine blade, antenna
   and car suction box can be improved. As a result, this review can

Abstract = {{High-performance stretchable strain sensors, particularly those with
   high sensitivity and broad sensing range, are highly important for
   wearable devices. Herein, a novel auxetic bilayer conductive mesh strain
   sensor (ABSS), composed of multi-hardness silicones, is proposed and
   fabricated by the direct ink writing 3D printing and ink spraying
   technique. The bilayer conductive mesh comprises a thin layer of
   high-conductive and crack-prone single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs)
   coated on a stretchable carbon-black-doped Ecoflex silicone rubber
   (CB/Ecoflex) mesh. The former serves as the dominant sensing material by
   generating SWCNT cracks in the full strain range, while the latter
   mainly plays the roles of both generating the resistance change and
   maintaining the conductive paths under high strain conditions. The
   presence of high-hardness auxetic frame contributes to the formation of
   longitudinal SWCNT cracks on transverse meshes, enhancing the
   sensitivity of the sensors. It is shown that the synergistic effect of
   the bilayer conductive mesh, strain concentration, and auxetic
   deformation strategy endow ABSS with a high gauge factor (similar to
   13.4) that is 6.6 times larger than that of the common sensor.
   Additionally, this study demonstrates the superior sensing performance
   of the ABSS for wearable applications including swallowing recognition,
   respiration monitoring, and joint movement detection.}},

Abstract = {{The evaluation of groundwater presence by means of seismic wave
   velocities is of great concern for many hydrological related engineering
   applications. This work introduces a simple basic procedure to
   accurately and systematically identify groundwater levels using P-wave
   and S-wave velocities. This procedure is defined as a seismic
   reflectivity parameter and based on the seismic reflection coefficients
   of P-wave and S-wave at the unsaturated/saturated interfaces (i.e.,
   groundwater level). The present procedure is applied to 1045 K-NET sites
   in Japan. Observed velocity structures, accompanied by their bulk
   densities and detailed lithology, for the upper 20 m depth are obtained
   from the National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster
   Prevention, Japan. Calculations are carried out considering three
   distinct lithological conditions - gravel, sand and clay-silt sediments
   - in order to evaluate the ability of this approach (seismic
   reflectivity parameter) to detect the groundwater level and assess its
   practical limitations. The increase of the seismic reflectivity
   parameter value varies substantially with Poisson's ratio, resembling
   the relationship between VP/VS and Poisson's ratio in gravel, sand and
   clay-silt sediments. However, positive seismic reflectivity parameter
   values indicate groundwater presence, whereas negative seismic
   reflectivity parameter values indicate lithological variation. The
   seismic reflectivity parameter can also be used as a relative indicator
   for groundwater saturation levels. Fair comparisons are established
   between the seismic reflectivity parameter and the water seismic index
   technique. However, the seismic reflectivity parameter approach shows
   consistency with previous theoretical and experimental studies related
   to variations of VP and VS in saturated conditions, whereas the water
   seismic index shows inconsistency with these previous theoretical and
   experimental studies and an inability in determining saturation levels
   and detecting groundwater levels.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICS AND MATERIALS IN DESIGN}},
Abstract = {{The present paper was conducted to calculate Young's modulus and
   Negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) of a warp and woof (WAW) 3D auxetic
   structure in three perpendicular directions using an analytical method
   under uniaxial loading and considering the elastic-plastic behavior of
   materials. Due to the periodic pattern of the auxetic structure, a unit
   cell was chosen as a representative volume element (RVE) and its
   mechanical properties were assessed by developing analytical
   formulations in the elastic region. To this end, the principle of
   virtual work along with the concept of lumped plasticity (plastic
   hinges) were utilized. For validating the proposed analytical model, the
   3D finite element (FE) simulations were used. Fairly good correlations
   were found between the present analytical results and the results of FE
   simulations. Subsequently, the effects of parameters, such as the
   initial re-entrant (IRE) angle, the cell thickness, and the auxetic cell
   aspect ratio on the mechanical properties were investigated. The
   obtained results revealed that with the increase in the IRE angle, NPR
   increases in the vertical direction and decreases in two other
   horizontal directions; it also increases the cell stiffness in three
   perpendicular directions. The thickness of cell walls does not alter
   NPR, yet relatively increases the cell stiffness. Furthermore, it was
   found that the cell aspect ratio has an important role in the mechanical
   properties of WAW auxetic structures.}},

Title = {{Risks of subsequent primary cancers among breast cancer survivors
   according to hormone receptor status}},
Journal = {{CANCER}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND This study was aimed at examining the risks of subsequent
   primary cancers (SPCs) among breast cancer survivors by hormone receptor
   (HR) status and age at diagnosis.
   METHODS Data from 12 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results
   registries were used to identify 431,222 breast cancer survivors (at
   least 1 year) diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 84 years from 1992 to
   2015. Risks of SPCs were measured as the standardized incidence ratio
   (SIR) and the excess absolute risk (EAR) per 10,000 person-years.
   Poisson regression was used to test the difference in SIRs by HR status.
   RESULTS In comparison with the general population, the risk of new
   cancer diagnoses among survivors was 20\% higher for those with
   HR-positive cancers (SIR, 1.20; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI],
   1.19-1.21; EAR, 23.3/10,000 person-years) and 44\% higher for those with
   HR-negative cancers (SIR, 1.44; 95\% CI, 1.41-1.47; EAR, 45.2/10,000
   person-years), with the risk difference between HR statuses
   statistically significant. The higher risk after HR-negative cancer was
   driven by acute nonlymphocytic leukemia and breast, ovarian, peritoneal,
   and lung cancers. By age at diagnosis, the total EAR per 10,000
   person-years ranged from 15.8 (95\% CI, 14.1-17.5; SIR, 1.11) among
   late-onset (age, 50-84 years) HR-positive survivors to 69.4 (95\% CI,
   65.1-73.7; SIR, 2.24) among early-onset (age, 20-49 years) HR-negative
   survivors, with subsequent breast cancer representing 73\% to 80\% of
   the total EAR. After breast cancer, the greatest EARs were for ovarian
   cancer among early-onset HR-negative survivors, lung cancer among early-
   and late-onset HR-negative survivors, and uterine corpus cancer among
   late-onset HR-positive survivors.
   CONCLUSIONS Risks of SPCs after breast cancer differ substantially by
   subtype and age. This suggests that more targeted approaches for cancer
   prevention and early-detection strategies are needed in survivorship
   care planning.}},

Title = {{Mathematical simulation of elastoplastic deformation in cubic materials
   with an account of anisotropic bulk compressibility}},
Journal = {{MATHEMATICS AND MECHANICS OF SOLIDS}},
Abstract = {{It was shown for the first time that when modelling the deformation of
   materials with cubic symmetry (at full stress), the rotation of the
   computational axes leads to the identification of anisotropic volumetric
   compressibility. Loading of the materials with cubic symmetry of
   properties in the directions not coincided with the main directions (for
   example, 011) allows one to detect 75\% cases of the auxetic single
   crystals (i.e. with negative Poisson's ratio). In these cases, the
   negative volumetric compressibility has anisotropy, in contrast to the
   volumetric compressibility calculated along the crystallographic axes
   for cubic materials. Anisotropy of the volumetric compressibility leads
   to anisotropy of velocities of propagation of body waves. This paper
   considers several elastoplastic problems for a cubic material with
   different orientations of a coordinate system about its crystallographic
   axes. The behaviour of such a material under dynamic loads is modelled
   with an account of anisotropic bulk compressibility to provide the same
   anisotropy of bulk wave velocities in the elastic and plastic ranges and
   a uniform pressure function at the elastic-to-plastic strain transition.
   For each orientation of the coordinate system and respective planes,
   different values at the indicatrices of elastic constants are specified,
   and this specifies different deformation processes in cubic materials.
   Such an effect is demonstrated by solving three problems in
   three-dimensional (3D) statements approximating the following processes:
   (1) one-dimensional elastoplastic deformation in a thin target impacted
   by a thin plate; (2) uniform compression in a spherical body under
   pulsed hydrostatic pressure; and (3) 3D elastoplastic deformation in a
   cylindrical body striking a rigid target in view of anisotropic bulk
   compressibility. The problems were solved numerically using original
   programs based on the finite element method modified by GR Johnson for
   impact problems. Solving problems in a 3D formulation makes it possible
   to take into account the dependences of the direction of the elastic and
   plastic characteristics of the material, as well as the velocities of
   propagation of elastic and plastic waves from that direction. The
   simulation results suggest that for cubic materials, changing the
   orientation of two coordinate axes in a plane changes the strains along
   all three axes, including those perpendicular to this plane. It is
   concluded that anisotropic bulk compressibility in cubic materials
   should be allowed for by mathematical models of their elastic and
   plastic deformation. We demonstrate that the orientation of a
   computational coordinate system for cubic materials should be in those
   directions in which their deformation is analysed in each particular
   case.}},

   manifests an Islamic mosaic pattern at the Alhambra Palace}},
Journal = {{ADVANCED COMPOSITES AND HYBRID MATERIALS}},
Abstract = {{Of late, metamaterials have been designed such that they possess
   properties that can switch between positive and negative signs depending
   on the external environment. This paper draws inspiration from an
   Islamic geometric design at the Alhambra Palace for designing a
   metamaterial that exhibits positive coefficients of thermal, pressure,
   and moisture expansions upon cooling, pressurizing, and drying but
   manifests negative coefficients of thermal, pressure, and moisture
   expansions with heating, deceasing pressure, and moistening such that
   the metamaterial always shrinks with environmental changes with
   reference from the original state. The metamaterial is constructed by
   using straight bimaterial strips with alternating orientation that are
   joined at the rigid hexagonal junction nodes to form equilateral
   triangular array such that it transforms into the hexachiral honeycomb
   structure regardless of how the environmental conditions change. Results
   indicate that every effective in-plane expansion coefficient is almost
   linearly proportional to its corresponding environmental change. In
   addition to exhibiting sign-switching expansion coefficients, the
   metamaterial displays positive Poisson's ratio in its original state but
   manifests negative Poisson's ratio upon environmental change(s).}},

Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},

Abstract = {{In present work, the variational asymptotic method is extended to study
   the bucking of composite honeycomb sandwich plate with negative
   Poisson?s ratio (CHSP-NPR), which is easily buckle under compressive
   loads or bending moments and may lead to catastrophic failure. For
   global bucking with small local rotations, the 3D geometrical nonlinear
   problem is decoupled into linear constitutive modeling using unit cell
   and geometrical nonlinear problem defined over the 2D equivalent plate
   model (2D-EPM). Results using 2D-EPM in global buckling analysis are
   compared with 3D-FEM results to evaluate the accuracy and efficiency of
   the present model, and parametric studies are carried out to reveal the
   relative influence of selective parameters on buckling behavior of
   CHSP-NPR. The results show the increase of the proportion of honeycomb
   core and the decrease of fiber volume fraction of face sheet may
   increase the negative Poisson?s ratio and weaken the buckling resistance
   of CHSP-NPR, but the buckling loads of CHSP-NPR are larger than those of
   conventional honeycomb sandwich plate under the same conditions.}},

Title = {{On the Comparative Suitability of Strain Relaxation and Stress
   Relaxation Compression for Ultrasound Poroelastic Tissue
   Characterization}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{MAY 10}},
Abstract = {{Poroelastic tissue strain imaging measures the time-varying and
   spatially varying deformation of a soft-tissue matrix during compression
   as the tissue fluid flows out of the compartmental boundaries. With the
   help of ultrasound, it has been carried out by observing the evolution
   of the images of the ultrasound echo strain over time, which shows that,
   in a stress-relaxation experiment (constantly applied global axial
   strain), a front of negative dilatation (volumetric strain) propagates
   slowly from the boundaries of a sample toward the center of the
   compressed region. The fitting of equations that predict this behavior
   to experimental data has earlier allowed quantitative imaging of the
   product of aggregate modulus and permeability of a tissue phantom,
   H(A)k, and its Poisson's ratio, nu. An ability to image and measure such
   novel tissue characteristics is likely to benefit biomedical research
   and have a wide range of clinical applications, including the assessment
   of lymphoedema, the diagnosis of cancer, the prediction of anticancer
   drug effectiveness, and monitoring of the tissue response to various
   treatments. This method is problematic, however, for application in vivo
   because the calculation of the volumetric strain requires the lateral
   and elevational strains, which are not easily measured accurately with
   conventional ultrasound strain imaging. This paper investigates for the
   first time whether the ultrasound observation in a strain-relaxation
   experiment (constantly applied uniaxial stress) could be used to observe
   the same mechanical behavior and provide the same information about the
   properties of a poroelastic sample as in a stress-relaxation experiment.
   The analytical theory was used to demonstrate that the propagation of
   dilatation shown in stress relaxation should also be observable in
   strain relaxation and that it should be detectable using axial strain,
   which is relatively easily measured in vivo. Finite element modeling
   (FEM) was employed to simulate all strain components within a
   homogeneous poroelastic material first during strain relaxation and then
   during stress relaxation, again demonstrating their equivalence for the
   observation of the propagation of a dilatation. The validity of using
   the strain relaxation conditions as an alternative to stress relaxation
   for measuring a poroelastic material's response was further confirmed by
   a fitting of the analytical models to the results of FEM. This allowed
   for an inversion of the time-varying volumetric strain, to recover the
   images of H(A)k and nu, for either loading configuration. The
   strain-relaxation configuration offers not only an opportunity to derive
   the same important quantitative poroelastic properties of the tissue as
   stress relaxation but also the potential to avoid the difficulties and
   errors associated with the estimation of strain along the axes
   perpendicular to the imaging axis, thus offering opportunities for
   easier clinical translation.}},

Abstract = {{Background BNT162b2 mRNA and ChAdOx1 nCOV-19 adenoviral vector vaccines
   have been rapidly rolled out in the UK from December, 2020. We aimed to
   determine the factors associated with vaccine coverage for both vaccines
   and documented the vaccine effectiveness of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine in
   a cohort of health-care workers undergoing regular asymptomatic testing.
   Methods The SIREN study is a prospective cohort study among staff (aged
   >= 18 years) working in publicly-funded hospitals in the UK.
   Participants were assigned into either the positive cohort (antibody
   positive or history of infection {[}indicated by previous positivity of
   antibody or PCR tests]) or the negative cohort (antibody negative with
   no previous positive test) at the beginning of the follow-up period.
   Baseline risk factors were collected at enrolment, symptom status was
   collected every 2 weeks, and vaccination status was collected through
   linkage to the National Immunisations Management System and
   questionnaires. Participants had fortnightly asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 PCR
   testing and monthly antibody testing, and all tests (including
   symptomatic testing) outside SIREN were captured. Data cutoff for this
   analysis was Feb 5, 2021. The follow-up period was Dec 7, 2020, to Feb
   5, 2021. The primary outcomes were vaccinated participants (binary ever
   vacinated variable; indicated by at least one vaccine dose recorded by
   at least one of the two vaccination data sources) for the vaccine
   coverage analysis and SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by a PCR test for
   the vaccine effectiveness analysis. We did a mixed-effect logistic
   regression analysis to identify factors associated with vaccine
   coverage. We used a piecewise exponential hazard mixed-effects model
   (shared frailty-type model) using a Poisson distribution to calculate
   hazard ratios to compare time-to-infection in unvaccinated and
   vaccinated participants and estimate the impact of the BNT162b2 vaccine
   on all PCR-positive infections (asymptomatic and symptomatic). This
   study is registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN11041050, and is ongoing.
   Findings 23 324 participants from 104 sites (all in England) met the
   inclusion criteria for this analysis and were enrolled. Included
   participants had a median age of 46.1 years (IQR 36.0-54.1) and 19 692
   (84\%) were female; 8203 (35\%) were assigned to the positive cohort at
   the start of the analysis period, and 15 121 (65\%) assigned to the
   negative cohort. Total follow-up time was 2 calendar months and 1 106
   905 person-days (396 318 vaccinated and 710 587 unvaccinated). Vaccine
   coverage was 89\% on Feb 5, 2021, 94\% of whom had BNT162b2 vaccine.
   Significantly lower coverage was associated with previous infection,
   gender, age, ethnicity, job role, and Index of Multiple Deprivation
   score. During follow-up, there were 977 new infections in the
   unvaccinated cohort, an incidence density of 14 infections per 10 000
   person-days; the vaccinated cohort had 71 new infections 21 days or more
   after their first dose (incidence density of eight infections per 10 000
   person-days) and nine infections 7 days after the second dose (incidence
   density four infections per 10 000 person-days). In the unvaccinated
   cohort, 543 (56\%) participants had typical COVID-19 symptoms and 140
   (14\%) were asymptomatic on or 14 days before their PCR positive test
   date, compared with 29 (36\%) with typical COVID-19 symptoms and 15
   (19\%) asymptomatic in the vaccinated cohort. A single dose of BNT162b2
   vaccine showed vaccine effectiveness of 70\% (95\% CI 55-85) 21 days
   after first dose and 85\% (74-96) 7 days after two doses in the study
   population.
   Interpretation Our findings show that the BNT162b2 vaccine can prevent
   both symptomatic and asymptomatic infection in working-age adults. This
   cohort was vaccinated when the dominant variant in circulation was
   B1.1.7 and shows effectiveness against this variant. Copyright Crown

Title = {{3D-Printed highly stretchable conducting polymer electrodes for flexible
   supercapacitors}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A}},
Abstract = {{Recent advances in the development of wearable, implantable, and
   bio-integrated electronic devices have increased the demand for
   stretchable and flexible energy storage devices that can deliver high
   degrees of mechanical deformability. However, the fabrication of fully
   flexible electronics with both satisfactory electrochemical performance
   and mechanical stretchability remains a significant technological
   hurdle. In this work, by synergistically combining theoretical
   structural design and 3D printing, additive-free free-standing
   stretchable electrodes with different negative Poisson's ratio (NPR)
   structures have been developed based on a
   poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) ink.
   Through tensile tests and finite element analyses (FEA), the stretchable
   electrode with a well-designed arc-shaped NPR structure can effectively
   reduce the peak strain, resulting in excellent flexibility (up to 180
   degrees) and stretchability (maximum elongation 150\%). Through further
   integration of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), the 3D printed hybrid
   polymer/CNT electrode exhibits enhanced electrochemical performance with
   a high area capacitance of 990 mF cm(-2). The as-fabricated
   quasi-solid-state symmetric supercapacitor not only achieves a
   satisfactory energy density and maintains excellent capacitance
   retention of 74.7\% after 14 000 cycles, but also shows promising
   mechanical properties by maintaining stable power output even when being
   extremely deformed. The strategy proposed here offers promising
   opportunities in developing novel deformable electrodes for integrated
   wearable energy storage devices in various applications.}},

Title = {{Reconfiguring maritime networks due to the Belt and Road Initiative:
   impact on bilateral trade flows}},
Journal = {{MARITIME ECONOMICS \& LOGISTICS}},
Abstract = {{This paper aims to analyse the potential effects on bilateral trade
   movements of the reconfiguration of maritime networks brought about by
   the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). The gravity model of international
   trade is applied to examine the hypothesized impact of maritime network
   reconfiguration on the bilateral trade between nine exporting countries
   (Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Israel, Panama, Colombia, Costa Rica, Singapore,
   Malaysia and Indonesia) and their 128 trading partners. The panel data
   on the five components of the Liner Shipping Bilateral Connectivity
   Index, the export value, the gross domestic product (GDP) of the nine
   exporting countries, the GDP of their trading partners and the maritime
   distance linking them to these 128 trading partners for each of the
   years from 2008 to 2016 are used in the analysis. The results show that
   the estimated coefficient for the number of transhipments is negative,
   revealing an inverse relationship between transhipments and bilateral
   exports, reconfirming that a redesign of the maritime supply chain
   network in response to the BRI could significantly improve bilateral
   export values. Furthermore, a reduction in the number of required
   transhipments, because of a reconfiguration of maritime networks with
   BRI trading partners, will improve the maritime network structure
   between countries located along the three strategic chokepoints: the
   Suez Canal, the Panama Canal, and the Strait of Malacca. In general
   terms, the BRI-driven reconfiguration of maritime supply networks is
   linked to an improvement in the productivity of nine exporting
   countries. An innovative gravity-based econometric model, estimated on a
   large set of panel data, is introduced below, aiming at the modelling of
   the effect of BRI on supply chain network reconfiguration.}},

   Re-entrant Geometry}},
Journal = {{PHYSICA STATUS SOLIDI B-BASIC SOLID STATE PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2021}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic fabrics are those with a negative Poisson's ratio and have
   received increasing attention in recent years. In our previous study, a
   series of auxetic warp-knitted fabrics were developed based on
   re-entrant geometry and their auxetic effects were experimentally
   investigated. Unlike weft-knitted fabrics, the preparation and
   production process of warp-knitted fabrics are very complicated and time
   consuming. However, finite element (FE) method offers an efficient way
   to simulate and predict their auxetic behavior without conducting the
   manufacturing process and experimental tests. Herein, an FE study of
   auxetic warp-knitted fabric structures is conducted. The FE models are
   established from the geometry of a real fabric and compared with the
   experimental results. It is shown that the variation trends of Poisson's
   ratio agree well between the simulation and experiment. Although
   simulation results are slightly different from the experimental ones, it
   still proves feasible for predicting auxetic effects of auxetic fabrics
   using the FE models. It is expected that this research can offer a
   useful method to model and simulate the deformation behavior of auxetic
   warp-knitted fabrics, providing a guide for the design and development
   of more novel auxetic fabric structures.}},

Title = {{Numerical Modelling of Rayleigh Wave in Homogeneous Soil Medium in
   Undamped Condition}},
Journal = {{INDIAN GEOTECHNICAL JOURNAL}},
Abstract = {{In this study, the Rayleigh wave velocity, which is an important
   parameter in ground vibration analysis, is determined directly in an
   unbounded soil medium using numerical modelling with ABAQUS. The
   Rayleigh wave (R-wave) velocity is determined from the displacement time
   response of the finite element model at a single station for far-field
   condition. Using the results, a linear prediction equation is proposed
   to determine the R-wave velocity of the soil. For this a 2D finite
   element model coupled with infinite elements in the boundary is
   developed which is subjected to dynamic loading. After establishment of
   the presence of R wave in the soil medium using particle movement and
   validation of displacement time response with analytical models, the R
   wave velocity is determined using positive peak particle vertical
   displacement. The effect of material properties of soil medium, such as
   modulus of elasticity, density and Poisson ratio, on Rayleigh wave
   velocity are investigated using differential sensitivity analysis. The
   analysis shows that the modulus of elasticity has positive correlation
   with highest sensitivity coefficient whereas density and Poisson ratio
   have negative correlations with R wave velocity. A prediction equation
   is developed for R wave velocity for the input variables, the square
   root of specific modulus and Poisson ratio, using multiple linear
   regression in MATLAB. The accuracy and usefulness of the predictive
   equation is validated by comparing the predicted values of R wave
   velocity with values obtained from analytical model and field/lab
   measurements. Applying the predictive equation for the range of soil
   properties available in the literature, the R wave velocity of different
   soil types and conditions are evaluated, which can be used for the
   analysis and mitigation of ground vibration problems.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Nine years after the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate
   vaccine (PCV) in the United States, Hong Kong (HK) introduced the
   vaccine to its universal childhood immunisation programme in 2009. We
   aimed to assess the impact of childhood PCV immunisation on all-cause
   pneumonia (ACP) admissions among the overall population of HK.
   Methods: In this population-based interrupted time series analysis, we
   used territory-wide population representative electronic health records
   in HK to evaluate the vaccine impact. We identified hospitalised
   patients with a diagnosis of pneumonia from any cause between 2004 and
   2017. We applied segmented Poisson regression to assess the gradual
   change in the monthly incidence of ACP admissions between pre and
   post-vaccination periods. Negative outcome control, subgroup and
   sensitivity analyses were used to test the robustness of the main
   analysis.
   Findings: Over the 14-year study period, a total of 587,607 ACP episodes
   were identified among 357,950 patients. The monthly age-standardised
   incidence of ACP fluctuated between 33.42 and 87.44 per 100,000-persons.
   There was a marginal decreasing trend in pneumonia admissions after PCV
   introduction among overall population (incidence rate ratio {[}IRR]:
   0.9965, 95\% confidence interval {[}CI]: 0.9932-0.99 98), and older
   adults (>= 65 years, IRR: 0.9928, 95\% CI: 0.9904-0.9953) but not in
   younger age groups.
   Interpretation: There was a marginally declining trend of overall ACP
   admissions in HK up to eight years after childhood PCV introduction. The
   significance disappeared when fitting sensitivity analyses. The results
   indicate the complexities of using non-specific endpoints for measuring
   vaccine effect and the necessity of enhancing serotype surveillance
   systems for replacement monitoring.}},

Title = {{Effect of pressure on pull-off of flat cylindrical punch adhered to
   circular membrane}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ADHESION}},
Abstract = {{Pressure can sometimes be utilized to increase or decrease the strength
   of adhesion. This phenomenon is analyzed for pull-off of a flat,
   circular cylindrical punch from a circular membrane. The pressure is
   applied, and then the punch is pulled upward. Both force control and
   displacement control are considered, and the pressure may be positive
   (acting upward) or negative (acting downward) on the membrane. The
   membrane is assumed to be linearly elastic, and Foppl-von Karman theory
   is used to allow moderate displacements. The JKR theory of adhesion is
   adopted. A transversality (debonding) condition is derived, and then the
   effects of the work of adhesion, Poisson's ratio, residual stress, and
   the relative radius of the punch to that of the membrane are
   investigated. With an increase in pressure, the pull-off force
   decreases, the pull-off deflection of the punch relative to the initial
   flat membrane level increases, and the total pull-off punch deflection
   from the pressurized membrane may increase or decrease.}},

Abstract = {{Patients who are bed-ridden and users of wheelchairs are prone to
   development of pressure sores at the cushion-skin interface due to
   stress concentrations, moisture and bacterial infections. The purpose of
   this work is to develop antibacterial auxetic polyurethane (PU) foams

   were used in the synthesis of PU foams to induce antibacterial
   properties. These foams were then converted to negative Poisson's ratio
   or auxetic polyurethane (APU) foams to improve the mechanical
   properties. Two different APU foams were made using compression factors
   of 2.07 and 2.97. Chemical composition, microstructure, thermal,
   mechanical and antibacterial properties of SNP-based PU foams before and
   after conversion to APUs were studied. The study showed that APU foams
   fabricated using higher compression factor greatly enhanced the
   antibacterial properties against gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus
   and Staphylococcus epidermidis) and gram negative (Pseudomonas
   aeruginosa and Escherichia coli) bacteria. APU foams made using higher
   compression ratio also exhibited increase in the compression strength at
   higher strains (after 20\% strain). This study shows that the
   antibacterial APU foams developed in this work can possibly cause less
   infection and ensure better stress distribution at the cushion-skin
   interface.

Abstract = {{Introduction Over the last decade, a number of delivery units have been
   closed in Sweden, justified by both economic incentives and patient
   safety issues. However, concentrating births to larger delivery units
   naturally increases travel time for some parturient women, which may
   lead to unintended negative consequences. We aimed to investigate the
   association between travel time to delivery unit and unplanned
   out-of-hospital birth, and subsequent infant morbidity and mortality.
   Material and methods We performed a population-based cohort study
   including 365 604 women in the Swedish Pregnancy Register, giving birth
   between 2014 and 2017. Modified Poisson regression was used to
   investigate the association between travel time from home address to
   actual delivery unit, based on geographic information system analysis,
   and risk of an unplanned out-of-hospital birth. Analyses were stratified
   by parity and urban/rural residence. Lastly, the associations between an
   unplanned out-of-hospital birth and severe infant morbidity, stillbirth,
   peripartum, perinatal and neonatal mortality were investigated.
   Results Of those with an unplanned out-of-hospital birth (n = 2159),
   65\% had a travel time up to 30 minutes. A travel time between 31 and 60
   minutes was associated with a doubled risk of unplanned out-of-hospital
   birth (adjusted risk ratio {[}RR] 1.96, 95\% confidence interval {[}CI]
   1.74-2.22) and women with a travel time of more than 1 hour had an
   adjusted RR of 3.19 (95\% CI 2.64-3.86), compared with those with a
   travel time of <30 minutes. No difference in results was seen when
   stratified for parity and urban/rural residence. No association was
   found between unplanned out-of-hospital birth and severe infant
   morbidity. Significant associations were found in crude analyses for
   stillbirth (RR 1.85, 95\% CI 1.09-3.13), peripartum (RR 1.93, 95\% CI
   1.18-3.16), perinatal (RR 2.03, 95\% CI 1.28-3.23) and neonatal
   mortality (RR 3.08, 95\% CI 1.27-7.46), although neonatal mortality was
   very rare (2.3/1000 out-of-hospital births). Similar effect estimates
   were found in the adjusted analyses, though no longer significant.
   Conclusions Although the majority of unplanned out-of-hospital births
   occurred in the group of women with a travel time of 0-30 minutes,
   increasing travel time to a delivery unit is associated with unplanned
   out-of-hospital birth, which may increase the risk of mortality.}},

Abstract = {{The ridge estimator has been consistently demonstrated to be an
   attractive shrinkage method to reduce the effects of multicollinearity.
   The Poisson regression negative binomial regression models are
   well-known model in application when the response variable is count
   data. However, it is known that multicollinearity negatively affects the
   variance of maximum likelihood estimator of the count regression
   coefficients. To address this problem, a count data ridge estimator has
   been proposed by numerous researchers. In this paper, an almost unbiased
   regression estimator is proposed and derived. Our Monte Carlo simulation
   results suggest that the proposed estimator can bring significant
   improvement relative to other existing estimators. In addition, the real
   application results demonstrate that the proposed estimator outperforms
   both negative binomial ridge regression and maximum likelihood
   estimators in terms of predictive performance.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is devoted to a category of metamaterials called auxetics,
   identified by their negative Poisson's ratio. Our work consists in
   exploring geometrical strategies to generate irregular auxetic
   structures. More precisely we seek to reduce the Poisson's ratio nu, by
   pruning an irregular network based solely on geometric criteria. We
   introduce a strategy combining a pure geometric pruning algorithm
   followed by a physics-based testing phase to determine the resulting
   Poisson's ratio of our structures. We propose an algorithm that
   generates sets of irregular auxetic networks. Our contributions include
   geometrical characterization of auxetic networks, development of a
   pruning strategy, generation of auxetic networks with low Poisson's
   ratio, as well as validation of our approach. We provide statistical
   validation of our approach on large sets of irregular networks, and we
   additionally laser-cut auxetic networks in sheets of rubber. The
   findings reported here show that it is possible to reduce the Poisson's
   ratio by geometric pruning, and that we can generate irregular auxetic
   networks at lower processing times than a physics-based approach.}},

Title = {{HIV infection modifies the relationship between distance to a health
   facility and treatment success rate for tuberculosis in rural eastern
   Uganda}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLINICAL TUBERCULOSIS AND OTHER MYCOBACTERIAL DISEASES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{23}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Rationale: Distance from residence to a health facility especially in
   rural areas presents a physical barrier and may influence tuberculosis
   (TB) treatment outcomes.
   Objectives: We examined the association between distance from residence
   to a health facility and TB treatment outcomes namely treatment success
   rate (TSR) and mortality, and whether HIV influences this relationship
   among people with TB in Kumi district in rural eastern Uganda.
   Methods: In this cross-sectional design, we abstracted data from TB unit
   registers across four large health facilities. Travel of >= 5 km to a
   health facility was considered a long distance. The primary outcome was
   TSR and the secondary was mortality. We performed a generalized linear
   model with Poisson distribution with a log-link and robust standard
   errors to determine the association between distance and the study
   outcomes adjusting for potential confounders. We report the adjusted
   risk ratio (aRR) and 95\% confidence interval (CI).
   Measurement and results: Of 611 participants studied, 484 (79.2\%) were
   successfully treated, 18 (2.9\%) died, and 359 (58.7\%) travelled a long
   distance to access TB treatment. Long-distance was significantly
   associated with lower TSR (aRR, 0.93; 95\% CI, 0.89-0.96). Further
   analysis showed that longer distance was associated with lower TSR among
   HIV positive persons with TB (aRR, 0.83; 95\% CI, 0.72-0.96), but not
   among HIV negative persons with TB (aRR, 0.94; 95\% CI, 0.85-1.03).
   Although it was not significant, longer distance showed a tendency
   towards worse mortality among HIV positive people with TB (aRR, 2.78;
   95\% CI, 0.80-9.66), but not among HIV negative people with HIV (aRR,
   0.21; 0.03-1.74).
   Conclusions: A majority of people with TB travel long distances to
   access treatment. Long distances are associated with lower TSR and
   higher mortality and affect people with TB who are HIV positive but not
   HIV negative. Interventions should focus on improving access to
   treatment for people with TB who travel long distances.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the thermal post-buckling behaviors of
   graphene-reinforced metal matrix composite (GRMMC) laminated cylindrical
   panels which possess in-plane negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) and rest on
   an elastic foundation. A panel consists of GRMMC layers of piece-wise
   varying graphene volume fractions to obtain functionally graded (FG)
   patterns. Based on the MD simulation results, the GRMMCs exhibit
   in-plane NPR as well as temperature-dependent material properties. The
   governing equations for the thermal post-buckling of panels are based on
   the Reddy's third order shear deformation shell theory. The von Karman
   nonlinear strain-displacement relationship and the elastic foundation
   are also included. The nonlinear partial differential equations for
   GRMMC laminated cylindrical panels are solved by means of a singular
   perturbation technique in associate with a two-step perturbation
   approach and in the solution process the boundary layer effect is
   considered. The results of numerical investigations reveal that the
   thermal post-buckling strength for (0/90)(5T) GRMMC laminated
   cylindrical panels can be enhanced with an FG-X pattern. The thermal
   post-buckling load-deflection curve of 6-layer (0/90/0)(S) and
   (0/90)(3T) panels of FG-X pattern are higher than those of 10-layer
   (0/90/0/90/0)(S) and (0/90)(5T) panels of FG-X pattern.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a significant health
   and economic burden in the US. Tobacco, alcohol, and drug use are
   established risk factors. We sought to evaluate the national trend of
   use of each substance in patients admitted with AMI.
   Methods: We used the National Inpatient Sample between 2005 and 2017. We
   included adult patients hospitalized with AMI. International
   Classification of Diseases, Ninth and Tenth Revisions codes were used to
   define tobacco, alcohol, cocaine, opioid, cannabis and other drug use.
   Trends of each substance use were assessed using multivariable Poisson
   regression, and were expressed as annual percent change (APC) with their
   95\% confidence intervals (CIs).
   Results: A total of 10,796,844 hospitalizations with AMI were included.
   Among all substances used, tobacco was the most common (32.7\%),
   followed by alcohol (3.2\%). Between 2005 and 2017, the prevalence ratio
   of tobacco use increased from 21.5\% to 44.5\% with an APC + 6.2\%
   (95\%CI 6.2\%-6.2\%). Tobacco users had more percutaneous coronary
   intervention (41\%vs25\%) and coronary artery bypass surgery
   (6.9\%vs4.9\%), p < 0.001. Further, there were positive trends in
   alcohol (APC + 3.1\%; 95\%CI 3.0\%-3.2\%), opioid (APC + 9.0\%; 95\%CI
   8.7\%-9.2\%), cannabis (APC + 7.2; 95\% CI 7\%-7.4\%), and combined all
   drug use (+ 7.1\%; 95\%CI 7\%-7.2\%). Meanwhile, there was a slight
   negative trend in cocaine use.
   Conclusions: This analysis outlines the national trends of substance use
   in patients admittedwithAMI and reveals an increasing prevalence of
   tobacco use, alcohol and drug use. More effective cessation measures are
   necessary to reduce the risk for AMI and its burden on the healthcare
   system and economy. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background/Aim: Tic habit cough (THC) is not easily recognized and
   requires a high index of suspicion. Since there is evidence for
   stress-related etiology, the study presents our experience during the
   eight-year period of the recent Greek financial crisis. Patients and
   Methods: This is a descriptive prospective cross-sectional clinical
   study using a consistent approach to diagnosis, possible triggers and
   treatment options. Results: Fifty-one children (26 girls, age 9.5 +/-
   3.1y) from a total of 3,793 new referrals for chronic cough fulfilled
   the criteria of THC (1.34\%). Incidence rates per 1,000 person-years
   were 1.34 (95\%CI=0.34-5.40), 3.91 (95\%CI=1.86-8.19), 4.03
   (95\%CI=2.01-8.06) and 14.60 (95\%CI=10.43-20.44) for every two years.
   Poisson analysis showed an increased trend during the four time periods
   with an incidence rate ratio equal to 2.21 (95\%CI=1.58-3.09, p<0.001).
   THC was mainly attributed to learning difficulties, as well as
   stress-related impact of peer or family bullying, family financial
   problems and child anxiety disorders. Conclusion: The incidence of THC
   is associated with the negative aspects of stressors during a period of
   financial crisis. The potential underlining psycho-physiological
   mechanisms are discussed as well as the fact that prompt diagnosis may
   result in successful interventions.}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{A 2D mechanical metamaterial exhibiting perfectly auxetic behavior,
   i.e., Poisson's ratio of -1, is proposed in this paper drawing upon
   inspiration from an Islamic star formed by circumferential arrangement
   of eight squares, such as the one found at the exterior of the
   Ghiyathiyya Madrasa in Khargird, Iran (built 1438-1444 AD). Each unit of
   the metamaterial consists of eight pairs of pin-jointed Y-shaped rigid
   elements, whereby every pair of Y-elements is elastically restrained by
   a spiral spring. Upon intermediate stretching, each metamaterial unit
   resembles the north dome of Jameh Mosque, Iran (built 1087-1088 AD),
   until the attainment of the fully opened configuration, which resembles
   a structure in Agra, India, near the Taj Mahal. Both infinitesimal and
   finite deformation models of the effective Young's modulus for the
   metamaterial structure were established using strain energy approach in
   terms of the spiral spring stiffness and geometrical parameters, with
   assumptions to preserve the eight-fold symmetricity of every
   metamaterial unit. Results indicate that the prescription of strain
   raises the effective Young's modulus in an exponential manner until full
   extension is attained. This metamaterial is useful for applications
   where the overall shape of the structure must be conserved in spite of
   uniaxial application of load, and where deformation is permitted under
   limited range, which is quickly arrested as the deformation progresses.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, auxetic cellular solids in the forms of honeycombs and carbon
   nanotube reinforced composite (CNTRC) have great potential in a diverse
   range of applications. This paper studies the nonlinear free and forced
   vibration of sandwich cylindrical panel on visco-Pasternak foundations
   in thermal environment subjected to blast load The sandwich cylindrical
   panel consists of auxetic honeycombs core layer and two CNTRC face
   sheets. The Poisson' ratio of the auxetic core is negative and the
   material properties of CNTRC face sheets are assumed to continuously
   vary in the thickness direction according to four different types of
   linear functions. The blast load is determined from the distance of the
   center of blast to center of the structure and the mass of explosive
   materials. The fundamental equations are established based on Reddy's
   higher order shear deformation shell theory taking into account the
   effect of initial imperfection and visco-Pasternak foundations. The
   Galerkin and Runge-Kutta methods are used to obtain the nonlinear
   dynamic response and the natural frequency of the sandwich cylindrical
   panel. The numerical results show the effect of geometrical parameters,
   visco foundations, initial imperfection, temperature increment, nanotube
   volume fraction and blast load on the nonlinear vibration
   characteristics of the sandwich cylindrical panel. The accuracy of
   present approach and theoretical results is verified by some comparisons
   with the known data in the literature.}},

Journal = {{ACTA BIOMATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{126}},
Pages = {{511-523}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Meta-biomaterials offer a promising route towards the development of
   life-lasting implants. The concept aims to achieve solutions that are
   ordinarily impossible, by offering a unique combination of mechanical,
   mass transport, and biological properties through the optimization of
   their small-scale geometrical and topological designs. In this study, we
   primarily focus on auxetic meta-biomaterials that have the extraordinary
   ability to expand in response to axial tension. This could potentially
   improve the longstanding problem of implant loosening, if their
   performance can be guaranteed in cyclically loaded conditions. The
   high-cycle fatigue performance of additively manufactured (AM) auxetic
   meta-biomaterials made from commercially pure titanium (CP-Ti) was
   therefore studied. Small variations in the geometry of the reentrant
   hexagonal honeycomb unit cell and its relative density resulted in
   twelve different designs (relative density: similar to 5-45\%,
   re-entrant angle = 10-25 degrees, Poisson's ratio = -0.076 to -0.504).
   Micro-computed tomography, scanning electron microscopy and mechanical
   testing were used to respectively measure the morphological and
   quasi-static properties of the specimens before proceeding with
   compression-compression fatigue testing. These auxetic meta-biomaterials
   exhibited morphological and mechanical properties that are deemed
   appropriate for bone implant applications (elastic modulus = 66.3-5648
   MPa, yield strength = 1.4-46.7 MPa, pore size = 1.3-2.7 mm). With an
   average maximum stress level of 0.47 sigma(y) at 10(6) cycles (range:
   0.35 sigma(y)sigma(y) - 0.82 sigma(y)sigma(y)), the auxetic structures
   characterized here are superior to many other non-auxetic
   meta-biomaterials made from the same material. The optimization of the
   printing process and the potential application of post-processing
   treatments could improve their performance in cyclically loaded settings
   even further.
   Statement of Significance
   Auxetic meta-biomaterials have a negative Poisson's ratio and,
   therefore, expand laterally in response to axial tension. Recently, they
   have been found to restore bone-implant contact along the lateral side
   of a hip stem. As a result, the bone will be compressed along both of
   the implant's contact lines, thereby actively reducing the risk of
   implant failure. In this case the material will be subjected to cyclic
   loading, for which no experimental data has been reported yet. Here, we
   present the first ever study of the fatigue performance of additively
   manufactured auxetic meta-biomaterials based on the re-entrant hexagonal
   honeycomb. These results will advance the adoption of auxetic
   meta-biomaterials in load-bearing applications, such as the hip stem, to
   potentially improve implant longevity. (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published

   performed on chiral lattices and chiral lattices filled composite tubes.
   For the different cases, the load-displacements curves were analyzed and
   the specific energy absorption (SEA) values were compared. The SEA
   capability for the axial quasi-static crushing of the chiral lattices
   filled composite tubes decreased in comparison with the hollow composite
   design. However, the most significant result was that the average SEA

Abstract = {{In this study, we propose self-triggered thermomechanical metamaterials
   (ST-MM) by applying thermomechanical materials in mechanical
   metamaterials designed with asymmetric structures (i.e., microstructural
   hexagons and chiral legs). The thermomechanical metamaterials are
   observed with programmable mechanical response under thermal
   excitations, which are used in mechanical metamaterials to obtain chiral
   tubes with negative Poisson's ratio and microgrippers with
   temperature-induced grabbing response. Theoretical and numerical models
   are developed to analyze the thermomechanical response of the ST-MM from
   the material and structural perspectives. Finally, we envision advanced
   applications of the ST-MM as chiral stents and thermoresponsive
   microgrippers with maximum grabbing force of approximately 101.7 N. The
   emerging ST-MM provide a promising direction for the design and
   perception of smart mechanical metamaterials.}},

   cellular structures fabricated by powder bed fusion additive
   manufacturing}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{197}},
Month = {{MAY 1}},
Abstract = {{For lightweight cellular structures fabricated via powder bed fusion
   additive manufacturing (PBF-AM), both the material anisotropy and the
   cellular topology design are both important design factors. In this
   work, a direct stiffness matrix-based analytical modeling approach was
   employed for the evaluation of material anisotropy topology effects on
   three representative 3D cellular structures (auxetic, BCC and
   octahedral). The established models were verified via experimentation
   with samples fabricated by EB-PBF using Ti6Al4V as material, using the
   material anisotropy information established experimentally using single
   struts with different build orientations (0?, 15?, 30?, 45?, 60?, 75?
   and 90?). The predicted mechanical properties of the Ti6Al4V cellular
   structures showed good agreement with experimental results. It was shown
   that both the strength and elastic modulus anisotropy of the materials
   affect the strength of the cellular structures, which must be determined
   based on the topology design. In addition, the material
   anisotropy-topology effects on cellular structures of varying cellular
   pattern sizes were also investigated in order to quantify the pattern
   size effects. It was found that the pattern size effects and the
   material anisotropy effects can be decoupled during the design of the
   mechanical properties of these cellular structures.}},

Title = {{Chronic musculoskeletal pain and occupational aspects among Brazilian
   teachers}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND ERGONOMICS}},
Abstract = {{Objectives. This study aimed to determine the association between
   working conditions and chronic musculoskeletal pain (CMP) in regions of
   the body in teachers. Methods. A cross-sectional study was performed
   with 958 teachers from Brazil. Outcomes were chronic pain in the upper
   limbs, lower back and lower limbs. Independent variables were
   characteristics and perceptions about the work. Poisson regression
   models were adjusted by socio-demographic, lifestyle and co-morbidity
   variables. Results. After adjustments, strong associations were observed
   between a negative perception regarding writing on the board and pain in
   the upper limbs (prevalence ratio {[}PR] = 4.65; 95\% confidence
   interval {[}CI] {[}2.02, 10.70]) and lower back pain (PR = 2.10; 95\% CI
   {[}1.06, 4.15]) and between a negative perception of standing duration
   and pain in the lower limbs (PR = 3.98; 95\% CI {[}1.54, 10.26]).
   Additionally, the number of workplaces, number of students and
   conditions for carrying teaching material were associated with pain in
   the upper limbs. Time in the profession and a negative perception of
   work-life balance were associated with pain in the lower limbs.
   Conclusions. Different work conditions were associated with CMP in
   different body regions. Policies to improve teachers' working
   conditions, such as providing furniture that meets teachers' ergonomic
   needs, are needed to reduce CMP.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED MECHANICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{88}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 1}},
Abstract = {{The development of multi-stable structural forms has attracted
   considerable attention in the design of architected multi-materials,
   metamaterials, and morphing structures, as a result of some unusual
   properties such as negative stiffness and, possibly, negative Poisson's
   ratio. Multi-stability is achieved through a morphological change of
   shape upon loading, and in doing so multi-stable structures undergo
   transitions from one equilibrium state to another. This paper
   investigates the structural performance of the negative stiffness
   honeycomb (NSH) metamaterials made of double curved beams which are
   emerging in various applications such as sensors, actuators, and
   lightweight impact protective structures with structural tunability and
   recoverability. An analytical treatment is pursued using the
   Euler-Lagrange theorem and the stability of the honeycomb has been
   studied. Based on a static analysis of the nonlinear elastic system, the
   developed tangent stiffness matrix and ensuing deformation curve were
   assessed through multiple phases of deformation. The closed-form
   solution was in good agreement with the numerical finite element (FE)
   model at different bistability ratios. It was shown that the bistability
   ratio had a pronounced effect on the overall response of the honeycomb
   and the desired negativity in the stiffness matrix could be achieved
   with high bistability ratios.}},

Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},

Abstract = {{Polymer-based sandwich composites have found increasing applications in
   the marine industry, where they are at an ever-increasing risk of
   encountering high-intensity underwater (UNDEX) or in air (AIREX)
   explosive loading. This review presents the current state of the art in
   achieving adequate blast mitigation, employing polymeric composites. An
   attempt has been made to highlight the differences in loading mechanisms
   between AIREX and UNDEX and segregate the mechanisms through which
   polymers can mitigate these two loading modes. This understanding
   facilitates the development of a tailored design approach to blast
   mitigation. Furthermore, recent blast mitigation research related to
   composite sandwich architecture is discussed in detail, focusing on
   various components' effect on mitigation performance. Finally,
   additively manufactured applications, auxetics, and other foam
   metamaterial constructions are also presented in relation to the
   mitigation effort. The recent interest in such materials for use as the
   core in polymeric sandwich construction against blast loading is covered
   cohesively with the rest of the discussion.}},

Title = {{A finite strain non-parametric hyperelastic extension of the classical
   phenomenological theory for orthotropic compressible composites}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITES PART B-ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{212}},
Month = {{MAY 1}},
Abstract = {{The phenomenological linear theory of orthotropic compressible materials
   is employed systematically in the engineering and scientific analysis of
   a large scope of bulk and composite materials. However, at finite
   elastic strains, multiscale and fiber-based parametric models are
   typically employed, which material parameters are fitted to macroscopic
   experimental data using optimization procedures. Phenomenological
   extensions of the linear theory capable of effectively modelling such a
   large scope of materials are not available. What we present in this work
   is a simple extension of the linear theory to finite strains such that
   at every deformation level, the infinitesimal theory is fully recovered.
   The model is based in non-parametric spline complementary energies
   employing an energy decomposition compatible with the classical
   infinitesimal expression at all strain levels. No material parameter is
   explicitly involved because the spline-based stress energies are
   numerically computed (not fitted) directly from experimental data. We
   show the applicability of the model to capture (1) the behavior of
   orthotropic bimodulus materials consistent with hyperelasticity (a novel
   formulation also presented herein), (2) orthotropic auxetic foams, and
   (3) composites at finite strains.}},

   finite element models. Derived analytical expressions of this work can
   be used to model the classical cell. Using this feature, validation of
   analytical and numerical models of this work is also provided with a
   classical cell?s experimental works reported in the literature. In the
   linear region, both the analytical and the finite element models match
   very closely with the literature experiments. Because of the highly
   non-linearity of the re-entrant structures, after the linear
   examination, this work was expanded to model the non-linear behaviour of
   both the classical and new cells numerically. Literature experiments
   also verify the non-linear finite element models of this work in means
   of the classical re-entrant cell?s results. Detailed design graphs are
   given for tuning the rigidity and negative Poisson?s ratios. The
   presented new design in this paper grants an extra rigidity while
   providing the same negative Poisson?s ratios with those of the classical
   cells.}},

Title = {{Engineered bi-material lattices with thermo-mechanical programmability}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{263}},
Month = {{MAY 1}},
Abstract = {{Lightweight meta-structures can reveal combinations of properties that
   do not occur in conventional structures. In this paper, a 2D bi-material
   unit cell is proposed based on a re-entrant architecture. Two 3D unit
   cells, socalled star and cubic architectures, are then constructed using
   the proposed 2D unit cell. Finally, lattice-based unit cells are
   periodically arranged to develop a meta-structure. The thermo-mechanical
   functionalities of the developed meta-lattices can be programmed by
   tailoring either architectural parameters (i.e., strut length, diameter,
   shape, and orientation) or the material combination of struts. The
   influence of the architectural parameters and material combinations on
   the effective elastic stiffness, Poisson's ratio (PR), and coefficient
   of thermal expansion (CTE) is systematically investigated. A finite
   element (FE) model is established to perform a goal-driven
   multi-objective optimization and to attain an uncommon combination of PR
   and CTE (e.g. negative PR up to ?1.8 or near-zero CTE) with
   uncompromised stiffness. Despite the complicated design (many struts are
   diagonal with respect to the printing bed), the low-cost additive
   manufacturing process (i.e., fused filament fabrication) parameters are
   optimized to fabricate a selected number of bi-material meta-lattices
   with a reasonable time and quality. By employing the FE model, the
   optimized architectural parameters are determined for a series of
   applied engineering applications such as structurally robust aerospace
   structures, energy absorbable structural elements, and shape
   transforming structures. The developed lightweight meta-lattices with
   tunable thermo-mechanical properties can offer the material selection
   charts with more economical material options for engineering
   applications such as antennas and precision instruments.}},

Title = {{Racial Disparities in Sexual Assault Characteristics and Mental Health
   Care After Sexual Assault Medical Forensic Exams}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF WOMENS HEALTH}},
Abstract = {{Background: Sexual assault (SA) is common, but Black individuals might
   be at higher risk of SA and negative health sequalae. Racial differences
   in SA characteristics and health care utilization after SA are largely
   unknown.
   Materials and Methods: We reviewed medical records of 690 individuals
   (23.9\% Black; 93.6\% women) who received a SA medical forensic exam
   (SAMFE) at a southeastern U.S. hospital. We examined bivariate racial
   differences in SA characteristics and used zero-inflated Poisson
   regressions to estimate racial differences in mental health outpatient
   visits at the SAMFE hospital.
   Results: Among survivors of SA, Black survivors were more likely than
   White survivors to have been victimized by an intimate partner (odds
   ratio {[}OR] = 1.77, confidence interval {[}95\% CI] = 1.02-3.07) and
   they had more post-SA outpatient mental health visits at the SAMFE
   hospital (incidence rate ratio {[}IRR] = 2.05, 95\% CI = 1.70-2.47).
   Black survivors were less likely to report alcohol or drug use before
   the SA (OR = 0.42, 95\% CI = 0.28-0.62). In multivariable models, Black
   survivors trended toward more mental health visits than White survivors
   (IRR = 1.63, 95\% CI = 0.82-2.44), but intimate partner violence (IPV)
   significantly moderated that association (IRR = 0.01, 95\%CI = <=
   0.001-0.03). Black survivors assaulted by an intimate partner were less
   likely to access mental health care than White IPV survivors.
   Conclusions: The hospital setting of a SAMFE could be a unique
   opportunity to serve Black survivors and reduce racial disparities in
   mental health sequelae, but additional support will be needed for Black
   survivors experiencing IPV. An intersectional, reproductive justice
   framework has the potential to address these challenges.}},

Title = {{Rock Physical Model and AVO Patterns for the Mud-Rich Source Rock}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{APR 22}},
Abstract = {{Rock physical model and amplitude variation with offset (AVO) patterns
   considering the content of organic matter and the composition of
   minerals have a wider significance for guiding the identification and
   prediction of the mud-rich source rock. A rock physical model is
   proposed for describing the elastic properties of kerogen in different
   maturity stages. The proposed rock physical model builds an intrinsic
   connection between the elastic properties and physical parameters of the
   mud-rich source rock, thereby providing a theoretical basis for a
   seismic inversion and a seismic forward modeling. To overcome the
   limitations of laboratory measurement, a combination-four-parameter
   regression (CFPR) method is further proposed to estimate the continuous
   total organic carbon (TOC) values for the verification and analysis of
   the rock physical model. The modeling results reveal that the P-wave
   velocity and P-wave impedance will decrease with an increase in TOC, and
   the Poisson ratio and Poisson impedance will increase as the mud content
   increases, which are consistent with the conclusions of the cross plot
   using the actual well data. Based on the proposed rock physical model,
   the seismic responses of the mud-rich source rock are further modeled.
   The synthetic seismic records are consistent with the well-side seismic
   records, the top reflection of the mud-rich source rock behaves as a
   stronger negative event dimming with an incident angle corresponding to
   a class IV AVO pattern, and the bottom reflection exhibits a class I AVO
   anomaly. In addition, a two-layer model is constructed to analyze an
   effect of the TOC content and mud content on the AVO characteristics.
   The results indicate that increasing the TOC content and mud content
   will significantly increase the interceptions and slightly change the
   gradients of the P-P reflection coefficients. These results help to
   guide the identification and evaluation of the mud-rich source rock.}},

Abstract = {{Small-scale soft-bodied machines that respond to externally applied
   magnetic field have attracted wide research interest because of their
   unique capabilities and promising potential in a variety of fields,
   especially for biomedical applications. When the size of such machines
   approach the sub-millimeter scale, their designs and functionalities are
   severely constrained by the available fabrication methods, which only
   work with limited materials, geometries, and magnetization profiles. To
   free such constraints, here, we propose a bottom-up assembly-based 3D
   microfabri-cation approach to create complex 3D miniature wireless
   magnetic soft machines at the milli-and sub-millimeter scale with
   arbitrary multimaterial compositions, arbitrary 3D geometries, and
   arbitrary programmable 3D magne-tization profiles at high spatial
   resolution. This approach helps us concurrently realize diverse
   characteristics on the machines, including programmable shape morphing,
   negative Poisson's ratio, complex stiffness distribution, directional
   joint bending, and remagnetization for shape reconfiguration. It
   enlarges the design space and en-ables biomedical device-related
   functionalities that are previously difficult to achieve, including
   peristaltic pump -ing of biological fluids and transport of solid
   objects, active targeted cargo transport and delivery, liquid biopsy,
   and reversible surface anchoring in tortuous tubular environments
   withstanding fluid flows, all at the sub-millimeter scale. This work
   improves the achievable complexity of 3D magnetic soft machines and
   boosts their future capa-bilities for applications in robotics and

Abstract = {{Objectives
   With the purpose of reducing the well-known negative impact of late
   presentation (LP) on people living with HIV (PLWH), guidelines on early
   HIV diagnosis were published in 2014 in Spain, but since then no data on
   LP prevalence have been published. To estimate prevalence and risk
   factors of LP and to evaluate their impact on the development of
   clinical outcomes in the Cohort of the Spanish HIV/AIDS Research Network
   (CoRIS) during 2004-2018.
   Methods
   CoRIS is an open prospective multicenter cohort of PLWH, adults, naive
   to ART at entry. LP was defined as HIV diagnosis with CD4 count <= 350
   cells/mu L or an AIDS defining event (ADE). Multivariable Poisson
   regression models were used to estimate both prevalence ratios (PR) for
   the association of potential risk factors with LP and Incidence rate
   ratios (IRRs) for its impact on the development of the composite
   endpoint (first ADE, first serious non-AIDS event {[}SNAE] or overall
   mortality).
   Results
   14,876 individuals were included. Overall, LP prevalence in 2004-2018
   was 44.6\%. Risk factors for LP included older age, having been infected
   through injection drug use or heterosexual intercourse, low educational
   level and originating from non-European countries. LP was associated
   with an increased risk of the composite endpoint (IRR: 1.34; 95\%CI
   1.20, 1.50), ADE (1.39; 1.18, 1.64), SNAE (1.22; 1.01, 1.47) and
   mortality (1.71; 1.41, 2.08).
   Conclusions
   LP remains a health problem in Spain, mainly among certain populations,
   and is associated with greater morbidity and mortality. Public policies
   should be implemented to expand screening and early diagnosis of HIV
   infection, for a focus on those at greatest risk of LP.}},

Abstract = {{Graphene assembly, e.g. graphene aerogel, is an open-cell porous
   material with randomly distributed graphene sheets and voids. In this
   study, we propose a method to generate the 3D graphene assembly models
   which can reasonably display the structural properties of graphene
   aerogel. Our 3D graphene assembly models are firstly established by a
   Voronoi construction method that is usually used to build the
   polycrystalline materials. The optimization and relaxation are then
   conducted to obtain 3D graphene assembly with proper structures by using
   molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. In order to explore the mechanical
   properties of graphene assembly, the tensile and compressive tests are
   carried out by MD simulations. The results show that the 3D graphene
   assembly reveals auxetic behavior under compression while it has
   positive Poisson's ratio under tension. We also find that the Poisson's
   ratios are specifically related to the grain sizes and mass densities.
   Furthermore, from our simulation the stress-strain relations for the
   compressive tests and tensile tests are also obtained. The compressive
   Young's modulus, tensile Young's modulus, compressive strength and
   tensile strength are found to follow the power law relation to the mass
   density with the exponential factors of 2.31756, 2.33005, 2.6243 and
   1.5084, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{The study of soft deployable structures is an emergent field that is
   highly correlated with metamaterial design, soft robotics, medical
   devices, etc. This paper studies a novel two-dimensional (2D) soft
   deployable structure that has a fractal layout with hierarchically
   coupled thin walls, which buckles upon actuation and deforms into a
   ``peacock tail{''} pattern that is over 10 fold its original dimension.
   Large deflection theory and finite-element (FE) modeling are used to
   characterize its mechanical performance and to investigate its potential
   application in multiple fields. Further, 2D FE homogenization is
   implemented to extend the novel design into an active plane lattice
   metamaterial, on which parametric studies are carried out to explore its
   effective stiffness and large strain properties. The results show that,
   besides excellent deformability, the ``peacock tail{''} soft deployable
   structure and its lattice metamaterial derivates exhibit intriguing
   properties such as multi-stiffening, strong anisotropy, zero/negative
   Poisson's ratio, a unique post-buckling collapse mechanism, etc.
   Three-dimensional generalization of the fractal compliant system is
   modeled to elaborate on the practical use of the structures. This paper
   aims to enrich the spectrum of soft deployable structures, shedding
   light on the research of novel soft robots, hierarchical structures, and
   metamaterials.}},

Abstract = {{By performing first-principles calculations, a new two-dimensional (2D)
   boron nitride (th-BN) with perfectly ordered arrangements of tetragonal
   and hexagonal rings is predicted to be energetically, dynamically,
   thermally, and mechanically stable. The unique structure endows th-BN
   with anisotropic mechanical, electronic, and optical properties.
   Remarkably, th-BN exhibits exceptional mechanical properties such as
   high in-plane stiffness and sign-tunable Poisson's ratio (PR). The PR of
   th-BN gradually decreases with the increase of axial strain and even
   becomes negative at a very small strain (similar to 2\%), which is
   novel, thereby offering the ability to become non-auxetic, auxetic, and
   partially auxetic 2D nanomaterials depending on the strain rate and
   direction. The structure can withstand tensile strain as large as 36\%,
   and shows ultrahigh ideal strength that can even outperform graphene and
   hexagonal BN. The th-BN is a natural 2D semiconductor with an indirect
   wide band gap of 4.49 eV. The band gap can be tuned by applying lattice
   strain and hydrogenation. The full hydrogenated th-BN exhibits an
   indirect-to-direct band gap transition. The th-BN shows high optical
   absorption in the ultraviolet region. The optical absorption spectrum is
   highly direction-dependent and tunable by strain, suitable for
   high-performance optoelectronic device applications. Furthermore, th-BN
   can be stacked into two different configurations, and are dynamically
   stable and exhibit exotic electronic properties. The desirable direct
   band gap and anisotropic effective mass of the th-C/th-BN
   heterostructure suggest that th-BN can be a suitable substrate for
   tetrahexcarbon.}},

Abstract = {{Background Increased understanding of whether individuals who have
   recovered from COVID-19 are protected from future SARS-CoV-2 infection
   is an urgent requirement. We aimed to investigate whether antibodies
   against SARS-CoV-2 were associated with a decreased risk of symptomatic
   and asymptomatic reinfection.
   Methods A large, multicentre, prospective cohort study was done, with
   participants recruited from publicly funded hospitals in all regions of
   England. All health-care workers, support staff, and administrative
   staff working at hospitals who could remain engaged in follow-up for 12
   months were eligible to join The SARS-CoV-2 Immunity and Reinfection
   Evaluation study. Participants were excluded if they had no PCR tests
   after enrolment, enrolled after Dec 31, 2020, or had insufficient PCR
   and antibody data for cohort assignment. Participants attended regular
   SARS-CoV-2 PCR and antibody testing (every 2-4 weeks) and completed
   questionnaires every 2 weeks on symptoms and exposures. At enrolment,
   participants were assigned to either the positive cohort (antibody
   positive, or previous positive PCR or antibody test) or negative cohort
   (antibody negative, no previous positive PCR or antibody test). The
   primary outcome was a reinfection in the positive cohort or a primary
   infection in the negative cohort, determined by PCR tests. Potential
   reinfections were clinically reviewed and classified according to case
   definitions (confirmed, probable, or possible) and symptom-status,
   depending on the hierarchy of evidence. Primary infections in the
   negative cohort were defined as a first positive PCR test and
   seroconversions were excluded when not associated with a positive PCR
   test. A proportional hazards frailty model using a Poisson distribution
   was used to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRR) to compare infection
   rates in the two cohorts.
   Findings From June 18, 2020, to Dec 31, 2020, 30 625 participants were
   enrolled into the study. 51 participants withdrew from the study, 4913
   were excluded, and 25 661 participants (with linked data on antibody and
   PCR testing) were included in the analysis. Data were extracted from all
   sources on Feb 5, 2021, and include data up to and including Jan 11,
   2021. 155 infections were detected in the baseline positive cohort of
   8278 participants, collectively contributing 2 047113 person-days of
   follow-up. This compares with 1704 new PCR positive infections in the
   negative cohort of 17 383 participants, contributing 2 971 436
   person-days of follow-up. The incidence density was 7.6 reinfections per
   100 000 person-days in the positive cohort, compared with 57.3 primary
   infections per 100 000 person-days in the negative cohort, between June,
   2020, and January, 2021. The adjusted IRR was 0.159 for all reinfections
   (95\% CI 0.13-0.19) compared with PCR-confirmed primary infections. The
   median interval between primary infection and reinfection was more than
   200 days.
   Interpretation A previous history of SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated
   with an 84\% lower risk of infection, with median protective effect
   observed 7 months following primary infection. This time period is the
   minimum probable effect because seroconversions were not included. This
   study shows that previous infection with SARS-CoV-2 induces effective
   immunity to future infections in most individuals. Copyright Crown

Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},

Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{The engineering materials and structures, which usually suffer both
   temperature variation and mechanical loading, motivate the urgent need
   of the multifunctional metamaterials with simultaneously programmable
   coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) and Poisson's ratio (PR).
   Whereas, the current 3D metamaterials can not continuously program the
   CTE and PR. Herein, a class of 3D metamaterial is originally devised by
   an exclusive geometrical methodology. The explicit expressions of the
   CTE and PR are theoretically established and are also verified by the
   numerical modeling. The analysis confirms that the CTE can be widely
   tailored by varying the geometrical parameters and selection of the
   constituents. Besides, the controllable PR can be also easily obtained
   by adjusting the geometrical parameters. Moreover, the devised 3D
   metamaterial gives paired tailorable CTE and controllable PR, including
   especially negative CTE + negative PR. An arrangement rule is developed
   to construct a series of hierarchical cells which can program CTE and PR
   in multi principle axes and can be periodically arrayed for obtaining
   the 3D cellular metamaterials. The devised 3D metamaterials are capable
   of realizing the widely coupled programmability of both CTE and PR and
   provide a strategy of shape morphing stimulated both by temperature
   variation and mechanical loading.}},

Abstract = {{Ideally, orthopedic implants would last for the entire lifetime of the
   patient. Unfortunately, they rarely do. Critically sized defects are a
   common sight in the revision of acetabular cups, and rather difficult to
   treat. The permanent deformation of lattice structures can be used to
   create shape-morphing implants that would fill up the defect site, and
   thereby restore the physiological loading conditions. Bending-dominated
   structures were incorporated in the porous outer layer of the
   space-filling meta-implants for their considerable lateral expansion in
   response to axial compression. A functionally graded density offered
   structural integrity at the joint while enhancing the deformability at
   the bone-implant interface. With the use of a more ductile metal, CP-Ti,
   these meta-implants could be deformed without strut failure.
   The unprecedented properties of meta-biomaterials could pave the way for
   the development of lifelasting orthopedic implants. Here, we used
   non-auxetic meta-biomaterials to address the shortcomings of the current
   treatment options in acetabular revision surgery. Due to the severe bone
   deficiencies and poor bone quality, it can be very challenging to
   acquire adequate initial implant stability and long-term fixation. More
   advanced treatments, such as patient-specific implants, do guarantee the
   initial stability, but are formidably expensive and may eventually fail
   due to stress shielding. We, therefore, developed meta-implants
   furnished with a deformable porous outer layer. Upon implantation, this
   layer plastically deforms into the defects, thereby improving the
   initial stability and homogeneously stimulating the surrounding bone. We
   first studied the space-filling behavior of additively manufactured pure
   titanium lattices, based on six different unit cells, in a compression
   test complemented with full-field strain measurements. The diamond,
   body-centered cubic, and rhombic dodecahedron unit cells were eventually
   selected for the design of the deformable porous outer layer. Each
   design came in three different relative density profiles, namely maximum
   (MAX), functionally graded (FG), and minimum (MIN). After their
   compression in bone-mimicking molds with simulated acetabular defects,
   the space-filling behavior of the implants was evaluated using
   load-displacement curves, micro-CT images, and 3D reconstructions. The
   meta-implants with an FG diamond infill exhibited the most promising
   space-filling behavior. However, the required push-in forces exceed the
   impact forces currently applied in surgery. Future research should,
   therefore, focus on design optimization, to improve the space-filling
   behavior and to facilitate the implantation process for orthopedic
   surgeons.}},

Title = {{Modeling of the effect of local material imperfection to the structural
   mechanical property variability of 2D fi nite -size cellular structures}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{262}},
Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{Understanding the effect of local material property fluctuation on the
   overall structural properties of cellular structures is not only
   important for more effective designs, but also critical for their
   adoption in load bearing applications. In this work, an analytical
   modeling approach based on direct stiffness method was adopted, which
   allows for the implementation of heterogeneous material imperfection at
   full-scale cellular structure level. Three representative 2D cellular
   designs including auxetic, diamond and triangular structures were
   modeled and analyzed. The material property imperfection was represented
   by 3 levels of variabilities (2\%, 5\% and 10\%) for both elastic
   modulus and strength, defined at local cellular element level.
   Experimental verification using Ti6Al4V cellular structures fabricated
   via laser powder bed fusion additive manufacturing demonstrated the
   potential of the established model in providing accurate predictions to
   the mechanical property variability of the cellular structures. In
   addition, the results also revealed new insights into the
   topology-material imperfection coupling relationships for the cellular
   structures. The auxetic structures exhibit the lowest material
   imperfection tolerance, whereas the stretching-dominated triangular
   structures exhibit the highest material imperfection sensitivity. The
   contribution of elastic modulus and ultimate strength imperfections at
   material level to the overall structural performance were established.
   Ultimately, this work could help ?re-establishing? the fundamental
   understanding of design factors for finite-size cellular structures with
   imperfect material properties.}},

   shape memory chiral-lattice metamaterials}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{262}},
Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{Chiral-lattice metamaterials with unique mechanical, optical, electrical
   and magnetic properties have been widely used in many engineering
   applications, such as chiral recognition and separation, stealth
   materials and devices, as well as biological sensors. Various design
   strategies have been developed to obtain chiral-lattice metamaterials
   with different mechanical properties. The fast grown design strategies
   that can provide a variety of Poisson?s ratios and elastic moduli have
   brought new opportunities to emerging biomedical appli-cations. In this
   study, hexagonal and tetragonal chiral-lattice metamaterials with
   positive and negative Poisson?s ratios were designed. The design
   strategy was based on a network structure with a periodic lattice
   topology, which was formed by three outer rings connected to the central
   ring via ligaments. The wide appli-cations of this type of metamaterial
   were investigated via experiments and finite-element analysis.
   Demonstrative examples and the shape-memory effect (SME) suggest that
   the chiral-lattice structure has great potential in developing
   programmable metamaterials. The findings of this study provide essential
   guidance for the design of chiral network structures with the desired
   mechanical properties.}},

Abstract = {{The roller honeycomb feeding roller (RHFR) of forest harvester in
   logging was raised for reducing damage to logs. The equivalent
   relationship of roller double V-wings honeycomb (RDWH) were proposed and
   analytically derived in the mass, platform stress and elastic modulus.
   The finite element models of RDWH with various cell densities under the
   equivalent relation were established. The mechanical properties, energy
   absorption characteristics, impact response, structural stability,
   structure efficiency and improvement performance efficiency of RDWH
   under compression impact were investigated in comparison with roller
   hexagonal honeycomb (RHH). The RDWHs with equivalent relationship had
   approximate mechanical properties under unit compression displacement.
   The RDWH, benefiting from the NPR enhancement phenomenon in deformation,
   possessed about multiple times of mechanical properties and energy
   absorption efficiency than RHH. The performance efficiency of RDWH
   related to cell densities and cell layers in ``PVP{''} and ``Bunching
   Phase{''} trend. The RHFR exceeded that of the steel feeding roller
   (SFR) with about 2 times in maximum contact area under the corresponding
   contact force. The phenomenon of ``sequential increment{''} and ``uprush

   22MnB5 tubes}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{262}},
Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{This paper describes the effects of various laser patterns on
   as-received 22MnB5 tubes for selective local strengthening. It has been
   confirmed that strengthened cross-sectional areas, perpendicular to the
   axial direction by laser patterning, and uniform strength distributions
   between the as-received and strengthened area can induce the concertina
   mode under axial crushing. The auxetic and helical laser patterns
   demonstrated the highest first peaks in the reaction force and
   substantial energy absorption due to progressive folding, followed by
   the concertina mode. Considering the fabrication efficiency, the helical
   pattern is recommended because it can be easily implemented. To optimize
   the helical pattern design, the specific pitch size should be based on
   the line length of a single fold along the neutral surface when the
   as-received tube collapses. Depending on the geometrical dimensions of
   the tube, this can increase the number of folds and maximise energy
   absorption by up to 32.2\% during axial crushing.}},

Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2021}},

Abstract = {{The negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) structures exhibit some unusual but
   highly useful mechanical properties. In comparison to two-dimensional
   (2D) NPR structures, less attention has been paid to the studies on
   threedimensional structures due to the complex manufacturing process. In
   this paper, based on the twodimensional nonconvex hexagonal cell, a
   novel three-dimensional (3D) NPR energy-absorbing structure is proposed.
   According to the beam theory, the equivalent Young's modulus and
   Poisson's ratio are deduced. Subsequently, numerous finite element (FE)
   simulations and compression tests were performed and a good agreement
   was observed among the theoretical results, the numerical simulations,
   and the experimental results. Moreover, a typical fuselage section of
   aircraft during a crash landing was considered and the fuselage section
   with the 3D NPR structure presented in this work showed better energy
   absorption capacity than the one without the 3D NPR structure.}},

Abstract = {{The stability, electronic and phonon structures, mechanical and

Journal = {{CARBON}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{174}},
Pages = {{368-381}},
Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{We report a series of novel two-dimensional (2D) group-IV carbides with
   perfectly ordered arrangement of tetragons and hexagons. The 2D tetrahex
   carbides possess robust energetic, dynamical, thermal, and mechanical
   stabilities. They have strong anisotropic mechanical, electronic, and
   optical properties. The negative Poisson's ratio (PR) in the 2D tetrahex
   carbides emerges by small tensile strain (2-5\%). The feature of
   sign-tunable PR enables them to be non-auxetic, auxetic, and
   partially-auxetic nanomaterials. They exhibit ultrahigh ideal strength
   that can even outperform graphene. They are natural semiconductors with
   direct and indirect band gaps which can be tuned by strain engineering.
   Beyond the binary carbides, the ternary alloying of group-IV elements
   further provides the ability to engineer their structural, mechanical,
   optical, and electronic properties. Excitingly, the alloying offers a
   continuous band gap energy, band edge modulation, and indirect-to-direct
   band gap transition. The 2D tetrahex-carbides exhibit high and
   directionally anisotropic carrier mobility, favorable for the separation
   of photogenerated carriers, and has very good optical absorption
   performance in the visible-light region. The position of band edges in
   the 2D tetrahex carbides fits perfectly the water oxidation and
   reduction potentials. Therefore, the 2D tetrahex carbides have potential
   applications not only in photocatalytic watersplitting but also in
   designing 2D opto-electro-mechanical devices. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Mechanical properties of a hybrid auxetic metamaterial and metastructure
   system}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF REINFORCED PLASTICS AND COMPOSITES}},
Abstract = {{We propose in this work an innovative hybrid auxetic metamaterial with a
   centersymmetric unit cell and tessellation topology similar to the one
   provided by the missing rib configuration. The tessellation proposed is
   applied to different core unit cells (star shape, cross-chiral shape
   with same dimensions, and reentrant). The effects of the geometric
   parameters of the cells on the in-plane mechanical properties of this
   hybrid auxetic metamaterial system are investigated via finite elements
   (FEMs). Representative unit cells (RUCs) with optimal mechanical
   behaviors are identified; those configurations exhibit the larger
   negative Poisson's ratios and enhanced specific moduli. Designs related
   to two groups of auxetic metastructures with cylindric and cubic shapes
   are then developed based on the optimized RUCs along x and y directions.
   The equivalent mechanical performance of these metastructures under
   internal pressure is evaluated from a numerical standpoint. Auxetic
   cylindrical metastructures can be tailored by adjusting the number of
   the optimized RUCs along the circumferential and longitudinal
   directions, together with the geometric parameters of the optimized RUC
   itself. These hybrid auxetic metamaterials and metastructures provide
   the potential for multifunctional applications in biomechanics, flexible
   electronics, and aerospace.}},

Abstract = {{Semi Reentrant structures, which exhibit zero Poisson's ratio and
   monoclastic curvature, are combinations of hexagonal Honeycomb and
   auxetic Reentrant structures. Deflections and strain analysis based on
   the deformation of unit cells were conducted, and four different
   equivalent theories for predicting the elastic modulus and Poison's
   ratio in two in-plane directions were developed by considering different
   mechanisms, including flexural, stretching, hinging and shearing
   deformations, as well as the influence of cell wall thickness. Single
   sidewall and double sidewall were considered for the cell wall
   thickness. The theoretical models of Semi Reentrant structures cell
   could be obtained by assuming that the deformation is a combination of
   deformation for a hexagonal honeycomb cell (with a positive angle) and a
   Reentrant cell (with a negative angle). The effectiveness and accuracy
   of the four theoretical models for Semi Reentrant structures were
   validated by comparing with the corresponding tensile test simulation
   results via the finite element method. It was indicated that the fourth
   theories (T4) were the most accurate, which include the consideration of
   flexural, stretching, hinging, shearing deformations and cell wall
   thickness. The influence of geometrical parameters (inclined arm length
   l, vertical arm length h, angle alpha, angle beta, structure thickness d
   and cell wall thickness t) on the in-plane tensile properties (elastic
   modulus and stiffness) was also analysed in tensile test simulations via
   the finite element method. Comparison of tension results between Semi
   Reentrant, Reentrant and Honeycomb demonstrated that the mechanical
   properties of Semi Reentrant were combinations between the others.}},

Title = {{On the Problematic Case of Product Approximation in Backus Average}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ELASTICITY}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{144}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{55-80}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Elastic anisotropy might be a combined effect of the intrinsic
   anisotropy and the anisotropy induced by thin-layering. The Backus
   average, a useful mathematical tool, allows us to describe such an
   effect quantitatively. The results are meaningful only if the underlying
   physical assumptions are obeyed, such as static equilibrium of the
   material. We focus on the only mathematical assumption of the Backus
   average, namely, product approximation. It states that the average of
   the product of a varying function with a nearly constant function is
   approximately equal to the product of the averages of those functions.
   We analyse particular problematic case for which the aforementioned
   assumption is inaccurate. Furthermore, we focus on the seismological
   context. We examine the inaccuracy's effect on the wave propagation in a
   homogenous medium-obtained using the Backus average-equivalent to thin
   layers. Numerical simulations indicate clearly that the product
   approximation inaccuracy has negligible effect on wave propagation;
   irrespective of layers' symmetries. To give the results a practical
   focus, we show that the problematic case of product approximation is
   strictly related to the negative Poisson's ratio of constituents layers.
   We discuss the laboratory and well-log cases in which such a ratio has
   been noticed. Upon thorough literature review, it occurs that examples
   of so-called auxetic materials (media that have negative Poisson's
   ratio) are not extremely rare exceptions as thought previously. The
   investigation and derivation of Poisson's ratio for materials exhibiting
   symmetry classes up to monoclinic become a significant part of this
   paper. In addition to the main objectives, we also show that the
   averaging of cubic layers results in an equivalent medium with
   tetragonal (not cubic) symmetry. We present concise formulations of
   stability conditions for low symmetry classes, such as trigonal,
   orthotropic, and monoclinic.}},

Title = {{Tunable Negative Poisson's Ratio in Van der Waals Superlattice}},
Journal = {{RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{2021}},
Month = {{APR 10}},
Abstract = {{Negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) materials are functional and mechanical
   metamaterials that shrink (expand) longitudinally after being compressed
   (stretched) laterally. By using first-principles calculations, we found
   that Poisson's ratio can be tuned from near zero to negative by
   different stacking modes in van der Waals (vdW) graphene/hexagonal boron
   nitride (G/h-BN) superlattice. We attribute the NPR effect to the
   interaction of p(z) orbitals between the interfacial layers.
   Furthermore, a parameter calculated by analyzing the electronic band
   structure, namely, distance-dependent hopping integral, is used to
   describe the intensity of this interaction. We believe that this
   mechanism is not only applicable to G/h-BN superlattice but can also
   explain and predict the NPR effect in other vdW layered superlattices.
   Therefore, the NPR phenomenon, which was relatively rare in 3D and 2D
   materials, can be realized in the vdW superlattices by different
   stacking orders. The combinations of tunable NPRs with the excellent
   electrical/optical properties of 2D vdW superlattices will pave a novel
   avenue to a wide range of multifunctional applications.}},

Title = {{Geometrical analysis of auxetic woven fabrics based on foldable geometry}},
Journal = {{TEXTILE RESEARCH JOURNAL}},
Abstract = {{This paper reports a geometrical analysis of auxetic woven fabrics based
   on foldable geometry. Two fabrics having different geometrical
   parameters were first designed and fabricated and then subjected to
   tensile tests in two principal directions. Based on the experimental
   observations of the geometry of one fabric structural unit cell at
   different tensile strains, a geometrical model was first proposed and a
   relationship between the Poisson's ratio and tensile strain was then
   established for each principal direction. Two semi-empirical equations
   are subsequently obtained for both principal directions by fitting the
   established relationships with experimental results. After validation by
   the experimental results of the other fabric, the obtained
   semi-empirical equations were finally used to predict the auxetic
   behavior of the fabric with a given geometrical parameter. The
   calculated and experimental results are found to be in excellent
   agreement with each other. Therefore, the semi-empirical equations
   obtained in this study could be useful in the design and prediction of
   the auxetic behavior of auxetic woven fabrics made with the same type of
   materials and foldable geometry but with different values of geometrical

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors with desirable bandgaps and high

   O-ScN are both direct bandgap semiconductors with the bandgaps of 1.39
   and 2.14 eV, respectively, while H-ScN has a large indirect bandgap of
   3.21 eV. In addition, both M-ScN and H-ScN exhibit ultra-high electron
   mobilities (3.09 x 10(4) cm(2) V-1 s(-1) and 1.22 x 10(4) cm(2) V-1

Abstract = {{Synthetic small diameter vascular grafts frequently fail owing to
   intimal hyperplasia, results from mismatched compliance between the
   vascular graft and native vessels. A vascular graft with a negative
   Poisson's ratio (NPR, materials expand transversely when pulled axially)
   was suggested to enhance compliance. We produced a three-layer tubular
   vascular scaffold with NRP properties. The luminal side consisted of
   nanosized electrospun fibers for endothelial cell (EC) growth. The
   middle layer was an NPR structure created using 3D printing, and the
   outer layer was a microsized electrospun fiber layer for vascular smooth
   muscle cell (VSMC) growth. The developed multi-layer tubular vascular
   scaffold contained NPR value. And the NPR vascular scaffold showed 1.7
   time higher compliance than the PPR scaffold and 3.8 times higher than
   that of commercial polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) vascular graft. In
   addition, the ECs and VSMCs were well survived and proliferated on the
   scaffold during 10 days of culture. From the optimized co-culture
   condition of the VSMCs and ECs that VSMC phenotype changed was
   inhibited, we successfully generated a thin luminal layer, which
   consisted of ECs and the proper thickness of the VSMC layer under the
   ECs. This scaffold may have a potential to replace conventional
   artificial vascular graft by providing enhanced compliance and improved
   cell culture environment.}},

Title = {{The COVID-19 pandemic and new clinical trial activations}},
Journal = {{TRIALS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{APR 8}},
Abstract = {{Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused severe disruptions in care
   for many patients. A key question is whether the landscape of clinical
   research has also changed. Methods In a retrospective cohort study, we
   examined the association of the COVID-19 outbreak with new clinical
   trial activations. Trial data for all interventional and observational
   oncology, cardiovascular, and mental health studies from January 2015
   through September 2020 were obtained from . An interrupted time-series
   analysis with Poisson regression was used.
   Results: We examined 62,252 trial activations. During the initial
   COVID-19 outbreak (February 2020 through May 2020), model-estimated
   monthly trial activations for US-based studies were only 57\% of the
   expected estimate had the pandemic not occurred (relative risk = 0.57,
   95\% CI 0.52 to 0.61, p < .001). For non-US-based studies, the impact of
   the pandemic was less dramatic (relative risk = 0.77, 95\% CI 0.73 to
   0.82, p < .001), resulting in an overall 27\% reduction in the relative
   risk of new trial activations for US-based trials compared to
   non-US-based trials (relative risk ratio = 0.73, 95\% CI 0.67 to 0.81, p
   < .001). Although a rebound occurred in the initial reopening phase
   (June 2020 through September 2020), the rebound was weaker for US-based
   studies compared to non-US-based studies (relative risk ratio = 0.87,
   95\% CI 0.80 to 0.95, p < .001).
   Conclusions: These findings are consistent with the disproportionate
   burden of COVID-19 diagnoses and deaths during the initial phase of the
   pandemic in the USA. Reduced activation of cancer clinical trials will
   likely slow the pace of clinical research and new drug discovery, with
   long-term negative consequences for cancer patients. An important
   question is whether the renewed outbreak period of winter 2020/2021 will
   have a similarly negative impact on the initiation of new clinical
   research studies for non-COVID-19 diseases.}},

Abstract = {{Bioinspired smart materials with synergistic allochroic luminescence and
   complex deformation are expected to play an important role in many areas
   of science and technology. However, it is still challenging to fabricate
   such soft actuators with high programmability that can be manipulated in

   terminally functionalized aggregation-induced emission active
   tetraphenylethene derivative and photochromic spiropyran moieties into
   the networks of liquid crystal elastomers through covalent bonding to
   obtain the synergistic photochromic luminescence and programmable soft
   actuators. Bio-mimic functions and light-induced auxetic
   metamaterial-like devices were shown to be feasible based on the
   combination of assembly and origami-programming strategy. These
   bioinspired devices with synergistic photochromic luminescence and
   complex photodeformation abilities provide an elegant strategy to design
   multi-functional liquid crystal actuators.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the electromechanical coupling of auxetic materials offers
   unique opportunities to enhance the sensitivity of piezoresistive
   sensors. Reports on the auxetic behavior of random fiber networks have
   been relatively scarce due to their less pronounced Poisson's expansions
   than other auxetic designs adapting periodically arranged structures. In
   this study, the auxetic response of hierarchical pulp-carbon nanotube
   networks is tailored through the localized tensional micro-fracture
   initiated by water-printing. The interfacial junctions among multiwalled
   carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and cellulose fibers are disintegrated and
   reorganized to induce the buckling of a wet CNT paper composite (CPC)
   network. The Poisson's ratio of -49.5 is achieved at the water-printed
   region. The resulting piezoresistive properties of CPC sensors exhibit
   high sensitivity (3.3 kPa(-1)) over a wide dynamic range (6-500 000 Pa).
   The novel auxetic behavior of water-printed CPC paves the way for high
   performance and inexpensive wearable devices.}},

Abstract = {{Two dimensional (2D) chalcogenide monolayers have diversified
   applications in optoelectronics, piezotronics, sensors and energy
   harvesting. The group-IV tellurene monolayer is one such emerging
   material in the 2D family owing to its piezoelectric, thermoelectric and
   optoelectronic properties. In this paper, the mechanical and
   piezoelectric properties of 2D tellurene in centrosymmetric beta and
   non-centrosymmetric beta ` phases are investigated using density
   functional theory. beta `-Te has shown a negative Poisson's ratio of
   -0.024 along the zigzag direction. Giant in-plane piezoelectric
   coefficients of -83.89 x 10(-10) C m(-1) and -42.58 x 10(-10) C m(-1)
   are observed for beta `-Te under biaxial and uniaxial strains,
   respectively. The predicted values are remarkably higher, that is 23 and
   12 times the piezoelectric coefficient of a MoS2 monolayer with biaxial
   and uniaxial strain in the zigzag direction, respectively. A large
   thermal expansion coefficient of tellurene is also estimated using quasi
   harmonic approximation. High piezoelectricity combined with exotic
   mechanical and thermal properties makes tellurene a very promising

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional (2D) materials with both auxetic effect and
   ferroelasticity are rare, however, have great application potential in
   next generation microelectromechanical and nanoelectronic devices. Here,
   we report the findings of an extraordinary combination half-auxetic
   effect and ferroelasticity in a single p2mm-type TiSe monolayer by
   performing first-principles calculations. The unique half-auxetic
   effect, namely the material expand laterally under both uniaxial tensile
   strain, and compressive strain, is reported and explained by considering
   both the nearest and the next-nearest interactions. The ferroelasticity
   is stemming from the degeneracy breaking of the 3d-orbitals of Ti atoms
   in a distorted tetrahedron crystal field, or the so-called Jahn-Teller
   effect. The results provide a guideline for the future design of novel
   2D multiple functional materials at the nanoscale.}},

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) layered materials with
   orthorhombic symmetry and distinct planar crystallographic lattices down
   to the monolayer limit, can potentially display in-plane anisotropy and
   diverse functionalities arising from their structural anisotropy.
   Typically, group-IV monopnictides (SiP, SiAs, GeP and GeAs) and
   dipnictides (SiP2, SiAs2, GeP2 and GeAs2) are two prototypical types of
   synthetic vdW layered materials characterized by orthorhombic symmetry
   and in-plane anisotropy in their 2D layered structural forms. In the
   current work, in order to provide deep insights into the in-plane
   anisotropic properties and especially to explore the new functionalities
   associated with in-plane anisotropy that have not yet been uncovered
   experimentally so far, we perform first-principles calculations to
   systematically investigate the structural, mechanical, electronic and
   optical properties, and electromechanical responses for 2D group-IV
   monopnictide AB and dipnictide AB(2) (A = Si and Ge, B = P and As)
   monolayers. Based on our calculations, both 2D monopnictide and
   dipnictide monolayers are predicted to exhibit in-plane anisotropy in
   their mechanical, electronic and optical absorption properties,
   including distinct elastic constants, Young's moduli, effective carrier
   masses and optical absorption along the two planar directions.
   Especially, owing to the unique 2D puckered crystal structure composed
   of corner-sharing AB(4) tetrahedrons, AB(2) monolayers can exhibit an
   extraordinarily large in-plane negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) of up to
   -0.32, making these group-IV dipnictides rare 2D auxetic materials.
   Moreover, compared to the centrosymmetric AB monopnictides, 2D AB(2)
   monolayers are characterized by acentric symmetry, where non-zero
   electric polarization can be obtained along one of the planar axes. Such
   a structural polarity can lead to a sizable negative longitudinal
   piezoelectric coefficient d(33) as large as -11.84 pC N-1. These
   intriguing properties arise from the in-plane anisotropy making 2D
   group-IV dipnictides of great promise for applications such as nanoscale
   auxetic sensors and low dimensional electromechanical devices.}},

Abstract = {{Materials with a negative Poisson's ratio, also known as auxetics, have
   attracted a lot attention as they have shown innovation potential in
   applications for energy damping, modern fasteners, biomedical implants,
   piezoelectric sensors, and soft actuators. In this study, we introduce
   different patterns of graded distribution of unit cells with positive
   and negative Poisson's ratio in tubular configurations. Seven types of
   patterns are programmed into the fabric of the metamaterial to create
   desired shape changes upon applying far-field external loads. Two of the
   patterns demonstrate near-zero Poisson's ratio even at axial strains as
   high as 44\%. Other pattern distributions convert the initially
   cylindrical shape of the tubes to vase, barrel, hourglass,
   nonsymmetrical vase, and nonsymmetrical hourglass geometries. The
   experimental Poisson's ratio values for the linear
   negative-to-positive-to-negative gradient (resulting in hourglass shape)
   and linear positive-to-negative-to-positive gradient (resulting in
   barrel shape) cases are +0.53 and -0.47, respectively. The measured
   Poisson's ratio values at tube level are in good accordance with the
   analytical values of +0.5 and -0.5. Benefits of the proposed designs in
   applications such as action-at-a-distance actuators and wrinkle-free
   jointless hinges in both 3D and 2D configurations are demonstrated.}},

   ratio structures: Concave hexagon, star shape, and their combination}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{859}},
Month = {{APR 5}},
Abstract = {{Negative Poisson's ratio structure is one of the international research
   hotspots, but there are still few reports on negative Poisson's ratio
   combination structure. In this paper, two single cell structures
   (concave hexagonal structure and star shape structure) with connection
   beam and three nine-grid combination structures (X-type, H-type,
   Sd-type) were designed. To obtain the negative Poisson's ratio
   mechanics, based on the Euler beam theory, the theoretical calculation
   method of single cell structure was established. By comparing the
   critical force, the sequence of bending and stretching/compression
   deformation was discussed. The mechanical properties of multi-cell
   structures were predicted by adopting the mixed law. The results show
   that the main deformation of the designed structures are bending, and
   the instability buckling occurs during compression. It is proved that
   the mechanical properties of multi-cell structures can be characterized
   by its single cell structure. The combination structure integrates the
   negative Poisson's ratio mechanical properties of different single cell
   structures. An important application is that the mechanical properties
   of combination structures can be obtained by changing the proportion of
   single cell structures without changing the structure size. (C) 2020

Title = {{Predicting an ideal 2D carbon nanostructure with negative Poisson's
   ratio from first principles: implications for nanomechanical devices}},
Journal = {{CARBON LETTERS}},
Abstract = {{The intrinsic negative Poisson's ratio effect at the level of molecule
   in two-dimensional nanomaterials, especially in the perfect planar
   nanostructures with a single atom thickness, is really rare and has
   attracted a lot of research interests because of its unique mechanical
   properties in the nanoscale and extensive applications in mechanical
   nanodevices. In this work, a novel ideal planar carbon nanostructure
   (PCNS) framework with a single atom thickness composed by carbon and
   hydrogen atoms is proposed and studied by means of first-principles
   density functional calculation. The results showed that the PCNS is,
   simultaneously, of excellent thermodynamic, molecular dynamic and
   mechanical stabilities. In addition, the electronic structure,
   mechanical characters, and optical-electronic characteristics of PCNS
   are also explored. Excitedly, it is found that the PCNS has a
   significant negative Poisson's ratio effect in plane, and the maximum
   value of Poisson's ratio is as high as - 2.094. Meanwhile, the material
   has a wide range of elastic mechanics. Moreover, the PCNS presents an
   ideal UV absorption performance. It is hoped that this work could be a
   useful structural design strategy for the development of the ideal 2D
   carbon-based nanomechanical devices with the intrinsic negative
   Poisson's ratio effect and other electronic functions.

Abstract = {{Background: Despite a clear association seen in congenitally infected
   children, the effect of postnatal cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection during
   early childhood on cognitive development has not yet been determined.
   Methods: CMV-infection status was obtained based on serological
   measurements when children were 7 years old. Using population-based
   longitudinal data, we employed multivariate Poisson regression with a
   robust variance estimator to characterize the relationship between
   childhood CMV infection and adverse neurocognitive outcomes in children.
   Suboptimal neurocognitive outcomes were compared between CMV-positive
   and CMV-negative children using various cognitive assessments from 8 to
   15 years of age. Children were evaluated on the cognitive domains of
   language, reading, memory and general intelligence, with a suboptimal
   score being >2 standard deviations lower than the mean score.
   Approximate Bayes factor (ABF) analysis was used to determine the level
   of evidence for the observed associations.
   Results: With adjustment for potential confounders, we observed that
   early-childhood CMV infection was associated with suboptimal total

   1.74, 95\% CI 1.13-2.68, ABF = 0.18) and reading comprehension at 9
   years (IRR =1.93, 95\% CI 1.12-3.33, ABF = 0.24) were also associated
   with CMV infection. ABF analysis provided strong evidence for the
   association between CMV infection and total IQ at 8 years, and only
   anecdotal evidence for attentional control at 8 years and reading
   comprehension at 9 years. All other cognitive measures assessed were not
   associated with CMV infection.
   Conclusion: In this large-scale prospective cohort, we observed some
   evidence for adverse neurocognitive effects of postnatal CMV infection
   on general intelligence during early childhood, although not with
   lasting effect. If confirmed, these results could support the
   implementation of preventative measures to combat postnatal CMV
   infection.}},

Abstract = {{The study analyzes the elastic properties of chiral metallic nanotubes
   formed by rolling up thin crystal plates with the {[}011] and {[}111]
   orientations within two frameworks of anisotropic elasticity and

   is shown that the tubes have a positive Poisson's ratio in the entire
   range of chiral angles, unlike nanotubes obtained by rolling up crystal
   plates with the {[}010] orientation. Poynting's coefficient of nanotubes
   rolled up from plates with the {[}011] orientation becomes negative at
   certain chiral angles, which corresponds to a change in the twisting
   direction of the nanotubes under tension. The description of the
   dependence of the elastic properties of nanotubes on the chiral angle
   and thickness within anisotropic elasticity theory agrees qualitatively
   with the results of molecular statics simulations. The results for some
   chiral metallic nanotubes are quantitatively different.}},

Abstract = {{This work describes the in-plane uniaxial tensile mechanical properties
   of two-dimensional graded rectangular perforations metamaterials using
   numerical homogenization finite element approaches benchmarked by
   experimental results. The metamaterial configuration is based on graded
   patterns of centre-symmetric perforated cells that can exhibit an
   auxetic (negative Poisson's ratio) behavior. Global and local equivalent
   mechanical properties of the metamaterial are measured using digital
   image correlation techniques mapped over Finite Element models to
   identify strain patterns and related stress distributions at different
   scales. The samples and their numerical counterpart are parametrized
   against the spacing and aspect ratios of the cells. The overall
   stiffness behavior of the graded perforated metamaterial plates features
   a higher degree of compliance that depends both on the geometries of the
   cells of the graded areas, but also on the graded pattern used. Local
   Poisson's ratio effects show a general constraint of the auxetic
   behavior compared to the case of uniform plates, but also interesting
   and controllable shape changes due to the uniaxial tensile loading

Abstract = {{Two vertical and orthogonal systematic joint sets are generally arrayed
   in a grid pattern on the bedding surface, which are the significant
   features of flat-lying sandstone terrains. Although extensive researches
   are reported on this topic, many fundamental problems have still not
   been solved. Such mutually perpendicular opening-mode fractures are an
   obvious manifestation of effective tensile stresses in two orthogonal
   directions in the horizontal bedding plane. A good understanding of
   these orthogonal joint systems is a key to structural analysis,
   landscape interpretation, and guidance of resolving a number of very
   practical problems in engineering, mining and hydrologic projects. Based
   on an anatomic investigation on the orthogonal joints in the Potsdam
   sandstone of Cambrian age at Ausable Chasm (New York State, USA) and
   Beauharnois (Quebec, Canada), we proposed that the orthogonal joints may
   result from the auxetic effects of quartz-rich sandstone rather than
   local or regional rotation of the maximum tensile stress (sigma(3))
   direction by about 90 degrees. The sandstone beds with negative
   Poisson's ratios are so fascinating that, when placed under vertical
   burial compression and layer-parallel extension in one direction
   (sigma(3)), it becomes stretched in the transverse direction (sigma(2)),
   producing two orthogonal sets of mutual abutting and intersecting joints
   (J1 and J2 normal to sigma(3) and sigma(2), respectively), and both are
   normal to the bedding surface. Joint set J1 is more closely-spaced than
   J2 by a factor of similar to 3.3, which is correlated with an average
   Poisson's ratio of -0.3 for the Potsdam sandstone at the time of joint
   formation. (C) 2021 Institute of Rock and Soil Mechanics, Chinese

Journal = {{MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Honeycomb materials have low density, high specific strength and
   stiffness, impact resistance, and good sound insulation effect, and
   therefore are widely used in aerospace, automobile, and ship field
   applications. In this paper, we study the in-plane impact response of a
   second-order hierarchical honeycomb (SHH) material. Its main structure
   is a hexagonal honeycomb, and the substructure is composed of an
   augmented double arrow honeycomb (ADAH) negative Poisson's ratio unit.
   Through a finite element simulation, the failure stress of an
   hierarchical honeycomb in two directions of quasi-static crushing and
   dynamic crushing was analyzed; the failure stress of the hierarchical
   honeycomb under different densities, different speeds, and different
   substructures was discussed; and the theoretical failure stress was
   verified. The numerical analysis results show that a second-order
   hierarchical honeycomb (SHH) has better collapse stress than a
   first-order regular hexagonal honeycomb (FHH) and an augmented double
   arrow honeycomb (ADAH).}},

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{195}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Background: Studies of prenatal per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances
   (PFAS) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)-related
   behaviors in children are inconsistent.
   Objectives: To examine associations between maternal serum PFAS
   concentrations and child behavior in 241 mother-child dyads within the
   Health Outcomes and Measures of the Environment (HOME) Study.
   Methods: We quantified perfluorooctanoate (PFOA), perfluorooctane
   sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), and
   perfluorononanoate (PFNA) in maternal serum collected during pregnancy
   or at delivery. We evaluated a total of 17 outcomes of child behavior
   using the Behavioral Assessment System for Children-2 (BASC-2) at 5 and
   8 years (n = 240) and ADHD diagnostic symptoms and criteria with the
   Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children-Young Child (DISC-YC) at 5
   years (n = 190). We used linear mixed models and logistic regression
   with generalized estimating equations to assess associations between
   PFAS and continuous or dichotomous ``at risk{''} BASC-2 scores; negative
   binomial regression to calculate incident rate ratios for counts of ADHD
   symptoms; and Poisson regression with robust standard errors to
   calculate relative risks of meeting ADHD diagnostic criteria.
   Results: Each ln-unit increase in PFOS, PFHxS, and PFNA was associated
   with higher BASC-2 scores and increased odds of ``at-risk{''} scores for
   externalizing behaviors, including hyperactivity (PFOS: odds ratio
   {[}OR] 2.7, 95\% confidence interval {[}CI] 1.2, 5.9; PFHxS: OR 2.5,
   95\% CI 1.5, 4.3; PFNA: OR 3.2, 95\% CI 1.3, 8.0). PFHxS was also
   associated with internalizing problems (OR 2.0, 95\% CI 1.1, 3.4) and
   somatization (OR 2.2, 95\% CI 1.2, 4.0). PFOS and PFNA were
   significantly associated with 50-80\% more DISC-YC symptoms and
   diagnostic criteria related to hyperactive-impulsive type ADHD. Prenatal
   PFNA was associated with increased risk of any-type ADHD.
   Conclusions: Prenatal PFOS and PFNA were consistently associated with
   measures related to hyperactive-impulsive type ADHD across two validated
   assessment instruments. PFHxS was associated with increased problems
   with both externalizing and internalizing behaviors. No associations
   were noted between PFOA and child neurobehavior.}},

Abstract = {{The COVID-19 lockdown was imposed in a context of notable inequalities
   in the distribution of the social determinants of health. It is possible
   that the housing conditions in which children and their families
   experienced the confinement, and the adoption of healthy behaviors, may
   have followed unequal patterns. The aim was to describe social
   inequalities in housing conditions and in health-related behaviors among
   children during the lockdown in Spain. This cross-sectional study was
   based on data from an online survey collecting information on the child
   population (3-12 years) living in Spain (n = 10,765). The outcome
   variables used were several housing conditions and health-related
   behaviors. The socioeconomic variables used were financial difficulties
   and parents' educational level. Crude prevalence and prevalence ratios
   estimated using Poisson models were calculated. During lockdown,
   children from families with low educational levels and financial
   difficulties not only tended to live in poor housing conditions, but
   were also exposed to negative health determinants such as noise and
   tobacco smoke; they took less physical exercise, had a poorer diet,
   spent more time in front of screens and had less social contact. A
   notable social gradient was found in most of the variables analyzed. The
   results point to the need to incorporate the perspective of equity in
   the adoption of policies in order to avoid the increase of pre-existing
   social inequalities in the context of a pandemic.}},

Abstract = {{The recent discovery of negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) in
   two-dimensional (2D) atomic crystals has stimulated extensive research
   interest in their intriguing physical properties. Here, via density
   functional theory (DFT) calculations, we reveal in the family of 2D
   IV-VI semiconductors that an iso-symmetry structure variation concerning
   the switch of the cation (IV) versus anion (VI) in the outermost layers
   leads to the change of sign of Poisson's ratio. Such iso-symmetry
   structural pseudo-phase transition can be induced by external strains,
   as well as electric fields, realizing the possibility of an electrically
   switchable Poisson effect. The phase transition process could involve a
   dynamic intermediate state with an alternative cation/anion switch in
   the frequencies of 2-3 THz according to the real-time time-dependent DFT
   (rt-TDDFT) calculations. The results open the way for studying
   pseudophases in 2D materials associated with sharply different physical
   properties, such as Poisson's ratio, for electromechanical and
   optoelectronic applications.}},

Title = {{Design and analysis for large magnitudes of programmable Poisson's ratio
   in a series of lightweight cylindrical metastructures}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{195}},
Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{Cylindrical metastructures, which have the exclusive programmability in
   Poisson's ratio, are widely used in engineering. Herein, a series of
   cylindrical metastructures with programmable Poisson's ratio were
   devised via the curling of the planar metamaterials. The relationships
   of the deformation characteristics and Poisson's ratio between the
   cylindrical metastructures and planar metamaterials were systematically
   analyzed. It is originally identified that the number of the
   circumferential unit cell N remarkably affects the deformation modes.
   When N is small, the warp effect, induced by the curved members, is
   remarkable. The cylindrical metastructures present the petal- and
   polygon-like deformation modes. Consequently, the Poisson's ratios
   deviate notably from those of the planar metamaterials. Further, the
   quantitative analysis figures out that when N is larger than specific
   critical values, the Poisson's ratios approach to those of the planar
   metamaterials. Thus this work identifies a design strategy, i.e. once
   the circumferential unit cells are sufficiently dense, the Poisson's
   ratios of the cylindrical metastructures can be predicted by the theory
   of the corresponding planar metamaterials. Moreover, through modulating
   the geometric parameters, large magnitudes of both positive and negative
   Poisson's ratio are obtained. This extraordinary feature of the large
   radial expansion and shrinkage, actuated through a slight axial
   stretching, can be used in shape morphing and deployable devices. The
   design and analysis provide a perspective on the multifunctional
   metastructures with programmable Poisson's ratio.}},

Title = {{SMP-based chiral auxetic mechanical metamaterial with tunable bandgap
   function}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{195}},
Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{Artificial designed metamaterials have attracted widespread attention
   because of its unique lattice structure and special physical properties.
   In this work, a chiral auxetic metamaterial with adjustable band gap
   function is designed based on the shape memory polymer (SMP) with
   special thermomechanical property. Theory and finite element methods are
   used to investigate the relationship between the elastic modulus,
   Poisson's ratio and lattice parameters of the chiral metamaterial.
   Moreover, the dispersion curves of the metamaterial under different
   strain states and temperature field are studied by finite element
   method. The evolution processes of the band gap with the variation of
   configuration and environmental temperature are systematically revealed.
   The results show that the elastic modulus can be tailored by adjusting
   the geometric parameters of the lattice, and the Poisson's ratio is -1.
   The band gap could be real-time adjusted by external stimuli (mechanical
   loadings, temperature field). Based on the relationship between the
   geometric parameters and the band gap, the required properties of
   metamaterial can be customized. Moreover, the vibration control ability
   of the metamaterial can be further optimized by adjusting the strain of
   metamaterial and the temperature. The method of designing metamaterials
   with tunable and programmable mechanical properties and acoustic
   functions provides a meaningful reference for the development of
   metamaterials with potential applications.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel auxetic weft-knitted fabric was firstly designed,
   which was based on the rhombus-shaped grid re-entrant structure. Then
   the fabric was fabricated using Kevlar filament yarn with 200D fineness
   on a computerized flat knitting machine. And the Poisson's ratio values
   in weft, warp, and diagonal directions of this weft-knitted fabric were
   measured. The results showed that it exhibits the negative Poisson's

   resistance tests at five different puncture speeds were carried out on
   this auxetic weft-knitted fabric and the plain weft-knitted fabric with
   same raw material and similar loop length. The experimental results show
   that the auxetic weft-knitted fabric has higher peak load and energy
   absorption capacity at quasi-static loading. The results also show that
   the quasi-static stab resistance of the auxetic weft-knitted fabric
   strengthens with the increase of the puncture speed, but changes little
   after the puncture speed reaches a certain value (50 mm/min).}},

Abstract = {{In this article, the transfer and output characteristics of an

   nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism, implemented in the
   NanoTCAD ViDES simulator. Results show that ED SiNR-FET has better
   characteristics than chemically doped (CD) SiNR-FET. Additionally,
   ED-device is inherently free of negative impacts of impurities on the
   transistor's performance. The ED SiNR-FET functionality is analyzed
   using different channel lengths, introducing the extended channel
   ED-device (ECED) with an improved I-ON/I-OFF ratio of 3.8x10(5) and a
   significant I-ON of 4.6mA/mu m. A 15 nm ECED SiNR-FET with an 8 nm
   channel is studied under different temperatures and supply voltages.
   Based on the results, low-power (LP) and high-performance (HP)
   applications are suggested for the ECED-device, with the minimum

   illustrated that the face panel moved toward the loading area in the

Title = {{Elastic and failure characteristics of additive manufactured thin wall
   lattice structures with defects}},
Journal = {{THIN-WALLED STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{161}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The design and realization of lightweight thin wall lattice structures
   assisted by additive manufacturing (AM) has the potential for a broad
   range of engineering applications. Due to the more pronounced material
   and feature defects that commonly occur with AM lattice structures, the
   application of these structures are currently hindered by the lack of
   adequate understanding of the effects of material defects on various
   structural performance, including the fracture characteristics. In this
   work, an analytical modeling-based analysis was carried out with two
   types of lattice designs, including the re-entrant auxetic and the
   diamond structures, in order to understand the effect of material
   defects on the elastic and fracture characteristics of these structures.
   The material defect characteristics were represented by introducing
   material property variability (strength and elastic modulus) functions
   using stochastic normal distribution functions, which were
   experimentally established in this study. The models provided good
   predictions of various fracture characteristics of the lattice
   structures fabricated by laser powder bed fusion AM (L-PBF-AM) process.
   Furthermore, the models were employed to investigate the effect of
   varying material property variabilities on the fracture characteristics
   of the two types of lattice structures. The results showed that the
   existence of material property variability not only result in reduced
   initial fracture strength, but also lead to some unexpected
   characteristics such as the increase of retaining strength and the
   divergence of fracture patterns. In addition, it was found that the
   auxetic and diamond structures exhibit significantly different
   sensitivities to material property variabilities, which translates into
   various implications for their use in different potential applications.}},

Abstract = {{Tracheal stent placement is a principal treatment for tracheobronchial
   stenosis, but complications such as mucus plugging, secondary stenosis,
   migration, and strong foreign body sensation remain unavoid-able
   challenges. In this study, we designed a flexible porous chiral tracheal
   stent intended to reduce or overcome these complications. The stent was
   innovatively designed with a flexible tetrachiral and anti-tetrachiral
   hybrid structure as the frame and hollows filled with porous silicone
   sponge. Detailed finite element analysis (FEA) showed that the designed
   frame can maintain a Poisson's ratio that is negative or close to zero
   at up to 50\% tensile strain. This contributes to improved airway
   ventilation and better resis-tance to migration during physiological
   activities such as respiration and neck movement. The preparation
   process combined indirect 3D printing with gas foaming and particulate
   leaching methods to efficiently fabricate the stent. The stent was then
   subjected to uniaxial tension and local radial compression tests, which
   indicated that it not only has the same desirable auxetic performance
   but also has flexibility sim-ilar to the native trachea. The porous
   sponge facilitated the adhesion of cells, allowed nutrient diffusion,
   and would prevent the ingrowth of granulation tissue. Furthermore, a
   ciliated tracheal epithelium similar to that of the native trachea was
   differentiated from normal human bronchial primary epithelial cells on
   the internal wall of the stent under air-liquid interface conditions.
   These results suggest that the designed stent has the potential for
   application in the treatment of tracheobronchial stenosis.
   Statement of significance
   In this study, a new flexible porous chiral auxetic tracheal stent with
   ciliated epithelium was developed. Its auxetic properties provide a
   larger ventilation cross-sectional area and greater anti-migration
   force. It is also compatible with the tracheal growth of pediatric
   patients. It is flexible enough to reduce foreign body sensation and can
   be compressed for stent delivery. The stent can be optimized for each
   patient using indirect 3D printing. The porous sponge filler prevents
   granulation tissue ingrowth and provides a suitable environment for
   epithelial cells. The ciliated epithelium on the inner wall of the stent
   is expected to have a clearing function similar to the native trachea.
   This flexible auxetic tracheal stent provides new opportunities and
   insights into the treatment of tracheobronchial stenosis.

Title = {{The impact of mandating a driving lesson for elderly drivers in Japan
   using count data models: Case study of Toyota City}},
Journal = {{ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{153}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{As one crucial mobility problem for elderly drivers, vehicle crashes due
   to elderly drivers account for an increased ratio of total vehicle
   crashes in recent years in Japan. Mandating a driving lesson for elderly
   drivers was implemented and revised continuously to reduce the number of
   vehicle crashes. To perform a practical driving lesson for elderly
   drivers, it is essential to evaluate whether it can reduce vehicle
   crashes significantly or not. Most previous studies only investigated
   its effects on fatal or severe rates using rather simple methods,
   without consideration for the increasing number of elderly drivers and
   the variability of vehicle crashes in different months. To bridge these
   research gaps, this study examines the impact of mandating a driving
   lesson for elderly drivers by some advanced statistical methods based on
   a monthly level. Vehicle crash records from April 2005 to December 2019
   collected in Toyota City, Japan are used for empirical analysis. Three
   types of count data models, i.e., the Poisson regression model, the
   Negative Binomial regression model, and the Poisson Integer Valued
   Autoregressive (INAR) (1) model are proposed in this study. A comparison
   of three proposed models was implemented to indicate the similarity and
   distinction of estimation results. The significant findings of this
   study suggest that: 1) three proposed models have the same prediction
   accuracy referring to indexes of Root Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute
   Error, and Mean Squared Error; 2) all of them indicate that the revision
   of license renewal legislation for elderly drivers in March 2017 is a
   significant factor negatively affecting the number of vehicle crashes at
   a 10 \% significance level; 3) all of them indicate that the number of
   drivers aged 65 years or older and month-variability are significant
   factors affecting the number of vehicle crashes at least a 10 \%
   significance level; 4) the time-series nature of vehicle crashes due to
   elderly drivers was not existing indicated by the result of the Poisson
   INAR (1) model. Statistical methods proposed in this study can be
   referred by researchers and engineers to evaluate the effects of traffic
   safety measures in the research field of traffic and transportation
   engineering.}},

Journal = {{MECHANICS OF MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{155}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Hydrogenation is a viable approach in transforming two-dimensional (2D)
   nanosheets into three-dimensional (3D) nanoarchitectures. The present
   work reported self-folding of 2D graphene into 3D graphene Miura origami
   assisted by hydrogenation, and studied its Poisson's ratio under
   external strain using molecular dynamics simulation and continuum
   modeling. It was found that the graphene Miura origami possesses
   negative Poisson's ratio, being largely insensitive to the chirality of
   the folding creases and side lengths of the constituting parallelograms.
   We further demonstrated the good agreement of Poisson's ratio between
   the continuum prediction and MD simulation, and identified the origin of
   their deviation as localized stress concentration at the quad-junction
   of the graphene Miura origami. The present study provides insights into
   designing novel 3D nanoarchitectures of programmable functionalities

Abstract = {{In this letter, we developed a piezoresistive auxetic sensor structure
   based on a silicone elastomer and carbon-based conductive thermoplastic
   elastomer fiber sensor (CTPE fiber). Liquid silicone has been used as
   the matrix material. In addition silicone has been mixed with silica
   filler to tailor the stiffness of an auxetic elastic structure that
   improved the sensor behavior of silicone-based CTPE fiber composites.
   The 2D auxetic structures with and without silica fillers have been
   successfully printed with the direct ink writing method. The
   piezoresistive fiber was integrated and the auxetic structure were
   embedded in the silicone matrix in a second step, via casting method. To
   detect the electrical signal behavior of the integrated fiber sensor,
   the hybrid manufactured auxetic fiber sensor composite was investigated
   using dynamic cycle testing between 0 and 20\% strain. Using silicone
   with silica filler for the printing of the auxetic structure, the sensor
   behavior of the piezoresistive fiber elastomer composite was improved
   and a secondary peak of the sensor signal could be avoided at low
   strains. Unfortunately, a constant gauge factor between 0 and 20\%
   strain could not be obtained by implementing the auxetic structure
   element inside the CTPE fiber composite. However, this structure can
   already be integrated into a watchband and used for gesture-controlled
   applications.}},

Title = {{Effects of prenatal exposure and co-exposure to metallic or metalloid
   elements on early infant neurodevelopmental outcomes in areas with
   small-scale gold mining activities in Northern Tanzania}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{149}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Background: Artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) is associated
   with release of neurotoxic metallic or metalloid chemical elements
   including lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), cadmium (Cd) and arsenic (As).
   Objective: To examine associations between prenatal exposure and
   co-exposure to total lead (T-Pb), total mercury (T-Hg), total cadmium
   (T-Cd) and total arsenic (T-As) and infant neurodevelopment at 6 to 12
   months of age in areas with ASGM activities in Tanzania.
   Methods: Women in their second trimester of pregnancy who resided in
   ASGM areas were enrolled from 2015 to 2017 (n = 883). At 6 to 12 months
   of age, children were assessed with the Malawi Developmental Assessment
   Tool (MDAT) (n = 439). We measured T-Pb, T-Hg, and T-Cd in maternal
   dried blood spots and T-As in maternal urines. Poisson regression was
   used to examine associations between prenatal concentrations of these
   elements and neurodevelopmental outcomes.
   Results: Prenatal T-Hg concentration was associated with global
   neurodevelopment status (aPR 1.03, CI:1.01-1.04; p < 0.001) and language
   impairment (aPR 1.05, CI:1.03-1.07; p < 0.001) on the MDAT. When
   prenatal T-Hg and T-As values were at or above the human biomonitoring
   reference values (>= 95\%) of the German Environmental Survey for Human
   Biomonitoring, that is 0.80 mu g/L and 15 mu g/L, respectively, the
   prevalence ratio of global neurodevelopmental impairment was two times
   higher (aPR 2.1, CI:1.0-4.3; p = 0.034). There was a 40\% increase in
   the prevalence ratio of global neurodevelopmental impairment (aPR 1.4,
   CI:0.90-2.10, p = 0.027), when prenatal T-Hg was at or above the
   reference value of 0.80 mu g/L and T-Pb was at or above the reference
   value of 35 mu g/L. When prenatal T-Hg was at or above the reference
   value of 0.80 mu g/L and T-As was at or above the reference value of 15
   mu g/L, the prevalence ratio of global neurodevelopmental impairment was
   two times higher (aPR 2.1, CI:1.0-4.3; p < 0.034).
   Discussion: Infants born to women in areas with ASGM activities are at
   significant risk for neurodevelopmental impairment and this is
   associated with exposure to higher concentrations of Hg prenatally.
   Co-exposure to high concentrations of Hg and Pb, or Hg and As appeared
   to have negative potentiated effects on infants' neurodevelopment.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials have recently emerged as new types of advanced
   materials with unique material properties that conventional materials do
   not possess. In this paper, we examine the effect of in-plane negative
   Poisson's ratio (NPR) on the thermal postbuckling behavior of
   graphene-reinforced metal matrix composite (GRMMC) laminated cylindrical
   shells. The shell consists of GRMMC layers arranged in a piece-wise
   functionally graded (FG) pattern and is subjected to a uniform thermal
   load surrounded by an elastic medium. Based on the molecular dynamics
   simulation results, it is noted that the temperature-dependent material
   properties of GRMMCs can be expressed as a nonlinear function of
   temperature. The thermal postbuckling problem of shells is modeled under
   the framework of the Reddy's third order shear deformation theory and
   solved by using a singular perturbation technique in conjunction with a
   two-step perturbation approach. Numerical investigations are carried out
   for the postbuckling of (10/-10/10/-10/10)(S) and (10/-10/10)(S) shells
   with in-plane NPR. It is found that the FG-X pattern can enhance the
   buckling temperature and the thermal postbuckling strength of the
   shells. The anomaly is that the thermal buckling load and postbuckling
   strength of UD (10/-10/10)(S) shell are slightly higher than those of UD
   (10/-10/10/-10/10)(S) GRMMC laminated cylindrical shell. (C) 2020

Abstract = {{Electrically-mediated actuation schemes offer great promise beyond
   popular pneumatic and suction based ones in soft robotics. However, they
   often rely on bespoke materials and manufacturing approaches that
   constrain design flexibility and widespread adoption. Following the
   recent introduction of a class of architected materials called handed
   shearing auxetics (HSAs), we present a 3D printing method for rapidly
   fabricating HSAs and HSA-based soft robots that can be directly driven
   by servo motors. To date, HSA fabrication has been limited to the laser
   cutting of extruded teflon tubes. Our work expands the HSA materials
   palette to include flexible and elastomeric polyurethanes. Herein, we
   investigate the influence of material composition and geometry on
   printed HSAs' mechanical behavior. In addition to individual HSA
   performance, we evaluate printed HSAs in two soft robotic systems - four
   degree-of-freedom (DoF) platforms and soft grippers - to confirm that
   printed HSAs perform similarly to the original teflon HSA designs.
   Finally, we demonstrate new soft robotic capabilities with 3D printed
   HSAs, including fully 3D printed HSA fingers, higher force generation in
   multi-DoF devices, and demonstrations of soft grippers with internal HSA
   endoskeletons. We anticipate our methods will expedite the design and
   integration of novel HSAs in electrically-driven soft robots and
   facilitate broader adoption of HSAs in the field.}},

Title = {{Crashworthiness analysis and multi-objective optimization for honeycomb
   structures under oblique impact loading}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CRASHWORTHINESS}},
Abstract = {{Oblique impact loading conditions are unavoidable in practical
   applications, which strongly influence the performance response of
   energy-absorbing structures. In this paper, the finite element models of
   four typical cellular structures (hexagon honeycomb, re-entrant hexagon
   honeycomb, star-shape honeycomb, double arrow honeycomb) are established
   and experimentally validated. The dynamic responses of four structures
   under different impact angles (from 0 to 30 degrees) and impact
   velocities (from 5 to 50 m/s) are investigated. On this basis, the
   influences of impact angle and impact velocity on the specific energy
   absorption (SEA) and peak crushing force (PCF) of four structures are
   discussed. The results reveal that the negative Poisson's ratio
   structure has the advantage of energy absorption under axial impact due
   to the characteristics of compression and contraction at the low impact
   velocity. The hexagonal honeycomb structure has great advantages in
   terms of comprehensive energy absorption capacity and better stability
   at varying inclination angles. The Non-dominated Sorting Genetic
   Algorithm (NSGA-II) coupled with the ideal point method (IPM) is
   utilised to explore the optimal design of hexagon honeycomb structure,
   which is then verified by a detailed crashworthiness comparison with the
   original design. The optimal honeycomb structure shows excellent
   crashworthiness characteristics and demonstrates great potential for
   applications in impact engineering, especially the oblique impact
   loading situations.}},

Abstract = {{Aiming at reducing the energy absorption of the hydrogen cylinder for
   fuel cell vehicles in collision, which may lead to fierce explosion,
   this paper introduces an energy-absorbing protective shell combining
   with negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) structure to the hydrogen cylinder.
   It adopts three honeycomb structures of the same mass and three kinds of
   aluminum alloy to determine the optimal structure and material scheme of
   the protective shell. Besides, sensitivity analysis is selected to
   screen the design parameters of the optimal structure scheme. Based on
   this, the overall mass of the designed protective shell, the specific
   energy absorption of NPR structure, the maximum impact force of rigid
   wall, and the maximum stress of the liner are taken to establish the
   optimization mathematical model. Furthermore, adaptive mutation genetic
   algorithm (AMGA), non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-ii (NSGA-II),
   and adaptive simulated annealing algorithm (ASA) are exerted as the
   optimization algorithms separately to conduct optimization design and a
   comparison is made between the optimization results. The results show
   that the optimized energy-absorbing protective shell has better
   crashworthiness and energy absorption effect, which can effectively
   improve the collision safety of the hydrogen cylinder. It provides a new
   idea for the protection design of hydrogen storage system in fuel cells
   in the future.}},

   Oval-Shaped Holes and Machine Learning Solutions}},
Journal = {{ADVANCED ENGINEERING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic metamaterials with negative Poisson's ratio have attracted much
   attention due to their counterintuitive deformation behavior over the
   conventional engineering materials. However, it is difficult to describe
   the complex correlation between microstructure parameters and auxeticity
   by analytical or empirical solutions in the form of math expressions.
   Herein, the machine learning (ML) model with artificial neural network
   (ANN) is developed to analyze a novel planar auxetic metamaterial
   designed by introducing orthogonally aligned oval-shaped perforations in
   solid base material, and its feasibility is demonstrated through the
   experimental and finite element method (FEM) solutions. It is found that
   the proposed structure involving less design parameters exhibits the
   best performance at the aspects of auxetic behavior and stress level
   than those with peanut-shaped holes and elliptic holes. Moreover, the
   results of parameter analysis demonstrate that the present ML solution
   model can provide accurate predicting results rapidly for this problem,
   without the limitations of explicit solution expressions which are
   typically not available in practice. The ML model allows one to obtain
   the desired auxetic property by tailoring the geometric parameters
   effectively and accelerate auxetic metamaterial design.}},

Title = {{Digital inequalities in health information seeking behaviors and
   experiences in the age of web 2.0: A population-based study in Hong Kong}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 30}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Inequalities in health information seeking behaviors (HISBs) using mass
   media and internet websites (web 1.0) are well documented. Little is
   known about web 2.0 such as social networking sites (SNS) and instant
   messaging (IM) and experiences of HISBs.
   Methods
   We surveyed representative Hong Kong Chinese adults (N = 10143, 54.9\%
   female; 72.3\% aged 25-64 years) on frequency of HISBs using traditional
   sources, internet websites, SNS (e.g., Facebook, Twitter), and IM (e.g.,
   WhatsApp, WeChat) and experiences measured using Information Seeking
   Experience Scale. Adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) for HISBs and
   experiences by sociodemographic and health-related characteristics were
   yielded using multivariable Poisson regression with robust variance
   estimators. aPRs for experiences by HISBs using internet websites, SNS,
   and IM adjusting for sociodemographic and health-related characteristics
   were also yielded.
   Results
   Being female, higher educational attainment, not smoking, and being
   physically active were associated with HISBs using any source (all
   P<0.05). Older age had decreased aPRs for HISBs using traditional
   sources (P for trend = 0.03), internet websites (P for trend<0.001), and
   SNS (P for trend<0.001) but not for IM (aged 45-64 years: aPR = 1.48,
   95\% CI 1.07, 2.03). Lower educational attainment and income were
   associated with negative experiences including feelings of effort and
   difficulties in understanding the information (all P for trend<0.05).
   Older age had increased aPRs for difficulties in understanding the
   information (P for trend = 0.003). Compared with internet websites,
   HISBs using IM was associated with feelings of frustration (aPR = 1.39,
   95\% CI 1.08, 1.79), difficulties in understanding the information (aPR
   = 1.36, 95\% CI 1.12, 1.65), and quality concern (aPR = 1.20, 95\% CI
   1.08, 1.32).
   Conclusions
   We identified correlates of web-based health information seeking and
   experiences in Hong Kong Chinese adults. Providing greater access to and
   improved information environment of web 2.0 to the target groups may
   help address digital inequalities.}},

Abstract = {{Upon strain, most materials shrink normal to the direction of applied
   strain. Similarly, if a material is compressed, it will expand in the
   direction orthogonal to the pressure. Few materials, those of negative
   Poisson ratio, show the opposite behavior. Here, we show an
   unprecedented feature, a material that expands normal to the direction
   of stress, regardless if it is strained or compressed. Such behavior,
   namely, half-auxeticity, is demonstrated for a borophene sheet
   stabilized by decorating Pd atoms. We explore Pd-decorated borophene,
   identify three stable phases of which one has this peculiar property of
   half auxeticity. After carefully analyzing stability and mechanical and
   electronic properties we explore the origin of this very uncommon
   behavior and identify it as a structural feature that may also be
   employed to design further 2D nanomaterials.}},

Abstract = {{Polymer-matrix composites are widely used in various industries due to
   their high specific strength and specific stiffness. However, the void
   formation is inevitable as a by-product during manufacturing processes,
   which may have negative effects on its mechanical properties. The
   purposes of this paper are to quantitatively evaluate the influence of
   voids on the anisotropic elastic properties of composites and to provide
   corresponding theoretical prediction models. Firstly, three-dimensional
   representative volume elements (RVE) of fiber-reinforced composite
   materials with different fiber contents (36.37\%, 45.47\%, 50.92\%) and
   different void contents (1\%, 3\%, 5\%, 7\%) are established. To obtain
   the elastic properties in different directions, various periodic
   boundary conditions are applied to the RVE models and corresponding
   subroutines are developed by ABAQUS-PYTHON. Secondly, a series of
   theoretical models are proposed to quickly predict the anisotropic
   elastic properties of unidirectional fiber/epoxy composites containing
   random-sized void defects, which agree well with the finite element
   simulation results. Especially, the proposed models have concise
   expressions, which require only a few parameters to be input, and hence
   they are convenient for engineering application. Both theoretical and
   numerical results show that void defects have an obvious influence on
   the transverse modulus, major Poisson's ratio, and the out-of-plane
   shear modulus. When the void volume reaches 7\%, all of the properties
   mentioned above decrease by more than 10\% for the FRPs studied.}},

Title = {{Driving after marijuana use among US adolescents: Prevalence profiles

Abstract = {{Objectives
   The interplay between marijuana legislation, perceptions of risks
   associated with marijuana use, and marijuana-related risk behaviors is
   an ever changing and complex issue. Marijuana impaired driving is of
   concern as legalization continues to expand in the United States. While
   driving after using marijuana has been shown to be prevalent among
   adults, little research has examined the behavior in adolescents. The
   aim of the present study was to examine the prevalence of driving after
   using marijuana among U.S. adolescents, with an examination of the
   relationship to age of marijuana initiation and marijuana usage
   patterns.
   Methods
   We analyzed data from the 2017 Youth Risk Behavior Survey, a nationally
   representative sample of high schools students in the U.S. The sample
   was current marijuana users, defined as past 30 day use. Driving after
   using marijuana was the main outcome variable, with analyses examining
   the association between the outcome and age of initiation and patterns
   of use. Prevalence ratios were obtained by modeling Poisson regression
   to examine factors associated with driving under the influence of
   marijuana.
   Results
   Nearly half of all marijuana users reported driving after use during the
   past 30 days, and did not differ between males and females. Prevalence
   of driving after using marijuana was significantly higher among heavy
   users (PR = 2.8; 95\% CI 2.1-3.6). A higher prevalence of driving after
   drinking alcohol (PR = 1.7; 95\% CI 1.5-1.9) was also found among those
   who had driven after using marijuana.
   Conclusions
   Among adolescent marijuana users, the prevalence of driving after using
   marijuana was high. Enhanced surveillance, prevention, and control
   measures are necessary to mitigate the negative impacts of marijuana
   consumption and related behaviors.}},

Abstract = {{Zinc squarate tetrahydrate (ZnC4O4 center dot 4H(2)O) and titanium
   oxalate trioxide dihydrate (Ti-2(C2O4)O-3 center dot 2H(2)O) are
   nanoporous metal-organic frameworks possessing empty channels in their
   crystal structures. The crystal structures and mechanical properties of
   these materials are studied using first principles solid-state methods
   based on Density Functional Theory. The results show that they exhibit
   the negative linear compressibility (NLC) and negative Poisson's ratio
   (NPR) phenomena. The absolute value of the negative compressibilities
   are significant and the range of pressure for which NLC effects are
   shown is very wide. The detailed study of the deformation of the crystal
   structures under pressure reveals that the NLC effect in these compounds
   can be rationalized using the empty channel structural mechanism. Under
   isotropic compression, the channels are elongated along the direction of
   minimum compressibiity, leading to NLC. Furthermore, under compression
   along the direction of minimum compressibity, the unit-cell volume
   increases leading to negative volumetric compressibilty. The effect of
   hydration on the NLC effect in titanium oxalate trioxide dihydrate is
   investigated by studying the parent compound titanium oxalate trioxide
   trihydrate (Ti-2(C2O4)O-3 center dot 3H(2)O). The NLC effect in this
   material is reduced due to the reinforcement of the walls of the
   structural channels.}},

Abstract = {{Seeking novel materials with specific applications is always an
   attractive theme in developing two-dimensional (2D) materials. Herein,
   we predicted a series of 2D pentagonal transition metal dichalcogenides,
   namely penta-MS2 (M = Mn, Ni, Cu/Ag and Zn/Cd) monolayers with alpha and
   beta configurations, by means of systematic density functional theory
   (DFT) computations. Six alpha-MS2 monolayers (M = Mn, Ni, Cu/Ag and
   Zn/Cd) and four beta-MS2 monolayers (M = Ni, Ag, Zn and Cd) were found
   to have sound thermodynamic, dynamic, thermal, and mechanical
   stabilities, and the coexistence of covalent and ionic bonding
   contributes to the structural stability of the pentagonal frameworks.
   All these 10 stable monolayers have low in-plane Young's moduli (8-94 N
   m(-1)), among which pentagonal beta-MS2 (M = Ni, Zn and Cd) monolayers
   have negative Poisson's ratios (NPRs). Three monolayers (alpha-CuS2,
   alpha-AgS2, and beta-AgS2) are metallic, and seven penta-MS2 monolayers
   (M = Ni, Zn and Cd with both alpha- and beta-phases, and alpha-MnS2) are
   semiconducting with band gaps in the range of 2.45-3.32 eV, and these
   band gaps can be tuned to 1.70-3.05 eV under rather feasible external
   strains (-8\% to 8\%). Notably, two monolayers, namely, alpha-NiS2 and
   beta-ZnS2, are promising candidates for the photocatalysis of water
   splitting under neutral conditions. This work not only predicted 10 new
   2D pentagonal transition metal dichalcogenides as synthesis targets, but
   also identified their promising applications for flexible nanomechanics,
   nanoelectronics and photocatalysis for water-splitting.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, after a review of the most common financial strategies
   and products that insurance companies use to hedge catastrophic risks,
   we study an option pricing model based on processes with jumps where the
   catastrophic event is captured by a compound Poisson process with
   negative jumps. Given the importance that catastrophe equity put options
   (CatEPuts) have in this context, we introduce a pricing approach that
   provides not only a theoretical contribution whose applicability remains
   confined to purely numerical examples and experiments, but which can be
   implemented starting from real data and applied to the evaluation of
   real CatEPuts. We propose a calibration framework based on historical
   log-returns, market capitalization and option implied volatilities. The
   calibrated parameters are then considered to price CatEPuts written on
   the stock of the main Italian insurance company over the high volatile
   period from January to April 2020. We show that the ratio between
   plain-vanilla put options and CatEPuts strictly depends on the shape of
   the implied volatility smile and it varies over time.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: In 2006, the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination
   policy in Finland changed from universal to selective. Aim: We assessed
   the impact of the policy change on tuberculosis (TB) morbidity in
   children under 5 years and epidemiological trends of paediatric TB in
   Finland. Methods: We conducted a nationwide, population-based,
   retrospective registry study of all newly diagnosed active TB cases
   younger than 15 years in Finland from 1995 to 2015 by linking data from
   the National Infectious Diseases Register, Finnish Care Register for
   Health Care, medical patient records and Finnish Population Information
   System. We compared the TB incidence rate ratio of under 5 year-olds
   with universal and selective BCG vaccinations with a Poisson log-linear
   model and analysed incidence trends among those younger than 15 years
   with a negative binomial model. Results: We identified 139 paediatric TB
   cases: 50 native (including 24 second-generation migrants) and 89
   foreign-born children. The TB rate of under 5 year-olds remained stable
   after changing to selective BCG vaccination (incidence rate ratio (IRR):
   1.3; 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.72.3). TB rate in the native
   population under 15 years increased slightly (IRR = 1.06; 95\% CI:
   1.01-1.11). Discussion: Paediatric TB cases in Finland were concentrated
   in families with migrant background from high-TB incidence countries.
   The native TB morbidity in under 5-year-olds did not increase after the
   BCG policy revision, suggesting that selective vaccinations can prevent
   TB in the most vulnerable age group in low-incidence settings.
   Second-generation migrants under 15 years in Finland with high TB risk
   are probably increasing.}},

Abstract = {{The Poisson's ratio, a property which quantifies the changes in

   and the actual definition used could result in a different Poisson's
   ratio being computed. This paper will look in more detail at this by
   comparing the more commonly used forms of strain and the Poisson's ratio
   that is computable from them. More specifically, an attempt is made to
   assess through examples on the usefulness of the various formulations to
   properly describe what can actually be observed, thus providing a
   clearer picture of which form of Poisson's ratio should be used in

Abstract = {{The mull-scale nature of architectured materials raises the need for
   advanced experimental methods suitable for the identification of their
   effective properties, especially when their size is finite and they
   undergo extreme deformations. The present work demonstrates that
   state-of-the art image processing methods combined with numerical and
   analytical models provide a comprehensive quantitative description of
   these solids and their global behaviour, including the influence of the
   boundary conditions, of the manufacturing process, and of geometric and
   constitutive non-linearities. To this end, an adapted mull-scale digital
   image correlation analysis is used to track both elongations and
   rotations of particular features of the unit cell at the local and
   global (homogenized) scale of the material. This permits to observe with
   unprecedented clarity the strain fields for various unit cells in the
   structure and to detect global deformation patterns and heterogeneities
   of the homogenized strain distribution. This method is here demonstrated
   on elastic sheets undergoing extreme longitudinal and shear
   deformations. These experimental results are compared to non-linear
   finite element simulations, which are also used to evaluate the effects
   of manufacturing imperfections on the response. A skeletal
   representation of the architectured solid is then extracted from the
   experiments and used to create a purely-kinematic truss-hinge model that
   can accurately capture its behaviour. The analysis proposed in this work
   can be extended to guide the design of two-dimensional architectured
   solids featuring other regular, quasi-regular or graded patterns, and
   subjected to other types of loads.}},

Abstract = {{This paper developed a thermal-mechanical analysis model to describe the
   thermal shock behavior of ceramic sandwich structures (CSSs) with an
   auxetic honeycomb core. The transient temperature distribution and the
   associated thermal stress field of CSSs subjected to a thermal shock
   were determined. The crack growth behavior was discussed based on the
   thermal stress intensity factor (TSIF), crack location, face-sheet
   thickness, and internal cell orientation of the honewycomb core in
   detail. The results revealed that the auxetic and nonauxetic honeycomb
   cores have the similar temperature distribution profile however the
   auxetic honeycomb core can substantially reduce the overall thermal
   stress level. Furthermore, by equating the maximum TSIF and equivalent
   fracture toughness, the critical temperature for which the honeycomb
   core can sustain without failure was obtained. The results showed that
   CSSs with auxetic honeycomb core possessed a higher thermal shock
   resistance than that of non-auxetic. This research work was the first
   attempt to identify the the thermal shock resistance of CSSs with an
   auxetic honeycomb core. The results would provide fresh insight into the

Title = {{Theoretical, emulation and experimental analysis on auxetic re-entrant
   octagonal honeycombs and its applications on pedestrian protection of
   engine hood}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{260}},
Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{In this article, a novel re-entrant octagonal honeycomb (ROH) with
   negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) configuration is proposed owing to its
   superior energy absorption and lightweight design performances.
   Regarding the effects of adjacent unit cells, a mechanics-based
   homogenization approach is put forward and employed to derive static
   mechanical properties including elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio of
   two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) ROHs under axial
   loading. Based on above, the predominant compression failure mode is
   explored. Then, the static mechanical properties and finite element
   model of ROH are validated by experiment and demonstrate high accuracy.
   Subsequently, to obtain dynamic responses of the ROH under dynamic
   impact loading, the relations among dynamic plateau stress and
   quasi-static plateau stress, initial density, dense strain and impact
   velocities are established under the conditions of mass conservation and
   momentum theorem based on one-dimensional shock wave theory and ideal
   rigid-perfectly plastic material model. Besides, dynamic energy
   absorption models of the ROH under dynamic loading are acquired in
   consideration of the effects of impact velocities on dense strain, the
   results show that theoretical models agree quite well with simulation
   results. On this basis, the application of ROH on automotive energy
   absorber is studied with the purpose of acquiring superior energy
   absorption and satisfying lightweight requirements simultaneously. Based
   on the decoupling thought of stiffness and pedestrian protection, a new
   design method of carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP) hood with ROH
   is put forward in consideration of energy absorption and lightweight
   requirements. Of this, ROH is regarded as sandwich structure to meet the
   demands of energy absorption, CFRP plates are treated as outer and inner
   skins to satisfy the needs of stiffness. Firstly, multi-objective
   optimization models are set up under the constraints of reasonable
   structural parameters and negative Poisson's ratio. Then, the
   NSGA-IIalgorithm is adopted to achieve the optimal Pareto fronts with
   the targets for maximum unit mass energy absorption and minimum density.
   Afterwards, the optimization on thicknesses of CFRP layers is carried
   out to achieve minimum mass under the constraint conditions that the
   static stiffness of CFRP hood is larger than that of steel hood. In
   addition, the layering sequence of inner and lower skins are also
   optimized. Finally, improved overall stiffness, optimized HIC values and
   similar lightweight space of CFRP hood with ROH are achieved in
   comparisons with CFRP hood without ROH. Compared with steel hood, the
   pedestrian protection performance of CFRP hood with ROH is greatly
   enhanced, 1st free mode increases by 33.9\%, and torsional stiffness and
   bending stiffness increase by 23.1\% and 30.8\%, respectively. While the
   weight decreases by 40.1\%. The results indicate that the CFRP hood with
   ROH presents outstanding advantages of pedestrian protection and
   lightweight design in terms of HIC and stiffness performance.}},

Title = {{On the Behavior of beta-Cristobalite-like Boron Arsenate when Subjected
   to Uniaxial Loading in Its {[}001] Direction and the Implications on Its
   ``Negative{''} Characteristics}},
Journal = {{PHYSICA STATUS SOLIDI B-BASIC SOLID STATE PHYSICS}},
Abstract = {{Boron arsenate (BAsO4) is a beta-cristobalite-like material, which
   crystallizes in the I4 over bar space group. However, unlike
   beta-cristobalite itself, BAsO4 is well characterized and known to be
   stable and at ambient conditions. This work presents the results of
   extensive density functional theory (DFT)-based simulations aimed at
   elucidating the nanoscale deformations that such crystals undergo when
   subjected to uniaxial tensile and compressive loads along their
   crystallographic {[}001] c-direction. It is shown that such uniaxial
   loading results primarily in intra-tetrahedral deformations rather than
   their tilting/rotations (which causes the auxeticity in the (001)
   plane). Through their analysis in isolation from other modes of
   deformation, this study gives a much better insight into such
   intra-tetrahedral deformations and helps explain better the cause of the
   measured negative linear compressibility in the c-direction at elevated
   pressures, which recently has been attributed to a ``demi wine-rack{''}
   mechanism caused by the same intra-tetrahedral deformations.}},

Abstract = {{This paper looks into the effects of various porous structures used in
   the construction of the shell of a protective helmet on the energy
   absorption capacity and their efficacy in protecting the head/skull
   against impact force. It is well known that porous structures are very
   effective for energy absorption; hence, they have been widely used to
   reduce the negative effects of impact and explosion loads on the human
   skull. Porous shell structures, made from titanium alloy (Ti-6Al-4V)
   and, comprised of several periodic topological configurations, namely
   the more common rectangle and hexagonal honeycomb, as well as those
   having auxetic properties, namely the concave honeycomb and
   double-arrow, are studied by means of numerical modeling. The
   reliability of the numerical model is validated with the published
   experimental results. For the double-arrow configurations, the study
   involves three different densities, and the structural energy absorption
   capacity of the double-arrow shells increases with density. For the same
   density, the energy absorption capacity of the rectangular shell is the
   best, and that of the honeycomb is the worst. The superior performance
   of the rectangular configuration is partly derived from the fact that
   the orientation of the struts in this structure is aligned along the
   direction of the impact force. Further comparison of energy absorption
   capacity is made between the porous shell and a shell having a
   traditional titanium monolayer. The severe plastic deformation in the
   solid titanium shell (traditional monolayer shell) is detrimental to the
   overall effectiveness of head protection gear. Apart from this, compared
   with the Kevlar composite laminated shell of the same mass, both the
   solid and porous titanium shells provide considerable protection to the
   human head. The comprehensive comparisons show that the porous design on
   the titanium shell is beneficial for mitigating the risks of traumatic
   brain injuries (TBIs).}},

Abstract = {{The research determined the resistance to compression and low velocity
   impact of wood-based sandwich panels, the face sheet made of
   high-density fiber board, and high pressure laminate, while its auxetic
   lattice core was made by 3D printing using LayWood bio-composite
   filament. The core's auxetic property (i.e. exhibiting negative
   Poisson's ratio) was observed within the planes parallel to the facings.
   The ability of particular types of multilayer panels to absorb the
   energy was also determined. Based on the analysis of the obtained test
   results, it was proven that the core denoted as B, with inclination
   angle of the cell ribs phi(x) = phi(y) = 65 degrees, shows the highest
   compressive strength. It was determined that the dynamic load causes a
   very high overload in high-density fiber board face sheets. This results
   in damage to the sandwich panel surface and core structure. Cells of
   type B favorably minimize the differences in absorbed energy when using
   different face sheets and the energy value for low velocity impact.
   Taking into account the amount of absorbed energy, the most attractive
   is the panel with the D-type orthotropic core characterized by an
   inclination angle of the cell ribs phi(x) = 30 degrees, phi(y) = 60
   degrees. The amount of energy absorbed by samples with high-density
   fiberboard face sheets increases significantly depending on the
   impactor's energy. For panels with face sheets manufactured from
   high-pressure laminate, the amount of energy absorbed decreases.}},

   were obtained from health records. Associations between exploratory
   factors and low OHRQoL (\% GOHAI score <30) were evaluated using
   multivariate Poisson regression models to estimate adjusted prevalence
   ratios (PRs) and confidence intervals. The mean OHRQoL score was 30 (+/-
   4.4). In bivariate analysis, being not married, smoking, and self-rated
   ``fair/poor{''} general health status were associated with lower OHRQoL.
   In the adjusted model, self-rated ``fair/poor{''} general health (PR:
   1.25; 95\% CI: 1.05-1.48), presence of chronic diseases (PR: 1.88; 95\%
   CI: 1.37-2.58), smoking (PR: 1.25; 95\% CI: 1.02-1.53), and reason for
   last dental appointment (PR: 1.34; 95\% CI: 1.13-1.59) were associated
   with poor OHRQoL.
   Conclusion: Non-institutionalized older adults with a history of chronic
   diseases, who smoke, have a negative perception of their general health,
   and had the last dental appointment motivated by pain present
   significantly higher prevalence rates of poor OHRQoL.}},

Journal = {{GEOFLUIDS}},

Abstract = {{Ultrasonic wave velocity is effective to evaluate anisotropy property
   and predict rock failure. This paper investigates the correlation
   between dynamic ultrasonic and mechanical properties of sandstones with
   different buried depths subjected to uniaxial compression tests. The
   circumferential anisotropy and axial wave velocity of sandstone are
   obtained by means of ultrasonic wave velocity measurements. The
   mechanical properties, including Young's modulus and uniaxial
   compressive strength, are positively correlated with the axial P wave
   velocity. The average angles between the sandstone failure plane and the
   minimum and maximum wave directions are 35.8 degrees and 63.3 degrees,
   respectively. The axial P wave velocity almost keeps constant, and the
   axial S wave velocity has a decreasing trend before the failure of rock
   specimen. In most rock samples under uniaxial compression, shear failure
   occurs in the middle and splitting appears near both sides.
   Additionally, the dynamic Young's modulus and dynamic Poisson's ratio
   during loading are obtained, and the negative values of the Poisson's
   ratio occur at the initial compression stage. Distortion and rotation of
   micro/mesorock structures may be responsible for the negative Poisson's
   ratio.}},

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional(2D) materials are considered excellent candidates for
   achieving a highly efficient photocatalyst. Herein, we report a novel 2D
   aluminum nitride monolayer (th-AlN) as a potential photocatalyst
   material, possessing robust energetic, dynamical, thermal, and
   mechanical stability as well as strong stability in aqueuos conditions.
   The monolayer is an indirect band gap semiconductor at its equilibrium
   state and can induce an indirect-to-direct band gap transition under a
   very small strain (-4\%). The band edge positions fit perfectly the
   water oxidation and reduction redox potentials. The monolayer exhibits
   strong visible-ultraviolet light absorption, which is favorable for the
   efficient utilization of sunlight. The excellent electron transport
   ability including high and directionally anisotropic carrier mobility
   (10(4) cm(2) V-1 s(-1)) leads to the rapid separation of electron-hole
   pairs, retards the recombination of electron-hole pairs, and greatly
   improves the photocatalytic activity. Furthermore, the monolayer
   exhibits exceptional mechanical properties including ultrahigh ideal
   strength (40\%) outperforming graphene, good flexibility, and mechanical
   anisotropy. Remarkably, the negative Poisson's ratio makes th-AlN a
   promising candidate for auxetic materials. With these outstanding
   properties, th-AlN can be considered as a promising candidate for
   potential application in the fields of electronics, optoelectronics, and
   nanomechanics.}},

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional (2D) materials integrated with anisotropy and
   ferroelasticity are highly desired for controllable
   polarization-sensitive devices and ferroelastic memorizers but are
   rarely reported. Herein, using the particle swap optimization (PSO)
   method and first-principles calculations, we theoretically predicted the
   coexistence of single-direction auxeticity, anisotropic carrier
   mobility, and intrinsic ferroelasticity in 2D silver oxide (AgO). Linear
   and square-planar Ag-O ligands align vertically in 2D AgO, leading to
   remarkable in-plane anisotropy. 2D AgO exhibits a large out-of-plane
   negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) of -0.47 which can only be triggered by
   the uniaxial strain along the y-direction. The electrons/holes favor the
   transport along the x-direction with mobilities of up to similar to
   6000/4000 cm(2) V-1 s(-1), which is around 10/17 times higher than that
   along the y-direction. Moreover, a strain-driven 90 degrees lattice
   rotation is found in 2D AgO with a record high reversal strain of
   107.6\%. Such integration allows us to tune the direction of the
   anisotropic properties, and at the same time enables the efficient
   identification of the bi-stable states during the ferroelastic
   transition, thus promising the versatile applications of 2D AgO in
   controllable mechanic/electronic devices and non-volatile information
   storage.}},

Journal = {{COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-SIMULATION AND COMPUTATION}},
Abstract = {{In both flexible Poisson Tweedie (PT) and Poisson-exponential-Tweedie
   (PET) over-dispersed count models, the common power parameter p is an
   element of \{0\} boolean OR {[}1, infinity) works as an automatic
   distribution selection. It mainly separates two subclasses of
   zero-inflated (1 <= p < 2) and heavy-tailed (p > 2). Although extensive
   works have been conducted in discriminating between continuous and
   semicontinuous distribution functions, not much attention has been paid
   to discriminating between discrete distribution functions. Estimations
   based on the likelihood approach for PT and PETS are challenging owing
   to the presence of an infinity sum and intractable integrals in their
   probability mass functions. Thus, we attempt to perform a Monte Carlo
   simulation to approximate them. In this paper, we invest the ratio of
   the maximized likelihoods within each subclass of these two models for
   discrimination purposes based on classic measures of dispersion,
   zero-inflation and heavy tail of both PT and PET models. Grounded only
   on dispersion index, we also discriminate two particular cases of the
   Hermite distribution with respect to its geometric version (p = 0) and
   the negative binomial one with its geometric version (p = 2).
   Probabilities of correct selection for several combinations of
   dispersion parameters, means and sample sizes are examined by
   simulations. We carry out a numerical comparison study to assess the
   discrimination procedures in these subclasses of two families.}},

Title = {{Metabolic syndrome and severe periodontitis were associated in Thai
   adults: A cross-sectional study}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PERIODONTOLOGY}},
Abstract = {{Background Studies support the relationship between metabolic syndrome
   (MetS) and periodontitis. However, age is the major confounding factor
   for both conditions. Therefore, this cross-sectional study was performed
   to investigate the relationship between MetS and severe periodontitis in
   different Thai adult age groups.
   Methods Data on the medical history, medical examination, and full mouth
   oral examination of 5,690 Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand
   employees aged 25 to 77 years were collected. The prevalence ratio (PR)
   between risk variables, MetS, and periodontitis was determined using
   Poisson regression analysis. Moreover, the subgroup analysis and effect
   modification by age on severe periodontitis were performed.
   Results Overall, MetS was significantly associated with severe
   periodontitis compared with non-severe periodontitis (adjusted PR, 1.11;
   95\% confidence interval {[}CI], 1.01 to 1.13). The association was
   modified by age, with negative effect modification observed on the
   multiplicative and additive scales. The subgroup analysis revealed a
   significant relationship between MetS and severe periodontitis only in
   participants aged <45 years with an adjusted PR of 1.69 (95\% CI, 1.29
   to 2.21). All MetS components, except hypertension, were associated with
   severe periodontitis in this group.
   Conclusions There is a significant relationship between MetS and severe
   periodontitis in adults aged <45 years. Therefore, attempts to control
   the risk of MetS and periodontitis should be emphasized for early adults
   to reduce the incidence of these conditions and related complications
   when they become elderly.}},

Abstract = {{Based on the symmetric re-entrant honeycomb (S-RH) structure with
   negative Poisson's ratios, a novel asymmetric and rotatable re-entrant
   honeycomb (AR-RH) structure was proposed. Both the S-RH structure and
   AR-RH structure were produced by the 3D printing technology. Through
   experimental test and finite element simulation, the deformation
   mechanism and energy absorption characteristics of the AR-RH structure
   and the S-RH structure with negative Poisson's ratios at different
   impact velocities were compared. The experimental test and finite
   element simulation results show that the novel AR-RH structure with
   negative Poisson's ratios has stronger energy absorption capacity than
   the S-RH structure, and it has been verified that the rotatability of
   AR-RH can indeed absorb energy. Furthermore, the degree of asymmetry of
   the AR-RH structure was discussed.}},

Title = {{HIV Injection Risk Behaviors among HIV-Negative People Who Inject Drugs
   Experiencing Homelessness, 23 US Cities}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SOCIAL DISTRESS AND THE HOMELESS}},
Abstract = {{Despite recent declines in numbers of people who inject drugs (PWID)
   diagnosed with HIV, clusters of HIV among PWID are ongoing, especially
   among PWID experiencing homelessness. Using data from the National HIV
   Behavioral Surveillance in 2018, we evaluated the association between
   homelessness and injection risk and prevention behaviors among
   HIV-negative PWID who were recruited by respondent-driven sampling in 23
   U.S. cities. Interviewers assessed sociodemographic characteristics,
   history of overdose, and behavioral risk and prevention factors for HIV.
   Adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) and 95\% CI were obtained using Poisson
   regression models. Of 10,614 HIV-negative PWID participants, 7275
   (68.5\%) reported experiencing homelessness. Homeless PWID were more
   likely than those who were not to be younger age, white, unemployed,
   without health insurance, in poverty, experiencing psychological
   distress, and incarcerated in the past 12 months. PWID experiencing
   homelessness were significantly more likely to report injection risk
   behaviors {[}share syringes/equipment (aPR = 1.26; 95\% CI = 1.20-1.33),
   non-fatal opioid overdose (aPR = 1.64; 95\% CI = 1.49-1.79)] and
   prevention behaviors {[}testing for HIV in past 12 months (aPR = 1.18;
   95\% CI = 1.12-1.24) and using syringe services programs (aPR = 1.09;
   95\% CI = 1.03-1.16)] than PWID not experiencing homelessness.
   Homelessness among PWID is associated with injection risk behaviors and
   non-fatal overdose.}},

   cellular microstructures}},
Journal = {{MECHANICS OF ADVANCED MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Abstract = {{The star-shaped auxetic structures with sharp reentrant corners are
   highly stressed in practice. In this article, a novel planar auxetic
   material is designed by introducing periodic cookie-shaped pattern to
   decrease the risk of structure failure. Then both auxetic and band gap
   properties are comprehensively investigated numerically. The results
   reveal that the stress level significantly decreases by an order of
   magnitude. Moreover, the designed structure can yield a large complete
   band gap in a much lower frequency region and has a good
   self-collimation effect. Finally, the parameter analysis allows one to
   tailor an auxetic phononic metamaterial with optimal acoustic and
   mechanical properties.}},

Title = {{Hip osteoarthritis signs and symptoms are associated with increased fall

   prospective study}},
Journal = {{ARTHRITIS RESEARCH \& THERAPY}},
Year = {{2021}},

Abstract = {{Background Older adults with concurrent low back and hip pain are
   predisposed to reductions in physical performance and health-related
   quality of life. Yet no study to date has assessed whether or not
   coexisting hip impairments increase fall risk in older adults with
   chronic low back pain (CLBP). The objective of this study was to
   determine if hip osteoarthritis (OA) signs and symptoms per American
   College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria are associated with fall risk
   over a 1-year span. Methods Falls were prospectively monitored for 1
   year via fall calendars. Age, sex, body mass index (BMI), anxiolytic
   use, balance confidence, LBP-related disability, and prior fall history
   were identified as covariates. Hip pain, pain with hip internal rotation
   (IR), hip IR range of motion (ROM) >= 15 degrees, and morning stiffness
   lasting <= 60 min were evaluated at baseline and summed to represent hip
   OA impairment burden. A generalized linear model with a Poisson
   distribution and log link function assessed the association between ACR
   criteria and fall risk beyond established covariates. As a secondary
   analysis, binary logistic regression assessed ACR criteria and the odds
   of falling two or more times within a year. Results Data from
   two-hundred and ten participants were analyzed. Hip OA signs and
   symptoms were present in 97.1\% of the participants, and hip OA
   impairment burden was significantly greater (p < 0.050) in participants
   who fell >= 2 times compared to single and non-fallers. Higher hip OA
   impairment burden was associated with significantly increased fall risk
   (p = 0.001, risk ratio = 1.23, 95\% CI 1.09-1.38) and odds of falling
   multiple times (p < 0.05, odds ratio = 1.41, 95\% CI 1.01-1.95) after
   adjustment for covariates. Conclusions Older adults with CLBP and
   concomitant hip impairments are an at-risk group for falling. Healthcare
   professionals should employ falls screening and preventive measures to
   avoid negative sequelae in this vulnerable population.}},

Title = {{Study on mechanical, electronic and optical properties of Pb-free double

Abstract = {{In recent years, perovskite solar cells have attracted the attention of
   many researchers due to their advantages such as high conversion
   efficiency, simple manufacturing process and low cost, and have become
   an important research direction in the field of new energy batteries. At
   the same time, it is also a very promising new type of solar cells. In
   this paper, the geometric characteristics, mechanical properties,
   electronic properties and optical properties of three perovskites
   In2TiCl6, In2TiBr6 and In2TiI6 were studied by using first-principles.
   The Poisson and Pugh's ratios show the ductile characteristics of
   In2TiX6 (X = Cl, Br, I). The mechanical stability of studied compounds
   has been confirmed by the Born stability criteria. Moreover, the
   thermodynamic stability has been proved by the negative formation
   enthalpy and cohesive energy. In2TiCl6 and In2TiBr6 are indirect band
   gap semiconductors with band gap values 2.15 and 2.12 eV, respectively,
   and In2TiI6 is a direct band gap semiconductor with band gap value 1.24
   eV. Theoretical calculations showed that In2TiI6 has better absorption
   capacity than In2TiCl6 and In2TiBr6 in the near ultraviolet and visible
   light regions. The results demonstrate that the compound In2TiI6 can be
   a potential candidate for excellent light absorbing material.}},

Volume = {{3}},

Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{A new auxetic microstructure is introduced herein by inspiration from an
   Islamic geometric pattern that consists of square array of 8-pointed
   rigid stars interspersed with square array of 4-pointed rigid stars. By
   permitting each star to slide across its adjoining neighbors through
   incorporation of slots and sliders in the stars, an in-plane isotropic
   Poisson's ratio of -1, and hence equi-biaxial strain, is achieved upon
   applied uniaxial compression. Apart from the negativity of Poisson's
   ratio, another counter-intuitive property is the occurrence of global
   rotation of the entire structure relative to the stars during
   compression. Results indicate that when fully compressed, the in-plane
   strain is -0.232 with the accompanying global rotation of 6.18 degrees.
   Without the 4-pointed stars, the system can achieve an in-plane strain
   of -0.288 with a corresponding global rotation of 7.86 degrees.}},

Abstract = {{Using particle swarm optimization (PSO) methodology for crystal
   structure prediction, we predicted a novel two-dimensional (2D)
   monolayer of silicide diphosphorus compound: SiP2, which exhibits good
   stability as examined via cohesive energy, mechanical criteria,
   molecular dynamics simulation and all positive phonon spectrum,
   respectively. The SiP2 monolayer is an indirect semiconductor with the
   band gap as 1.8484 eV (PBE) or 2.681 eV (HSE06), which makes it more
   advantageous for high-frequency-response optoelectronic materials.
   Moreover, the monolayer is a relatively hard auxetic material with
   negative Possion's ratios, and also possesses a ultrahigh carrier
   mobility (1.069 x 10(5) cm(2) V-1 s(-1)) which is approximately four
   times the maximum value in phosphorene and comparable to the value of
   graphene and CP monolayers. Furthermore, the effects of strains on band
   structures and optical properties of SiP2 monolayer have been studied,
   as well as CO2 molecules can be strongly chemically adsorbed on the SiP2
   monolayer. A semiconductor-to-metal transition for -9.5\% strain ratio
   case and a huge optical absorption capacity on the order of 106 cm(-1)
   in visible region present. These theoretical findings endow SiP2
   Monolayer to be a novel 2D material holding great promises for
   applications in high-performance electronics, optoelectronics, mechanics
   and CO2 capturing material. (C) 2020 Chinese Chemical Society and

Abstract = {{In this paper, sandwich plates with flexible core and composite surfaces
   as well as viscoelastic and auxetic core are investigated under dynamic
   loading. A new higher order global-local theory is used for simulation
   of the dynamic behavior of sandwich plates. The presented theory is able
   to consider the thickness change of the sandwich plates as well as
   transverse stresses accurately. It is obvious that considering these
   parameters are so crucial in study behavior of thick sandwich plates or
   sandwich plates with soft core. Furthermore, in terms of solving
   equations, an iterative incremental method based on the formulation of
   transient nonlinear finite element as well as a real time algorithm was
   employed to simulate viscoelastic behavior accurately. The results
   indicate a significant increase in the stiffness of the sandwich plate
   due to the auxetic properties of the core materials, leading
   consequently to the reduction of the vibration amplitude and stresses
   level. Some of the innovations belonging to this paper are: 1)
   presenting a global-local higher-order theory while considering the
   changes in the thickness of the sandwich plates; 2) calculating
   transverse stresses using the three-dimensional elasticity method as
   well as modifying the results obtained from displacement and inertial
   effects based on this method; 3) simulating sandwich plate with
   viscoelastic and auxetic cores; 4) taking orthotropic properties for the
   viscoelastic core into account.}},

Title = {{The 3D-Printed Honeycomb Metamaterials Tubes with Tunable Negative
   Poisson's Ratio for High-Performance Static and Dynamic Mechanical
   Properties}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS}},

Abstract = {{The synthesized understanding of the mechanical properties of negative
   Poisson's ratio (NPR) convex-concave honeycomb tubes (CCHTs) under
   quasi-static and dynamic compression loads is of great significance for
   their multifunctional applications in mechanical, aerospace, aircraft,
   and biomedical fields. In this paper, the quasi-static and dynamic
   compression tests of three kinds of 3D-printed NPR convex-concave
   honeycomb tubes are carried out. The sinusoidal honeycomb wall with
   equal mass is used to replace the cell wall structure of the
   conventional square honeycomb tube (CSHT). The influence of geometric
   morphology on the elastic modulus, peak force, energy absorption, and
   damage mode of the tube was discussed. The experimental results show
   that the NPR, peak force, failure mode, and energy absorption of CCHTs
   can be adjusted by changing the geometric topology of the sinusoidal
   element. Through the reasonable design of NPR, compared with the equal
   mass CSHTs, CCHTs could have the comprehensive advantages of relatively
   high stiffness and strength, enhanced energy absorption, and damage
   resistance. The results of this paper are expected to be meaningful for
   the optimization design of tubular structures widely used in mechanical,
   aerospace, vehicle, biomedical engineering, etc.}},

Title = {{Isogeometric shape optimization of missing rib auxetics with prescribed
   negative Poisson's ratio over large strains using genetic algorithm}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{193}},
Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents an isogeometric shape optimization framework using
   genetic algorithm to design 2D auxetic structures with prescribed
   Poisson's ratio over large tensile or compressive strains in the
   nonlinear deformation regime. The design domain is parametrized using
   NURBS to allow smoother shape variation of the structure and enable
   accurate fabrication of the optimized structures. The versatility of the
   framework is illustrated through the optimization of a missing rib
   structure with four ligaments under different loading conditions. The
   manufacturability of specimens using the NURBS and PolyJet 3D printing
   technology is also shown. The first example focuses on achieving
   constant negative Poisson's ratio up to -0.7 within the applied tensile
   strain of 50\% under plane stress condition. As auxetics experiments
   under large compressive strain are rarely performed and published, the
   second example demonstrates the optimization for compressive loading.
   The Poisson's ratio determined from experiments matches well with the
   numerical results. The experiments highlight that for very flexible
   materials, deformation under self-weight and contacts between adjacent
   unit cells are significant factors in compression, and further
   investigations are needed.}},

   lattice structure}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{193}},
Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{The star-shaped lattice structure is recognized as a typical auxetic
   metamaterial. Unlike the most research focused on the negative Poisson's
   ratio, in this paper the wave propagation behaviour and vibration
   attenuation mechanism of the periodic star-shaped lattice structure are
   studied based on the analytical 16 degrees of freedom (DOF) discrete
   mass-spring model. The dispersion relation and bandgaps of the 16 DOF
   mass-spring model are derived based on lattice dynamics. The dependence
   of the bandgap boundaries on the parameters of configuration angle,
   stiffness, and mass are studied accordingly. It is noteworthy that the
   eigenstate modes investigation reveals that the bandgaps attribute to
   the hybridization of the monopole, dipole, quadrupole, and rotational
   resonance, which is only noticed in multiphase hybrid metamaterials
   before. Most importantly, though examining the eigenstate modes of the
   degeneration points, the low-frequency bandgap between the acoustic and
   optical dispersion curves is opened by tuning the dominant parameters.
   The response of the finite periodic star-shaped lattice shows the
   frequency ranges with high attenuation agree well with complete bandgaps
   predicted by dispersion relation. The star-shaped lattice shows a very
   unique anisotropic solid when the slope of the dispersion curve is
   negative.}},

Journal = {{MATERIALS TODAY COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{26}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{In this research, the effects of negative chemical pressure on various
   physical properties of SrFeO3 were investigated by partially
   substituting larger Mo at smaller Fe-site. The calculated lattice
   parameters exhibited a linear increasing trend according to the Vegard's
   rule with increasing doping of Mo confirmed the existence of negative
   chemical pressure within the compound. The calculated formation enthalpy
   as well as elastic constants that satisfied the Born criteria ensured
   the structural and mechanical stability, respectively, of our system
   under varied doping of Mo. In addition, the mechanical properties,
   including the elastic moduli, Pugh's ratio, Poisson's ratio, hardness,
   and machinability index, were also successfully investigated and
   noticeably affected by the negative chemical pressure induced by doping.
   Moreover, it would be possible to tune the band structure of SrFeO3 by
   partially substituting Mo at Fe-site. The accumulation of electron
   carriers in the vicinity of Fermi level was increased with the increment
   of doping level, which was justified by DOS calculations. More
   interestingly, the flat bands close to the Fermi level predicted the
   superconducting nature of this compound (both undoped and doped) under

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The term liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) describes a class of materials
   that combine the elastic entropy behaviour associated with conventional
   elastomers with the stimuli responsive properties of anisotropic liquid
   crystals. LCEs consequently exhibit attributes of both elastomers and
   liquid crystals, but additionally have unique properties not found in
   either. Recent developments in LCE synthesis, as well as the
   understanding of the behaviour of liquid crystal elastomers-namely their
   mechanical, optical and responsive properties-is of significant
   relevance to biology and biomedicine. LCEs are abundant in nature,
   highlighting the potential use of LCEs in biomimetics. Their exceptional
   tensile properties and biocompatibility have led to research exploring
   their applications in artificial tissue, biological sensors and cell
   scaffolds by exploiting their actuation and shock absorption properties.
   There has also been significant recent interest in using LCEs as a model
   for morphogenesis. This review provides an overview of some aspects of
   LCEs which are of relevance in different branches of biology and
   biomedicine, as well as discussing how recent LCE advances could impact
   future applications.}},

Abstract = {{The Muzhailing extra-long highway tunnel and corresponding inclined
   shafts in Lanzhou, Gansu Province, China passes through structurally
   complex carbonaceous slate that is under high ground stress.
   Rationally-designed and effective support is of high importance for
   achieving safe and efficient tunnel construction. The No. 2 inclined
   shaft of Muzhailing Tunnel was taken as the engineering background
   prototype, for which, a similar model test was conducted to evaluate the
   effect of highly pre-tightened constant resistance (NPR, Negative
   Poisson's Ratio) anchor cable support provision to the geologically
   complex carbonaceous slate at different depths. Two schemes were
   proposed during testing: one scheme was without support and the second
   was with asymmetric support from highly pre-tightened constant
   resistance anchor cable. Digital speckle displacement analysis system
   and micro-ground-stress sensors were employed to measure the deformation
   and shear stress distribution of the tunnel. The results demonstrated
   that through the second support scheme, the deformation of the
   surrounding rock could be effectively ameliorated, while this support
   scheme was applied on the project site of the No.2 inclined shaft, to
   explore the rationality of the scheme through field engineering tests.
   On-site monitoring indicated that the deformation of the surrounding
   rock was within the reasonable design range and the problem of severe
   tunnel deformation was effectively controlled. The research methods and
   related conclusions can be used as a reference for the treatment of
   large deformation problems in deep-buried soft rock tunnels.}},

   Wuchereria bancrofti infection in Culex quinqefasciatus and Anopheles
   species after six rounds of MDA in Masasi District, South Eastern
   Tanzania.MethodsMosquitoes were collected between June and July 2019
   using Center for Diseases Control (CDC) light traps and gravid traps for
   indoor and outdoor respectively. The collected mosquitoes were
   morphologically identified into respective species. Dissections and PCR
   were carried out to detect W. bancrofti infection. Questionnaire survey
   and checklist were used to assess vector control interventions and
   household environment respectively. A Poisson regression model was run
   to determine the effects of household environment on filarial vector
   density.ResultsOverall, 12 452 mosquitoes were collected of which 10 545
   (84.7\%) were filarial vectors. Of these, Anopheles gambiae complex, An.
   funestus group and Cx. quinquefasciatus accounted for 0.1\%, 0.7\% and
   99.2\% respectively. A total of 365 pools of Cx. quinquefasciatus (each
   with 20 mosquitoes) and 46 individual samples of Anopheles species were
   analyzed by PCR. For Cx. quinquefasciatus pools, 33 were positive for W.
   bancrofti, giving an infection rate of 0.5\%, while the 46 samples of
   Anopheles species were all negative. All 1859 dissected mosquitoes
   analyzed by microscopy were also negative. Households with modern
   latrines had less mosquitoes than those with pit latrines {[}odds ratio
   (OR)=0.407, P<0.05]. Houses with unscreened windows had more mosquitoes
   as compared to those with screened windows (OR=2.125, P<0.05). More than
   80\% of the participants own bednets while 16.5\% had no
   protection.ConclusionsLF low transmission is still ongoing in Masasi
   District after six rounds of MDA and vector control interventions. The
   findings also suggest that molecular tools may be essential for
   xenomonitoring LF transmission during elimination phase.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, nanocellulose aerogels with a tunable Poisson's ratio
   were fabricated. Tissue engineering scaffolds with a tunable Poisson's
   ratio may be better able to simulate the mechanical behavior of natural
   tissues. A mixture of cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) and polyethylene
   glycol diacrylate (PEGDA) was used as the raw material to prepare
   CNF/PEGDA aerogels with a multiscale pore structure through a
   combination of stereolithography (SLA) and freeze-drying. The aerogels
   were fabricated with a regular macropore network structure and a random
   and homogeneous distribution of micropores. The macropore structure of
   the scaffolds could be customized through SLA, which resulted in
   scaffolds that exhibited one of three different mechanical behaviors:
   positive Poisson's ratio (PPR), negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) or zero
   Poisson's ratio (ZPR). Then, the hydrogel scaffolds were transformed
   into aerogel scaffolds through the freeze-drying method, which endowed
   the scaffolds with homogeneously distributed micropores. The material
   ratio and exposure were adjusted to obtain scaffolds with a clear pore
   structure. Then, the CNF/PEGDA scaffolds with different Poisson's ratios
   were subjected to mechanical tests, and their chondrogenic induction
   characteristics were determined. The NPR scaffold not only provided a
   good environment for cell growth but also affected mouse bone marrow
   mesenchymal stem cell (mBMSC) proliferation and chondrogenic induction.
   Thus, we provide a feasible scheme for the preparation of
   three-dimensional scaffolds with a multiscale pore structure and tunable
   Poisson's ratio, which contributes to cartilage repair in tissue
   engineering.}},

Title = {{The frequency and severity of crop damage by wildlife in rural Beijing,

Journal = {{FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS}},

Volume = {{124}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{With a continuous expansion of the number and activity of wild animals
   induced by ecological conservation and restoration efforts, the
   human-wildlife conflict is becoming more prominent across China. There
   have been frequent and severe incidents of crop damage caused by
   wildlife. In this paper, we investigate the crop losses caused by
   wildlife in the rural districts of Beijing, using a unique dataset of
   31,573 observations from 2009 to 2017. Through statistical tests on the
   individual coefficients and the overall fitness, we find that a negative
   binomial generalized regression model describes the pattern of crop loss
   events more accurately, compared to an alternative Poisson model. The
   frequency of crop loss events is positively related to a village's
   distance from the river system but negatively associated with the
   distance from woodland, population density, and protective measures
   taken. The predicted frequencies of crop damage events are then used to
   correlate with the amounts of losses at the village level. Based on
   these results, we propose solutions for effective reduction of future
   crop losses and practical assessment of the likely damage compensation
   or insurance premium.}},

Abstract = {{With the generalized gradient approximation, our work presents a
   comparative research for elastic properties, carrier mobility and
   thermodynamic properties of InX (X = O, S, Se, Te) monolayers using
   first principles computational density functional theory (DFT). Among
   the four indium compounds of the same main group, they all show
   isotropic Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio. Among them, the Young's
   modulus and Poisson's ratio of InO are the largest, reaching 79.1 Nm(-1)
   and 0.44, respectively. At the same time, we also calculated the
   cohesive energy of each primitive cell to explain their relationship.
   For the sake of studying the thermodynamic properties, the Helmholtz
   free energy in various area, area change, two-dimension bulk moduli,
   heat capacity of constant pressure and constant volume in different
   temperature are analyzing in detail. The heat capacity of both constant
   pressure and constant volume and thermal expansion coefficient adhere to
   the trend of InTe > InSe > InS > InO in the same temperature. Moreover,
   InO, InS and InSe have the negative thermal expansion coefficient at the
   low temperature. Furthermore, we used the deformation potential theory
   to calculate the carrier mobility, analyzing their elastic constants,
   deformation potential constants, and the effective mass of electrons and
   holes, and found that the effective mass of electrons is isotropic.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials with negative Poisson's ratio are alternatively used

   material with low stress and negative Poisson's ratio is the main topic.
   The peanut pattern can be reduced the weight by decreasing the
   equivalent density. The unit cell of the peanut pattern lattice can be
   drilled with four circle holes. In this study, the auxetic two-dimension
   material with modified peanut pattern is used to study the effect of the
   pattern geometric shape and the equivalent density on the stress and the
   Poisson's ratio. A four-circle punched pattern has been designed with
   the original peanut pattern. The equivalent density will be changed by
   varying their radius lengths. The results show that, the stress and the
   Poisson's ratio can be reduced by increasing the radius length. In the
   other words, by decreasing the equivalent density, the stress and the
   Poison's ratio is decreased. The parabolic relationship between the
   radius length and the stress is found with R-square value more than 0.95
   similar to the relationship between the radius length and the Poissong's
   ratio.}},

Title = {{Micropolar homogenization of wavy tetra-chiral and tetra-achiral
   lattices to identify axial-shear coupling and directional negative
   Poisson's ratio}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{201}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Chiral lattices are generally considered to possess auxetic properties
   with negative Poisson's ratios and high compressibility. However, the
   effects of anisotropy and handedness (chirality) on their mechanical
   properties, such as directional moduli, Poisson's ratio, and other
   coupling effects, are not clearly understood due to the lack of
   analytical methods to handle both anisotropy and chirality. Herein, we
   construct a generalized micropolar homogenization method to characterize
   the elastic constants of tetra-chiral and tetra-achiral lattices having
   different joint types. The developed method can identify the directional
   moduli and Poisson's ratio and coupling effects in the anisotropic wavy
   lattices. The generalized micropolar homogenization of the wavy square
   lattices reveals i) the axial-shear coupling effect of tetra-chiral
   structures, ii) the weak correlation of the chirality of tetra-chiral
   lattices to auxeticity, and iii) the directional positive and negative
   Poisson's ratio of tetra-achiral lattices. This work offers a powerful
   platform for metamaterials' design via geometric reconfiguration of
   lattice structures to adjust both anisotropy and chirality.

Abstract = {{Image reconstruction algorithms were developed for radiation source
   mapping and used for generating the search path of a moving radiation
   detector, such as one onboard an unmanned aerial vehicle. Simulations
   consisted of first assuming radioactive sources of varying complexity
   and estimating the radiation fields that would then be produced by that
   source distribution. Next, the ``measurements{''} that would result from
   a pair of adjacent spatial locations were computed. A crude estimate of
   the source distribution likely to have produced such ``measurements{''}
   was reconstructed based upon the limited measurements. Location of the
   next ``measurement{''} was then determined as halfway between the
   location of the estimated source and the current ``measurement.{''} With
   each additional sample, improved source distribution reconstructions
   were made and used to inform the immediate direction of detector motion.
   Source reconstruction or mapping was formulated as an inverse problem
   solved with either maximum a posteriori or least squares (LS) regression
   deconvolution methods. Different amounts of noise were added to the
   simulated ``measurements,{''} allowing evaluation of the methods'
   performances as functions of signal-to-noise ratio of the measured map.
   As expected, methods that promote sparsity were better suited in
   reconstructing point sources. Reliable prior information of the source
   distribution also improved the reconstruction results, especially with
   distributed sources. With a non-negative least square algorithm and the
   suggested paths it generated, location of sources was successfully
   estimated to an accuracy of 0.014 m within nine iterations in a
   single-source scenario and 12 iterations in a two-source scenario, given
   a 10\% error on the integrated counts and a Poisson distribution of the
   noise associated with the measured counts.}},

Title = {{Buckling and postbuckling of extensible, shear-deformable beams: Some
   exact solutions and new insights}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents exact solutions for the buckling loads and
   postbuckling states of extensible, shear deformable beams. The governing
   equation for the large-amplitude lateral deformation of beams in
   compression is expanded in Taylor series up to the cubic nonlinearity.
   Closed-form solutions in terms of the axial and shear stiffnesses are
   developed for statically determinate and statically indeterminate beams.
   Namely, pinned-pinned, cantilevered, clamped-clamped, and clamped-pinned
   beams are considered with the loaded end is a roller that is able to
   slide. The postbuckling response under a given axial load is exactly
   derived. The dependence of the buckling load on the length-to-radius of
   gyration is discussed. It is shown that the extensibility and the shear
   deformation significantly affect the buckling loads and the postbuckling
   response. For conventional materials with positive Poisson's ratio, the
   inclusion of the axial and shear deformation results in a meaningful
   reduction of the buckling load. It is further shown that the buckling
   load can be enhanced by designing artificial metamaterials materials
   with an effective negative Poisson's ratio.}},

Abstract = {{A flexible semiparametric class of models is introduced that offers an
   alternative to classical regression models for count data as the Poisson

   parametric term that specifies the effect of explanatory variables. In
   addition, an extended version is considered, in which the effects of
   covariates are specified nonparametrically. The proposed model and

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED MECHANICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{88}},
Number = {{3, SI}},
Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{The entropy inequality, commonly taken as an axiom of continuum
   mechanics, is found to be spontaneously violated in macroscopic granular
   media undergoing collisional dynamics. The result falls within the
   fluctuation theorem of nonequilibrium thermodynamics, which is known to
   replace the Second Law for finite systems. This phenomenon amounts to
   the system stochastically displaying negative increments of entropy. The
   focus is on granular media in Couette flows, consisting of monosized
   circular disks (with 10 to 104 disks of diameters 0.01 m to 1 m) with
   frictional-Hookean contacts simulated by molecular dynamics accounting
   for micropolar effects. Overall, it is determined that the probability
   of negative entropy increments diminishes with the Eulerian velocity
   gradient increasing, while it tends to increase in a sigmoidal fashion
   with the Young modulus of disks increasing. This behavior is examined
   for a very wide range of known materials: from the softest polymers to
   the stiffest (i.e., carbyne). The disks' Poisson ratio is found to have
   a weak effect on the probability of occurrence of negative entropy
   increments.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study is to analyze the impact behavior on the

   hand lay-up using epoxy resin. Negative Poisson ratio of the reinforcing

   developed. Results obtained by drop weight dart impact test show that
   the impact experiment with different impact loads confirmed the auxetic
   composites, regardless de material composition, have an increase in the
   total energy absorption compared to jersey reinforced composite,
   approximately 2.5 and 4 times more for para-aramid and hybrid composite,

Title = {{Extreme values of Young's modulus of tetragonal crystals}},
Journal = {{MECHANICS OF MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{154}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The extreme values of Young's modulus for sixand seven-constant
   tetragonal crystals are found using the necessary and sufficient
   conditions for the extrema of the functions of two variables.
   Theoretical and numerical analyzes of stationary and extreme values are
   performed based on experimental data on elastic constants collected in
   the Landolt-Bornstein reference book. Five such Young's moduli are
   formed in the case of six constant and seven-constant tetragonal
   crystals. It is found how the stationary and extremal values of Young's
   modulus depend on three anisotropy coefficients that disappear in the
   limit of an isotropic material. Simple analytical dependences of some
   stationary and extreme values of Young's moduli of six-constant crystals
   are obtained. In the case of stationary values of Young's modulus of
   seven-constant tetragonal crystals, the coefficients included in the
   sufficient conditions for the extremum of the function of two variables
   are estimated numerically. Tetragonal crystals (Hg2I2, Hg2Br2, Hg2Cl2,
   TeO2, (NH2)(2)CO, LiY0.5Tb0.5F4 and C(CH2OH)(4)) with a large difference
   between the maximum and minimum values of Young's modulus are revealed.
   It is shown that six-constant tetragonal crystals may have a greater
   difference between global extrema than seven-constant tetragonal
   crystals. It is found that six-constant tetragonal crystals with a large
   difference between the global extrema of Young's modulus have a negative
   Poisson's ratio. In the case of seven-constant tetragonal crystals, such
   relationship has not been identified. A classification scheme based on
   the dependence of three stationary values of Young's modulus on two
   dimensionless parameters is proposed.}},

   Poisson's ratio and enhanced energy absorption}},
Journal = {{THIN-WALLED STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{160}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{In order to improve the energy absorption capacity of the honeycomb, a
   combined auxetic honeycomb is designed in this paper. By using the
   double-inclined walls replacing the horizontal walls of the star-shaped
   honeycomb (SSH), and introducing a thin-walled circle contacting with
   the four concave corners of the SSH, the star-circle honeycomb (SCH) is
   designed. The in-plane dynamic crushing behaviors was explored based on
   finite element method (FEM). There are three types of deformation modes
   observed with different impact velocity, including low-, medium- and
   high-velocity loading modes and the stress-strain curve exhibits two
   plateau stress stages. Based on the deformation characteristics of the
   representative unit, theoretical calculation models were established to
   estimate the plateau stress of the SCH under lowand high-velocity
   loading according the conservation of energy and the theoretical
   calculation was in keep well with the numerical simulation. A
   deformation modes map was summarized to investigate the effects of the
   impact velocity and the relative density on the deformation modes and
   the energy absorption capability and the dynamic Poisson's ratio were
   studied. The result shows that the SCH presents better energy absorption
   compared with SSH as well as retaining the negative Poisson's ratio
   property. The deformation mechanism was revealed form the structural
   design and plastic hinge dissipation. This work presents a different
   design strategy for the auxetic honeycomb, expected to guide the design
   of more novel auxetic with better energy absorption and mechanical
   property.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose an origami-based auxetic tunable Helmholtz
   resonator by controlling the volume of the cavity to allow a real-time
   tunability of the resonance frequency. The design is inspired by the
   waterbomb origami base, which expands when stretched and contracts when
   compressed. Such a foldable structure offers a wide range of volume
   variation, which corresponds to a larger frequency shift in the
   bandwidth of interest. Based on the design of the origami resonator,
   multi-physical models are established to understand and predict the
   parameters' effect on the device's behavior. After fabrication,
   experimental tests are conducted on physical prototypes to validate the
   models and illustrate the effectiveness of the concept.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic (negative Poisson's ratio) and gradient open cell foams have
   shown promise for their conformability and high impact energy

   the cell structure of auxetic closed cell foam, to produce novel
   intentionally anisotropic and gradient auxetic closed cell foam. Pins
   passed through the foam constrained or stretched regions during steaming
   to further modify cell structure, and impart gradients in cell
   structure, Young's modulus and Poisson's ratios. Fabricated foams had
   Poisson's ratios between 1 and -1. Imparted Young's moduli of 1-12 MPa
   were similar to foams used in footwear, prosthesis, helmets and other
   impact protection. The effect of changes to cell structure on Young's
   moduli and Poisson's ratio are explained by combining analytical models
   of auxetic open cell and conventional closed cell foam.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Rotating squares auxetic metamaterials have the peculiar feature of a
   negative Poisson's ratio. This work proposes and examines how an
   innovative variable arcs fillet solution, at the interconnection regions
   between the rotating units, improves the structural response of a
   titanium alloy-based rotating squares metamaterial. Through a 2D finite
   element (FE) model of the auxetic structure, we investigated and
   optimized two fillet configurations: first, a double circular arcs
   profile; second, a combined elliptical and circular arc fillet.
   According to the FE results, the optimal configuration of the combined
   elliptical and circular arc fillet allows an overall 3\% elastic strain
   of the metamaterial, with a Poisson's ratio (PR) equal to ca. -1. In
   order to assess the deformation behavior of the proposed metamaterial,
   we performed a tensile test on a prototype of the optimal solution, 3D
   printed in Onyx material. The experimental displacement field of the
   specimen, measured through digital image correlation, exhibited
   excellent agreement with the FE predictions, with a PR equal to ca. -1
   up to a 3\% overall strain.}},

   graphene nanoplatelets reinforcement}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{259}},
Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{Nowadays, sandwich plates with cellular core structures are gaining the
   attention of researchers owing to their outstanding features. For a
   better insight into auxetic structures, in this study, we propose an
   excellent computational approach based on polygonal meshes to
   comprehensively examine the free vibration, buckling and dynamic
   instability behaviors of the auxetic honeycomb sandwich plate
   structures. A generalized C-0-type higher-order shear deformation theory
   (C-0-HSDT) in conjunction with both Laplace and quadratic serendipity
   shape functions is employed to approximate the strain fields for
   polygonal plate elements. The sandwich plate structures are constituted
   by an auxetic honeycomb core layer with negative Poisson's ratio and two
   skin layers reinforced by graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs). Ultra-light
   features of the plate structures can be obtained by using the auxetic
   honeycomb cells with negative Poisson's ratio while the GNPs are
   embedded into skin layers to enhance the structural stiffness. In order
   to determine the dynamic instability region of the sandwich plate,
   Bolotin's approach is utilized in the current research. Several
   numerical examples are carried out to investigate the influences of
   geometrical parameters of auxetic cell and GNPs reinforcement on the
   structural behaviors. The results obtained in the current research can
   be considered as benchmark ones to investigate auxetic sandwich plate
   structures.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF SOLIDS}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{H2O ice is known to exist as a number of different polymorphs. One such
   polymorph is ice X, a symmetrical phase of ice which is known to be
   stable at high pressures and low temperatures. In this work, the
   mechanical properties of ice X have been studied through DFT
   simulations, and it has been shown that ice X has the potential to
   exhibit auxetic behaviour (negative Poisson's ratio) at 45 degrees
   off-axis in the (100), (010) and (001) planes. Studying the deformation
   of two orthogonally interconnected rhombi has shown that this predicted
   negative Poisson's ratio can be attributed to the interplay between
   distortion and hinging of these rhombi. Moreover, it has been shown that
   the auxetic potential of ice X increases with an increase in hydrostatic
   pressure, which behaviour is explained by the rhombi approaching
   quasi-perfect behaviour resulting in a decrease in the distortion of the
   rhombi and an increase in hinging mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{A new two dimensional carbon allotrope TPDH-graphene
   (Tetra-Penta-Deca-Hexagonal-graphene) belonging to the
   tetragonal-pentagonal carbon ring family is proposed in this work using
   density-functional method. The allotrope satisfies all the conditions of
   structural stability. This allotrope has lower cohesive energy than many
   existing planar carbon allotropes. It can withstand temperature as high
   as 1000 K without loosing its structural integrity. However, its
   electronic structure reflects metallic character due to delocalised p,
   orbital near the Fermi level. Further, this mechanically stable
   elastically anisotropic structure shows directional variation of
   In-plane Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio. It is stronger than
   graphene in a particular direction. Moreover, The material can be
   identified by four characteristic peaks in the electron energy loss
   spectra within 10 eV energy. It has optical reflectance peaks in the
   visible range at similar to 600 nm yellow colour. Interestingly, some
   nanoribbons of this material show semimetallic, semiconducting and
   metallic behaviour. Non-equilibrium Green's function method along with
   density-functional theory is employed to study the nanodevices made of
   these nanoribbons. Strong current regulation property and robust
   negative differential resistance effect with a peak-to-valley ratio 3.3
   are observed in two nanodevices making TPDH-graphene an attractive
   material for use in nanoelectronics.}},

Abstract = {{The elastic anisotropy and thermodynamic properties of MB12 (M = Hf, Y,

   possesses the lowest one. The 3D contours of the Young's modulus of four
   materials are very similar at both 0 GPa and 100 GPa. Also, pressure can
   increase the anisotropy for MB12 compounds. The pressure and temperature
   dependence of the heat capacity, thermal expansion coefficient and Debye
   temperature of MB12 compounds are also comprehensively discussed. These
   findings are of great value for the applications of these
   multifunctional materials in electromechanical and medical engineering.

Abstract = {{This study presents the compression response of additively manufactured
   novel soft porous structures with architected microstructure. Six porous
   additively manufactured architected periodic structures with two-fold
   and four-fold symmetry were considered. The effect of pore shape and
   fold symmetry of microstructure on the non-linear response of a square
   array of architected pores in a soft polymeric matrix is experimentally
   investigated. The digital image correlation (DIC) is used for
   investigating the evolution of strains and deformation during uniaxial
   tensile tests and compression tests of porous structures. Compression
   induced instability lead to negative Poisson's ratio, and compaction of
   porous structures, which is found to depend not only on the shape of the
   architecture but also the fold symmetry exists in the microstructure's
   unit cell. Unique architectures with multiple buckling modes and shape
   transformation are also observed. Two-fold symmetry structures are found
   to buckle at lower strains compared to the four-fold symmetric structure
   at the same porosity level and produced high compaction and negative
   Poisson's ratio. The results showed that in addition to pore shape, the
   fold symmetry could be used effectively to design a new class of soft,
   active, and reconfigurable devices over a wide range of length scales
   with desired characteristics.}},

   Fatality Ratio in the USA: a Negative Binomial and GIS-Based Analysis}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF RACIAL AND ETHNIC HEALTH DISPARITIES}},
Abstract = {{The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has exacerbated inequality in
   the United States of America (USA). Black, indigenous, and people of
   color (BIPOC) are disproportionately affected by the pandemic. This
   study examines determinants of COVID-19 case fatality ratio (CFR) based
   on publicly sourced data from January 1 to December 18, 2020, and
   sociodemographic and rural-urban continuum data from the US Census
   Bureau. Nonspatial negative binomial Poisson regression and
   geographically weighted Poisson regression were applied to estimate the
   global and local relationships between the CFR and
   predictors-rural-urban continuum, political inclination, and
   race/ethnicity in 2407 rural counties. The mean COVID-19 CFR among rural
   counties was 1.79 (standard deviation (SD) = 1.07; 95\% CI 1.73-1.84)
   higher than the total US counties (M = 1.69, SD = 1.18; 95\% CI:
   1.65-1.73). Based on the global NB model, CFR was positively associated
   with counties classified as ``completely rural{''} (incidence rate ratio
   (IRR) = 1.24; 95\% CI: 1.12-1.39) and ``mostly rural{''} (IRR = 1.26;
   95\% CI: 1.15-1.38) relative to ``mostly urban{''} counties. Nonspatial
   regression indicates that COVID-19 CFR increases by a factor of 8.62,
   5.87, 2.61, and 1.36 for one unit increase in county-level percent
   Blacks, Hispanics, American Indians, and Asian/Pacific Islanders,
   respectively. Local spatial regression shows CFR was significantly
   higher in rural counties with a higher share of BIPOC in the Northeast
   and Midwest regions, and political inclination predicted COVID-19 CFR in
   rural counties in the Midwest region. In conclusion, spatial and
   racial/ethnic disparities exist for COVID-19 CFR across the US rural
   counties, and findings from this study have implications for public
   health.}},

Abstract = {{Complex mechanical behaviours are generally met in macroscopically
   homogeneous media as effects of inelastic responses or as results of
   unconventional material properties, which are postulated or due to
   structural systems at the meso/micro-scale. Examples are strain
   localization due to plasticity or damage and metamaterials exhibiting
   negative Poisson's ratios resulting from special porous, eventually
   buckling, sub-structures. In this work, through ad hoc conceived
   mechanical paradigms, we show that several non-standard behaviours can
   be obtained simultaneously by accounting for kinematical
   discontinuities, without invoking inelastic laws or initial voids. By
   allowing mutual sliding among rigid tesserae connected by pre-stressed
   hyperelastic links, we find several unusual kinematics such as localized
   shear modes and tensile buckling-induced instabilities, leading to
   deck-of-cards deformations-uncapturable with classical continuum
   models-and unprecedented `bulky' auxeticity emerging from a densely
   packed, geometrically symmetrical ensemble of discrete units that deform
   in a chiral way. Finally, after providing some analytical solutions and
   inequalities of mechanical interest, we pass to the limit of an infinite
   number of tesserae of infinitesimal size, thus transiting from discrete
   to continuum, without the need to introduce characteristic lengths. In
   the light of the theory of structured deformations, this result
   demonstrates that the proposed architectured material is nothing else
   than the first biaxial paradigm of structured continuum-a body that
   projects, at the macroscopic scale, geometrical changes and
   disarrangements occurring at the level of its sub-macroscopic elements.}},

Abstract = {{Deployable geometries are finite auxetic structures that preserve their
   overall shapes during expansion and contraction. The topological
   behaviors emerge from intricately arranged elements and their
   connections. Despite the considerable utility of such configurations in
   nature and in engineering, deployable nanostructures have never been
   demonstrated. Here a deployable flight ring, a simplified planar
   structure of Hoberman sphere is shown, using DNA origami. The DNA flight
   ring consists of topologically assembled six triangles in two layers
   that can slide against each other, thereby switching between two
   distinct (open and closed) states. The origami topology is a trefoil
   knot, and its auxetic reconfiguration results in negative Poisson's
   ratios. This work shows the feasibility of deployable nanostructures,
   providing a versatile platform for topological studies and opening new
   opportunities for bioengineering.}},

Abstract = {{Architectured materials exhibit negative Poisson's ratios and enhanced

   behaviors emerge from periodic cellular structures regardless of the

   top-down approaches and macroscopic with unit cells of microns or
   larger. There are also molecular auxetics including natural crystals
   which are not designable. There is a gap from few nanometers to microns,
   which may be filled by biomolecular self-assembly. Herein, we
   demonstrate two-dimensional auxetic nanostructures using DNA origami.
   Structural reconfigurations are performed by two-step DNA reactions and
   complemented by mechanical deformation studies using molecular dynamics
   simulations. We find that the auxetic behaviors are mostly defined by
   geometrical designs, yet the properties of the materials also play an
   important role. From elasticity theory, we introduce design principles

Abstract = {{In this study, the ultra-low porous auxetic piezoelectric composite made
   of lead zirconate titanate (PZT) and hollow polyvinylidine difluoride
   (PVDF) is first proposed by combining ``additive{''} and
   ``subtractive{''} approaches. The electromechanical properties of the
   auxetic piezoelectric composite are investigated by finite element
   analysis. It is found that the ultra-low porosity in the composite may
   lead to great extensibility along with the excellent figures of merit
   obtained in conventional highly porous piezoelectric ceramics. The small
   amount of additional PVDF can greatly tune the electromechanical
   properties of composite and effectively reduce the maximum stress of
   PZT. To elucidate the role of Poisson's ratio on the electromechanical
   properties of piezoelectric materials, the relationship expressions
   among some electromechanical coefficients are derived. Moreover, the
   semi-empirical expression of ``longitudinal{''} compliance coefficients
   and a simple strategy for predicting some electromechanical coefficients
   are presented to instruct design and application of the ultra-low porous
   auxetic piezoelectric materials.}},

Abstract = {{The existence of a new two dimensional CN2 structure was predicted using
   ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) and density-functional theory
   calculations. It consists of tetragonal and hexagonal rings with C-N and
   N-N bonds arranged in a buckling plane, isostructural to the
   tetrahex-carbon allotrope. It is thermodynamically and kinetically
   stable suggested by its phonon spectrum and AIMD. This nanosheet has a
   high concentration of N and contains N-N single bonds with an energy
   density of 6.3 kJ g(-1), indicating its potential applications as a high
   energy density material. It possesses exotic mechanical properties with
   a negative Poisson's ratio and an anisotropic Young's modulus. The
   modulus in the zigzag direction is predicted to be 340 N m(-1), stiffer
   than those of h-BN and penta-CN2 sheets and comparable to that of
   graphene. Its ideal strength of 28.8 N m(-1) outperforms that of
   penta-graphene. The material maintains phonon stability upon the
   application of uniaxial strain up to 10\% (13\%) in the zigzag
   (armchair) direction or biaxial strain up to 5\%. It possesses a wide
   indirect HSE band gap of 4.57 eV, which is tunable between 3.37-4.57 eV
   through strain. Double-layered structures are also explored. Such unique
   properties may facilitate its potential applications as a high energy
   density material and in nanomechanics and electronics.}},

Abstract = {{The stability and geometrical, mechanical, and electronic properties of
   monolayer carbon sulfur (CS) systems with honeycomb-like structure are
   studied by using first-principles calculations based on density
   functional theory. The results demonstrate that the honeycomb-like CS
   systems with two types of structure (buckled and puckered) are quite
   stable. It is found that such puckered and buckled CS nanosheets possess
   indirect gaps of 1.952 and 2.325 eV, respectively. Interestingly, both
   puckered and buckled CS monolayer materials exhibit negative
   out-of-plane Poisson's ratio, most likely originating from their
   puckered and buckled nature. Moreover, their bandgap can be effectively
   modulated by altering bond and bond lengths under uni- and biaxial
   strains. Meanwhile, an indirect-to-direct gap transition occurs in both
   monolayers, which is a useful feature for addressing the electron
   transition difficulties observed for intrinsic indirect nanosheets,
   thereby enabling their use in solar cells and light-emitting diodes. In
   particular, the Dirac-like cones of the puckered CS monolayer are
   identified in the band structure on the application of appropriate
   zigzag tensile strain. The results of the present calculations are very
   interesting for the selection of monolayer CS materials for use in
   electronic devices and provide a promising method to engineer their
   electronic characteristics for potential applications in future
   electronic and optoelectronic devices.}},

   are accomplished for three phases to obtain the most stable phase. The
   results of these calculations revealed that Type-III is the most stable

   density of states (DOS) and band structures are also presented. The
   obtained total magnetic moment (MM) is negative for LiRhSb, LiRuSb,
   LiRhTe, LiRuTe, while it is positive for LiRhSe, LiRuSe, LiRhAs, LiRuAs

Abstract = {{Occurrence of toppling failure has been prominent due to the increasing
   of infrastructure construction, such as road slopes, dams, and
   hydroelectric stations. Many scholars have done research on the toppling
   failure characteristics, but paid less attention to the comparison of
   numerical simulations and physical models in order to propose reasonable
   and effective stability control methods. Based on previous tests on
   physical model and field investigations, a numerical model of an
   anaclinal slope using the three-dimension distinct element code (3DEC)
   software has been built to simulate the failure process of the physical
   model. Based on the prominent mechanical properties of the
   engineering-scale and model-scale negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) cables,
   a numerical simulation model of the NPR cable has been developed. The
   numerical model has been used to simulate the effects of different types
   of model-scale cables on controlling the deformation of the anaclinal
   slope. The numerical results show that standard cables, i.e., Poisson's
   ratio (PR) cables, cannot control the large deformations of the slope,
   and the slope finally fails. On the opposite, NPR cables can absorb the
   deformation energy and maintain the stable constant resistance force
   during the tensile process. This thereby allows avoiding tensile
   breakage of cables under the effect of large deformations of the slope
   and driving the slope towards a new equilibrium state. Through the
   comparison between the numerical simulation results and the physical
   model test results, the accuracy and rationality of the numerical
   simulations have been proven. The numerical model developed in this
   study can be used for future research works on the failure mechanism of
   anaclinal slopes and the control effect of NPR cables. It thereby lays a
   foundation for applying the NPR cables to control the toppling
   deformations of similar anaclinal slopes.}},

Abstract = {{Structural phase transitions between semiconductors and topological
   insulators have rich applications in nanoelectronics but are rarely
   found in two-dimensional (2D) materials. In this work, by combining ab
   initio computations and evolutionary structure search, we investigate
   two stable 2D forms of gold(I) telluride (Au2Te) with square symmetry,
   noted as s(I)- and s(II)-Au2Te. s(II)-Au2Te is the global minimum
   structure and is a room-temperature topological insulator. s(I)-Au2Te is
   a direct-gap semiconductor with high carrier mobilities and unusual
   in-plane negative Poisson's ratio. Both s(I) and s(II) phases have
   ultralow Young's modulus, implying high flexibility. By applying a small
   tensile strain, s(II)-Au2Te can be transformed into s(I)-Au2Te. Hence, a
   structural phase transition from a room-temperature topological
   insulator to an auxetic semiconductor is found in the 2D forms of Au2Te,
   which enables potential applications in phase-change electronic devices.
   Moreover, we elucidate the mechanism of the phase transition with the
   help of phonon spectra and group theory analysis.}},

   absorption capacity optimizes. The two models with the highest energy
   absorption capacity are then selected for experimental investigation and
   produced by additive manufacturing from a polymer. To further enhance
   the mechanical properties, the specimens are electrochemically coated
   with nickel and the polymer molten out by pyrolysis. Those Ni/polymer
   hybrids are subjected to quasistatic and dynamic impact experiments.
   Only a small strain rate sensitivity can be detected under dynamic
   loading, namely, a higher plastic collapse and higher plateau stress.
   The hollow struts are folding instead of bending, which render them much
   weaker than predicted by the simulation. In conclusion, it is possible
   to improve existing crash absorber elements with tailored auxetic hybrid
   structures. They absorb higher amounts of energy without changing their
   stiffness under dynamic loading while saving mass and cost.}},

Abstract = {{Although epitaxial strain imparted by lattice mismatch between a film
   and the underlying substrate has led to distinct structures and emergent
   functionalities, the discrete lattice parameters of limited substrates,
   combined with strain relaxations driven by film thickness, result in
   severe obstructions to subtly regulate electro-elastic coupling
   properties in perovskite ferroelectric films. Here a practical and
   universal method to achieve highly strained phases with large tetragonal
   distortions in Pb-based ferroelectric films through synergetic effects
   of moderately (approximate to 1.0\%) misfit strains and laser fluences
   during pulsed laser deposition process is demonstrated. The phase
   possesses unexpectedly large Poisson's ratio and negative thermal
   expansion, and concomitant enhancements of spontaneous polarization
   (approximate to 100 mu C cm(-2)) and Curie temperature (approximate to
   800 degrees C), 40\% and 75\% larger than that of bulk counterparts,
   respectively. This strategy efficiently circumvents the long-standing
   issue of limited numbers of discrete substrates and enables continuous
   regulations of exploitable lattice states in functional oxide films with
   tightly elastic coupled performances beyond their present levels.}},

Title = {{Anomalous elastic response of a 3D anti - tetrachiral metamaterial}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{192}},
Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{The elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio of a 3D anti-tetrachiral (3ATC)
   metamaterial design was investigated using an exact analytical model,
   finite element simulations and experiments on additively manufactured
   Ti6Al4V lattices. The 3ATC structure was found to undergo a unique
   symmetric-to-asymmetric transition as the number of unit cells in the
   lattice decreases, an observation that has not been reported to date. A
   reduced lattice size also increases the influence of shear forces
   introduced by the fixed boundary conditions, which can lead to a higher
   elastic modulus in certain orientations and reduce it in others. These
   shear forces also drive the joints in small lattices into an
   out-of-plane rotation that causes the Poisson's ratio of such structures
   to range from -1.2 to 1 for different relative densities, in contrast to
   a constant value of -0.5 for bulk 3ATC lattices that do not undergo this
   joint twisting. Our results strongly indicate that the 3ATC structure
   belongs to a new `rotation-dominated' geometric class in the Ashby
   framework for cellular materials, in addition to the well-established
   bending- and stretch- dominated topologies. The main contributor of
   strain for this class of materials is rigid joint rotation, with novel,
   distinctive traits such as a nonlinear elastic stress-strain response
   and multiple relative modulus vs. relative density relationships. For
   the 3ATC structure, one of these relations is linear, similar to
   stretch-dominated structures, while the other is disjointed and does not
   follow the power law, which is atypical of a cellular material.}},

   Cloud Service Platform of Monitoring of the Soft Rock Tunnel}},
Journal = {{GEOFLUIDS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{2021}},
Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{Throughout engineering construction, large deformation disasters in soft
   rock tunnels are encountered increasingly frequently. Therefore,
   structural health monitoring not only ensures accurate construction
   management but also provides a basis for dynamic adjustment of the
   support structure. The existing monitoring technology has certain
   shortcomings, such as poor anti-interference ability, non-real-time
   operation, and great security risks. Consequently, high-precision
   real-time monitoring has become a key scientific issue in tunnel
   engineering. For this work, multisource information fusion technology
   was adopted, while data security reserve systems, such as cloud server
   (ECS) based on the fiber Bragg grating multisource sensing system, cloud
   database (RDS), and cloud website, were embedded into the No. 2 inclined
   shaft of the Muzhailing tunnel. Based on the negative Poisson's ratio
   (NPR) anchor cable control technology for large deformation of the soft
   rock in the No. 2 inclined shaft of the Muzhailing tunnel, reasonable
   and effective intelligent monitoring was carried out for tunnel
   construction. Monitoring and early warning cloud service platforms,
   based on the Internet of Things and cloud technology, could quickly
   produce query and statistic tunnel monitoring information. The
   monitoring system provided the collection, transmission, storage,
   processing, and early warning information sending of data, such as NPR
   anchor cable axial force, steel arch stress, deep surrounding rock
   displacement, surrounding rock deformation, and contact pressure between
   primary support with secondary lining. This monitoring system ensured
   construction safety and provided monitoring application case support for
   the related problems of similar projects.}},

Abstract = {{The conventional magnetostrictive strain sensor suffers from low
   detection sensitivity. In this study, a wireless and passive
   magnetostrictive strain sensor with improved sensitivity was proposed,
   modelled, analyzed, and tested. A hollow plate with a negative Poisson's
   ratio structure was taken as the substrate, substituting this for the
   conventional positive Poisson's ratio material. An analysis model was
   established for the negative Poisson's ratio substrate. Finite element
   method (FEM) analysis was conducted to verify the negative Poisson's
   ratio model. Experiments were carried out to prove the sensitivity
   enhancement principle. Parametric studies were conducted to investigate
   the influence of the geometry dimension on the output of the electric
   signal. We show that the proposed sensor has an improved strain test
   sensitivity of up to 176.3\%. The experimental results further indicate
   that different geometry dimensions of the negative Poisson's ratio have
   different influences on the sensitivity of the magnetostrictive strain
   sensor. The proposed magnetostrictive strain sensor shows the advantages
   of high sensitivity, easy implementation, convenient fabrication, and

Abstract = {{The origin of negative Poisson's ratio in rutile-type oxides and

   structure via elastic beams. Analytical expressions for the effective
   Poisson's ratio and compressibility are derived and validated by finite
   element computations. Numerical results indicate that the material can
   exhibit simultaneously negative Poisson's ratio and negative linear,

   conformed experimentally, and the parametric spaces leading to negative
   compressibilities are identified explicitly.

Title = {{Anisotropic elasticity drives negative thermal expansion in
   monocrystalline SnSe}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{103}},

Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{Negative thermal expansion (NTE) materials have been at the center of
   attention for the past few decades as thermal expansion compensators in
   the fields of engineering, photonics, electronics, and medicine.
   Numerous crystalline materials exhibit NTE, wherein a combination of
   positive and negative linear thermal expansion coefficients results from
   their highly anisotropic elasticity. In this study, we selected SnSe, an
   anisotropic uniaxial NTE material as a model system where theoretical
   studies have linked its NTE along the c direction to transverse phonons
   and to positive Gruneisen parameters along all crystallographic axes.
   However, the fundamental origin of NTE in SnSe have not been
   experimentally resolved. Here we performed temperature-dependent
   resonant ultrasound spectroscopy (between 295-773 K) on
   single-crystalline SnSe to experimentally measure all nine independent
   elastic constants (C-11, C-22, C-33, C-44, C-55, C-66, C-12, C-13,
   C-23). Our data revealed a high degree of anisotropy in the
   temperature-dependent elastic constants with shear anisotropic factors
   show a contrasting pattern with increasing temperature. From this data
   we also deduced its material compressibility and negative Poisson's
   ratios in the major crystallographic directions that could explain its
   colossal linear thermal expansion coefficient along the c direction,
   reaching similar to-12 x 10(-5) K-1 at 773 K as reported in this study.
   Furthermore, we confirmed positive Gruneisen parameters along all the
   crystallographic axes and observe that SnSe behaves like a
   semicompressible parallelepiped with elastically coupled a and b axes,
   with the NTE being driven by the displacement of Sn atoms in the c

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{854}},
Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{In present study, the negative chemical pressure effect on SrMoO3
   molybdate system has been demonstrated with the help of substitution
   based strategy employing density functional theory (DFT) for the first
   time. We have observed that it is possible to tune band structure (BS)
   in a controlled manner by introducing higher ionic Barium (Ba) to the
   lower ionic Strontium (Sr) site by controlling doping content. We have
   noticed an interesting correlation among BS, covalency strength and
   negative chemical pressure. Equally important, elastic, mechanical and
   direction dependency of our system also can be correlated with negative
   chemical pressure and can be tuned effectively with doping amount. It
   can be noticed that the anisotropy of our system under study is
   significantly dependent on elastic constant C-11 and prominent
   anisotropy can be observed in the Poisson ratio than the Shear modulus
   in all the cases. We have predicted an effective way of describing the
   phase and compression of a disordered system using elastic constant
   employing the theoretical and graphical (2D and 3D) anisotropy
   measurement techniques which can be a guidance for future research using
   DFT. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Influence of re-entrant hexagonal structure and helical auxetic yarn on
   the tensile and auxetic behavior of parametric fabrics}},
Journal = {{TEXTILE RESEARCH JOURNAL}},
Abstract = {{This paper focuses on systematically analyzing the influence of macro
   fabric structure and yarn architecture on the mechanical and auxetic
   performance of parametric auxetic fabrics. Re-entrant hexagonal (REH)
   and helical auxetic yarn (HAY) were adopted as a macro fabric structure
   and weft yarn to produce three kinds of auxetic fabrics: REH fabric with
   HAY as weft yarn (REH-HAY); REH fabric with elastic yarn as weft yarn
   (REH-1, REH-2, REH-3); and plain fabric with HAY as weft yarn
   (NREH-HAY). By controlling the existence of the HAY and REH structure,
   the influence of the REH structure and HAY on the mechanical and auxetic
   properties was thoroughly analyzed. It is demonstrated that both the REH
   macrostructure and HAY micro configuration can contribute to the
   performance of the auxetic fabric. Specifically, in the presence of the
   REH structure and HAY, the auxeticity was found to a 77\% increase
   compared with NREH-HAY and the breaking strain and load rises by about
   37.50\% and 90.42\%, respectively. Notably, the variation of the
   polyurethane (PU) weft yarn per unit length influenced the tensile and
   auxetic performance to a lesser extent, while by changing PU to HAY, a
   significant increase of negative Poisson's ratio value from -1.155 to
   -1.492 was noticed without greatly jeopardizing the stretchability.
   Furthermore, the cyclic tensile results demonstrate the stability and
   elasticity of the fabric. The comparative analysis can give guidance to
   optimize fabric design and inspire the innovative design of the auxetic
   textiles, all of which will pave the way for a quantitative and
   optimizing design for auxetic textiles.}},

Abstract = {{A new family of hypophosphite-based ABX(3) hybrid perovskite has caused
   a widespread range of attentions due to their structural diversity,
   phase transition, and magnetic and negative thermal expansion. As a
   continuation of searching for novel hybrid perovskites, this work
   reports a new hypophosphite-based hybrid perovskite,
   {[}Trz]{[}Mg(H2POO)(3)] (TrzMgP, Trz(+)=1,2,4-triazole), which belongs
   to the centrosymmetric space group P2(1)/c with ordered organic cations
   located in the perovskite cage windows. It is notable that the broad
   bandgap of TrzMgP is 5.82eV, and the calculated band structure and
   density of states disclose that the Trz(+) cations donate to the large
   indirect bandgaps with 4.36eV. In addition, the full elastic constants
   of TrzMgP were calculated by density functional theory which enables the
   systematic mapping of their Young's moduli, shear moduli, and Poisson's
   ratios. Notably, TrzMgP exhibits low anisotropy and comparable rigidity
   with the formate perovskite.}},

Abstract = {{Single-layer delta-As and gamma-P have unique atomic arrangement, which

   their inherent negative Poisson ratio (NPR) is -0.708 and -0.226,
   respectively. Surprisingly, the absolute value of the NPR of delta-As is
   approximately 26.2 times greater than that of single-layer black
   phosphorus (the NPR of single-layer black phosphorus is -0.027), and
   remains invariant at a certain strain range. Thus, single-layer delta-As

Title = {{Feasibility of De-Escalation Implementation for Positive Blood Cultures

Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{FEB 12}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: The aim of the present study was to determine whether
   de-escalation guided by blood cultures for patients with a diagnosis of
   sepsis, severe sepsis or septic shock reduces mortality, and
   antimicrobial drug resistance (ADR).
   Methods: A prospective, single-center, cohort study was conducted with
   adults admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of sepsis, severe sepsis, or
   septic shock at a public hospital in Sorocaba, State of Sao Paulo,
   Brazil, from January 2013 to December 2013. We excluded patients who had
   negative blood cultures. Patients who had replaced the initial empirical
   broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy (EAT) by the antibiotic therapy guided
   by blood cultures were compared with those who continued receiving EAT.
   The outcome included mortality and antimicrobial drug resistance. We
   used the Cox regression (proportional hazards regression) and the
   Poisson regression to analyze the association between antibiotic therapy
   guided by blood cultures (ATGBC) and outcomes. The statistical
   adjustment in all models included the following variables: sex, age,
   APACHE II (Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation II) score and
   SOFA (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment) score.
   Results: Among the 686 patients who were admitted to the intensive care
   unit, 91 were included in this study. The mean age of the patients was
   52.7 years (standard deviation = 18.5 years) and 70.3\% were male. EAT
   was replaced by ATGBC in 33 patients (36.3\%) while 58 patients (63.7\%)
   continued receiving EAT. Overall hospital mortality decreased from
   56.9\% in patients who received EAT to 48.5\% in patients who received
   ATGBC {[}Hazard ratio- HR 0.44 (95\% CI 0.24-0.82), p = 0.009]. There
   was no association between ATGBC and ADR {[}HR 0.90 (95\% CI 0.78 -
   1.03) p = 0.15].
   Conclusions: Although the early and appropriate empirical EAT is
   undoubtedly an important factor prognostic, ATGBC can reduce the
   mortality in these patients.}},

Title = {{3D Printed Metamaterial Capacitive Sensing Array for Universal Jamming
   Gripper and Human Joint Wearables}},
Journal = {{ADVANCED ENGINEERING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2021}},

Abstract = {{Existing stretchable capacitive sensor arrays face challenges in
   decoupling normal forces and stretch stimuli which restrict its
   applications into soft robotics. Herein, a metamaterial capacitive
   sensor array with 6 x 6 sensors is developed for the detection of normal
   forces on curved deforming surfaces common to both the soft universal
   jamming gripper and human elbow. The fabrication process involves the 3D
   printing of carbon black thermoplastic polyurethane (PI-ETPU) electrodes
   and thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) insulation based on commercially
   available multimaterial fused deposition modeling (FDM). This
   metamaterial capacitive sensor array is unaffected by a uniaxial stretch
   of up to 21.6\% and remains capable of detecting normal forces. The
   sensor array structure possesses a negative Poisson's ratio which is
   desirable for improving compliance and conformability to adhered
   expanding surfaces. Consequently, normal force-distribution and
   proximity detection capabilities on curved deforming surfaces are
   demonstrated on a soft universal jamming gripper for measuring gripping
   forces and identifying object shapes. Conformal force-sensing joint
   wearable on a human elbow with an individualized Poisson's ratio is
   explored as another application. The possibility of programming
   Poisson's ratio of a metamaterial capacitive sensing array opens new
   avenues for potential sensing applications into soft robotics and
   personalized wearables.}},

Title = {{An Abaqus plugin for evaluation of the Auxetic structure performance}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING WITH COMPUTERS}},
Abstract = {{The behavior of Auxetic structures is highly dependent on the geometric
   parameters of the unit cell. To achieve the desired behavior, it is
   necessary to perform a parametric study on the unit cell. A conventional
   parametric study (which includes modeling and analysis with different
   parameters) is very time consuming and error prone. The Auxetica plugin
   was produced to solve this problem. Auxetica is an Abaqus plugin
   developed to estimate Auxetic structures' performance. In this paper,
   the features and instructions of this plugin are presented. This tool
   can automatically generate and analyze re-entrant, chiral, (Tri-chiral,
   Tetra-chiral, Hexa-chiral) and anti-chiral (Tri-anti-chiral and
   Tetra-anti-chiral) in planar and cylindrical geometries. The plugin
   tasks can be categorized as follows: the first task is to generate a
   model based on parametric input. The second task is an automatic
   analysis and extraction of the target output. The third task is to
   generate models that are ready for 3D printing and testing. To validate
   the plugin, an experimental setup is prepared and samples which are made
   by 3D printing are tested. The simulation result is validated with
   experimental data before any parametric study would be carried out.
   Moreover, to understand the plugin functionality better, a parametric
   study has been done. This plugin helps to perform the parametric study
   by the user in the shortest time and with the most accuracy with the
   desired inputs.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{3441-3446}},
Month = {{FEB 7}},
Abstract = {{Negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) materials (when stretched longitudinally,
   the thickness of these materials increases along the lateral direction)
   are widely used in engineering because of their good resistance to
   shear, denting, and fracture. Observance of a negative Poisson's ratio
   (NPR) in two-dimensional (2D) single-layer materials presently has two
   explanations. The first, from mechanical principles, is that it derives
   from the presence of a special structure (hinge structure), such as in
   single-layer black phosphorus (BP) or black arsenic (beta-As). The
   second, from electronic effects, is that it derives from
   (non-hinge-like) planar honeycomb structures and transition-metal
   dichalcogenides, MX2. Through first-principle calculations, we show that
   2D single-layer materials with a hinge structure also have distinct
   electronic effects, similar to those observed from 2D planar honeycomb
   materials. Under strain, electronic effects of Px orbitals lead to the
   inherent NPR of the 2D single-layer material with a hinge structure. We
   discuss the influencing factors of the hinge structure on the NPR and
   demonstrate that the electronic effects inside the hinge structure are
   the fundamental factor in determining the inherent NPR.}},

Title = {{A microarchitecture design methodology to achieve extreme isotropic
   elastic properties of composites based on crystal symmetries}},

Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{63}},

Abstract = {{The present contribution describes an optimization-based design
   technique of elastic isotropic periodic microarchitectures with crystal
   symmetries aiming at the realization of composites with extreme
   properties. To achieve this goal, three consecutive procedures are
   followed: (i) a series of inverse homogenization problems with symmetry
   constraints, (ii) a correlation analysis between symmetries and
   effective elastic properties of the attained microarchitectures, and
   (iii) the pattern resemblance recognition of these topologies and their
   redesign, by adopting microstructures with two length-scales, through
   optimized parametric geometries. This paper is devoted to assessing the
   third procedure because the first two procedures have been evaluated in
   previous works of the authors, and here they are only summarized. By
   applying the methodology, two plane group symmetries are assessed to
   define two families of 2D periodic parameterized microarchitecture. Once
   the parameters have been optimized, the resulting composites achieve
   elastic isotropic properties close to the whole range of the
   theoretically estimated bounds. Particularly, an unprecedented
   microstructure attaining the theoretical maximum stiffness is reported.
   Starting from these parameterized topologies, simple, one-length scale,
   and easily manufacturable geometries are defined. One of the so-designed
   microarchitectures has been manufactured and tested, displaying an
   effective Poisson's ratio of - 0.90 simultaneously with a high shear
   modulus.}},

Abstract = {{The drilling-related geomechanics requires a better understanding of the

   paper shows set of laboratory results of the dynamic Young's modulus,

   Istebna sandstone samples under a series of confining pressure
   conditions at two different temperatures. The predicted results from
   Wyllie's equation were compared to the measured ones in order to show
   the effect of saturation on the rock weakening. A negative correlation
   has been identified between Poisson's ratio, Biot's coefficient and
   confining pressure, while a positive correlation between confining
   pressure and Young's modulus. The predicted dynamic poroelastic rock
   properties using the P-wave value from Wyllie's equation are different
   from measured ones. It shows the important influence of water saturation
   on rock strength, which is confirmed by unconfined compressive strength
   measurement. Linear equations have been fitted for the laboratory data
   and are useful for the analysis of coupled stress and pore pressure
   effects in geomechanical problems. Such results are useful for many

Abstract = {{Auxetic structures have unique properties wherein the structure

   material reduction is possible. The optimized structure inspired the
   creation of three new variants of the arrowhead structure. These designs
   are 3D printed using ABS and PLA materials. Compression and impact tests
   are performed on a drop test rig and a compression test set-up. From the
   results, an optimal design is obtained that strikes a balance between

Abstract = {{In the framework of the theory of anisotropic elasticity, a theoretical
   analysis of the out-of-plane extension of thin two-layered plates of
   hexagonal crystals is carried out. The six-fold axes of all pairs of
   crystals are assumed to be perpendicular to the plane of the plates.
   Formulae for effective Young's modulus and effective Poisson's ratio are
   obtained. It is shown that in most cases effective Young's moduli exceed
   Reuss's average, and thus the rule of mixtures is violated. Equality of
   these characteristics is possible if the ratios of Young's moduli and
   the ratios of Poisson's ratios of crystal pairs are the same. Effective
   Poisson's ratio may be greater or less than the corresponding Reuss's
   average. In addition, it was found that effective Young's modulus can
   surpass Young's moduli of both crystals forming a two-layered plate.
   Effective Poisson's ratio can be both larger and smaller than Poisson's
   ratios of the initial pair of crystals. The general theoretical
   conclusions are illustrated by numerical estimates using the
   experimental values of the elastic constants of the known hexagonal

   reinforcement mechanism of stratified anti-inclined slope using
   model-scale NPR and ordinary anchor cables is performed. The physical
   model is monitored using static strain data acquisition equipment, an
   infrared thermal imager, tension sensors, and digital speckle
   correlation method (DSCM) displacement field measurement equipment. The
   evolution of the displacement field, strain field, temperature field,
   and anchor cable force are obtained during excavation on the physical
   model. By comparing the evolution of these parameters with images from
   both the anti-inclined slope model instability failure test and the
   deformation characteristics on the two sides of the slope, which were
   reinforced using different types of anchor cables, this paper determines
   the mechanisms governing instability failure of anti-inclined slopes
   reinforced with NPR anchor cable. In addition, this paper also proves
   that NPR anchor cable can be used to monitor the sliding force of
   anti-inclined slopes throughout excavation, and lays a foundation for
   the application of NPR anchor cable monitoring technology to the
   advanced anti-inclined slope failure warning.}},

Title = {{Fracture Hits in Unconventional Reservoirs: A Critical Review}},
Journal = {{SPE JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{412-434}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{``Fracture hit{''} was initially coined to refer to the phenomenon of an
   infill-well fracture interacting with an adjacent well during the
   hydraulic-fracturing process. However, over time, its use has been
   extended to any type of well interference or interaction in
   unconventional reservoirs. In this study, an exhaustive literature
   survey was performed on fracture hits to identify key factors affecting
   the fracture hits and suggest different strategies to manage fracture
   hits. The impact of fracture hits is dictated by a complex interplay of
   petrophysical properties (high-permeability streaks, mineralogy, matrix
   permeability, natural fractures), geomechanical properties (near-field
   and far-field stresses, tensile strength, Young's modulus, Poisson's
   ratio), completion parameters (stage length, cluster spacing, pumping
   rate, fluid and proppant amount), and development decisions (well
   spacing, well scheduling, fracture sequencing). It is difficult to
   predict the impact of fracture hits, and they affect both parent and
   child wells. The impact on the child wells is predominantly negative,
   whereas the effect on parent wells can be either positive or negative.
   The ``child wells{''} in this context refer to the wells drilled with
   pre-existing active/inactive well(s) around. The ``parent well{''}
   refers to any well drilled without any pre-existing well around.
   Overall, fracture hits tend to negatively affect both the production and
   economics of lease development. The optimal approach rests in
   identifying the reservoir properties and accordingly making
   field-development decisions that minimize the negative impact of
   fracture hits. The different strategies proposed to minimize the
   negative impact of fracture hits are simultaneous lease development,
   thus avoiding parent/child wells (i.e., rolling-, tank-, and
   cube-development methods); repressuring or refracturing parent wells;
   using far-field diverters and high-permeability plugging agents in the
   child-well fracturing fluid; and optimizing stage and cluster spacing
   through modeling studies and field tests. Finally, the study concludes
   with a recommended approach to manage fracture hits. There is no silver
   bullet, and the problem of fracture hits in each shale play is unique,
   but by using the available data and published knowledge to understand
   how fractures propagate downhole, measures can be taken to minimize or
   even completely avoid fracture hits.}},

Abstract = {{Sex at an early age can have later life negative health outcomes.
   Insights on early sexual activity may help in the development of future
   health-promotion products and interventions related to pregnancy and
   sexually transmitted infections (STIs) prevention. Among Kenyan women
   participating in a contraceptive vaginal ring study, we determined: (1)
   the proportion with first sex at <= 15 years (early sex) and (2) factors
   associated with early sex. Baseline data collection and testing for
   pregnancy, STIs, and HIV were undertaken. A log-binomial or a modified
   Poisson regression was used to estimate univariable prevalence ratios
   and multivariable adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs). Among 332 women
   aged 18-34 years, the median age of first sex was 16 years, with 40.1\%
   experiencing early sex. Overall, 29.8\% reported an older first sex
   partner (>= 5 years); 83.9\% indicated lack of readiness or intentions
   at first sex; and 56.2\% received money, gifts, or favors as part of
   first sex. Early sex was more prevalent among inherited widows (a Luo
   cultural practice, aPR 1.49), gift recipients (aPR 1.38), women with a
   forced/unwanted sex history (aPR 1.42), or those with a partner of
   unknown or positive HIV status in the past 3 months (aPR 1.45). Sex
   before or at the age 15 may be associated with higher sexual risk
   behaviors. Complex power and gender relations may additionally influence
   exposure to sexual risk in our research setting.}},

Title = {{New AVO expression and attribute based on scaled Poisson reflectivity}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED GEOPHYSICS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{185}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{A new expression for Amplitude Variation with Offset (AVO) is proposed.
   The expression introduces reflection amplitudes as a function of two
   very common AVO parameters, the Gradient (G) and scaled Poisson
   reflectivity (SPR). The SPR is proven to be an excellent indicator of
   hydrocarbon with more sensitivity to fluid than other ordinary AVO
   attributes. Another advantage of the SPR is that it works for all types
   of gas-saturated sands commonly targeted by AVO. From the new
   expression, a new AVO classification based on SPR is introduced. The
   classification involves two classes: 1) Class H, with negative SPR and
   negative G, represents rocks with high probability of hydrocarbon
   presence, and 2) Class N, with nearly zero or positive G and SPR,
   includes rocks with high probability of no-hydrocarbon presence. An AVO
   attribute combining SPR and Gradient is derived from the expression and
   is proposed as a good indicator of fluid presence. The approximation and
   the attribute are applied on Marmousi-2 model datasets and on a field
   data from Alberta, Canada. The attribute has demonstrated a good
   identification of the hydrocarbon-saturated reservoirs in theoretical
   model and the real field data. The new AVO approximation, classification
   and attribute are intended to complement other existing approximations
   and reduce uncertainty from their interpretations. (C) 2021 Elsevier

Title = {{Multi-functional cylindrical metastructures to simultaneously program
   both thermal expansion and Poisson's ratio}},
Journal = {{EXTREME MECHANICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{43}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Currently reported cylindrical metastructures mainly act as the
   load-bearing components, or only present the single function of
   programming either Poisson's ratio (PR) or coefficient of thermal
   expansion (CTE). Here, by curling the planar metamaterials, a series of
   multi-functional cylindrical metastructures is originally devised to
   simultaneously incorporate programmable CTE and PR. The deformation
   characteristics are systematically analyzed. It is identified that the
   number of circumfer-ential cells N remarkably affects the deformation
   characteristics. When N is small, the warp effect induced by the curved
   members is remarkable. The quantitative analysis figures out that when N
   is larger than specific critical values, the PR and CTE of the
   cylindrical metastructures approach to those of the planar
   metamaterials. Thus, a design strategy is identified, namely, with
   adequate circumferential cells, both the PR and CTE of the cylindrical
   metastructures are independent on the variable N, and are equal to those
   of the corresponding planar metamaterials. Most importantly, by
   modulating the geometric parameters, the PR and CTE of the devised
   cylindrical metastructures can be simultaneously programmed to be wide
   ranges. The excellent programmability in both PR and CTE enables the
   cylindrical metastructures to be potentially used in engineering
   applications where precise control of deformation induced both by
   mechanical and thermal loads is in urgent need. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{In the present paper, three kinds of novel two-dimensional enhanced

Title = {{Topological design of microstructures using periodic material- fi eld
   series-expansion and gradient-free optimization algorithm}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{199}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{Light-weight cellular materials with periodic repetitive microstructures
   are widely used in various fields due to their superior
   mechanical/multi-physical performances. As the microstructural design
   problem is known to have multiple local minima, most gradient-based
   topology optimization methods significantly depend on the initial guess
   of the microstructural geometry, thus requiring the designer's
   experiences. This paper presents an effective gradient-free framework
   for periodic microstructure design, which exhibits powerful global
   searching capabilities and requires no sensitivity information. The
   proposed framework combines the material-field series-expansion (MFSE)
   topology representation of periodic microstructures and the sequential
   Kriging-based optimization algorithm. The MFSE method decouples the
   topological representation from the finite element discretization, and
   describes a relatively complex microstructural topology with
   high-quality boundary description using a greatly reduced number of
   design variables. Based on the Kriging surrogate model, a solution
   scheme is suggested to solve material microstructural topology
   optimization successively in a sequence of sub optimization problems
   with self-adaptive design spaces. With the present gradient-free
   optimization method, high-performance cellular materials that approach
   the H-S upper bound with porosities from 0.2 to 0.6, or that achieve
   negative Poisson's ratios of-0.94 in the principal directions for
   materials with square symmetry, are obtained without prior knowledge of
   the optimum microstructural topology.

   Rh, Ir, or Pd). The mechanical stability of these compounds was also
   verified by their single independent elastic constants. Poisson's and
   Pugh's ratios revealed that all the compounds have a ductile nature. The
   metallic nature of these phases was found from their band structure
   calculations. The study of Mulliken bond populations and charge density
   maps ensured the existence of a mixed character of ionic, covalent, and

   investigation was also performed on optical properties, and the
   dielectric function, absorption, and conductivity again ensured the

   suggested their potential application in quantum-dot light emitting
   diodes, organic light emitting diodes, solar cells, waveguides, and

Abstract = {{A class of three-dimensional lattice structures of cubic symmetry is
   designed by spatially assembling and merging a number of two-dimensional
   re-entrant honeycomb structures. We demonstrate that the effective
   thermoelastic properties of these structures are widely tunable by
   tailoring the microstructural geometry and/or constituent materials.
   Particularly, they possess negative effective Poisson's ratios. If the
   inclined and non-inclined walls are of dissimilar thermal expansion
   coefficients, they can further attain isotropic negative or positive
   effective thermal expansion coefficients with a magnitude as large as
   several to dozens of times that of the constituent materials. Owing to
   these novel properties, they are well suitable as structural or
   functional components in engineering systems for preventing or
   harnessing thermal and/or mechanical deformation. (C) 2021 The Authors.

Abstract = {{The 121 mining method of longwall mining first proposed in England has
   been widely used around the world. This method requires excavation of
   two mining roadways and reservation of one coal pillar to mine one
   working face. Due to considerable excavation of roadway, the mining
   roadway is generally destroyed during coal mining. The stress
   concentration in the coal pillar can cause large deformation of
   surrounding rocks, rockbursts and other disasters, and subsequently a
   large volume of coal pillar resources will be wasted. To improve the
   coal recovery rate and reduce excavation of the mining roadway, the 111
   mining method of longwall mining was proposed in the former Soviet Union
   based on the 121 mining method. The 111 mining method requires
   excavation of one mining roadway and setting one filling body to replace
   the coal pillar while maintaining another mining roadway to mine one
   working face. However, because the stress transfer structure of roadway
   and working face roof has not changed, the problem of stress
   concentration in the surrounding rocks of roadway has not been well
   solved. To solve the above problems, the conventional concept utilizing
   high-strength support to resist the mining pressure for the 121 and 111
   mining methods should be updated. The idea is to utilize mining pressure
   and expansion characteristics of the collapsed rock mass in the goaf to
   automatically form roadways, avoiding roadway excavation and waste of
   coal pillar. Based on the basic principles of mining rock mechanics, the
   ``equilibrium mining{''} theory and the ``short cantilever beam{''}
   mechanical model are proposed. Key technologies, such as roof
   directional presplitting technology, negative Poisson's ratio (NPR)
   high-prestress constant-resistance support technology, and gangue
   blocking support technology, are developed following the ``equilibrium
   mining{''} theory. Accordingly, the 110 and N00 mining methods of an
   automatically formed roadway (AFR) by roof cutting and pressure
   releasing without pillars are proposed. The mining methods have been
   applied to a large number of coal mines with different overburdens, coal
   seam thicknesses, roof types and gases in China, realizing the
   integrated mode of coal mining and roadway retaining. On this basis, in
   view of the complex geological conditions and intelligent mining demand
   of coal mines, an intelligent and unmanned development direction of the
   ``equilibrium mining{''} method is prospected. (C) 2021 Institute of

Abstract = {{Due to the increasingly serious environmental pollution and the extreme
   shortage of energy resources, harvesting clean and sustainable random
   energy from the environment is a scientific, effective, and necessary
   solution in the coming intelligent era. Such random and disorder energy,
   like that from human motion and textile-related movement, can be
   obtained via textile-based triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs).
   However, research related to textile-based TENGs with mature,
   high-efficiency, and economical manufacturing techniques is limited.
   Here, by using a high-speed ring spinning method, negative Poisson's
   ratio yarn (NPRY) with a composite structure is designed and fabricated
   as a variety of intelligent device. Based on the special negative
   Poisson's ratio effect, NPRY combined with TENG can be used as a
   foundation structure to form diverse flexible textile-based electronic
   devices, such as an energy harvesting fabric, a self-counting yoga
   elastic band, and a self-powered pre-alarm cable. At the same time,
   NPRY-TENGs with different structures and structural parameters are
   systematically investigated to optimize the output performance in this
   work. This special, low-cost, and highly efficient NPRY as a foundation
   structure material has promising applications in the manufacture of all
   kinds of textile-based TENGs and harvesting a lot of random energy from
   the environment, where the random energy can be used by other electronic
   devices or those textile-based TENGs themselves as self-powered sensors.}},

Abstract = {{This is a territory-wide study to investigate the impact of coronavirus
   disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on Accident and Emergency Department
   (A\&E) attendances and acute ward admissions for seizures. Adult
   patients who presented to the A\&E with seizures from January 23, 2020
   to March 24, 2020 (study period) were included and compared with
   parallel intervals from 2015 to 2019 (control periods). Preexisting time
   trend in control periods and potential changes during COVID-19 were
   analyzed by Poisson, negative and logistic regression models.
   Accident and Emergency Department attendances and ward admissions for
   seizures decreased significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total
   of 319 and 230 recorded ward admissions and A\&E attendances for
   seizures were identified during the study period in 2020, compared with
   494 and 343 per annum, respectively in the control periods. The ratio of
   acute ward admission per A\&E attendance for seizures did not change
   significantly. Intensive care utility and mortality rates remained
   stable.
   For some patients, delaying medical attention due to fear of nosocomial
   COVID-19 cross-infection may lead to severe or even life-threatening
   consequences. This change in medical help-seeking behavior calls for new
   medical care models to meet the service gap. Education to patients with

Abstract = {{The study of physical and mechanical properties can shed light on the
   picture of martensitic transitions in materials that control the unique
   effects of shape memory and superelasticity. Martensitic transformations
   in metals and alloys are based on shear-type deformation processes, so
   the study of their elastic behavior contains important information about
   the nature and mechanisms of these phase transitions. In this report, we
   analyze the value and relationship between the degree of elastic
   anisotropy and the Poisson's ratio of Ti-Ni alloy crystals based on our
   own and literature data obtained experimentally and computationally from
   the first principles. A significant variability of the elastic
   anisotropy coefficient A of Ti-Ni crystals was established, which is due
   to the apparently elastic ``softening{''} of the alloy lattice on the
   eve of martensitic transformations (especially the constant c44). The
   minimum Poisson's ratio of Ti-Ni crystals is -0.25. The maximum value of
   mu was 1.10, which is higher than the theoretical limit for
   polycrystals. Extreme values of mu were achieved for directions when the
   stretch is oriented along the direction < 110 >, i. e. diagonals of the
   cube face. The mean <mu > was found to be 0.41. Ti-Ni based alloys can
   be considered as partial auxetic - materials with negative Poisson's
   ratio in some directions, that is, have mu < 0 when choosing some
   directions and be an ordinary material with positive mu for other
   directions. The elastic anisotropy of Ti-Ni crystals can be determined
   based on the numerical differences in the extreme values of mu as A(mu)
   = |mu(ma)x-mu(min)|/<mu >. A strong correlation was established between
   the elastic anisotropy coefficient A and the factor A(mu) (the
   correlation coefficient 0.9871). The parameters of the linear dependence
   of the reduced anisotropy factor A(mu)({*}) =1.33779A(mu) + 0.18542, for
   which A(mu)({*}) = A.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the modified SIMP topology optimization (TO) method was
   used, to introduce diverse auxetic unit cells with different volume
   fractions, composing of the symmetric, chiral and re-entrant unit cells.
   The output results suggested that the geometry of the 2D auxetic
   structures were extremely dependent on the values of SIMP method
   parameters, including initial designs and volume fractions. The
   brilliant modes of deformation in the auxetic structures, whose unit
   cells are symmetric, are based on either buckling or bending. To
   validate the TO results, four structures containing symmetric unit cells
   were chosen, called structure 1, 2, 3 and 4. The auxetic structures were
   produced by using 3D printing, with TPU as a hyperelastic material as
   well. Under Compression, the dominating mode of deformation in
   structures 1 and 2 is based on bending, caused by the movement of the
   oblique struts between the unit cells. There is also a linear
   relationship between the vertical and horizontal displacements in
   structure 1, the structure with 50 \% volume fraction and-0.55 Poisson?s
   ratio value. However, the deformation mechanisms in structures 3 and 4
   are based on buckling, called shearing deformation, which is the result
   of the buckling of the vertical struts between the unit cells.}},

Abstract = {{The need for control of the elastic properties of architected materials
   has been accentuated due to the advances in modelling and
   characterization. Among the plethora of unconventional mechanical
   responses, controlled anisotropy and auxeticity have been promulgated as
   a new avenue in bioengineering applications. This paper aims to
   delineate the mechanical performance of characteristic auxetic and
   anisotropic designs fabricated by multiphoton lithography. Through
   finite element analysis the distinct responses of representative
   topologies are conveyed. In addition, nanoindentation experiments
   observed in-situ through scanning electron microscopy enable the

Title = {{HIV incidence after pre-exposure prophylaxis initiation among women and

   Uganda}},

Abstract = {{Author summary
   Why was this study done?
   Despite major gains in HIV testing and treatment, there were 1.7 million
   new HIV infections worldwide in 2019, of which nearly 60\% occurred in
   sub-Saharan Africa.
   Daily oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with tenofovir disoproxil
   fumarate/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) is highly effective for HIV prevention
   and could substantially reduce new HIV infections if offered alongside
   access to HIV testing and treatment.
   Little is known about the incidence of new HIV infections among PrEP
   users in settings with generalized HIV epidemics, particularly when
   offered broadly across communities where access to HIV testing and
   treatment have already been scaled up.
   What did the researchers do and find?
   In 16 communities in rural Kenya and Uganda, we conducted community-wide
   HIV testing and offered universal access to PrEP with an inclusive
   approach to eligibility (for persons in serodifferent partnerships,
   those identified by an HIV risk prediction tool, or those who
   self-identified as being at risk of HIV). We offered rapid PrEP start
   and a flexible care delivery model with follow-up visits at health
   facilities or community-based sites for HIV testing and PrEP refills.
   Of 74,541 persons who tested negative for HIV, 15,632 (21\%) were
   assessed to be at elevated HIV risk, of whom 5,447 (35\%) started PrEP.
   Overall, 79\% of persons who initiated PrEP engaged in the program for
   follow-up visits.
   Among PrEP initiators in the 16 study communities, there were 25
   seroconversions over 7,150 person-years of follow-up. HIV incidence was
   0.35 per 100 person-years (95\% confidence interval {[}CI] 0.22-0.49).
   In 8 communities, we compared HIV incidence among PrEP initiators to
   persons with similar characteristics (matched controls) from the year
   before PrEP was available. Compared to matched controls, HIV incidence
   was 74\% lower among PrEP initiators overall; 76\% lower among women who
   initiated PrEP; and 40\% lower among men who initiated PrEP, although
   this result among men did not reach statistical significance.
   What do these findings mean?
   Providing universal access to PrEP in the context of community-wide HIV
   testing in rural Kenya and Uganda was associated with lower HIV
   incidence among persons who initiated PrEP compared to matched recent
   controls.
   We found lower HIV incidence after PrEP initiation among women, for whom
   rates of new HIV infections are higher than in men, including in recent
   prevention studies without PrEP. These results suggest that PrEP may
   help to close the gap in new infections between men and women.
   Universal access to HIV testing, treatment, and prevention, including
   rapid provision of PrEP with flexible service delivery, could reduce HIV
   incidence in generalized epidemic settings.
   Background
   Oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is highly effective for HIV
   prevention, but data are limited on HIV incidence among PrEP users in
   generalized epidemic settings, particularly outside of selected risk
   groups. We performed a population-based PrEP study in rural Kenya and
   Uganda and sought to evaluate both changes in HIV incidence and clinical
   and virologic outcomes following seroconversion on PrEP.
   Methods and findings
   During population-level HIV testing of individuals >= 15 years in 16
   communities in the Sustainable East Africa Research in Community Health
   (SEARCH) study (NCT01864603), we offered universal access to PrEP with
   enhanced counseling for persons at elevated HIV risk (based on
   serodifferent partnership, machine learning-based risk score, or
   self-identified HIV risk). We offered rapid or same-day PrEP initiation
   and flexible service delivery with follow-up visits at facilities or
   community-based sites at 4, 12, and every 12 weeks up to week 144. Among
   participants with incident HIV infection after PrEP initiation, we
   offered same-day antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation and analyzed
   HIV RNA, tenofovir hair concentrations, drug resistance, and viral
   suppression (<1,000 c/ml based on available assays) after ART start.
   Using Poisson regression with cluster-robust standard errors, we
   compared HIV incidence among PrEP initiators to incidence among
   propensity score-matched recent historical controls (from the year
   before PrEP availability) in 8 of the 16 communities, adjusted for risk
   group. Among 74,541 individuals who tested negative for HIV,
   15,632/74,541 (21\%) were assessed to be at elevated HIV risk;
   5,447/15,632 (35\%) initiated PrEP (49\% female; 29\% 15-24 years; 19\%
   in serodifferent partnerships), of whom 79\% engaged in >= 1 follow-up
   visit and 61\% self-reported PrEP adherence at >= 1 visit. Over 7,150
   person-years of follow-up, HIV incidence was 0.35 per 100 person-years
   (95\% confidence interval {[}CI] 0.22-0.49) among PrEP initiators. Among
   matched controls, HIV incidence was 0.92 per 100 person-years (95\% CI
   0.49-1.41), corresponding to 74\% lower incidence among PrEP initiators
   compared to matched controls (adjusted incidence rate ratio {[}aIRR]
   0.26, 95\% CI 0.09-0.75; p = 0.013). Among women, HIV incidence was 76\%
   lower among PrEP initiators versus matched controls (aIRR 0.24, 95\% CI
   0.07-0.79; p = 0.019); among men, HIV incidence was 40\% lower, but not
   significantly so (aIRR 0.60, 95\% CI 0.12-3.05; p = 0.54). Of 25
   participants with incident HIV infection (68\% women), 7/25 (28\%)
   reported taking PrEP <= 30 days before HIV diagnosis, and 24/25 (96\%)
   started ART. Of those with repeat HIV RNA after ART start, 18/19 (95\%)
   had <1,000 c/ml. One participant with viral non-suppression was found to
   have transmitted viral resistance, as well as emtricitabine resistance
   possibly related to PrEP use. Limitations include the lack of
   contemporaneous controls to assess HIV incidence without PrEP and that
   plasma samples were not archived to assess for baseline acute infection.
   Conclusions
   Population-level offer of PrEP with rapid start and flexible service
   delivery was associated with 74\% lower HIV incidence among PrEP
   initiators compared to matched recent controls prior to PrEP
   availability. HIV infections were significantly lower among women who
   started PrEP. Universal HIV testing with linkage to treatment and
   prevention, including PrEP, is a promising approach to accelerate
   reductions in new infections in generalized epidemic settings.}},

Abstract = {{This study aimed to examine the effectiveness of Human Immunodeficiency
   Virus (HIV)-assisted smartphone applications in the treatment of
   HIV/AIDS patients in Vietnam. A cross-sectional study was performed in
   two urban outpatient clinics in Hanoi from May to December 2019. A
   simple random sampling method and a structured questionnaire were used
   to recruit 495 eligible participants and to collect data. Multivariable
   modified Poisson regression and multivariable linear regression models
   were employed to investigate the factors associated with the willingness
   to pay (WTP) and amount of money patients were willing to pay.
   Approximately 82.8\% of respondents were willing to pay for the
   hypothetical applications, with the mean amount the participants were
   willing to pay of Vietnam Dong (VND) 72,100/month. Marital status
   (separate/divorced/widow: Odds ratio (OR) = 1.28, 95\% confidence
   interval (CI) = (1.09; 1.50) and having spouse/partner: OR = 1.18, 95\%
   CI = (1.03; 1.36)) and using health services (OR = 1.03, 95\% CI =
   (1.01; 1.04)) were positively associated with nominating they would be
   WTP for the app, whereas the duration of antiretroviral treatment (ART)
   (OR = 0.98, 95\% CI = (0.96; 0.99)) had a negative association. The
   frequency of using health services (beta = 0.04, 95\% CI = (-0.07;
   -0.01)) was negatively associated with the amount of WTP. High levels of
   WTP revealed the feasibility of implementing smartphone-based apps for
   HIV treatment. This study implied the necessity to consider a co-payment
   system to reach populations who were in need but where such applications
   may be unaffordable in lieu of other treatment-associated expenses.
   Developers also need to pay attention to privacy features to attract
   single people living with HIV/AIDS and additional measures to initiate
   people with a long duration on ART into using the applications.}},

Abstract = {{Since the outbreak of novel SARS-COV-2, each country has implemented
   diverse policies to mitigate and suppress the spread of the virus.
   However, no systematic evaluation of these policies in their alleviation
   of the pandemic has been done. We investigate the impact of five indices
   derived from 12 policies in the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response
   Tracker dataset and the Korean government's index, which is the social
   distancing level implemented by the Korean government in response to the
   changing pandemic situation. We employed segmented Poisson model for
   this analysis. In conclusion, health and the Korean government indices
   are most consistently effective (with negative coefficients), while the
   restriction and stringency indexes are mainly effective with lagging
   (1-10 days), as intuitively daily confirmed cases of a given day is
   affected by the policies implemented days before, which shows that a
   period of time is required before the impact of some policies can be
   observed. The health index demonstrates the importance of public
   information campaign, testing policy and contact tracing, while the
   government index shows the importance of social distancing guidelines in
   mitigating the spread of the virus. These results imply the important
   roles of these polices in mitigation of the spread of COVID-19 disease.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we use computer simulations (Molecular Dynamics) to
   analyse the behaviour of a specific auxetic hierarchical mechanical
   metamaterial composed of square-like elements. We show that, depending
   on the design of hinges connecting structural elements, the system can
   exhibit a controllable behaviour where different hierarchical levels can
   deform to the desired extent. We also show that the use of different
   hinges within the same structure can enhance the control over its
   deformation and mechanical properties, whose results can be applied to
   other mechanical metamaterials. In addition, we analyse the effect of
   the size of the system as well as the variation in the stiffness of its
   hinges on the range of the exhibited auxetic behaviour (negative
   Poisson's ratio). Finally, it is discussed that the concept presented in
   this work can be used amongst others in the design of highly efficient
   protective devices capable of adjusting their response to a specific
   application.}},

Title = {{Analysis of additively manufactured (3D printed) dual-material auxetic
   structures under compression}},
Journal = {{ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{38}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic cellular structures offer improvements in some mechanical
   properties due to their negative Poisson's ratio response when loaded.
   This study investigates and compares the effect of using multiple
   materials within three well researched cellular geometries, two auxetic:
   re-entrant and anti-tetrachiral, and one non-auxetic: hexagonal
   honeycomb. For each geometry, three different material configurations
   were used, a single material PLA structure and two dual-material
   structures: Polylactic Acid (PLA)-Nylon and PLA-Thermoplastic
   Polyurethane (TPU). A numerical model was developed to simulate these
   complex multi-material cellular geometries under a quasi-static
   compression load using Abaqus Explicit solver. To validate this
   numerical model, samples were additively manufactured and experimentally
   tested. They were found to show good correlation for the PLA and
   PLA-TPU. This study found that for situations where single loading
   cycles were required, for example, for crashworthy structures, the
   single material structures offered the highest performance where they
   absorbed the largest amount of energy. If multiple loading cycles are
   required, the multi-material structures offer the best solution due to
   the compression occurring through elastic buckling in comparison to
   plastic buckling in the single material. It was also found that through
   introducing materials with varying stiffnesses into specific regions
   within the structure, the Poisson's ratio through the compression could
   be modified for the re-entrant and honeycomb geometries.}},

Title = {{Idealized 3D Auxetic Mechanical Metamaterial: An Analytical, Numerical,
   and Experimental Study}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Mechanical metamaterials are man-made rationally-designed structures
   that present unprecedented mechanical properties not found in nature.
   One of the most well-known mechanical metamaterials is auxetics, which
   demonstrates negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) behavior that is very
   beneficial in several industrial applications. In this study, a specific
   type of auxetic metamaterial structure namely idealized 3D re-entrant
   structure is studied analytically, numerically, and experimentally. The
   noted structure is constructed of three types of struts-one loaded
   purely axially and two loaded simultaneously flexurally and axially,
   which are inclined and are spatially defined by angles theta and phi.
   Analytical relationships for elastic modulus, yield stress, and
   Poisson's ratio of the 3D re-entrant unit cell are derived based on two
   well-known beam theories namely Euler-Bernoulli and Timoshenko.
   Moreover, two finite element approaches one based on beam elements and
   one based on volumetric elements are implemented. Furthermore, several
   specimens are additively manufactured (3D printed) and tested under
   compression. The analytical results had good agreement with the
   experimental results on the one hand and the volumetric finite element
   model results on the other hand. Moreover, the effect of various
   geometrical parameters on the mechanical properties of the structure was
   studied, and the results demonstrated that angle theta (related to
   tension-dominated struts) has the highest influence on the sign of
   Poisson's ratio and its extent, while angle phi (related to
   compression-dominated struts) has the lowest influence on the Poisson's
   ratio. Nevertheless, the compression-dominated struts (defined by angle
   phi) provide strength and stiffness for the structure. The results also
   demonstrated that the structure could have zero Poisson's ratio for a
   specific range of theta and phi angles. Finally, a lightened 3D
   re-entrant structure is introduced, and its results are compared to
   those of the idealized 3D re-entrant structure.}},

Abstract = {{We present in this paper two novel concepts of hybrid metamaterials that
   combine a core unit cell of re-entrant or cross-chiral shape and lateral
   missing ribs. The first topology is a hybrid between an anti-tetrachiral
   and a missing rib (cross-chiral) configuration; the second one has a
   variable cross-chiral layout compared to the classical missing rib
   square structure. Their in-plane mechanical properties have been
   investigated from a parametric point of view using finite element (FE)
   simulations. The two classes of metamaterials have been benchmarked to
   obtain optimized designs and specific effective properties. Nonlinear
   simulations and experimental tests of the new re-entrant missing rib
   metamaterials featuring optimized geometry parameters have been
   performed to understand the behavior of these architectures under large

Abstract = {{Chiral honeycombs are one of the main classes of mechanical
   metamaterials with the potential to exhibit auxetic behaviour. In this
   work, we propose a new class of chiral metamaterials based on uniform
   Euclidean tessellations and their dual counterparts. In total, ten new
   structures were designed and analysed using Finite Element analysis
   under periodic boundary conditions, with eight of these systems showing
   the capability of possessing a negative Poisson's ratio. The
   relationship between the various geometric parameters defining the
   systems and the resultant mechanical properties was also studied. We
   show that `chiralisation', i.e. introduction of chirality and rotational
   elements within the system, has the ability to transform even complex
   geometries, which in their original state possess a high positive
   Poisson's ratio, into auxetic metamaterials and hope that this work can
   act as a blueprint for the design of auxetic structures with novel

Title = {{Effect of Compressive Strain Rate on Auxetic Foam}},
Journal = {{APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic foams have previously been shown to have benefits including
   higher indentation resistance than their conventional counterparts, due
   to their negative Poisson's ratio, making them better at resisting
   penetration by concentrated loads. The Poisson's ratio and Young's
   modulus of auxetic open cell foams have rarely been measured at the high
   compressive strain rates typical during impacts of energy absorbing
   material in sporting protective equipment. Auxetic closed cell foams are
   less common than their open cell counterparts, and only their
   quasi-static characteristics have been previously reported. It is,
   therefore, unclear how the Poisson's ratio of auxetic foam, and
   associated benefits such as increased indentation resistance shown at
   low strain rates, would transfer to the high strain rates expected under
   impact. The aim of this study was to measure the effect of strain rate
   on the stiffness and Poisson's ratio of auxetic and conventional foam.
   Auxetic open cell and closed cell polymer foams were fabricated, then
   compression tested to similar to 80\% strain at applied rates up to 200
   s(-1), with Poisson's ratios obtained from optical full-field strain
   mapping. Open cell foam quasi-static Poisson's ratios ranged from -2.0
   to 0.4, with a narrower range of -0.1 to 0.3 for closed cell foam.
   Poisson's ratios of auxetic foams approximately halved in magnitude
   between the minimum and maximum strain rates. Open cell foam
   quasi-static Young's moduli were between 0.02 and 0.09 MPa, whereas
   closed cell foams Young's moduli were similar to 1 MPa, which is like
   foam in protective equipment. The Young's moduli of the auxetic foams
   approximately doubled at the highest applied strain rate of 200 s(-1).}},

Title = {{The frequency and severity of crop damage by wildlife in rural Beijing,
   China}},
Journal = {{MEASUREMENT}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{171}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{With a continuous expansion of the number and activity of wild animals
   induced by ecological conservation and restoration efforts, the
   human-wildlife conflict is becoming more prominent across China. There
   have been frequent and severe incidents of crop damage caused by
   wildlife. In this paper, we investigate the crop losses caused by
   wildlife in the rural districts of Beijing, using a unique dataset of
   31,573 observations from 2009 to 2017. Through statistical tests on the
   individual coefficients and the overall fitness, we find that a negative
   binomial generalized regression model describes the pattern of crop loss
   events more accurately, compared to an alternative Poisson model. The
   frequency of crop loss events is positively related to a village's
   distance from the river system but negatively associated with the
   distance from woodland, population density, and protective measures
   taken. The predicted frequencies of crop damage events are then used to
   correlate with the amounts of losses at the village level. Based on
   these results, we propose solutions for effective reduction of future
   crop losses and practical assessment of the likely damage compensation
   or insurance premium.}},

   Directions}},
Journal = {{ADVANCED ENGINEERING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Materials with an abnormal Poisson's ratio, including those with
   negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) and zero Poisson's ratio (ZPR), are an
   important category of mechanical metamaterials, among which many exhibit
   NPR in all three directions. However, few of them, especially the 3D
   materials, exhibit ZPR in partial directions and NPR in other
   directions. Herein, a novel 3D structure developed by orthogonal
   splicing the 2D parallelogram honeycomb structure is proposed. Different
   from the 2D parallelogram honeycomb with ZPR, the spliced 3D
   parallelogram structure can exhibit not only ZPR but also NPR in
   different directions. The analytical model of the structure is
   established based on the classical beam theory, the equivalent
   analytical formulas of Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio are given,
   and finite element simulation and experiments are used for verification.
   The relationships between Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of the
   structure, as well as its geometric parameters and material parameters,
   are analyzed using analytical formulas and numerical simulation. The
   results reveal that the structure is transversely isotropic and can
   achieve NPR on the transverse symmetry plane and ZPR outside the plane.
   This unique property may accord this structure with important
   applications in aerospace, biomedical, and other fields.}},

   foam core with negative Poisson's ratio}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{191}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, a sandwich panel composed of two metal face sheets and a
   three-dimensional (3D) isotropic foam core with negative Poisson's ratio
   (NPR) was established via FEM. The 3D NPR isotropic foam core was
   achieved by using triaxial compression method on a cubic Voronoi model,
   which was created based on Voronoi tessellation technique to achieve
   different randomness for the core (beta). The Poisson's ratio of the
   Voronoi core dropped rapidly at first, and then increased with an
   increasing triaxial pre-compression ratio eta. A minimum Poisson's
   ratio, -0.12, was obtained when the randomness of the Voronoi core beta
   = 0.29 and the triaxial pre-compression ratio eta = 0.4. The blast
   resistance of the proposed composite sandwich panel (CSP) with cores
   that have different beta and eta under 300 g equivalent TNT explosion
   was analyzed. Results show that with an increase of eta, the maximum
   stress on the foundation surface of CSP5 gradually decreased, and then
   slightly increased. The maximum stress on the foundation surface of CSP5
   can reach a minimum value when beta = 0.29 and eta = 0.4. The proposed
   CSP with the minimum Poisson's ratio core exhibited the highest blast
   resistance performance, which was approximately 1.5 times higher than
   CSP with traditional re-entrant NPR structure core.}},

Title = {{Experimental and numerical study on the structural performance of
   auxetic-shaped, ring-shaped and unstiffened steel plate shear walls}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{34}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Structural engineers have always tried to enhance the seismic
   performance of existing building systems by introducing new solutions to
   increase the amount of ductility along with dissipated seismic energy.
   In this regard, this paper presents a new system to improve the
   structural behavior of unstiffened steel plate shear walls and eliminate
   the known defects of these efficient seismic-resistant systems. One of
   the significant drawbacks of unstiffened steel plate shear walls is the
   pinching of their hysteretic curve that happens due to the early
   out-of-plane buckling of the infill plate under small shear forces.
   Therefore, the primary purpose of this study is to reduce the amount of
   out-of-plane buckling using perforated plates with periodic
   auxetic-shaped cellular forms, which have a negative Poisson's ratio. To
   this aim, a parametric study is conducted on 255 finite element models
   of auxetic-shaped steel plate shear walls using ABAQUS software to
   select the most efficient configuration considering some design
   parameters such as the amount of out-of-plane buckling, energy
   dissipation and strength. Then, two full-scale specimens of the selected
   models are investigated experimentally under a quasistatic cyclic
   loading history. Finally, regarding this fact that for broader adoption
   of a new system, besides its structural performance, the total weight of
   that structural system is a determinant factor, two 5- and 10-story
   plane building models with unstiffened and auxetic-shaped steel plate
   shear walls are designed to have the life safety performance level at
   the BSE-1 hazard level and they are evaluated by performing nonlinear
   static analyses. The results show that auxetic-shaped steel plate shear
   walls, while improving the seismic performance of a building, reduce its
   weight.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICAL BEHAVIOR OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{114}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in worldwide shortages of
   nasopharyngeal swabs required for sample collection. While the shortages
   are becoming acute due to supply chain disruptions, the demand for
   testing has increased both as a prerequisite to lifting restrictions and
   in preparation for the second wave. One of the potential solutions to
   this crisis is the development of 3D printed nasopharyngeal swabs that
   behave like traditional swabs. However, the opportunity to digitally
   conceive and fabricate swabs allows for design improvements that can
   potentially reduce patient pain and discomfort. The study reports the
   progress that has been made on the development of auxetic nasopharyngeal
   swabs that can shrink under axial resistance. This allows the swab to
   navigate through the nasal cavity with significantly less stress on the
   surrounding tissues. This is achieved through systematically conceived
   negative Poisson's ratio (-upsilon) structures in a biocompatible
   material. Finite element (FE) and surrogate modelling techniques were
   employed to identify the most optimal swab shape that allows for the
   highest negative strain (-epsilon(lat)) under safe stress (-sigma(von)).
   The influence and interaction effects of the geometrical parameters on
   the swab's performance were also characterised. The research
   demonstrates a new viewpoint for the development of functional
   nasopharyngeal swabs that can be 3D printed to reduce patient
   discomfort. The methodology can be further exploited to address various
   challenges in biomedical devices and redistributed manufacturing.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{As a kind of mechanical metamaterials with negative Poisson's ratio
   (NPR), auxetic lattices possess unusual mechanical responses such as
   higher sensitivity to strain and reversibility after large deformation.
   Therefore, they are regarded as a potential candidate to sensors,
   actuators, and optics. Here, we designed four types of auxetic lattices
   with long stress plateau based on the assembly of hollow shell
   cuboctahedron. To begin with, experiments along with finite element
   simulations were performed to probe their auxetic behaviors under
   uniaxial compression, which give an excellent qualitative and
   quantitative agreement. To establish design criteria on specific
   applications, we systematically investigated the mechanical properties
   of the four kinds of lattices with different volume fractions, including
   critical stresses, strain-stress curves, strain energy densities,
   strain-dependent Poisson's ratios, and the length of stress plateau. The
   results demonstrate that these lattices can suffer from buckling with
   NPR in an extended range of volume fractions, and high reversibility was
   observed in several compressive loadings, which provides insight into
   energy absorption such as the body protection equipments and smart
   packaging material}},

Title = {{Dynamic impact testing of cellular solids and lattice structures:
   Application of two-sided direct impact Hopkinson bar}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMPACT ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{148}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Direct impact testing with a Hopkinson bar is, nowadays, a very popular
   experimental technique for investigating the behavior of cellular
   materials, e.g., lattice metamaterials, at high strain-rates as it
   overcomes several limitations of the conventional Split Hopkinson
   Pressure Bar (SHPB). However, standard direct impact Hopkinson bars
   (DIHB) have only single-sided instrumentation complicating the analysis.
   In this paper, a DIHB apparatus instrumented with conventional
   strain-gauges on both bars (a so called Open Hopkinson Pressure Bar -
   OHPB) is used for dynamic impact experiments of cellular materials.
   Digital image correlation (DIC) is used as a tool for investigating the
   displacements and velocities at the faces of the bars. A
   straight-forward wave separation technique combining the data from the
   strain-gauges with the DIC is adopted to increase the experiment time
   window multiple times. The experimental method is successfully tested at
   impact velocities in a range of 5 - 30 m.s(-1) with both linear elastic
   and visco-elastic bars of a medium diameter. It is shown that, under

Abstract = {{We describe here the quasi-static crushing behavior of novel classes of
   multiphase (hybrid) hierarchical lattice metamaterials. The first class
   is represented by a hybrid architecture combining a hierarchical
   honeycomb with polyurethane foam filler, while the second is a
   multiphase structure produced by injecting an alginate hydrogel into the
   hierarchical voids of the honeycomb metamaterial. Twelve different
   auxetic (i.e. negative Poisson's ratio) and non-auxetic metamaterial
   architectures have been 3D printed and subjected to edgewise compression
   crushing loading. A parametric numerical analysis has been also
   performed using validated finite element models to identify best
   metamaterial architecture configurations. Configurations filled with the
   hydrogel showed a significant stabilization of the deformation mechanism
   during large deformation edgewise compression. The use of metamaterials
   designs with internal slots and round in the ribs also filled by
   polyurethane rigid semi-reticulated foam feature however significant
   increases in terms of specific stiffness, mean crushing force, strength
   and energy absorption. The enhancement is particularly evident for the
   hybrid lattice metamaterials auxetic configurations.}},

   of the re-entrant composite lattice structures using an analytical model}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{257}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{In the present study, a novel theoretical model is developed, based on
   classical laminate theory, to predict the equivalent mechanical
   properties of the re-entrant lattice structures, which composed of
   continuous fiber reinforced composite struts. Three main mechanism of
   stretching, flexing and hinging are considered and a general closed-form
   formulation is derived to estimate the auxetic honeycomb's elastic and
   shear modulus as well as Poisson's ratios. In spite of previous studies
   in which the response of honeycomb structures is modeled using beam
   theory, here, each strut of unit cell is expressed as a composite
   laminate with orthotropic mechanical properties and classical laminate
   theory is implemented to calculate the mechanical constants. In
   addition, using the available relations, the elastic buckling stress and
   failure load of the auxetic unit cell is evaluated. The proposed model
   is validated using experimental results, which are available from the
   previous studies as well as FE simulations. A parametric study is also
   conducted on the model to study the effects of cell angle and
   honeycomb's density on the mechanical properties and failure stresses of
   the re-entrant structure. The results show that, the proposed analytical
   model can finely predict the equivalent and failure properties of the
   auxetic honeycomb structures. Furthermore, it is observed that, for the
   considered re-entrant composite structures with the cell angles between
   -25 to 25, the vertical strut fails due to the damage evolution and for
   the unit cells with other cell angles, the buckling failure is
   determinative.}},

   Pneumatic Linear Actuators}},

Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{In this article, the inverted honeycomb cell, known to exhibit an
   auxetic behavior, is considered to design two pneumatic linear
   actuators. The actuators are built using a combination of soft and rigid
   structures. They present complementary performances in terms of
   displacement, force, and stiffness. Experimental evaluations are
   conducted using prototypes produced using multimaterial additive
   manufacturing to combine soft and rigid materials with freedom of shape.
   The first actuator is inspired by origami structures. The possibility to
   obtain large deformations under low pressure is observed. The second
   actuator is based on a cylindrical auxetic structure based on the
   inverted honeycomb cell. Smaller deformation is reached but the design
   favors the off-axis stiffness, so the component can be integrated
   without any additional mechanical joint for translation. A discussion on
   the relative performances of these two actuators and their possible uses
   conclude the paper.}},

Title = {{Assessment of negative Poisson's ratio effect on the postbuckling of
   pressure-loaded FG-CNTRC laminated cylindrical shells}},
Journal = {{MECHANICS BASED DESIGN OF STRUCTURES AND MACHINES}},
Abstract = {{This paper examines the postbuckling behaviors of pressure-loaded
   laminated cylindrical shells made of carbon nanotube reinforced
   composite (CNTRC) under thermal environmental conditions. The shell has
   negative in-plane or out-of-plane effective Poisson's ratio (EPR). The
   thermo-mechanical properties of CNTRCs are temperature dependent. The
   CNT volume fraction of the shell is in a piece-wise functionally graded
   (FG) distribution across the shell thickness. The extended rule of
   mixture (EROM) model is applied to determine the thermo-mechanical
   properties of CNTRCs. Based on the framework of the Reddy's third order
   shear deformation shell theory and the von Karman-type of kinematic
   assumptions, the governing partial differential equations for
   pressure-loaded CNTRC laminated cylindrical shells are formulated. The
   thermal environmental condition effect is also included. The
   postbuckling solution for pressure-loaded FG-CNTRC laminated cylindrical
   shell is obtained in the asymptotic sense by means of a singular
   perturbation technique in associate with a two-step perturbation
   approach. Numerical investigations are carried out for the (10/60/10)(S)
   shell including in-plane NPR effect, and (20/-20/20)(S) and
   (70/-70/70)(S) shells including out-of-plane NPR effect. Assessment is
   presented through numerical comparisons.}},

Title = {{Natural Resource Rents, Inequality, and Terrorism in Africa}},
Journal = {{DEFENCE AND PEACE ECONOMICS}},
Abstract = {{This study examines the impact of natural resource rents on terrorism
   via inequality channel in 34 African economies, straddling the period
   1980-2012. This study employs a negative binomial regression, in which
   the following findings are established: first, the unconditional impact
   of natural resource rents on terrorism is found to be positive across
   the model specifications, particularly when Gini and Theil indices are
   controlled for. Second, inequality has no discernable first-order impact
   on terrorism across the board. Third, the marginal impacts of
   interactions between inequality measures, specifically Gini and Theil
   coefficients and total natural resource rents on terrorism are
   significantly negative. Four, the corresponding net effects of
   interactions between natural resource rents and inequality (Gini and
   Theil coefficients) on terrorism are positive, thus lending support to
   earlier submission of involving all constitutive variables in the
   specifications for the parameters to make economic sense. The results
   are robust to accounting for fixed and country effects using the Poisson
   Pseudo maximum likelihood high-dimension fixed effects estimator. On the
   policy front, maintaining fairness and equity in the distribution of
   rents from the `free gifts of nature' remains a veritable policy menu,
   especially for the resource-rich economies, to counteracting terrorist
   activities.}},

Abstract = {{Various structural configurations of iron trifluoride appear at the
   nanoscale and macroscopic size, either in the amorphous or crystalline
   state. The specific atomic organization in these structures crucially
   alters the performance of FeF3 as an effective cathode in Li-ion
   batteries. Our detailed first-principles computational simulations
   examine the structural strains induced by temperature and stress on the
   four anhydrous polymorphs observed so far in FeF3 at ambient pressure. A
   wealth of data covering previous experimental results on their
   equilibrium structures and extending their characterization with new
   static and isothermal equations of state is provided. We inform on how
   porous apertures associated with the six-octahedra rings of the HTB and
   pyrochlore phases are modified under compressive and expansive strains.
   A quasi-auxetic behavior at low pressures for the ground state
   rhombohedral phase is detected, which is in concordance with its
   anomalous structural anisotropy. In contrast with the effect of
   temperature, this structure undergoes under negative pressure phase
   transitions to the other three polymorphs, indicating potential
   conditions where low-density FeF3 could show a better performance in

Month = {{JAN 28}},
Abstract = {{BackgroundMortality rate under the age of five is the proportion of
   deaths of children below the age of 5 years out of 1000 live births. It
   is related with the living standard of a population, and it is taken as
   one of the health and socioeconomic status deterioration index.
   Mortality rate under the age of five also indicates a poor quality life
   standards of a population. It is very significantly high in Sub-Saharan
   African countries. Ethiopia is one of these Sub-Saharan African
   countries where mortality rate under the age five is high. This research
   work aims to identify the determinants and associated factors of
   under-five mortality in Ethiopia.MethodsThe data for this paper were
   gathered from the EDHS 2016, collected by CSA. In this study, count
   family models such as Poisson, negative binomial, zero-inflated Poisson
   and zero-inflated negative binomial regression were applied for
   analyzing the data. Each of these count models were compared with
   different statistical tests like log-likelihood ratio test, Akaike
   information criteria, mean absolute difference, Vuong test and observed
   versus predicted probability plot.ResultsThe study revealed that as
   mothers' age at first birth increased by one unit, the average number of
   under-five mortality rate decreased by 2.69\%. In the same way the
   number of under-five mortality of Afar, Benishangul Gumuz and Dire Dawa
   were 1.3446, 1.6429 and 1.3320 times more likely to Tigray respectively.
   The risk of under-five mortality for primary and secondary education
   level of the mother was 28.31 and 40.96\% less likely than to mothers
   who have no education respectively.ConclusionFrom the result we found
   that, there were overabundance zeros and broad heterogeneity in the
   non-zero outcomes. Zero-inflated negative binomial regression model was
   found to best fit the data, and from the regression model, age of
   mothers at first birth, mother's education level, place of residence and
   region were statistically significant factors of under-five mortality
   per mother.}},

Title = {{Numerical and experimental investigation of FDM fabricated re-entrant
   auxetic structures of ABS and PLA materials under compressive loading}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - Auxetic structures are one type of mechanical meta-materials
   mainly used for energy absorption applications because of their unique
   negative Poisson's ratio. This study is focused on numerical and
   experimental investigations of fused deposition modeling (FDM)
   fabricated re-entrant auxetic structures of acrylonitrile butadiene
   styrene (ABS) and poly-lactic acid (PLA) materials under compressive
   loading. Influence of geometric parameters, namely, re-entrant angle,
   height and arm-length on strength, stiffness and specific energy
   absorption (SEA) of auxetic structures under compressive loading.
   Optimization of significant parameters is also performed to maximize
   these responses and minimize weight and time of fabrication. Further,
   efforts have also been made to develop predictive models for strength,
   stiffness and SEA of auxetic structures.
   Design/methodology/approach - A full factorial design of experiment is
   used for planning experiments. Auxetic structures of ABS and PLA are
   fabricated by FDM technique of additive manufacturing within the
   constrained range of geometric parameters. Analysis of variance is
   performed to identify the influence of geometric parameters on
   responses. To optimize the geometric parameters Gray relational analysis
   is used. Deformation of auxetic structures is studied under compressive
   loading. A numerical investigation is also performed by building
   nonlinear finite element models of auxetic structures.
   Findings - From the analysis of results, it is found that re-entrant
   angle, height and arm-length with their interactions are significant
   parameters influencing responses, namely, strength, stiffness and SEA of
   the auxetic structures of ABS and PLA materials. Based on the analysis,
   statistical nonlinear quadratic models are developed to predict these
   responses. Optimal configurations of auxetic structure of ABS and PLA
   are determined to maximize strength, stiffness, SEA and minimize weight
   and time of fabrication. From the study of deformation of auxetic
   structures, it is found that ABS structures have higher energy
   absorption, whereas PLA structures have better stiffness. Results of
   finite element analysis (FEA) are found in good agreement with
   experimental results.
   Research limitations/implications - The present study is limited to
   re-entrant type of auxetic structures of ABS and PLA materials only
   under compressive loading. Also, results from the present study are
   valid within the selected range of geometric parameters. The findings of
   the present study are useful in maximizing strength, stiffness and SEA
   of auxetic structures that have wide applications in the automotive,
   aerospace, sports and marine sector.
   Originality/value - No literature is available on studying the influence
   of geometric parameters, namely, re-entrant angle, height and arm-length
   of auxetic structure on strength, stiffness and SEA under compressive
   loading. Also, a comparative study of feedstock materials, namely, ABS
   and PLA, is also not reported. The present work attempts to fulfill the
   above research gaps.}},

Title = {{Kinetically Tunable, Active Auxetic, and Variable Recruitment Active
   Textiles from Hierarchical Assemblies}},
Journal = {{ADVANCED MATERIALS TECHNOLOGIES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Multifunctional textiles with programmable, multi-axial, distributed,
   and scalable actuation are highly desirable and presently unrealized. 1D
   torque-unbalanced active yarns within 2D textile structures are
   exploited to produce soft and scalable active textiles that exhibit
   tunable displacements, forces, stiffnesses, and kinematic deformations.
   Through a textile hierarchy spanning active material composition, yarn
   construction, textile geometry, and system architecture, these active
   textiles accomplish kinetic tunability, variable recruitment behaviors,
   and auxetic effects without mechanical contact, called active auxetic
   effects. New modes of pre-programmed multi-axial performance are enabled
   by geometrically manipulating-specifically pre-stressing and
   constraining-active filaments in torsion and leveraging their structural
   elastic instability within a textile geometry. The new kinematic motion
   afforded by torque-unbalanced active yarns enhances the performance of
   active textiles, which accomplish tensile strokes over 40\%, generated
   blocked forces up to 308 N m(-1), and specific work over 0.4. kJ kg(-1).
   Advances in active textiles are demonstrated through multifunctional 3D
   applications, including a variable constriction pump that exhibits
   sequential actuation, a wearable that conforms multi-axially around the
   body, and a soft exoskeleton that performs assistive motions and on-body
   anchoring simultaneously. By harnessing the capabilities of active
   materials within a textile hierarchy, advances in the potentiality of
   multifunctional textiles are presented.}},

Title = {{Auxetic behavior of warp knitted fabric under repeating tension}},
Journal = {{TEXTILE RESEARCH JOURNAL}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{In our previous study, a novel class of auxetic warp knitted fabrics
   were developed and their auxetic behaviors were studied under a single
   tensile test. However, during daily use, the fabrics are usually
   subjected to repeating tension rather than single tension. Therefore,
   the durability of the fabrics' auxetic performance is of great
   importance. So far, the auxetic behavior of fabrics under repeating
   tension has not systematically been investigated. In this paper, we
   report a study on the auxetic behavior of warp knitted fabrics under
   repeating tension. All the fabric samples were subjected to a repeating
   tensile test within a tensile strain of 25\% until 100 tensile cycles.
   The results show that the fabrics can keep their auxetic effect in both
   course and wale testing directions after 100 tensile cycles, and the
   auxetic effect in the wale direction is retained longer under higher
   tensile strains than that under lower tensile strains with the increase
   of tensile cycles. The results also indicate that auxetic stability in
   the course direction is much better than that in the wale direction. We
   hope that this study can offer useful information to improve the auxetic
   stability of auxetic fabrics for practical use.}},

Title = {{Integrated psychosocial, economic strengthening, and clinical

   with HIV and their caregivers: Findings from a prospective cohort study
   in Zambia}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Abstract = {{Background
   Children and youth are profoundly impacted groups in Zambia's HIV
   epidemic. To evaluate delivery of integrated psychosocial, economic
   strengthening, and clinical services to HIV-affected households through
   the Zambia Family (ZAMFAM) Project, a prospective cohort study compared
   socio-economic, psychosocial, and health outcomes among ZAMFAM
   beneficiaries to non-beneficiaries.
   Methods
   In July-October 2017, 544 adolescents living with HIV (ALHIV) aged 5-17
   years and their adult caregivers were recruited from Central (ZAMFAM
   implementation sites) and Eastern (non-intervention sites) Provinces.
   Structured interviews at baseline and one-year follow-up assessed
   household characteristics, socio-economic wellbeing, and health service
   utilization. Poisson regression with generalized estimating equations
   measured one-year changes in key health and socio-economic indicators,
   comparing ZAMFAM beneficiaries to non-beneficiaries.
   Results
   Overall, 494 households completed two rounds of assessment (retention
   rate: 91\%) Among ALHIV, improvements in current antiretroviral therapy
   use over time (Adjusted Prevalence Rate Ratio {[}aPRR] = 1.06, 95\%
   Confidence Interval {[}95\% CI]: 1.01-1.11) and reductions in
   non-household labor (aPRR = 0.44, 95\% CI: 0.20-0.99) were significantly
   larger among ZAMFAM beneficiaries than non-beneficiaries. For
   caregivers, receiving ZAMFAM services was associated with significant
   reductions in HIV-related stigma (aPRR = 0.49, 95\% CI: 0.28-0.88) and
   perceived negative community attitudes towards HIV (aPRR = 0.77, 95\%
   CI: 0.62-0.96). Improvements in caregiver capacity to pay for unexpected
   (aPRR = 1.54, 95\% CI: 1.17-2.04) and food-related expenses (aPRR =
   1.48, 95\% CI: 1.16-1.90), as well as shared decision-making authority
   in household spending (aPRR = 1.41, 95\% CI: 1.04-1.93) and
   self-reported good or very good health status (aPRR = 1.46, 95\% CI:
   1.14-1.87), were also significantly larger among ZAMFAM beneficiaries.
   Conclusions
   Significant improvements in caregivers' financial capacity were observed
   among households receiving ZAMFAM services, with few changes in health
   or wellbeing among ALHIV. Integrated service-delivery approaches like
   ZAMFAM may yield observable socio-economic improvements in the
   short-term. Strengthening community-based delivery of psychosocial and
   health support to ALHIV is encouraged.}},

Abstract = {{Door system plays a very important role in the domain of automobile
   passive safety. In order to improve its side crashworthiness, some
   affiliated impact components are assembled. Conventional impact parts
   can make the door system possess enough stiffness and strength so as to
   ensure the integrity of car body when side collision occurs. But for
   occupant protection, the excessive rigidity may increase the risk of
   occupant injury. To address this problem, this work first introduces a
   kind of negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) structure, and proposes a novel
   door system which is composed of NPR energy-absorbing block, NPR impact
   beam, inner panel, outer panel, and reinforcing plate. Next, parameter
   sensitivity analysis for each performance index is conducted to
   determine the corresponding variables when constructing the approximate
   model. Then, aiming at the disadvantages of the Technology for Order
   Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) and the Mean Square
   Deviation Method (MSDM) in processing performance index data, a novel
   integrated weighting method is used to determine the weighting
   coefficient of each performance index. Finally, considering side
   structural crashworthiness, occupant protection, and lightweight, the
   hierarchical optimization for the novel door system is conducted to
   further enhance its overall performance. The result demonstrates that
   compared with the conventional door, the optimal door can improve the
   performance of occupant protection and ensure the side crashworthiness
   more effectively.}},

Abstract = {{Nickel titanium, also know as nitinol, is a prototypical shape memory
   alloy, a property intimately linked to a phase transition in the
   microstructure, which allows the meso/macroscopic sample shape to be
   recovered after thermal cycling. Not much is known about the other
   alloys in this binary system, which prompted our computational
   investigation of other compositions. In this work, structures are found
   by probing the potential energy surfaces of NiTi binary systems using a
   minima hopping method, in combination with ab initio electronic
   structure calculations. We find stable structures in 34 different
   stoichiometries and calculate derived physical properties of the low
   energy phases. From the results of this analysis a new convex hull is
   formed that is lower in energy than those in the Materials Project and
   Open Quantum Materials Databases. Two previously unreported phases are
   discovered for the NiTi2 and Ni5Ti compositions, and two metastable
   states in NiTi and NiTi2 shows signs of negative linear compression and
   negative Poisson ratio, respectively.}},

Title = {{Epsilon-Negative Carbon Aerogels with State Transition from Dielectric
   to Degenerate Semiconductor}},
Journal = {{ADVANCED ELECTRONIC MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Aerogels with negative parameters have become a research hotspot since
   the discovery of negative Poisson's ratio and negative thermal expansion
   coefficient in aerogels. The negative parameters are originally brought
   up and studied in electromagnetic metamaterials, leaving a question that
   whether aerogels can be used to construct metamaterials with negative
   electromagnetic parameters. Here, the authors show that negative
   permittivity (epsilon-negative) property can be achieved in carbon
   aerogels, and its value is adjusted continuously by changing the
   composition of carbon aerogels but keeping their microstructure
   unchanged. This is a novel strategy different from the typical
   array-structure-containing metamaterials. Moreover, a physical state
   transition is found when increasing the carbonization temperature, where
   the initial low-loss dielectric state evolves into a high-loss one upon
   increasing the temperature from 400 to 700 degrees C followed by a final
   degenerate semiconductor state when increasing the temperature to 800
   degrees C and above. This work can provide a new method toward the
   design of electromagnetic metamaterials, starting by choosing the
   component materials with optimal composition.}},

Title = {{Optimizing the Auxetic Geometry Parameters in Few Yarns Based Auxetic
   Woven Fabrics for Enhanced Mechanical Properties Using Grey Relational
   Analysis}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NATURAL FIBERS}},
Abstract = {{2D woven auxetic fabrics (AF) developed by weave design modification
   provide a continuous, commercial, and low-cost manufacturing process for
   high strength and stable auxetic structures. However, AFs developed by
   previous methods have a highly folded surface, which is problematic in
   printing, laminating, and stitching. For the first time, we studied the
   auxeticity in a few yarn-based auxetic structures, which provides a
   uniform surface texture. Reentrant honey-comb geometry was chosen to
   fabricate auxetic woven fabrics, as such geometry shows the best auxetic
   nature. Different parameters of auxetic geometry were optimized based on
   their mechanical response using the statistical tool: gray relational
   analysis (GRA). The mechanical properties of AFs were compared with
   conventional (3/1 twill woven) non-auxetic fabric (NAF), having the same
   specifications. The smaller unit cell (3E) with a reorientation area of
   4P showed optimum auxeticity and mechanical properties. The optimized
   auxetic structure showed superior mechanical properties as compared to
   conventional fabric. GRA grade of optimized AF was 67.3\% higher than
   the NAF. Most importantly, the tensile strength was 23\% higher for
   optimized AF structure. The bidimensional energy dissipation ability of
   the AF provides a key advantage in the superior mechanical response.}},

Volume = {{64}},

Pages = {{260-277}},

Abstract = {{Hydraulic fracturing reservoir reconstruction technology is crucial in
   the development of shale gas exploitation techniques. Large quantities
   of high-pressure fluids injected into shale reservoirs significantly
   alter compressional (P) and shear (S) wave velocities, rock mechanical
   parameters, and anisotropic characteristics. In this study,
   differentiated hydraulic fracturing petrophysical experiments were
   carried out on Longmaxi Formation shale under pseudo-triaxial stress
   loading conditions. The effects of stress loading methods, and
   water-rock physical and chemical reactions on P- and S-wave velocities
   and rock mechanical parameters were compared. The experimental results
   showed that isotropic stress loading may increase the P- and S-wave
   velocities and Young's modulus of dry shale kldnsample. Furthermore, it
   may lead to a weakening of the corresponding anisotropy. In contrast,
   differential stress loading was able to improve the anisotropy of
   Young's modulus and accelerate the decrease in the compressive strength
   of shale in the vertical bedding direction. The water-rock physical and
   chemical reactions prompted by hydraulic fracturing was found to
   ``soften{''} shale samples and reduce Young's modulus. The influence of
   this ``soften{''} effect on the compressional and shear wave velocities
   of shale was negligible, whilst there was a significant decrease in the
   anisotropy characteristics of Thomsen parameters, Young's modulus, and
   Poisson's ratio. The negative linear relationship between the Poisson's
   ratios of the shale samples was also observed to lose sensitivity to
   stress loading, as a result of the ``soften{''} effect of fracturing
   fluid on shale. The results of this study provide a reliable reference
   point and data support for future research on the mechanical properties
   of Longmaxi shale rocks.}},

Abstract = {{Developing two-dimensional multifunctional materials is highly desirable
   for nanoscale device applications. Herein, by means of first-principles
   calculations, we demonstrate a promising two-dimensional multifunctional
   semiconductor with ferroelectricity, ultrahigh carrier mobility, and
   negative Poisson's ratio in single-layer BI. We show that single-layer
   BI exhibits intrinsic ferroelectricity, derived from its asymmetric
   structure, and the ferroelectricity features an in-plane electric
   polarization as large as 3.3 x 10(-10)C(m-1), which is beneficial for
   nonvolatile memories. Owing to its large band dispersion, single-layer
   BI is also found to harbor an extremely high carrier mobility (1.17 x
   10(5) cm(2)V(-1)s(-1)), even comparable to that of graphene, suggesting
   its potential for high-performance electronics and bulk photo-voltaic
   effect. This, combined with the moderate band gap, renders single-layer
   BI with a high absorption coefficient (10(5)cm(m-1)) from near-infrared
   to ultraviolet light. In addition, we unveil that single-layer BI is a
   long-sought-after auxetic material with a negative Poisson's ratio of
   -0.31. All of these findings make single-layer BI a compelling
   multifunctional material, offering a versatile platform for diverse
   nanoscale devices applications.}},

Abstract = {{Most metamaterials with negative Poisson's ratio and/or negative thermal
   expansion coefficient possess relatively low stiffness. In this work, a
   novel hybrid-honeycomb structure with enhanced stiffness is proposed. It
   consists of two merged hexagonal honeycombs. Analytical and
   computational homogenization methods are used to evaluate the effective
   thermoelastic properties. Analytical expressions of the effective
   Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, and thermal expansion coefficient are
   given. We show that the effective thermoelastic properties of the
   structure are widely tunable by tailoring the microstructural geometry
   and the constituent materials. In particular, the inplane effective
   Poisson's ratio and thermal expansion coefficient are adjustable over a
   wide range, from negative to positive. By properly choosing the
   geometrical and material parameters, the structure can be designed to
   concurrently possess an enhanced stiffness and a high degree of
   auxeticity and negative thermal expansion.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials with a negative Poisson's ratio show a unique lateral
   expansion under tension while their deformation under shear is similar
   to that of normal materials. Here, we present a novel method to design
   the stiffness of tubular structures by exploiting these load-dependent
   distinct deformation modes of auxetic materials. Auxetic cutting
   patterns are engraved on a tube whose bending and torsional stiffness
   values are predicted computationally for a comprehensive set of design
   parameters and measured experimentally for representative designs.
   Results demonstrate that a wide range of bending and torsional stiffness
   values can be effectively achieved and controlled independently. The
   proposed design principle is simple and powerful, and hence can be
   easily extended to design the mechanical properties of non-tubular
   structures as well. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

   negative Poisson's ratio. Most auxetic metamaterials are truss-based or
   originate from Boolean operations of simple geometries. Herein, we
   introduce a new 3D auxetic metamaterial that is mathematically generated
   from an implicit expression. Further, this metamaterial is fabricated by
   3D printing using a flexible material, which allows it to recover from
   large deformations. The buckling-induced auxetic behavior of the
   metamaterial was first evaluated via compression tests and finite
   element analyses. A nickel layer was then plated onto the surface to
   enhance its stiffness, strength, and conductivity without loss of
   auxeticity and resilience. The integration of 3D printing and
   electroless plating enabled accurate control over the mechanical and
   conduction properties of the auxetic metamaterial; these properties are
   presented as contour maps for guidance in functional applications. (C)

Abstract = {{This work studies the low-velocity impact response of 3D-printed layered

   composed of crushable cellular cores placed in between terminal
   stiffening plates. The cores tessellate either honeycomb hexagonal unit
   cells, or hexagonal cells with re-entrant corners, with the latter
   exhibiting auxetic response. The given results highlight that the
   examined PETg protectors exhibit higher energy dissipation ratios and
   lower restitution coefficients, as compared to PLA structures that have

   material for the fabrication of effective impact protection gear through
   ordinary, low-cost 3D printers.}},

   lactic acid reinforced with chicken keratin materials}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{283}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{In this research, auxetic composites of polylactic acid (PLA) reinforced
   by keratin materials (barbs and rachis), were developed through 3D
   printing manufacture to induce diverse acoustic properties. To evaluate
   the coefficient of sound absorption, an electro-acoustic experiment was
   implemented. The capacity of sound absorption for the composites was
   superior to conventional (honeycomb) and auxetic PLA geometries without
   reinforcement. Reduction of the free space in cavities (achieved by
   keratin materials) triggered an increment in the resistance in air flow,
   improving the sound absorption. Also, increasing the interconnectivity
   of the cavities provides sound waves with irregular transmission routes,
   which reduce the wave's energy. Thus, in this work, acoustic properties
   are associated with 3D geometry of auxetic composites, shape, and
   concentration of reinforcements; considering the synergistic effect due
   to this combination, a range of metamaterials with acoustic capabilities
   were generated. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Association between dietary diversity with overweight and obesity: A
   cross-sectional study conducted among pastoralists in Monduli District
   in Tanzania}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 13}},
Abstract = {{Background
   The prevalence of overweight and obesity is rising at a rapid pace and
   is associated with negative health consequences like cardiovascular
   diseases, type 2 diabetes and cancer. Obesity is a multifactorial
   problem that develops mainly from lifestyle factors including physical
   inactivity and poor dietary intake. Dietary diversity is a simplified
   method for assessing the adequacy and quality of diet and is associated
   with nutritional need and overall health status. Therefore, we conducted
   this study to synthesize the associations between consumption of a
   diversified diet and overweight/ obesity among adults living in pastoral
   communities in Monduli district in Tanzania.
   Methods
   This was a cross-sectional study conducted among 510 adults aged >= 18
   years old in the Monduli district, Arusha region in Tanzania. We
   conducted face-to-face interviews to collect information about
   socio-demographic characteristics, 24-hours dietary recall, and
   anthropometric measurements. The dietary diversity score (DDS) was
   constructed and used to determine the diversity of the diet consumed. We
   performed the multivariate Poisson regressions to determine the
   prevalence ratio (PR) with 95\% confidence intervals (CI). The dependent
   variables were overweight and general obesity as measured by body mass
   index (BMI), abdominal obesity measured by waist-hip ratio (WHR) and
   waist circumference (WC).
   Results
   The prevalence of general obesity based on BMI was 20.2\% (95\%CI;
   16.9-23.9), abdominal obesity based on WHR was 37.8\% (95\%CI;
   33.7-42.1), and WC was 29.1\% (95\%CI; 25.2-33.1). More than half
   (54.3\%) of the participants consumed an adequate dietary diversity (DDS
   >= 4). After adjustment for potential confounders, the prevalence of
   abdominal obesity by WHR decreased with higher DDS among male (APR =
   0.42; 95\% CI, 0.22-0.77) and female participants (APR = 0.63; 95\% CI,
   0.41-0.94). There were inconsistent positive associations between DDS
   and prevalence of overweight and general obesity among male and female.
   There was no association between DDS and abdominal obesity by WC.
   Conclusion
   More than half of the pastoralists have consumed an adequate diversified
   diet. Given the inconsistent findings on associations between dietary
   diversity and obesity measures, this study suggests that targeting
   dietary diversity as an overweight/obesity prevention strategy requires
   careful consideration.}},

Abstract = {{We handshake statistical mechanics with continuum mechanics to develop a
   methodology for consistent evaluation of the continuum scale properties
   of two-dimensional materials. The methodology is tested on pristine
   graphene. Our scope is kept limited to elastic modulus,E, which has been
   reported to vary between 0.912 TPa and 7 TPa, Poisson's ratio,nu, which
   has been reported to vary from being negative to a value as large as
   0.46, and effective thickness,q, whose value varies between 0.75
   angstrom and 3.41 angstrom. Such a large scatter arises due to
   inconsistent evaluation of these properties and making assumptions that
   may not be valid at atomistic scales. Our methodology combines three
   separate methods: uniaxial tension, equibiaxial tension, and flexural
   out-of-plane free vibrations of simply supported sheets, which, when
   used in tandem in molecular dynamics, can provide consistent values
   ofE,nu andq. The only assumption made in the present study is the
   validity of the continuum scale thin plate vibration equation to
   represent the free vibrations of a graphene sheet. Our results suggest
   that-(i) graphene is auxetic in nature, (ii)Edecreases with increasing
   size and temperature, and (iii) the effective thicknessqincreases with
   increasing size and temperature. Further, a robustness study of the
   computed mechanical properties shows consistent results, with
   differences varying between 1.4\% and 6\%.}},

Abstract = {{This article introduces a computational design framework for obtaining
   three-dimensional (3D) periodic elastoplastic architected materials with
   enhanced performance, subject to uniaxial or shear strain. A nonlinear
   finite element model accounting for plastic deformation is developed,
   where a Lagrange multiplier approach is utilized to impose periodicity
   constraints. The analysis assumes that the material obeys a von Mises
   plasticity model with linear isotropic hardening. The finite element
   model is combined with a corresponding path-dependent adjoint
   sensitivity formulation, which is derived analytically. The optimization
   problem is parametrized using the solid isotropic material penalization
   method. Designs are optimized for either end compliance or toughness for
   a given prescribed displacement. Such a framework results in producing
   materials with enhanced performance through much better utilization of
   an elastoplastic material. Several 3D examples are used to demonstrate
   the effectiveness of the mathematical framework.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a data-driven approach to predict mechanical
   properties of auxetic kirigami metamaterials with randomly oriented
   cuts. The finite element method (FEM) was used to generate datasets, the
   convolutional neural network (CNN) was introduced to train these data,
   and an implicit mapping between the input orientations of cuts and the
   output Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of the kirigami sheets was
   established. With this input-output relationship in hand, a quick
   estimation of auxetic behavior of kirigami metamaterials is
   straightforward. Our examples indicate that if the distributions of
   training and test datasets are close to each other, a good prediction is
   achievable. Our efforts provide a fast and reliable way to evaluate the
   homogenized properties of mechanical metamaterials with various
   microstructures, and thus accelerate the design of mechanical
   metamaterials for diverse applications.}},

Abstract = {{This research presents an investigation of the compressive behavior of
   auxetic cementitious cellular composites (CCCs) using a combination of
   experiments and finite element (FE) simulations. Typical auxetic
   centrosymmetric geometry was used as unit cells for the cellular
   structure and fiber reinforced cementitious mortar were used as
   constituent material. By varying the cellular geometry, three CCCs (P0,
   P25 and P50) were prepared then experimentally and numerically tested
   under uniaxial compression with different boundary conditions. Good
   agreement can be found between experimental and FE simulated results:
   Only CCCs with chiral section (P25 and P50) exhibited auxetic behavior
   and a typical compressive stress-strain response with two peaks was
   found; Under restrained boundary condition, different from the cone
   confinement zone observed in bulk cementitious materials, re-entrant
   confinement zone was found in the auxetic CCCs. More importantly, a
   cracking initiated section rotation mechanism is identified for the
   CCCs' auxetic behavior which is distinct from the elastic instability
   mechanism of polymeric auxetic materials with the same cellular
   structure. In terms of density, energy dissipation ability and Poisson's
   ratio, the auxetic CCCs shows excellent properties making them promising
   in various civil engineering applications. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

   ferroelasticity and bidirectional negative Poisson's ratio}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{9}},

Month = {{JAN 7}},
Abstract = {{Two-dimensional (2D) antiferromagnetic ferroelasticity and bidirectional
   auxeticity are highly sought for next-generation nanoelectronics,
   spintronics, or mechanical devices, but are rarely reported. Herein,
   using first-principles calculations, we report the coexistence of these
   intriguing properties in the vanadium tetrafluoride (VF4) monolayer. 2D
   VF4 is a direct wide-gap semiconductor with antiferromagnetic order
   stemming from the synergy between the direct exchange and superexchange
   of the d(xy) orbitals in adjacent V atoms. Notably, 2D VF4 features
   ferroelasticity with a moderate reversible strain and low transition
   barrier, enabling manipulation of the in-plane magnetic easy axis via
   external strain. Additionally, 2D VF4 simultaneously harbors an
   ultra-large negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) in both the in-plane and
   out-of-plane directions due to the hinged connection between the
   neighboring VF6 octahedra. Our work highlights a new material for the
   exploration of 2D multiferroic physics and the integration of
   antiferromagnetic ferroelasticity and large bidirectional auxeticity
   renders 2D VF4 a versatile candidate for the development of novel
   multifunctional devices.}},

Title = {{3D Strain Field Evolution and Failure Mechanisms in Anisotropic
   Paperboard}},
Journal = {{EXPERIMENTAL MECHANICS}},

Volume = {{61}},

Abstract = {{Background Experimental analyses of the 3D strain field evolution during
   loading allows for better understanding of deformation and failure
   mechanisms at the meso- and microscale in different materials. In order
   to understand the auxetic behaviour and delamination process in
   paperboard materials during tensile deformation, it is essential to
   study the out-of-plane component of the strain tensor that is, in
   contrast to previous 2D studies, only achievable in 3D.
   Objective The main objective of this study is to obtain a better
   understanding of the influence of different out-of-plane structures and
   in-plane material directions on the deformation and failure mechanisms
   at the meso- and microscale in paperboard samples.
   Methods X-ray tomography imaging during in-situ uniaxial tensile testing
   and Digital Volume Correlation analysis was performed to investigate the
   3D strain field evolution and microscale mechanical behaviour in two
   different types of commercial paperboards and in two material
   directions. The evolution of sample properties such as the spatial
   variation in sample thickness, solid fraction and fibre orientation
   distribution were also obtained from the images. A comprehensive
   analysis of the full strain tensor in paperboards is lacking in previous
   research, and the influence of material directions and out-of-plane
   structures on 3D strain field patterns as well as the spatial and
   temporal quantification of the auxetic behaviour in paperboard are novel
   contributions.
   Results The results show that volumetric and deviatoric strain,
   dominated by the out-of-plane normal strain component of the strain
   tensor, localize in the out-of-plane centre already in the initial
   linear stress-strain regime. In-plane strain field patterns differ
   between samples loaded in the Machine Direction (MD) and Cross Direction
   (CD); in MD, strain localizes in a more well-defined zone close to the
   notches and the failure occurs abruptly at peak load, resulting in
   angular fracture paths extending through the stiffer surface planes of
   the samples. In CD, strain localizes in more horizontal and continuous
   bands between the notches and at peak load, fractures are not clearly
   visible at the surfaces of CD-tested samples that appear to fail
   internally through more well-distributed delamination.
   Conclusions In-plane strain localization preceded a local increase of
   sample thickness, i.e. the initiation of the delamination process, and
   at peak load, a dramatic increase in average sample thickening occurred.
   Different in-plane material directions affected the angles and
   continuity of the in-plane strain patterns as well as the sample and
   fracture properties at failure, while the out-of-plane structure
   affected how the strain fields distributed within the samples.}},

Journal = {{MECCANICA}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{56}},

Abstract = {{In recent experimental studies an unusual time-dependent transversal
   behavior of the annulus fibrosus of the intervertebral disc mainly
   caused by the coupling between mechanics and electro-chemical activity
   was disclosed. In this contribution, a microstructure-based model is
   proposed to connect structural features, intrinsic mechanics and
   electro-chemical properties of multi-layered soft tissues with a special
   attention to disc annulus. A hybrid experimental/modeling decoupling
   strategy is proposed to obtain the constitutive representation of each
   layer of the disc annulus thanks to full-field strain data. The layers
   are then reconnected to each other to get the overall time-dependent
   response considering inter-layer ionic diffusion as well as
   stress/strain continuity along the interfaces. The final constitutive
   model is shown to describe the experimentally observed behavior of
   bovine tissues under free swelling immediately followed by quasi-static
   stretching, deviating from chemical equilibrium and provoking
   auxeticity, and then relaxation, allowing equilibrium return. The
   model/experiments comparison demonstrates that the evaluation of the
   overall time-dependent response involves considering stress, volumetric
   change and auxetic feature simultaneously in relation to
   diffusion-mechanics and structural features in terms of collagen
   orientation/content, interlamellar matrix inter-spacing fiber-reinforced
   layers and gradual thickness of layers. The effective contribution of
   fiber-reinforced and unreinforced interlamellar layers on the coupling
   is discussed with respect to the model. Using the model, microstructure
   and coupling effects are independently investigated in order to
   highlight their role on the damage-related annulus shearing.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To compare employment in people by HIV status, mode of HIV
   transmission and migrant status. Design: Nation-wide population-based
   register data from 1996 to 2016. Methods: All people born between 1940
   and 2000 (n = 8587 629) were identified from the Swedish Total
   Population Register and linked to the Swedish National HIV Register (n =
   9492) and Longitudinal Integration Database for Health Insurance and
   Labour Market Studies. Adjusted prevalence ratios (adjPR) of employment
   were calculated using Poisson regression. Trends in employment were
   illustrated in scatterplots with overlaid prediction plots. Results:
   People with HIV were less likely employed than HIV-negative but with
   decreasing difference over time {[}adjPR 0.57, 95\% confidence interval
   (CI) 0.54-0.60 in 1996, adjPR 0.84, 95\% CI 0.83-0.86 in 2016]. Female
   migrants with HIV had the highest increase of employment over time and
   were more likely employed than HIV-negative female migrants by end of
   follow-up (adjPR 1.12, 95\% CI 1.08-1.16). Swedish-born with
   present/former intravenous drug use had the lowest employment rates.
   Individuals with undetectable HIV-RNA viral levels showed higher
   employment rates (adjPR 1.29, 95\% CI 1.20-1.38) compared with those
   with detectable viral levels. Conclusion: Employment in people living
   with HIV (PLWH) increased over time but remained lower than for
   HIV-negative people. HIV was not associated with lower employment in
   migrants by end of follow-up, indicating that HIV is not a barrier for
   employment among migrants in Sweden. The heterogeneity of PLWH needs to
   be taken into account in interventions, and future studies, focusing on
   access to the labour market in PLWH.}},

   reveals a number of specific features of the theoretical creep and

Abstract = {{Diabetic foot is a common complication of diabetes with a significant
   symptom of excessive plantar pressure. Studies have shown that reducing
   plantar pressure can effectively lower the incidence of diabetic foot.
   In this work, a new design method is proposed to reduce plantar pressure
   by dividing the orthotic insole into two areas. Support area is under
   the midfoot and shares a part of plantar pressure compared to flat
   structure. Soft area helps in decreasing the plantar pressure of the
   forefoot region and rearfoot region by low young's modulus structure.
   Honeycomb structure and auxetic structure are applied in the novel
   porous insole. The orthotic insoles were manufactured by
   fused-deposition modeling. Finite element analyses show that the auxetic
   structure of soft area enhances larger deformation than ordinary flat
   structure by 18\% under pressure. Results show that the support area
   reduces the pressure of the forefoot region and rearfoot region by 30\%
   during upright position. The scene of wearing orthotic insoles with
   pressure sensors is explored. Consequently, the novel porous insoles can
   be used to bring better plantar pressure reduction for the treatment of
   diabetic foot.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic structures, which have a negative Poisson's ratio, have good

   impact loading was investigated. For the in-plane (x and y) and
   out-of-plane (z) directions, boxes with an auxetic honeycomb structure
   were produced by material extrusion method using Power ABS filament. In
   the experimental study, dynamic tests were carried out with a drop test
   machine. Besides, explicit analyses were performed by creating finite
   element models for these 3 directions. The experimental and numerical
   results have shown that the energy absorption property of auxetic
   honeycomb geometry is superior in the case of out-of-plane loading, in
   agreement with each other. In in-plane loadings, crush force efficiency

Abstract = {{2-D and 3-D micro-architectured multiphase thermoelastic metamaterials
   are designed and analyzed using a parametric level set method for
   topology optimization and the finite element method. An asymptotic
   homogenization approach is employed to obtain the effective
   thermoelastic properties of the multiphase metamaterials. The
   epsilon-constraint multi-objective optimization method is adopted in the
   formulation. The coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) and Poisson's
   ratio (PR) are chosen as two objective functions, with the CTE optimized
   and the PR treated as a constraint. The optimization problems are solved
   by using the method of moving asymptotes. Effective isotropic and
   anisotropic CTEs and stiffness constants are obtained for the
   topologically optimized metamaterials with prescribed values of PR under
   the constraints of specified effective bulk modulus, volume fractions
   and material symmetry. Two solid materials along with one additional
   void phase are involved in each of the 2-D and 3-D optimal design
   examples. The numerical results reveal that the newly proposed approach
   can integrate shape and topology optimizations and lead to optimal
   microstructures with distinct topological boundaries. The current method
   can topologically optimize metamaterials with a positive, negative or
   zero CTE and a positive, negative or zero Poisson's ratio.}},

Abstract = {{Twenty-four rectangular RC column specimens, constructed at 1/3 scale,
   were tested under axial loading to investigate the use of ASWM (one,
   two, three, four, and five layers) exposed to elevated temperatures. Six

   250 degrees C, six columns at 500 degrees C, and six columns at 750
   degrees C) for 2 hr. The obtained results clearly showed that each axial
   load resistance, toughness, and stiffness were all negatively affected
   by escalated temperature degrees. Also, the confinement effectiveness in
   terms of the ultimate load was decreased with the increase in concrete
   compressive strength (un-damaged). The number of ASWM layers
   significantly influenced the ductility, energy absorption, and ultimate
   load improvement percentage. The number of the ASWM layers considerably
   enhanced the ductility up to a certain number of erected layers;

   lattice structures with negative Poisson's ratio}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIA SINICA-PHYSICA MECHANICA \& ASTRONOMICA}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{51}},
Number = {{5}},
Abstract = {{This paper studies the static mechanical properties of four-sided
   concave pyramid-type lattice structures with a polyurea coating and a
   negative Poisson's ratio. Experimental models of different types were
   made by the additive manufacturing method. Quasi-static compression
   experiments of lattice structures, and three-point and four-point
   bending experiments of lattice sandwich structures, were implemented.
   The lattice structure exhibited a significantly negative Poisson's ratio
   effect under compressive load. Under platform stresses of 0.6-1.0 MPa,
   the polyurea coating obviously improved the mechanical properties of the
   lattice structures. The total energy absorption, deformation energy per
   unit volume, and specific energy absorption were significantly higher
   (by 1-2 orders of magnitude) in the multicellular polyurea-coated models
   than in the uncoated models. The maximum energy-absorption efficiency
   and compression utilization in the polyurea-coated models reached
   40.59\% and 55.15\%, respectively. In the lattice structures without
   polyurea, the deformation energy per unit volume, specific energy
   absorption, maximum energy-absorption efficiency, and compression
   utilization decreased with increasing number of units. These trends are
   attributable to early brittle fracture. Meanwhile, the energy-absorption
   characteristics of the polyurea-coated lattice structures largely
   depended on the polyurea thickness. Under a bending load, the
   polyurea-uncoated lattice sandwich structures were prone to partial core
   collapse, especially around the indenter. The destruction degree reduced
   layer by layer outward to the core. The upper and lower panels showed
   fold-line deformation and a curved deformation mode, respectively. The
   upper panel developed a ``U-shaped{''} deformation mode at an early
   stage, and its core failure range was widely reduced. The lower panel
   was 19.61\%-42.03\% more deformed in the polyurea-coated than in the
   uncoated lattice sandwich structures. The results provide a reference
   for the design of lightweight and efficient energy-absorptive structures
   for ship protection.}},

Title = {{Incidence and risk factors of C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae among
   young women from the Western Cape, South Africa: The EVRI study}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2021}},

Abstract = {{Objective
   Young women in South Africa are highly affected by sexually transmitted
   infections (STI), like C. trachomatis (CT) and N. gonorrhoeae (NG). We
   aimed to estimate the incidence of CT and NG, and its determinants,
   among young women from the Western Cape, South Africa, participating in
   an HPV vaccine trial (the EVRI study).
   Methods
   HIV-negative women aged 16-24 years were enrolled between October 2012
   and July 2013. At enrolment and month 6 participants were screened for
   CT and NG (Anyplex CT/NG real-time detection method). A questionnaire on
   demographic and sexual history characteristics was completed at
   enrolment and month 7. Treatment for CT and/or NG was offered to
   infected participants. Incidence rates (IR) of CT and NG were estimated.
   Determinants of incident CT and NG infections were assessed using
   Poisson regression.
   Results
   365 women were tested for CT and/or NG at least twice. Prevalence of CT
   and NG at baseline was 33.7\% and 10.4\%, respectively. Prevalence of
   co-infection with CT and NG was 7.1\%. During 113.3 person-years (py),
   48 incident CT infections were diagnosed (IR = 42.4 per 100 py, 95\%
   confidence interval (CI) 31.9-56.2). Twenty-nine incident NG were
   diagnosed during 139.3 py (IR = 20.8 per 100 py, 95\%CI 14.5-29.9).
   Prevalent CT infection at baseline was associated with incident CT
   (adjusted incidence rate ratio (aIRR) 5.8, 95\%CI 3.0-11.23. More than
   three lifetime sex partners increased the risk for incident NG (3-4
   partners aIRR = 7.3, 95\%CI 2.1-26.0; >= 5 partners aIRR = 4.3, 95\%CI
   1.1-17.5).
   Conclusions The IR of bacterial STIs among young women in the Western
   Cape is very high. Besides being previously infected and a higher
   lifetime number of sex partners, no other risk factors were found for CT
   and NG, suggesting that the majority of these women were at risk. This
   indicates the need for intensified prevention of STIs as well as
   screening and treatment programs to increase sexual health in this
   region.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the unique deformation characteristics of auxetic materials
   (Poisson's ratio mu< 0), they have better shock resistance and energy
   absorption properties than traditional materials. Inspired by the
   concept of variable crosssection design, a newauxetic re-entrant
   honeycomb structure is designed in this study. The detailed design
   method of re-entrant honeycomb with variable cross-section (VCRH) is
   provided, and five VCRH structures with the same relative density and
   different cross-section change rates are proposed. The in-plane impact
   resistance and energy absorption abilities of VCRH under constant
   velocity are investigated by ABAQUS/EXPLICIT. The results show that the
   introduction of variable cross-section design can effectively improve
   the impact resistance and energy absorption abilities of auxetic
   re-entrant honeycombs. The VCRH structure has better Young's modulus,
   plateau stress, and specific energy absorption (SEA) than traditional
   re-entrant honeycomb (RH). The influence of microstructure parameters
   (such as cross-section change rate alpha) on the dynamic impact
   performance of VCRH is also studied. Results show that, with the
   increase in impact velocity and alpha, the plateau stress and SEA of
   VCRH increase. A positive correlation is also found between the energy
   absorption efficiency, impact load uniformity and a under both medium
   and high impact speeds. These results can provide a reference for
   designing improved auxetic re-entrant honeycomb structures.}},

Title = {{Too many zeros and/or highly skewed? A tutorial on modelling health
   behaviour as count data with Poisson and negative binomial regression}},

Abstract = {{Background: Dependent variables in health psychology are often counts,
   for example, of a behaviour or number of engagements with an
   intervention. These counts can be very strongly skewed, and/or contain
   large numbers of zeros as well as extreme outliers. For example, `How
   many cigarettes do you smoke on an average day?' The modal answer may be
   zero but may range from 0 to 40+. The same can be true for minutes of
   moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. For some people, this may be
   near zero, but take on extreme values for someone training for a
   marathon. Typical analytical strategies for this data involve explicit
   (or implied) transformations (smoker v. non-smoker, log
   transformations). However, these data types are `counts' (i.e.
   non-negative whole numbers) or quasi-counts (time is ratio but discrete
   minutes of activity could be analysed as a count), and can be modelled
   using count distributions - including the Poisson and negative binomial
   distribution (and their zero-inflated and hurdle extensions, which
   alloweven more zeros).
   Methods: In this tutorial paper I demonstrate (in R, Jamovi, and SPSS)
   the easy application of these models to health psychology data, and
   their advantages over alternative ways of analysing this type of data
   using two datasets - one highly dispersed dependent variable (number of
   views on YouTube, and another with a large number of zeros (number of
   days on which symptoms were reported over a month).
   Results: The negative binomial distribution had the best fit for the
   overdispersed number of views on YouTube. Negative binomial, and
   zero-inflated negative binomial were both good fits for the symptom data
   with over-abundant zeros.
   Conclusions: In both cases, count distributions provided not just a
   better fit but would lead to different conclusions compared to the
   poorly fitting traditional regression/linear models.}},

Abstract = {{As 3D printing gets more popular in many industrial areas, 3D printing
   researchers have focused mainly on designing and developing cellular
   structures for material minimization and better mechanical performances.
   In the present paper, twelve samples were fabricated by fused deposition
   modeling in PLA, and corresponding numerical simulations for each sample
   are implemented in Abaqus/Explicit. As the honeycomb structures and the
   re-entrant structures are impressive due to desirable mechanical
   performances and light-weight, much research has been carried out. Some
   researchers attempted to come up with new hybrid structures by combining
   the honeycomb and re-entrant auxetic. In this study, two new hybrid
   structures are developed, studied, and compared with basic structures
   with respect to the mechanical properties both experimentally and
   numerically. According to the experiment and numerical simulation
   results, the newly-designed hybrid structures are of better mechanical
   performances than the basic honeycomb and the re-entrant auxetic
   separately. During the fabrication of the samples, the material of 18 g,
   14 g, 10 g, and 14 g in amount was used for H\_A, H\_B, honeycomb as
   well as re-entrant auxetic, respectively. According to the stress-strain
   curve, the former two show better performance. Therefore, the material
   during 3D printing can be minimized by changing the inner structure of
   the objects being printed. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Metamaterials that exhibit negative Poisson's ratio are termed as
   auxetic materials. The chiral and achiral honeycombs comprising of an
   array of cylinders connected by ligaments are one class of auxetic
   metamaterials. These structures have been investigated for their
   in-plane linear elastic behavior in the past. In this paper, novel
   bilayer tetra periodic structures are proposed by combining chiral
   and/or achiral honeycombs along the out-of-plane direction. Finite
   element (FE) models are developed for estimation of inplane linear
   Elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio. In the first step, the present FE
   model is verified with the help of experimental data for single layer
   tetra-chiral and tetra-achiral structures available in the literature.
   Subsequently, following identical methodology, the linear elastic
   constants of bilayer structures are computed. A comparison of bilayer
   tetra periodic structures with the single-layer tetra chiral/achiral
   metamaterials is presented. Further, a parametric analysis (for varied
   geometries) was performed to find a correlation between the geometry and

Abstract = {{In this study, a series of in-plane hexagonal honeycombs with different

   The crushing strength of honeycomb in terms of Poisson's ratio is
   firstly presented. In the previous research, we have studied the
   compression performance of honeycomb with different negative Poisson's
   ratio. In this study, a comparative study on the local impact resistance
   of different sandwich panels is conducted by considering a spherical
   projectile with low to medium impact speed. Some critical criteria (i.e.
   local indentation profile, global deflection, impact force and energy
   absorption) are adopted to analyze the impact resistance. Finally, an
   influential mechanism of Poisson's ratio on the local impact resistance
   of sandwich panel is studied by considering the variation of core
   strength and post-impact collapse behavior.}},

   Problem Solution for Circle under the Neumann Boundary Condition}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE \& TECHNIQUE}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{168-172}},
Abstract = {{It is known that boundary value problems for the Laplace and Poisson
   equations are equivalent to the problem of the calculus of variations -
   the minimum of an integral for which the given partial differential
   equation is the Euler - Lagrange equation. For example, the problem of
   the minimum of the Dirichlet integral in the unit disc centered at the
   origin on some admissible set of functions for given values of the
   normal derivative on the circle is equivalent to the Neimann boundary
   value problem for the Laplace equation in this domain. An effective
   approximate dilogarithm representation of the solution of the above
   equivalent variational boundary value problem is constructed on the
   basis of the known exact solution of the Neumann Boundary value problem
   for a circle using a special approximate formula for the Dini integral.
   The approximate formula is effective in the sense that it is quite
   simple in numerical implementation, stable, and the error estimation,
   which is uniform over a circle, allows calculations with the given
   accuracy. A special quadrature formula for the Dini integral has a
   remarkable property - its coefficients are non-negative. Quadrature
   formulas with non-negative coefficients occupy a special place in the
   theory of approximate calculations of definite integrals and its
   applications. Naturally, this property becomes even more significant
   when the coefficient are not number, but some functions. The performed
   numerical analysis of the approximate solution confirms its
   effectiveness.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{As one of the most popular 3D printed metamaterials, the auxetic
   structure with its tunable Poisson's ratio has attracted huge amount of
   attention recently. In this study, we designed an auxetic shape-memory
   metamaterial, which showed designable buckling responses by using the
   thermomechanically coupled in-plane instability. The influence of
   viscoelasticity on in-plane moduli and Poisson's ratios of shape-memory
   auxetic metamaterial was experimentally investigated. Based on the
   generalized Maxwell model and finite-element method, the buckling
   behaviors and their main influence factors were studied. The analytical
   results and experimental ones showed a good agreement. Thermomechanical
   properties of the printed metamaterials govern the temperature and
   strain rate-dependent buckling, and a controllable transition from the
   negative to positive Poisson's ratio in the metamaterials can be
   achieved. Based on the shape memory effect, the buckled state and the
   Poisson's ratio of the metamaterials can be tuned by programmed
   thermomechanical processes. This study provides a simple and efficient
   way to generate morphing structures using the designable buckling
   effect.}},

Pages = {{1614-1626}},
Abstract = {{Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has become a well-established
   class of methods for the analysis of non-negative data. In particular, a
   lot of effort has been devoted to probabilistic NMF, namely estimation
   or inference tasks in probabilistic models describing the data, based
   for example on Poisson or exponential likelihoods. When dealing with
   time series data, several works have proposed to model the evolution of
   the activation coefficients as a non-negative Markov chain, most of the
   time in relation with the Gamma distribution, giving rise to so-called
   temporal NMF models. In this paper, we review four Gamma Markov chains
   of the NMF literature, and show that they all share the same drawback:
   the absence of a well-defined stationary distribution. We then introduce
   a fifth process, an overlooked model of the time series literature named
   BGAR(1), which overcomes this limitation. These temporal NMF models are
   then compared in a MAP framework on a prediction task, in the context of
   the Poisson likelihood.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic cellular materials are modern materials which have some unique
   and superior mechanical properties. As a consequence of the structural
   deformation of their internal cellular structure they exhibit a negative
   Poisson's ratio, i.e. they significantly increase in volume if stretched
   and vice versa. The effect of negative Poisson's ratio is use full in
   many applications to enhance certain physical properties such like the
   density, stiffness, fracture toughness, energy absorption and damping.
   These properties can be further tailored by using variable cell geometry
   and density distribution, which can be achieved with functionally graded
   porosity of auxetic materials. This review paper provides the
   state-of-the-art overview of the auxetic materials, their development,
   most common geometries, fabrication methods, mechanical properties,
   applications and further possibilities for their development. (C) 2020

Abstract = {{Slope sliding force can be measured by an anchor cable sensor with the
   negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) property. It is capable of reflecting the
   stability of the slope intuitively. Thus, predicting the variation trend
   of the sliding force is able to achieve early warning for landslide
   disaster, thereby avoiding losses to the lives and property of the
   people. In this paper, due to the uncertain variation of the sliding
   force, a belief rule-based (BRB) sliding force prediction model is
   established to describe the nonlinear and uncertain relationship between
   the history/current sliding force and the future sliding force. In this
   model, the activated belief rules are fused by adopting the evidence
   reasoning (ER) algorithm. And based on the fused results, the sliding
   force at a future time can be predicted accurately. Moreover,
   considering the variation of the sliding force on different slopes or
   different monitoring points in the same slope, a parameter transfer
   strategy of BRB model together with a corresponding online update method
   are proposed to achieve the adaptive design of the BRB prediction model.
   Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed sliding force prediction
   methods has been verified by experiments on the sub-section of the China
   West-East Gas Pipeline Project. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials or structures on the application of a tensile or
   compressive load expand or contract laterally, respectively. Over the
   years, multiple auxetic structures have been proposed. The most studied
   type is the re-entrant honeycomb model. In this work, a novel modified
   re-entrant honeycomb model is proposed to improve the elastic properties
   of the structure by adding additional members to the unit cell.
   Analytical equations for the Poisson's ratio, strain, deflection and
   Young's modulus are derived in two orthogonal directions. The proposed
   model provides significantly higher values of Negative Poisson's Ratio
   (NPR) for the same relative density in loading in one direction at the
   cost of other orthogonal direction when compared to the existing
   re-entrant honeycomb model. The results are evaluated for multiple
   geometric parameters for the calculation of NPR. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Journal = {{EXTREME MECHANICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{42}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Unprecedented sign change of Poisson's ratio not only paves the way for
   diverse applications, but it provides a sense of deep understanding of
   `hidden' mechanics, yet to be discovered. Stochastically distributed
   multi-walled carbon nanotubes in the form of buckypaper can possess
   negative Poisson's ratio, but the underlying design principles are still
   unclear. Herein, we explored analytical approaches, namely, energy
   minimization, structural modeling, and force-balance as a means to
   target negative Poisson's ratio in the buckypaper. Though `zero'
   Poisson's ratio is still achievable, the controlling parameters could
   not be identified. Guided by a `keyed-brick' structure, a simple
   geometrical model is then constructed to account for sliding effects in
   carbon nanotubes for contemporary understanding of auxetic behavior
   (negative Poisson's ratio). The alignment of carbon nanotubes plays a
   prominent role in augmenting the magnitude of negative Poisson's ratio.

Title = {{Design of auxetic plates with only one degree of freedom}},
Journal = {{EXTREME MECHANICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{42}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{A continuum elastic plate has infinite degrees of freedom: according to
   the applied loads, it assumes the shape that the minimization of the
   total energy prescribes, in dependence of the material it is made of.
   The possibility to control the shape of a morphing structure is
   receiving an increasing attention in several fields; in this connection,
   if a classical elastic plate is considered, it is not possible, in
   general, to tune the elastic properties of the material in order to
   select, between the infinite deformation modes the plate may have, the
   one desired. We present a prototypical case that tries to satisfy this
   desideratum, opening the way to the systematic design of
   microstructure's geometries to fully control a system's shape
   independently of the applied loads. A novel yet simple architecture for
   thin plates having only one degree of freedom is proposed. The plate is
   realized as a tessellation composed by rigid equal hexagonal tiles
   hinged to each other along the sides, and it can deform in just one way,
   that is, into a predetermined synclastic surface, whatever loads are
   applied to it. Such tessellated plate also has a remarkable auxetic
   behavior in bending, with the ratio between transverse and longitudinal
   curvatures in uniaxial bending reaching values larger than one. Modeling
   assumptions and analysis results, at both the discrete and the continuum
   level, are verified by tests carried out onto additively manufactured
   bi-material specimens, showing that it is possible to design the
   deformed configuration by controlling the hexagons' geometry. The
   proposed architecture for realizing auxetic plates with only one degree
   of freedom is highly scalable and easily manufacturable, and it can find
   applications for auxetic scaffolds, prosthetic stress shields, energy
   harvesters, and wearable devices. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Metamaterials are the class of man-made cellular structures that are
   intended to improve the energy absorption ability without an expense on
   its weight. The current investigation focuses on modeling and
   compressive simulation of three types of basic metamaterial (i.e
   Diamond, Auxetic and Hexagon) and its hybrids (i.e Auxetic-diamond,
   Auxetic-hexagon and Diamond-hexagon) with Ansys 19 simulation software.
   All the six auxetic metamaterials are simulated by assuming Polylactic
   Acid (PLA) material. At 0.1 MPa the maximum equivalent von-Mises stress
   was evident during the compressive analysis of auxetic-diamond hybrid
   structure. For auxetic-diamond hybrid structure higher energy absorption
   of 40 mJ was noted. It was observed to decrease by 67, 62, 75, 25 and
   40\% for auxetic, diamond, hexagon, auxetic-hexagon and diamond-hexagon
   respectively. The higher value of equivalent von-Mises stress and higher
   energy absorption is a manifestation of stiffest structure. The
   deformation results during simulation test confirmed that the basic
   auxetic structure and its hybrid absorb more energy. The hybrid auxetic
   metamaterials are the new class structural elements that exhibited
   extraordinary energy absorption ability. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Graphene aerogel (GA) is a promising candidate for energy absorption
   purposes because of its very low density, high specific surface area and
   porous structure. GA samples, prepared by the Sol-Gel method, were
   tested under quasi-static compression, and characterized via surface
   area analyzer, as well as scanning electron microscopy and transmission
   electron microscopy. The results show that 98\% (and above) porous GA
   samples, whose elastic modulus is 2.9 MPa, can support at least 35,000
   times its weight. Scaling analysis shows that the mechanical properties
   of GA are superior to those of conventional polymeric open-cell foams.
   The GA samples exhibit a negative structural Poisson's ratio under the
   uniaxial compression test, which is most likely due to the bread-like
   microstructural evolution. Due to the mesopores of the GA sample as well
   as the negative structural Poisson's ratio, the GA has considerable
   toughness.}},

Abstract = {{As we all know, compression in one direction will cause expansion in the
   orthogonal direction for conventional materials. Similarly, stretching
   in one direction will give rise to contraction in the vertical
   direction. It is hence possible to combine these two properties to
   obtain a novel mechanism to create 3D structures with negative Poisson's
   ratio (PR) in some directions and positive PR in other ones (partial
   auxetics). The latitude-and-longitude-inspired double-elliptic-ring
   structures (DERs) with tunable Poisson's ratio and Young's modulus are
   designed and studied in this work, which offers an effective way for
   achieving this mechanism. A 3D structure with negative Poisson's ratio
   in three directions is also obtained via arranging the DERs alternately.
   Meanwhile, theoretical results show that the magnitude of Poisson's
   ratio of DERs can reach -18.3. Experimental and simulation consequences
   indicate that the DERs can effectively reduce stress concentration and
   fracture possibility due to its smooth geometry. Another advantage of
   DERs is that it still has negative Poisson's ratio effect under large
   levels of compression. This work can provide a useful reference for the
   design of 3D auxetic metamaterials with excellent properties, which is
   promising in some structural and functional applications. (C) 2020

Abstract = {{The human being has always been looking for optimal use of his
   surrounding materials and over the years, has managed to invent various
   structures with special properties. Lattice structures are widely used
   in various applications due to their lower weight and desirable
   compressive strength. An example of these structures is the honeycomb
   that is very popular and many studies have been done about it. A new
   type of lattice structures is auxetic structure that has negative
   Poisson's ratio due to its geometry. This characteristic has caused
   auxetic structures to have unique properties such as high shear
   strength, indentation resistance and energy absorption. Investigation of
   energy absorption of auxetic structures is a subject that has not been
   studied in researches. In this study, the ability of some auxetic
   structure for absorbing energy is investigated at quasi-static and low
   velocity impact transverse loading. Specimens with three types of
   geometries (re-entrant, arrowhead and anti-tetra chiral) are fabricated
   using additive manufacturing method (3D printing). Discussion about
   energy absorption and failure mechanisms of all three structures were
   carried out and compared in both types of loading. (C) 2019 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Kirigami and auxetic topologies are combined to design an innovative
   metamaterial-based substrate (MetaSub) for piezoelectric energy
   harvesters. The proposed MetaSub piezoelectric energy harvester (MPEH)
   contains both advantageous metamaterial properties of negative Poisson's
   ratio capability and enhanced planar stretchability. A computational
   parametric analysis is conducted to develop the optimum design for the
   MPEH to trap the maximum elastic energy. A finite element analysis (FEA)
   is employed to analytically and numerically validate the simulation
   model of the MPEH. Accordingly, two experimental results of conventional
   and auxetic strain energy harvesters are used to evaluate the power
   enhancement of the MPEH. The FEA results demonstrate the average power
   gained by the MPEH at a low level of frequency and strain excitation (10
   Hz and 150 mu epsilon) is 165 mu W which easily satisfies the minimum
   electric power amount required as a sensor node for self-powered
   wireless sensor networks. The harvested power output of the MPEH is 19.2
   times more than power output produced by an equivalent conventional
   harvester with a plain substrate (8.6 mu W). The performance of the MPEH
   is investigated at different combinations of both low and high
   excitation frequencies. The creative design of the MetaSub can
   significantly improve the productivity of strain-induced devices whose
   efficiency is dependent on their deformation performance such as
   vibration energy harvesters, wearable sensors, flexible actuators, and
   micro electromechanical applications.}},

Title = {{Adequacy of Improved Sources of Drinking Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene
   Practice for the Reduction of Diarrheal Disease Among People Living with
   HIV/AIDS, Harar Region, Ethiopia}},
Journal = {{HIV AIDS-RESEARCH AND PALLIATIVE CARE}},
Year = {{2021}},

Pages = {{1-11}},
Abstract = {{Background: Home-based care services like improved water supply,
   sanitation, and hygiene (WaSH) practice are vital for people living with
   HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) to improve their quality of life. The negative impact
   of inadequate WaSH services is more pronounced among HIV-infected
   individuals leading them to low economic productivity, poor-nourished,
   immuno-compromised, and death. The aim of this study was to investigate
   the adequacy of improved sources of drinking water, sanitation, and
   hygiene practice for the reduction of diarrheal disease among people
   living with HIV/AIDS, Harar region, Ethiopia.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 422 PLWHA in the Harar
   region related to WaSH as home-based care services and the prevalence of
   diarrheal disease using a standardized survey questionnaire. Descriptive
   statistics and multivariate Poisson regressions models were performed by
   SPSS Version 25. Using generalized linear models, adjusted prevalence
   ratio (APR) with 95\%Cl and p-value were computed to assess the strength
   of association between the outcome and explanatory variables. A
   significant association was assured when the p-value is less than 0.05.
   Results: In the present study, the two-week prevalence of diarrheal
   disease was 25\%, of which 16\% experienced two or more diarrheal
   episodes. Moreover, 87\% of PLWHA used an improved source of drinking
   water, 66\% used improved sanitation facilities, and 68\% have good
   hygiene practices. Only 37\% of the respondents acquired a basic water
   service level (>= 20lcd) and 58\% of PLWHA acquired the recommended
   quantity of safe water for drinking (>= 1.5lcd). In multivariate
   analysis, the adjusted prevalence ratio of the 2-week prevalence of
   diarrhea was lower by 8\% (APR =1.08; 95\%Cl: 1.02, 1.14), 7\% (APR
   =1.07; 95\%Cl: 1.01, 1.14), and 5\% (APR =1.05; 95\%Cl: 1.00, 1.11)
   among PLWHA who have good hygiene practice, wash their hand with soap 24
   hours before the survey, and used sanitation facility consistently,
   respectively.
   Conclusion: The current study results showed that PLWHA has inadequate
   access to improved drinking water sources, improved sanitation
   facilities, and hygienic practice; these triggers stakeholders for
   proper interventions, effective integration of adequate WaSH services to
   the HIV/AIDS program to enhance the quality of life of PLWHA.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanical behaviour of three different auxetic cellular structures,
   hexa-chiral 2D, tetra-chiral 2D and tetra-chiral 3D, was experimentally
   investigated in this study. The structures were produced with the powder
   bed fusion method (PBF) from an austenitic stainless steel alloy. The
   fundamental material mechanical properties of the sample structures were
   determined with classic quasi-static compressive tests, where the
   deformation process was captured by a high-resolution digital camera.
   The Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar (SHPB) apparatus was used for dynamic
   impact testing at two impact velocities to study the strain-rate
   dependency of the structures. Two synchronised high-speed cameras were
   used to observe the impact tests. The captured images from both
   quasi-static and dynamic experiments were processed using a custom
   digital image correlation (DIC) algorithm to evaluate the
   displacement/strain fields and the Poisson's ratio. Predominant auxetic
   behaviour was observed in all three structures throughout most of the
   deformation process both under quasi-static and impact loading regimes.
   The tetra-chiral 2D structure showed the most significant auxetic
   behaviour. Significant stress enhancement in all tested structures was
   observed in dynamic testing. The Poisson's ratio strain-rate dependency
   was confirmed for all three auxetic structures.}},

Abstract = {{Meta-sandwich composites with three-dimensional (3D) printed
   architecture structure are characterized by their high ability to absorb
   energy. In this paper, static and fatigue 3-point bending tests are
   implemented on a 3D printed sandwich composites with a re-entrant
   honeycomb core. The skins, core and whole sandwich are manufactured
   using the same bio-based material which is polylactic acid with flax
   fiber reinforcement. Experimental tests are performed in order to
   evaluate the durability and the ability of this material to dissipate
   energy. First, static tests are conducted to study the bending behaviour
   of the sandwich beams, as well as to determine the failure parameters
   and the characteristic used in fatigue tests. Then, fatigue analyses
   were carried out to determine the fatigue resistance of these
   structures. The effects of the core density on the stiffness, hysteresis
   loop, energy absorption and loss factor, for two loading level, are
   determined. Moreover, the behaviour of this sandwich composite with
   re-entrant honeycomb core is compared with that of sandwiches with
   different core topologies. The results show that sandwich with high core
   density dissipate more energy, which results higher loss factors. The
   determined properties offer the most sensitive indicators of sandwich
   composite damage during its lifetime. This work aims to determine the
   static and fatigue properties of this material, thus, study its

Abstract = {{In this research, the various physical properties of Nb-doped SrFeO3
   were investigated using the density functional theory (DFT), which was
   not experimentally investigated and reported in the previous literature.
   This is the first detailed theoretical study about these properties of
   this doped system. The calculated lattice parameters exhibited excellent
   conformity with the experimental data. In addition, the structural and
   mechanical stability of the studied compound was confirmed by the
   negative value of formation enthalpy and elastic constants (fulfilled
   the Born stability criteria), respectively. The metallic nature of
   SrFe0.5Nb0.5O3 was revealed by their band structure and the density of
   states. A strong hybridization was observed among Fe-3d, Nb-4p, and O-2p
   states at the Fermi level, reflecting the covalent bonding of Fe/Nb-O.
   Furthermore, the mechanical properties including the elastic moduli,
   Poisson ratio, Pugh's ratio, hardness, and machinability index of
   SrFe1-xNbxO3 (x=0.4, 0.5, and 0.6), were also studied in depth, and
   showed considerable effects of doping. Finally, a high level of
   anisotropy was noticed for SrFe0.5Nb0.5O3. Therefore, our simulation
   output clearly illustrated the influence of Nb doping in the theoretical
   results of the physical properties of the presently studied strontium
   ferrite.}},

Title = {{Voltage-dependent modulation of elastic moduli in lattice metamaterials:
   Emergence of a programmable state-transition capability}},

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional lattices are ideal candidate for developing artificially
   engineered materials and structures across different length-scales,
   leading to unprecedented multi-functional mechanical properties which
   can not be achieved in naturally occurring materials and systems.
   Characterization of effective elastic properties of these lattices is
   essential for their adoption as structural elements of various devices
   and systems. An enormous amount of research has been conducted on
   different geometry of lattices to identify and characterize various
   parameters which affect the elastic properties. However, till date we
   can not control the elastic properties actively for a lattice
   microstructure, meaning that the elastic properties of such lattices are
   not truly programmable. All the parameters that control the effective
   elastic properties are passive in nature. After manufacturing the
   lattice structure with a certain set of geometric or material-based
   parameters, there is no room to modulate the properties further. In this
   article, we propose a hybrid lattice micro-structure by integrating
   piezo-electric materials with the members of the lattice for active
   voltage-dependent modulation of elastic properties. A bottom-up
   multi-physics based analytical framework leading to closed-form formulae
   is derived for hexagonal lattices to demonstrate the concept of active
   lattices. It is noticed that the Young's moduli are voltage-dependent,
   while the shear modulus and the Poisson's ratios are not functions of
   the applied voltage. Thus, the compound mechanics of deformation induced
   by external mechanical stresses and electric field lead to an active
   control over the Young's moduli as a function of voltage. Interestingly,
   it turns out that a programmable state-transition of the Young's moduli
   from positive to negative values with a wide range can be achieved in
   such hybrid lattices. The physics-based analytical framework for active
   modulation of voltage-dependent elastic properties on the basis of
   operational demands provide the necessary physical insights and
   confidence for potential practical exploitation of the proposed concept
   in various futuristic multifunctional structural systems and devices
   across different length-scales. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Femur Auxetic Meta-Implants with Tuned Micromotion Distribution}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{14}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Stress shielding and micromotions are the most significant problems
   occurring at the bone-implants interface due to a mismatch of their
   mechanical properties. Mechanical 3D metamaterials, with their
   exceptional behaviour and characteristics, can provide an opportunity to
   solve the mismatch of mechanical properties between the bone and
   implant. In this study, a new porous femoral hip meta-implant with
   graded Poisson's ratio distribution was introduced and its results were
   compared to three other femoral hip implants (one solid implant, and two
   porous meta-implants, one with positive and the other with a negative
   distribution of Poisson's ratio) in terms of stress and micromotion
   distributions. For this aim, first, a well-known auxetic 3D re-entrant
   structure was studied analytically, and precise closed-form analytical
   relationships for its elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio were derived.
   The results of the analytical solution for mechanical properties of the
   3D re-entrant structure presented great improvements in comparison to
   previous analytical studies on the structure. Moreover, the
   implementation of the re-entrant structure in the hip implant provided
   very smooth results for stress and strain distributions in the lattice
   meta-implants and could solve the stress shielding problem which
   occurred in the solid implant. The lattice meta-implant based on the
   graded unit cell distribution presented smoother stress-strain
   distribution in comparison with the other lattice meta-implants.
   Moreover, the graded lattice meta-implant gave minimum areas of local
   stress and local strain concentration at the contact region of the
   implants with the internal bone surfaces. Among all the cases, the
   graded meta-implant also gave micromotion levels which are the closest
   to values reported to be desirable for bone growth (40 mu m).}},

   ions towards the front side. At the backside of the sample, in contact
   with a copper electrode, the electric field increases as a result of the
   alkali ion transport. Under these conditions, Cu+ ions become ejected
   from the electrode and enter into the glass. The concentration depth
   profiles of all mobile species in the glass have been quantitatively
   analyzed by means of the Nernst-Planck-Poisson theory. As the result of

Volume = {{19}},

Abstract = {{The ridge estimator has been consistently demonstrated to be an
   attractive shrinkage method to reduce the effects of multicollinearity.
   The negative binomial regression model is a well-known model in
   application when the response variable is count data. However, it is
   known that multicollinearity negatively affects the variance of maximum
   likelihood estimator of the negative binomial regression coefficients.
   To address this problem, a negative binomial ridge estimator has been
   proposed by numerous researchers. In this paper, a new negative binomial
   ridge estimator (NNBRE) is proposed and derived. The idea behind the
   NNBRE is to get diagonal matrix with small values of diagonal elements
   that leading to decrease the shrinkage parameter and, therefore, the
   resultant estimator can be better with small amount of bias. Our Monte
   Carlo simulation results suggest that the NNBRE estimator can bring
   significant improvement relative to other existing estimators. In
   addition, the real application results demonstrate that the NNBRE
   estimator outperforms both negative binomial ridge regression and
   maximum likelihood estimators in terms of predictive performance.}},

Abstract = {{Background Deaths by suicide can increase during infectious disease
   outbreaks. This study analysed suspected suicide rates in 2020 relative
   to 2015-19 to assess any early effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in
   Queensland, Australia.
   Methods We analysed data from the interim Queensland Suicide Register
   (iQSR), a state-wide real-time suicide surveillance system, using an
   interrupted time-series design. The data source for the iQSR is the Form
   1 police report of a death to a coroner. Two QSR staff independently
   classed the probability of a death by suicide as possible, probable, or
   beyond reasonable doubt. The analysis included the probable or beyond
   reasonable doubt categories as suspected suicides. The primary outcome
   was the monthly suspected suicide rate. We applied Poisson and negative
   binomial regressions to assess whether Queensland's Public Health
   Emergency Declaration on Jan 29, 2020, affected suspected suicides from
   Feb 1 to Aug 31, 2020. Secondary outcomes included absolute or relative
   changes in police-reported motives of recent unemployment, financial
   problems, domestic violence, and relationship breakdown.
   Findings 3793 suspected suicides were recorded with an unadjusted
   monthly rate of 14.85 deaths per 100 000 people (from Jan 1, 2015, to
   Jan 31, 2020) before the declaration, and 443 suspected suicides were
   recorded with an unadjusted monthly rate of 14.07 deaths per 100 000
   people (Feb 1, 2020, onwards) after the declaration. An interrupted
   timeseries Poisson regression model unadjusted (rate ratio {[}RR] 0.94,
   95\% CI 0.82-1.06) and adjusted for overdispersion, seasonality, and
   pre-exposure trends (RR 1.02, 95\% CI 0.83-1.25) indicated no evidence
   of a change in suspected suicide rates. We found no absolute or relative
   increases in the motives for suspected suicides, including recent
   unemployment, financial problems, relationship breakdown, or domestic
   violence from February to August, 2020, compared with the pre-exposure
   period.
   Interpretation There does not yet appear to be an overall change in the
   suspected suicide rate in the 7 months since Queensland declared a
   public health emergency. Despite this, COVID-19 has contributed to some
   suspected suicides in Queensland. Ongoing community spread and
   increasing death rates of COVID-19, and its impact on national economies
   and mental health, reinforces the need for governments to maintain the
   monitoring and reporting of suicide mortality in real time.}},

Title = {{Mechanics of unusual soft network materials with rotatable structural
   nodes}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICS AND PHYSICS OF SOLIDS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{146}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Soft network materials consisting of filamentary horseshoe
   microstructures represent a class of architected materials of practical
   interest in flexible, bio-integrated electronics, because they can be
   tailored to reproduce accurately nonlinear stress-strain responses of
   biological tissues. The previous studies of these bio-inspired soft
   network materials focused mostly on the intriguing mechanical responses
   (e.g., J-shaped stress-strain curves and negative Poisson's ratios)
   before their fracture, and paid little attention on their utmost
   strength and stretchability. The development of soft network materials
   that can offer both a high stretchability (e.g., > 100\%) and a
   relatively high strength (e.g., > 50 MPa) remains challenging. This
   paper presents the design, mechanics modeling and experimental
   measurement of a novel type of soft network materials that introduce
   rotatable structural lattice nodes (either with ring or disk shapes) to
   offer an enhanced deformability. Based on the analyses of the periodic
   building-block structure, we develop a nonlinear mechanics model of
   unusual soft network materials made of elastic constituent materials.
   Validated by finite element analyses (FEA) and experiments, this
   theoretical model can well predict the J-shaped stress-strain curves and
   deformed configurations of unusual soft network materials with a variety
   of geometric parameters. The results based on the developed model
   provide insights into the underlying relationship between nonlinear
   mechanical properties and key geometric parameters. For unusual soft
   network materials made of metals, an Ashby plot in terms of the strength
   and the stretchability is presented, highlighting the advantages of
   developed network materials over the existing network materials and
   typical soft materials. Moreover, computational models based on
   representative unit cells with periodic boundary conditions allow
   precise predictions of the utmost strength and stretchability, which can
   thereby serve as a reliable design tool. Due to the combined mechanical
   attributes of high stretchability, relatively high strength, and
   negative Poisson's ratio, the proposed unusual soft network materials
   can be used in various device systems of bio-integrated electronics.}},

Title = {{Simulation of main chain liquid crystalline polymers using a
   Gay-Berne/Lennard-Jones hybrid model}},
Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{186}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Main chain liquid crystalline polymers (MCLCP) offer strong potential to
   exhibit auxetic properties. However, the first synthesized molecules did
   not show the expected results. To address this issue, simulation
   provides an interesting advantage as it can grasp the molecular reasons
   why the auxetism is not reached, and thus it can guide the synthesis of
   successful candidates. However, the crucial step of validation is
   mandatory. In this study, we report the simulation of MCLCP at the
   coarse-grained level. Interactions are represented by an hybrid
   GayBerne/Lennard Jones (GB/LJ) potential which is particulary adapted in
   the simulation of anisotropic systems. Energies stemming from different
   configurations of pairs of ellipsoids are computed at the MP2 level, and
   are fitted using the GB potential. The methylene groups are represented
   by spheres whose interactions are depicted by the LJ potential.
   Molecular dynamics in the NPT ensemble (number of particles, pressure
   and temperature are kept constant) are thus carried out beginning at 800
   K to 375 K, by cooling the system by 25 K steps. It is shown that the
   smectic A phase emerges at about 500 K, and the smectic B phase at about
   425 K. Such mesophases occur without the use of any external stimulus.
   These findings pave the way to simulate LCP which have been specifically
   designed to potentially exhibit auxetic properties.}},

Title = {{Experimental and numerical analysis of mounting force of auxetic dowels
   for furniture joints}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{226}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{Limited number of papers describe the practical use of auxetics in the
   wood and furniture sector. Only one paper describes the auxetic nails.
   None of them analyzed the impact of using auxetics on the strength of
   furniture joints. The aim of this investigation was to design and
   manufacture different kinds of auxetic dowels with corresponding muffs
   and experimentally, theoretically, and numerically analyze the minimum
   mounting forces, contact pressures, and friction coefficients of these
   dowels in particleboard. Firstly, auxetic properties of the dowels were
   numerically determined, and then obtained values were confirmed by real
   compression tests in order to be sure that the dowels had negative
   Poisson's ratios. All dowels were manufactured from polyamide (PA12)
   with 3D printing Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) technology. Static
   compression tests were carried out for obtaining the minimum mounting
   force needed to insert the dowel into the muff. Numerical analyses were
   performed by means of Abaqus/Explicit v6.14-2 software. Contact
   pressures and friction coefficients were also theoretically calculated
   and compared to the results of numerical analyses and real tests. At the
   end of the tests, the auxetic dowels gave lower mounting force values
   than the non-auxetic dowels. Mounting force values of dowels decreased
   as the dowel hole diameter and size of inclusions are increased.
   Furthermore, the contact pressures on the surface of the auxetic dowels
   were considerably lower than in the non-auxetic dowels. In conclusion,
   it could be said that the auxetic dowels could be utilized as an
   alternative fastener for the traditional furniture dowels. Therefore,
   withdrawal strength and corner joint tests of the auxetic dowels should
   be investigated in future studies.}},

Title = {{Fabrication of multi-scale and tunable auxetic scaffolds for tissue
   engineering}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{197}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{Melt electro writing (MEW) provides three-dimensional (3D) printing
   porous scaffolds with well-defined geometrical features of ultrafine
   fibers in the tissue engineering. Scaffolds with adjustable Poisson's
   ratio are more suitable in certain biological applications for mimicking
   the behavior of native tissue mechanics. However, it is still a
   challenging issue to tune the Poisson's ratio. In order to resolve this
   problem, a new method is proposed in the present study to design and
   fabricate tunable auxetic scaffolds through altering the printing
   configurations in the MEW. Patterns with thick fibers are designed using
   specific geometries and then these patterns are utilized to tune the
   Poisson's ratio based on the intended deformation mechanism. Moreover,
   the electrospun thin fibers are used to fill the unit cell of auxetic
   lattice structures for promoting the cell growth. Investigating the
   mechanical characteristics of the fabricated scaffolds demonstrates that
   the Poisson's ratio of the scaffold can be effectively tuned.
   Furthermore, cell sense and response to the fabricated scaffolds are
   studied. Obtained results indicate that the proposed approach can
   potentially be applied in a wide variety of biomedical applications. (c)

   structures based on stretching-dominated cells}},
Journal = {{MECHANICS OF MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{152}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{A new concept of 3D auxetic lattice structures with high stiffness is
   proposed in this paper. Correspondingly, a feasible method for rapidly
   fabricating the proposed structures with high-performance continuous
   carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composite is exploited.
   Theoretical models for predicting the homogenized elastic properties of
   the representative structure along all principal axes, including the
   Young's moduli, Poisson's ratios and shear moduli, are developed. Based
   on the models, directional dependence of structural homogenized elastic
   properties is investigated in detail. The compressive elastic behaviors
   of the 3D auxetic lattice structures fabricated with high-performance
   continuous carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composite are further
   investigated in a combination of numerical analysis and experiments. Our
   results suggest that the new concept of 3D auxetic lattice structures
   are very suitable for uniaxial loading and can be great candidates where
   excellent load bearing capacity and obvious negative Poisson's ratio
   effects are simultaneously desired. Coupled with the proposed efficient
   fabrication process, our efforts may help to promote the 3D auxetic
   lattice structures to be widely used in a variety of applications.}},

Title = {{A biomechanical study of clamping technique on patellar tendon surface
   strain and material properties using digital image correlation}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICAL BEHAVIOR OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{113}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Several clamping techniques exist for ex vivo mechanical testing of
   tendon. For the patellar tendon, one can choose to clamp directly to the
   bony attachment sites, the tendon itself, or a combination of the two;
   however, the influence of these techniques on localized strains and
   gross material properties is unknown. To this end, uniaxial tensile
   tests were performed on eleven porcine patellar tendons in three
   clamping setups while digital image correlation was used to measure
   axial and transverse strains, Young's modulus, and Poisson's ratio. The
   setups involved clamping to: 1) the patella and tibia, 2) the patella
   and the dissected distal tendon, and 3) the dissected proximal and
   distal tendon. Axial strains in the tendon-tendon clamping setup were
   181\% higher than patella-tibia clamping (p = 0.002) and 131\% higher
   than patella-tendon clamping (p = 0.006). Transverse strains were not
   significantly different between clamping conditions (p >= 0.118).
   Young's modulus was 50\% (p < 0.001) greater for patella-tibia clamping
   and 42\% (p < 0.001) greater for patella-tendon clamping when compared
   to tendon-tendon clamping. For all clamping setups, the tendon
   illustrated auxetic behaviour (i.e., negative Poisson's ratio); however,
   the Poisson's ratios were 80\% smaller in the patella-tibia setup (p =
   0.006) and 71\% smaller patella-tendon setup (p = 0.007) compared to the
   tendon-tendon setup. These results illustrate that discretion should be
   utilized when reporting material properties derived from mechanical
   tests involving direct clamping to the dissected patellar tendon at both
   ends, as this clamping technique significantly increases axial strains,
   reduces Young's modulus, and alters the tendon's natural auxetic
   behaviour.}},

Title = {{Impact response of metallic stacked origami cellular materials}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMPACT ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{147}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Cellular materials are attractive for applications in structural
   protection and impact energy absorption. Progressive buckling of cell
   walls during compression delivers good specific strength and energy
   absorption. In a cellular solid, the arrangement of the cell wall
   material with respect to the direction of loading has a key influence on
   its mechanical response. This is especially true for cellular materials
   loaded in dynamic compres-sion, where dynamic buckling and inertial
   stabilisation effects can also be sensitive to the alignment of cell
   walls with the loading direction. Origami-based geometries provide one
   route to designing cellular materials to achieve controllable collapse
   modes and, in some cases, auxeticity. The stacked Miura-ori geometry has
   been proposed recently as a strategy for constructing a volume of
   periodic cellular solid from an origami-inspired unit cell. However,
   these have been previously difficult to manufacture. Using selective
   laser melting, an additive manufacturing process, stainless steel
   stacked origami materials were produced in a periodic cellular
   arrangement for the first impact tests on such a cellular material. The
   origami specimens were tested with a gas gun and direct impact Hopkinson
   bar apparatus, at impact speeds of 50 m/s and 100 m/s. The auxetic
   behaviour of the origami fold was observed to diminish at the higher
   impact speeds, due to the localisation of deformation to individual fold
   layers. Different fold configurations were studied through simulations,
   with clear trends observed between fold angle and specific energy
   absorption and strength. Lastly, the influence of material strain rate
   sensitivity was investigated numerically.}},

Abstract = {{Open-cell auxetic foams have shown potential for use in sporting and
   other protective equipment. Previous conversion methods for auxetic
   closed-cell foam used a bespoke pressure vessel. This work expands upon
   a recent method, using steam absorption followed by cooling and
   condensation, to change the cell shape of closed-cell foam to impart a
   negative Poisson's ratio. Aiming to present a simple, repeatable
   conversion method, foam samples (20 x 10 x 100 mm) floating in
   water-filled (similar to 20 degrees C), covered ceramic containers (300
   x 200 x 100 mm) were heated in an oven at 105 degrees C for between 1
   and 6.5 hrs. Based on the results for these smaller samples, a larger
   sample of foam (30 x 100 x 100 mm) was also converted, with a steaming
   time of 8 hrs. The final volume ratio (original/final volume) increased
   with heating time, up to a maximum of 4.6. The amount and angle of
   re-entrant (inward-folding) cell walls increased with the final volume
   ratio as cells contracted further, as evidenced by micro-computed
   tomography. Poisson's ratios, measured using digital image correlation,
   were as low as -0.3 in tension and -1.1 in compression. The tensile
   Young's modulus increased from similar to 2 up to similar to 6 MPa with
   the final volume ratio and the compressive Young's modulus reduced from
   similar to 1.5 MPa for low values of the final volume ratio between one
   and three and then remained close to 1.5 MPa.}},

Title = {{Thermoelastic and vibration response analysis of shape memory alloy
   reinforced active bimorph composites}},
Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, thermoelastic and free vibration responses of hybrid
   Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) and E-glass fiber-reinforced composites are
   investigated using finite element analysis. We consider four composites
   for analysis and comparison of performances, (1) single layer SMA
   fiber-reinforced hybrid composite (unimorph SMAHC), (2) a two-layer
   (cross-ply) SMA fiber-reinforced hybrid composite (bimorph SMAHC), (3)
   single layer SMA fiber-reinforced with a honeycomb core, and (4) single
   layer SMA fiber-reinforced with reentrant-honeycomb or auxetic core. We
   analyze the bending response of all the aforementioned composite
   structures, focusing on the bimorph anticlastic and synclastic bending
   with negative and positive Gaussian curvatures, respectively. The
   uniqueness of this work is utilizing the shape memory effect of the SMA
   fibers to achieve active shape control of low-stiffness and lightweight
   auxetic composite structures. We investigated the free vibration
   response and analyzed the effect of the fiber volume fraction and the
   fiber orientation angle on the natural frequency of the system. Further,
   the role of the reentrant angle and stiffness of honeycomb struts on the
   overall effective mechanical properties of the ply is also studied.
   Results confirm the non-linearity of the parametric combination and the
   importance of optimization of these parameters for improved Gaussian
   curvature. The findings are envisaged to be useful for the design of
   lightweight rigidizable space structures and tensairity structures.}},

Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2021}},

Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{Cellular solids, as a class of materials, are known for a high strength
   to weight ratio. Their design into non-stochastic configurations is
   known to be beneficial for the tailor and control of their mechanical
   properties. The current developments on additive manufacturing allow a
   successful route to manufacture these scaffolds and gives a novel
   freedom in their design process. This study explores the deformation
   behavior of axisymmetric non-stochastic cellular solids, allowing the
   understanding of the mechanisms that enhance their mechanical properties
   relatively to regular extruded lattices. It is shown that axisymmetric
   samples display a circumferential deformation effect that distributed
   loads along the volume of the material. This effect, however, is more
   prominent in axisymmetric samples with auxetic behavior. The coupling of
   circumferential deformation and the dynamic density changes in auxetic
   samples generate an overall increase in modulus, collapse stress and
   energy absorption.}},

   piezocomposites: Improved performance via controlling auxeticity and
   anisotropy}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{255}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{Multiscale material design has made it possible to control the
   properties of a material through introducing structures at multiple
   length scales. This structuring brings about unusual material behaviour
   that is not seen in a continuum material. Here we introduce a multiscale
   design for the matrix components of a lead-free piezocomposite. This
   combines a microscale stiff polymeric structure embedded within a softer
   matrix to form a composite matrix. By controlling the microscale
   features of the embedded structure, we tune the mechanical behaviour of
   the matrix by rendering it either nonauxetic (hexagonal structure) or
   auxetic (inverted hexagonal structure). Further, the mechanical and
   electrical properties of the matrix are controlled at the nanoscale by
   addition of carbon nanotubes within the embedded polymeric structure. By
   engineering the matrix at the nano and the microscale, we firstly
   demonstrate that the auxetic matrix can result in three orders of
   magnitude higher piezoelectric response by amplifying the strains within
   the piezoelectric inclusions. We further demonstrate that by using the
   matrix with the nonauxetic embedded structure, it is possible to design
   piezoelectric composites with pronounced anisotropy in their
   longitudinal and transverse responses. This is an important requirement
   for designing materials with directional sensing ability. Our findings
   show that the multiscale material design proposed here has important
   implications for both energy harvesting and directional sensing.
   Further, the approach taken here yields considerable performance
   improvements while using limited quantities of nanomaterial. The
   multiscale matrix design is scalable and amenable to fabrication through
   emerging methods such as additive manufacturing.}},

Abstract = {{Inspired by low transverse and high vertical stiffness characteristics
   of leaf epidermis cell walls, a biomimetic Isosceles Trapezoid
   Corrugated Lattice Cellular (bio-ITCLC) core is designed and fabricated.
   The constitutive model of the bio-ITCLC sandwich panel under

   bio-ITCLC core for decoupling the mutual restriction of small tangential
   and large normal stiffness of a flexible skin. After that, the variable
   stiffness, equating to the continually changing stiffness characteristic
   of epidermis cell walls, is introduced in the above constitutive model
   to capture the growth behavior of a leaf shape via epidermis cell
   divisions to study morphing mechanisms of a flexible skin. On this
   basis, by the supporting effect of self-adaption units in the bio-ITCLC
   core, with new circumstances, is proposed to be one promising approach

Title = {{Mechanical metamaterials with programmable compression-twist coupling}},
Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The rational design of mechanical metamaterials has the potential to
   grant them with properties unattainable by bulk materials. This paper
   describes twisting mechanical metamaterials (TMMs), a new class of
   programmable matter whose rationally designed architecture endows them
   with compression-twist coupling, a property absent in conventional
   materials. Upon compression, the cellular architecture of TMMs
   efficiently transforms longitudinal strain into unidirectional or
   bidirectional twisting-free from mechanical frustrations and independent
   of the flexible material chosen to fabricate the TMM. TMMs can be
   rapidly designed using an automated generative algorithm, which enables
   the tailoring of their twisting properties (up to 3.24 degrees twist per
   \% strain) and Poisson's ratio (-0.6 to +1.22) using only two design
   parameters. The scalable architecture of TMMs does not suffer from size
   effects which impair their twist per unit strain. Bidirectional TMMs
   autonomously switch their direction of rotation during uniform
   displacement-controlled compressive loading, conferring them with
   non-interchangeable compression-twist coupling. The capability of TMMs
   to controllably convert translation to rotation blurs the boundary
   between materials and machines, expanding the range of mechanical
   properties currently accessible to 3D printed materials and paving the
   way toward the creation of future programmable matter.}},

Title = {{Investigation of the auxetic oval structure for energy absorption
   through quasi-static and dynamic experiments}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMPACT ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{147}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Auxetics are structures and materials with a negative Poisson's ratio,
   meaning they contract in the direction perpendicular to the applied
   force under a compressive load. This phenomenon can lead to increased
   energy absorption, among other favourable parameters to protect against
   impulsive loadings. In this research, a structure with alternating oval
   perforations was investigated which gives rise to an auxetic geometry,
   referred to as an `auxetic oval' design within this paper. Quasi-static
   (strain rate = 0.001/s) and dynamic (strain rate = 100/s) experiments
   have been conducted on small-scale specimens, manufactured using
   subtractive fabrication (laser cutting). Different design criteria were
   examined to understand the mechanisms behind the energy absorption of
   the auxetic structures. A modified version of the energy efficiency
   method was developed to determine the densification strain of the
   auxetics. A shift from strain-softening to strain-hardening behaviour is
   seen as the number of cell layers increases, with the perfectly-plastic
   response ideal for energy absorbing structures. Inertia effects are
   present in the dynamic tests, showing an increase in plateau stress for
   several of the designs. The quasi-static and dynamic responses are
   fundamentally identical, meaning that the performance of the auxetics do
   not change under the range of strain rates examined.
   Digital image correlation has been successfully utilised in the analysis
   process. This includes confirmation of the mechanism giving rise to the
   auxetic behaviour (rigid rotating squares) and the calculation of the
   negative Poisson's ratio. Strain fields have been examined showing the
   regions of energy dissipation. Based on these results the auxetic oval
   design experiences bending dominated behaviour. Finally, a unique design
   has been developed, dubbed the `Hybrid Auxetic Oval', which shows
   favourable behaviour compared to the equivalent base auxetic oval design
   by mitigating the effects of fracture.}},

   Negative Poisson's Ratio}},
Journal = {{ADVANCED ENGINEERING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Metamaterials with negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) have a broad range of
   application background, such as aerospace engineering, automotive
   engineering, medical instrument engineering, and wearable engineering.
   Herein, a novel strategy for constructing 3D dislocated chiral
   metamaterial is proposed that can achieve NPR effect in three
   directions. According to this strategy, a new dislocated chiral
   metamaterial composed of dislocated tetrachiral honeycombs and inclined
   rods is designed and selected as an example to investigate the
   effectiveness of the strategy. Experiments and numerical simulations are
   carried out to study the mechanical properties of the new metamaterial,
   confirming that this metamaterial exhibits NPR effect. The influence of
   geometric parameters on the elastic constants of the metamaterial is
   discussed based on experimental and numerical results. Meanwhile, the
   local loading performances of this dislocated chiral metamaterial and
   the previous aligned chiral metamaterial are studied and compared.
   Results show that this dislocated metamaterial possesses a stronger
   damage resistance capacity than the aligned one. By adjusting the
   rotational direction of ligaments in honeycombs and the arrangement of
   inclined rods, more special 3D dislocated chiral metamaterials with

Abstract = {{We demonstrate wireless remote control of two-dimensional (2D) and
   three-dimensional (3D) shape transformations of specially designed
   kirigami patterns by application of static magnetic fields. The kirigami
   patterns consist of hinge-linked periodic unit blocks composed of
   magnetic-particle-elastomer composites. By designing the axis of
   magnetic anisotropy in each unit block and determining the placement of
   the hinges that link the individual unit blocks, 2D and 3D
   transformations of the patterns were demonstrated under application of
   uniform magnetic fields with specific field directions. Magnetic
   nanoparticles in an elastomer matrix within unit blocks were aligned
   in-plane or out-of-plane with respect to the frame of the individual
   unit blocks by application of magnetic fields. Such 2D and 3D actuations
   of kirigami patterns might offer a first step toward the development of
   spatiotemporal actuation and transformation of more complex 3D shapes
   using magnetic-particle-elastomer composites.}},

Abstract = {{Mechanical metamaterials are systems which derive their mechanical
   properties from their structure rather than their intrinsic material
   composition. In this work, we investigate a class of highly anisotropic
   mechanical metamaterials designed by the introduction of diamond and
   elliptically shaped perforations which possess the ability to show
   auxetic behaviour. By the use of finite element simulations, we show how
   these highly tuneable systems have the potential to exhibit a large
   range of Poisson's ratios, ranging from highly positive to giant
   negative values, simply by altering the geometric parameters and
   orientation of the perforations. The anomalous properties of these
   systems have also been shown to be retained over significant tensile
   strain ranges, highlighting the vast potential applicability and
   functionality of these mechanical metamaterials.}},

Abstract = {{A stiff tubular cellular structure topology is designed by alternatively
   indenting rectangular contour patterns on the cell ribs. Modified
   topologies can be obtained by tailoring the geometric parameters. The
   Poisson's ratios and elastic moduli of the proposed tubular structures
   with various geometric parameters are determined using finite element
   method (FEM). Results show that the minimum Poisson's ratio of the
   proposed structures can reach -0.28. The unit cell topology and
   orientation can significantly affect the structures deformation
   behaviors. The structures exhibit mixed mode of bending- and
   stretching-dominated deformation responses, and show improved specific
   elastic moduli compared with traditional open-cell stochastic foams with
   positive Poisson's ratios. 3D-printed samples with identical geometric
   variables to those of the FE models are fabricated, and their Poisson's
   ratios and stress-strain relationships are determined experimentally,
   and compared with simulation results. Excellent agreement is achieved
   between measurements and simulations. The design concept proposed here

Title = {{Intensification of auxetic effect in high stiffness auxetic yarns with
   potential application as the reinforcing element of composite}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL TEXTILES}},
Abstract = {{Helical auxetic yarn (HAY) is a newly developed composite yarn with
   negative Poisson's ratio. HAYs offers advantageous merits as a
   reinforcing element in composite materials. In this paper high stiffness
   HAYs composed of Nylon filament core and fine steel wire wrap yarns were
   developed. The importance of the stiffness ratio of the wrap to the core
   components in the resultant auxetic yarn was examined. The differences
   between instantaneous and engineering Poisson's ratio analyses in the
   understanding of the strain-dependent behavior of HAY was investigated.
   Results revealed that the utilization of the fine steel multifilament in
   the developed HAY samples enormously improves the stiffness of HAY. It
   was possible to obtain an elastic modulus of 9 GPa and a maximum auxetic
   effect of -16.82 in the samples. It was concluded that such highly stiff
   auxetic yarn can successfully be used as reinforcement in various
   composite materials such as cementitious composites.}},

Abstract = {{A mathematical procedure has been presented to study the vibrational

   are solved using an analytical solution, and the natural frequencies,
   the critical velocities and dynamic response have been determined. To
   investigate the sensitivity of the geometrical parameters and material
   properties on the natural frequency, critical velocity, and dynamic
   response, a parametric study has been conducted. To verify the

   structure}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{254}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic materials exhibit interesting mechanical properties. In this
   work, a novel auxetic unit cell was proposed with an aim to improve the
   strength and energy absorption of the auxetic structure constituting
   these unit cells. In the developed unit cell, the vertical member of a
   conventional re-entrant unit cell was replaced by a diamond. The
   corresponding structure was named re-entrant diamond structure.
   Specimens were fabricated using Multi-Jet Fusion (MJF) technique and
   experimentally tested to investigate their mechanical performance under
   uniaxial quasi-static and dynamic compression. Finite element model was
   also developed in ABAQUS/Explicit and validated using experimental
   results. Moreover, in order to improve stiffness of the diamonds, a
   cross-link member was introduced in each diamond. Subsequently, a
   parametric study was conducted to study the influence of diamond angle
   (theta(2)) and length ratio (L-2/L-1) on the deformation mode,
   stress-strain curve, Poisson's ratio, and energy absorption of the
   re-entrant diamond structures with and without cross-links. This study
   revealed that larger diamond angle (theta(2)) and smaller length ratio
   (L-2/L-1) are desirable for high strength. Furthermore, the re-entrant
   diamond structures with and without cross-links were compared with the
   conventional re-entrant and hexagonal honeycombs in terms of strength
   and energy absorption.}},

Volume = {{281}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Here we propose a new 3D structure with cubic unit cells constructed by
   six 2D cross-like lattices. Applying Finite element analysis (FEA), we
   find that the mechanical properties of such 3D lattices can be
   geometrically tuned without considering different material attributes.
   The topology and volume fraction are changed by varying the deformation
   angle and strut diameter-length ratio, respectively, which both affect
   the overall stiffness. This is demonstrated by the experiments with 3D
   printed acrylate resin specimens. Interestingly, the proposed lattices
   also show a potential auxetic property and high porosity (>90\%). Such
   lattices can be used to create new materials with lightweight and
   tunable mechanical properties in tissue engineering, civil engineering,
   and aerospace industry. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   lattices, conventional and re-entrant honeycomb, are studied in detail
   and their dynamic behaviour is compared with that of a 2D auxetic
   lattice. Initially, the equivalent elastic properties of the proposed
   geometries are investigated at varying equivalent densities. Then a new
   lightweight solution of a sandwich structure with an auxetic
   metamaterial core is proposed for possible application to facial
   protective masks. Numerical impact analyses of the problem show the
   potential benefit of the present proposal with respect to traditional
   mask geometries.}},

Title = {{The impact of HIV infection on tuberculosis transmission in a country
   with low tuberculosis incidence: a national retrospective study using
   molecular epidemiology}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{DEC 14}},
Abstract = {{BackgroundHIV is known to increase the likelihood of reactivation of
   latent tuberculosis to active TB disease; however, its impact on
   tuberculosis infectiousness and consequent transmission is unclear,
   particularly in low-incidence settings.MethodsNational surveillance data
   from England, Wales and Northern Ireland on tuberculosis cases in adults
   from 2010 to 2014, strain typed using 24-locus
   mycobacterial-interspersed-repetitive-units-variable-number-tandem-repea
   ts was used retrospectively to identify clusters of tuberculosis cases,
   subdivided into `first' and `subsequent' cases.Firstly, we used
   zero-inflated Poisson regression models to examine the association
   between HIV status and the number of subsequent clustered cases (a
   surrogate for tuberculosis infectiousness) in a strain type cluster.
   Secondly, we used logistic regression to examine the association between
   HIV status and the likelihood of being a subsequent case in a cluster (a
   surrogate for recent acquisition of tuberculosis infection) compared to
   the first case or a non-clustered case (a surrogate for reactivation of
   latent infection).ResultsWe included 18,864 strain-typed cases, 2238
   were the first cases of clusters and 8471 were subsequent cases. Seven
   hundred and fifty-nine (4\%) were HIV-positive.Outcome 1: HIV-positive
   pulmonary tuberculosis cases who were the first in a cluster had fewer
   subsequent cases associated with them (mean 0.6, multivariable incidence
   rate ratio {[}IRR] 0.75 {[}0.65-0.86]) than those HIV-negative (mean
   1.1).Extra-pulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) cases with HIV were less likely
   to be the first case in a cluster compared to HIV-negative EPTB cases.
   EPTB cases who were the first case had a higher mean number of
   subsequent cases (mean 2.5, IRR (3.62 {[}3.12-4.19]) than those
   HIV-negative (mean 0.6).Outcome 2: tuberculosis cases with HIV
   co-infection were less likely to be a subsequent case in a cluster (odds
   ratio 0.82 {[}0.69-0.98]), compared to being the first or a
   non-clustered case.ConclusionsOutcome 1: pulmonary tuberculosis-HIV
   patients were less infectious than those without HIV. EPTB patients with
   HIV who were the first case in a cluster had a higher number of
   subsequent cases and thus may be markers of other undetected cases,
   discoverable by contact investigations.Outcome 2: tuberculosis in
   HIV-positive individuals was more likely due to reactivation than recent
   infection, compared to those who were HIV-negative.}},

Title = {{A systematic study on the predictability of different methods to predict
   the maximum Poisson's ratio of helical auxetic yarn}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE TEXTILE INSTITUTE}},
Abstract = {{Helical auxetic yarn is a structural material with negative Poisson's
   ratio which contains a soft yarn with a higher diameter as a core
   component and a stiff yarn with a lower diameter as wrap component that
   has been wrapped around the core component. In the present study, a
   semi-empirical model based on the improvement of a theoretical model and
   an artificial neural network model was developed for predicting the
   maximum negative Poisson's ratio of helical auxetic yarn. In order to
   verify the models, an experiment according to the initial helical angle
   of wrap component, the diameter ratio of components, and the modulus
   ratio of components has been designed. To measure the Poisson's ratio of
   helical auxetic yarn, an algorithm based on the image processing
   technique has been proposed. Unlike the results of previous studies, the
   experimental results showed that increasing the diameter ratio of
   components so much, will decrease the maximum negative Poisson's ratio
   of helical auxetic yarn due to higher bending stiffness of core
   component. The results of the comparison between the predicted and
   experimental values indicated that the artificial neural network model
   has a lower error than the semi-empirical model. It is expected that
   this work provides engineering tools to predict the auxetic behavior of
   helical auxetic yarn based on the required precision.}},

Journal = {{GEOFLUIDS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{2020}},
Month = {{DEC 8}},
Abstract = {{The time-dependent behaviors of the sedimentary rocks which refer to the
   altering of the mechanical and deformable properties of rock elements in
   the long-term period are of increasing importance in the investigation
   of the failure mechanism of the rock strata in underground coal mines.
   In order to obtain the accurate and reliable mechanical parameters of
   the sedimentary rocks at different weathering grades, the extensive
   experimental programs including the Brazilian splitting test, uniaxial
   compression tests, and direct shear tests have been carried out on the
   specimens that exposed to the nature environments at different
   durations. The correlation between the weathering grades and mechanical
   parameters including uniaxial tensile strength, uniaxial compression
   strength, elastic modulus, Poisson's ratio, cohesion, and friction
   coefficient was proposed. The obtained results suggested that uniaxial
   tensile strength, uniaxial compressive strength, elastic modulus, and
   cohesion dramatically decreased with increasing weathering time,
   characterized as the negative exponential relationship in general. The
   influences of various weathering grades on fracture behavior of the rock
   specimens were discussed. The cumulative damage of the rock by the
   weathering time decreased the friction coefficient of the specimens
   which led to the initiation and propagation of microcrack within the
   rock at lower stress conditions. The obtained results improved the
   understanding of the roles of weathering on the mechanical properties of
   sedimentary rocks, which is helpful in the design of the underground
   geotechnical structures.}},

   two-dimensional tetrahex-carbon nanosheet}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{102}},
Number = {{23}},
Month = {{DEC 7}},
Abstract = {{A recently proposed two-dimensional (2D) carbon allotrope,
   tetrahex-carbon composed of tetragonal and hexagonal rings in a buckled
   plane, draws scientific research interests due to its remarkable
   mechanical and electronic properties, including ultrahigh strength,
   negative Poisson's ratio, finite direct band gap, and high carrier
   mobility. In this work, a series of carbon nanotubes rolled from this
   new 2D tetrahex-C nanosheet with various size and chirality are studied
   through first-principles density-functional theory calculations. The
   tube diameter is in the range of 4.5-18 angstrom. It is found that the
   smallest thermodynamically stable nanotubes have the diameter of 4.5
   angstrom for zigzag tetrahex-C nanotubes (z-TH-CNTs) and 6.0 angstrom
   for armchair tetrahex-C nanotubes (a-TH-CNTs). The z-TH-CNTs are
   energetically more favorable than the a-TH-CNTs given similar size. The
   single-wall nanotubes have a particular wall thickness which shrinks
   with the decrease of tube size. It is also found that all explored
   nanotubes show semiconducting behavior and HSE predicted band gaps can
   be effectively tuned in the range of 1.84-2.69 eV with size and
   chirality. Large curvature in small z-TH-CNTs alters the band
   structures, resulting in a significantly reduced effective mass of
   electron thus indicating potentially enhanced carrier mobility. Work
   function of the tubes can be manipulated within the range of 5.25-5.43
   eV dependent on the tube size and chirality. These remarkable structural
   and electronic properties in the tetrahex-C nanotubes may have potential
   applications in nanoelectronics.}},

Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{278-287}},

Abstract = {{Purpose
   The purpose of this paper is the production of mechanical meta-material
   samples by rapid prototyping (RP) and replica technique for
   patient-specific skin graft or cranial implant applications in tissue
   engineering.
   Design/methodology/approach
   Positive moulds (patterns) were produced by stereolithography-based RP.
   Impression moulding method was used for the production of silicone
   products (skin grafts). Alginate was used as a moulding material
   (negative mould). Room temperature vulcanising silicone was poured into
   the cavity of alginate mould and then products were produced. TiO2
   powder and carbon fibres were used as reinforcement. Meta-material
   structured polyurethane reinforced silicone composites were also
   produced. Liquid components (diisocyanate and polyol) were poured into
   the mould and then polyurethane was produced. Then, polyurethane was
   immersed in the liquid silicone.
   Findings
   It is found that non-destructive ultrasonic test is a fast and reliable
   method. Meta-material-based composites show dome-shaped
   tensile/synclastic surface properties which are important for the skin
   graft and cranial implants. Increasing the amounts of cross-linking
   agent and TiO2 particles increased the hardness and elastic modulus.
   Carbon fibre addition enhanced the elastic modulus.
   Originality/value
   Although there are studies on the meta-materials, there is limited study
   on the RP of the meta-materials for patient-specific implants (skin
   grafts). Auxetic surface shows perfect fit to curved surface of the
   skull. Although there are studies on the silicone and polyurethane
   composites, there is limited study on the characterisation of mechanical
   properties by ultrasonic tests and strain gauge analysis.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a design method of Auxetic Bending-Active Gridshells
   (ABAGs), which are curved surfaces generated from the initial flat grid
   with 2-dimensional auxetic patterns. One of the mechanical properties of
   ABAGs is that a dome-like shape of a curved surface can be easily
   obtained by bending a grid due to negative Poisson's ratio for in-plane
   deformation. Shapes of auxetic patterns are relevant to Poisson's ratio.
   Non-periodic and/or hybrid 2-dimensional auxetic patterns are developed
   for designing the initial flat grid of ABAGs. Shape parameters are the
   sizes of each plane unit for tuning its reentrant pattern, and two types
   of reentrant shapes are mixed on an initial flat grid. Using the
   non-uniform patterns, we can obtain an asymmetric and more complex
   free-form surface of ABAGs than those composed of a uniform reentrant
   pattern. Discrete Gaussian curvature at each node on a curved surface is
   computed for quantitatively evaluating the properties of shapes of the
   obtained surfaces. Possibility of ABAGs as a new design tool is
   demonstrated by showing that various shapes are generated through large
   deformation analysis with the forced displacements at the supports.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Describe the inequalities in oral health in children treated
   in a hospital located in a deprived urban area in the UK. Research
   design: Case-note review of 1911 0-17-year-olds who underwent dental
   extractions under a general anaesthetic (DGA). Main outcome measures:
   Associations between Age, Ethnicity, Year-of-Treatment and Index of
   Multiple Deprivation (IMD) with the number of teeth extracted. Analysis
   used multilevel modelling assuming a Poisson distribution. Results: Mean
   number of teeth extracted was higher in the youngest children treated
   aged 0-5 years (relative risk coefficient, (RR=exp(beta)=1.39; 95\% CI
   1.24 to 1.56) compared to those aged 6-17 years and in `Other Whites'
   (predominantly immigrants from Eastern Europe) (RR=exp(beta)=1.34; 95\%
   CI 1.25 to 1.43), `South Asians' (RR=exp(beta)=1.15; 95\% CI 1.08 to
   1.23) but fewer in the `Black' ethnic group (RR=exp(beta)=0.85; 95\% CI
   0.76 to 0.95). DGA increased during the study with more teeth extracted
   in 2015, 2016 and 2017 (RR=exp(beta)=1.12, 95\% CI 1.22, 1.25) and with
   a negative gradient in the rate of DGA's (per decile) in children from
   the most deprived to most affluent locations (RR=exp(beta)=0.98; 95\% CI
   0.97 to 0.99). Conclusions: Significant oral health inequalities exist
   in children from a deprived urban area in the UK. A preventive approach
   to children's oral health is needed to reduce such inequalities,
   including public health and healthcare agencies to informing parents of
   children whose first language is not English about dental caries.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon nanotube reinforced composite (CNTRC) is one of the novel classes
   of advanced composite materials. This paper investigates the nonlinear
   bending and nonlinear vibration responses of hybrid laminated beams made
   of CNTRC layers bonded with metal layers on the top and bottom surfaces.
   We proposed a hybrid metal/CNTRC laminated beam for which out-of-plane
   Poisson's ratio is negative. The effective material properties of CNTRC
   layers are graded in a piece-wise pattern across the thickness of the
   beam. The material properties of both CNTRC layer and metal layer are
   temperature dependent. The beams are rested on an elastic foundation and
   are located in thermal environments. Reddy's higher-order beam model is
   used to establish the motion equations of the hybrid metal/CNTRC
   laminated beam. The motion equations include the von Karman geometric
   nonlinearity, the thermal effects and the beam-foundation interaction.
   By employing a two-step perturbation approach, the bending and nonlinear
   vibration solutions are obtained. A comparison of nonlinear responses of
   hybrid metal/CNTRCl laminated beams with positive and negative Poisson's
   ratios (NPRs) under different thermal environmental conditions is
   carried out and discussed in detail.}},

Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials and negative thermal expansion materials show great
   application potential in many important fields. In this paper, a novel
   three-dimensional truss structure with a tunable Poisson's ratio and
   tailorable coefficient of thermal expansion was developed. Since the
   deformation of each rod was dominated by axial tension or compression,
   the structure showed high stiffness. Equations regarding equivalent
   elasticity parameters and coefficients of thermal expansion of the
   structure were obtained by displacement and unit force methods. A
   numerical simulation verification was performed by ANSYS 16.0 software.
   The verification results indicated that the formulas have high precision
   and wide application scope. Through parametric analysis, we obtained the
   conditions for achieving a negative Poisson's ratio and negative thermal
   expansion coefficient. We also concluded that this material could
   realize a three-dimensional negative Poisson's ratio and bidirectional
   negative thermal expansion simultaneously by choosing reasonable
   geometric parameters and material combinations.}},

   FG-GRMMC laminated plates in thermal environments}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{253}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{In this paper we will investigate the impact of in-plane negative
   Poisson's ratio (NPR) on the post-buckling responses of
   graphene-reinforced metal matrix composite (GRMMC) laminated plates
   under uni- and bi-axial in-plane compressive loads. The effects of
   temperature variation and foundation support on the post-buckling
   responses of GRMMC laminated plates are also taken into consideration.
   The graphene volume fractions in each layer of a GRMMC plate may vary
   along the plate thickness direction to achieve a functionally graded
   (FG) arrangement. The GRMMC layers have temperature-dependent material
   properties that can be modeled by the extended Halpin-Tsai model.
   Employing the Reddy's third order shear deformation plate theory, the
   governing equations containing both thermal and foundation effects for
   the post-buckling problem of FG-GRMMC plates are formulated. The von
   Karman geometrical nonlinearity is also considered. The post-buckling
   responses of the FG-GRMMC laminated plates are obtained by solving the
   governing equations using a two-step perturbation approach. The results
   have revealed that in-plane NPR has a substantial impact on the
   post-buckling responses of GRMMC laminated plates.}},

Title = {{Compliant morphing structures from twisted bulk metallic glass ribbons}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICS AND PHYSICS OF SOLIDS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{145}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In this work, we investigate the use of pre-twisted metallic ribbons as
   building blocks for shape-changing structures. We manufacture these
   elements by twisting initially flat ribbons about their (lengthwise)
   centroidal axis into a helicoidal geometry, then thermoforming them to
   make this configuration a stress-free reference state. The helicoidal
   shape allows the ribbons to have preferred bending directions that vary
   throughout their length. These bending directions serve as compliant
   joints and enable several deployed and stowed configurations that are
   unachievable without pre-twist, provided that compaction does not induce
   material failure. We fabricate these ribbons using a bulk metallic glass
   (BMG), for its exceptional elasticity and thermoforming attributes.
   Combining numerical simulations, an analytical model based on a
   geometrically nonlinear plate theory and torsional experiments, we
   analyze the finite-twisting mechanics of various ribbon geometries. We
   find that, in ribbons with undulated edges, the twisting deformations
   can be better localized onto desired regions prior to thermoforming.
   Finally, we join multiple ribbons to create deployable systems with
   complex morphing attributes enabled by the intrinsic chirality of our
   twisted structural elements. Our work proposes a framework for creating
   fully metallic, yet compliant structures that may find application as
   elements for space structures and compliant robots. (c) 2020 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Continuous demand for the improvement of mechanical performance of
   engineering structures pushes the need for metastructures to fulfil
   multiple functions. Extensive work on lattice-based metastructure has
   shown their ability to manipulate wave propagation and producing
   bandgaps at specific frequency ranges. Enhanced customizability makes
   them ideal candidates for multifunctional applications. This paper
   explores a wide range of nonlinear mechanical behavior that can be
   generated out of the same lattice material by changing the building
   block into dome shaped structures which improves the functionality of
   material significantly. We propose a novel hourglass shaped lattice
   metastructure that takes advantage of the combination of two oppositely
   oriented coaxial domes, providing an opportunity for higher
   customizability and the ability to tailor its dynamic response. Six new
   classes of hourglass shaped lattice metastructures have been developed
   through combinations of solid shells, regular honeycomb lattices and
   auxetic lattices. Numerical simulation, analytical modelling, additive
   layer manufacturing (3D printing) and experimental testing are
   implemented to justify the evaluation of their mechanics and reveal the
   underlying physics responsible for their unusual nonlinear behaviour. We
   further obtained the lattice dependent frequency response and damping
   offered by the various classes of hourglass metastructures. This study
   paves the way for incorporating hourglass based oscillators to be used
   as building block of future mechanical metamaterials, leading to a new
   class of tunable metamaterial over a wide range of operating
   frequencies. The proposed class of metastructure will be useful in
   applications where lightweight and tunable properties with broadband
   vibration suppression and wave attenuation abilities are necessary.}},

Title = {{Strengths-based approaches for quantitative data analysis: A case study
   using the australian Longitudinal Study of Indigenous Children}},
Journal = {{SSM-POPULATION HEALTH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In Australia and internationally, there are increasing calls for the use
   of strengths-based methodologies, to counter the dominant deficit
   discourse that pervades research, policy, and media relating to
   Indigenous health and wellbeing. However, there is an absence of
   literature on the practical application of strengths-based approaches to
   quantitative research. This paper describes and empirically evaluates a
   set of strategies to support strengths-based quantitative analysis.
   A case study about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander child wellbeing
   was used to demonstrate approaches to support strengths-based
   quantitative analysis, in comparison to the dominant deficit approach of
   identifying risk factors associated with a negative outcome. Data from
   Wave 8 (2015) of the Australian Longitudinal Study of Indigenous
   Children were analysed. The Protective Factors Approach is intended to
   enable identification of factors protective against a negative outcome,
   and the Positive Outcome Approach is intended to enable identification
   of factors associated with a positive health outcome. We compared
   exposure-outcome associations (prevalence ratios and 95\% confidence
   intervals (CIs), calculated using Poisson regression with robust
   variance) between the strengths-based and deficit approaches.
   In this case study, application of the strengths-based approaches
   retains the identification of statistically significant exposure-outcome
   associations seen with the standard deficit approach. Strengths-based
   approaches can enable a more positive story to be told, without altering
   statistical rigour. For Indigenous research, a strengths-based approach
   better reflects community values and principles, and it is more likely
   to support positive change than standard pathogenic models. Further
   research is required to explore the generalisability of these findings.}},

Title = {{Additive manufacturing of metamaterials: A review}},
Journal = {{ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{36}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Metamaterials exhibit properties beyond those exhibited by conventional
   materials in conventional scenarios. These have been investigated both
   theoretically and experimentally at length. In many cases the
   underpinning physical understanding of metamaterials has greatly
   preceded our ability to manufacture constituent structures. However, the
   development of additive manufacturing techniques gives new possibilities
   for the fabrication of complex metamaterial structures, many of which
   cannot be realised through conventional fabrication methods. The
   literature to date contains contributions from a diverse group of
   researchers from the physical sciences, mathematics, and manufacturing
   technology in the creation of metamaterials for electromagnetic,
   acoustic and mechanical applications. It is proposed that additive
   manufacturing holds the key to realise the capabilities of this vibrant
   research community and permit the creation of new paradigms in
   fundamental structures but also exploitation through application. For
   this purpose, a literature review is presented which identifies key
   advances in metamaterials alongside additive manufacturing and proposes
   new opportunities for researchers to work together through intra/inter
   disciplinary research to realise structures which exhibit extraordinary
   behaviour(s). This review represents a comprehensive account of the
   state-of-the-art in the production of such metamaterials using additive
   manufacturing methods and highlights areas, which, based on trends
   observed in the literature, are worthy of further research and require a
   coordinated effort on behalf of the afore mentioned disciplines in order
   to advance the state-of-the-art.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper the geometry of an auxetic, re-entrant honeycomb structure
   made from Inconel 718 (IN718), was optimised with respect to the process
   parameters of laser melting process using a Renishaw AM250 after which
   the quasi static behaviour was analysed under tensile loading. Two
   different PBF process parameters were used with 2 different laser energy
   densities to manufacture the auxetic structures with 3 different strut
   thicknesses (0.3, 0.6 and 0.9 mm) in 2 building orientations (XY and ZX
   plane). A strut thickness of 0.6 mm was found to have the least porosity
   and the best dimensional accuracy. The latter geometry was then
   manufactured as part of a tensile test sample which were then tested at
   a strain rate of 0.001 s' after which the stress strain curve, yield
   stress, structural stiffness, plastic work and Poisson's Ratio were
   compared. The building directions XY, ZX and XZ of the auxetic structure
   were investigated, as well as the orientation of the individual cells
   with respect to the loading direction. XY was found to provide the best
   mechanical properties and the kinematics of deformation was found to be
   dependent on the loading direction with respect to the cells direction
   which resulted in a significant change in Poisson's ratio. Finite
   Element Analysis was also done in order to compare the stress strain
   curves and the deformation mode obtained from numerical modelling and
   experiment, and a good agreement was observed.}},

Journal = {{COMPOSITES COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{22}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{A novel 3-D structure is proposed by adding the reinforcing rods into
   the original 2-D star-shaped structure to obtain more obvious negative
   Poisson's ratio effect. The influence of length parameter, thickness
   parameter, angle parameters and material combination on the effective
   Poisson's ratio, effective Young's modulus and effective shear modulus
   of the novel 3-D structure is systematically investigated using
   cell-based finite element modeling. Additionally, the change rule of
   material combination sequence and length parameter of the structure's
   thermal expansion is also studied. The results show that the novel 3-D
   structure can achieve positive, zero and negative Poisson's ratio, as
   well as positive, zero and negative thermal expansion when appropriate
   material combination is adopted. Moreover, the negative Poisson's ratio
   effect of the novel 3-D structure is distinctly enhanced, and the
   effective Young's modulus is slightly increased through comparing with
   other two 3-D star shaped structures. By selecting material combinations
   and structural geometry parameters, metamaterials with special
   properties can be designed for different application fields.}},

Abstract = {{The accurate and rapid prediction of materials' physical properties,

   the thermal expansion coefficient, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, and
   thermal conductivity. Moreover, the transferability of commonly used

Abstract = {{Background Stigma is a formidable social structural barrier to HIV
   testing, and yet the effect of stigma on HIV testing is rarely examined
   at the community level. We aimed to examine the geospatial relationships
   of perceived HIV stigma and HIV testing among men and women living in
   rural Uganda.
   Methods Women and men (aged >= 18 years or emancipated minor) residing
   in rural areas of Uganda who self-identified as HIV negative completed
   interviews that included measures of HIV testing history and how
   participants perceived HIV stigma. We used geospatial cluster analyses
   to identify areas of higher perceived stigma and lower perceived stigma
   and the geographical dispersion of these areas. We used Poisson
   regression models stratified by gender to test individual-level and
   community-level perceived stigma in relation to frequency of HIV testing
   in the previous 2 years.
   Findings Between Nov 25, 2015, and May 26, 2017, we interviewed 9740
   participants (4359 {[}45\%] men and 5381 {[}55\%] women]), among whom
   940 (9\%) had never been tested for HIV, and among those who had been
   tested, 1131 (12\%) had not been tested in the previous 2 years. Men
   (3134 {[}72\%] of 4359) were less likely to have been tested in the past
   2 years than women (4535 {[}84\%] of 5381) were (p<0.001). We used
   Poisson regression models, reporting B coefficients, to test study
   hypotheses regarding the effects of individual-level and community-level
   stigma on HIV testing frequency counts. Multilevel modelling showed that
   women showed significant individual-level (B=-0.173, p<0.001) and
   community-level (B=-0.223, p<0.001) associations between lower stigma
   predicting higher rates of HIV testing. For men, lower individual-level
   perceived stigma was also associated with higher testing frequency
   (B=-0.030, p=0.018), whereas higher community-level perceived stigma was
   associated with higher testing frequency (B=0.077, p=0.008).
   Interpretation Our results suggest that perceived HIV stigma at the
   community level exerts a differential influence on testing for women and
   men. HIV testing campaigns that are targeted to men and women in rural
   Uganda will require gender tailoring to fit local contexts. Copyright

Title = {{Assessment of the mechanical and optical properties of buckling periodic
   elastic materials as optical force sensors}},
Journal = {{OPTICAL MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{110}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In this work, we report on the fabrication and characterization of a
   buckling system constituted by square array holes able to modify its
   structural configuration and its optical response as a function of the
   applied force. Herein, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) auxetic structures
   are fabricated by means of 3D printing mold and casting/peeling off
   steps. From a mechanical point of view, it has been demonstrated that
   the structure presents a transformation to a strikingly different
   pattern of alternating mutually orthogonal ellipses above a nominal
   force of 23 N, a clear signature of the auxetic structures behavior.
   This feature has been exploited to create a reversible and sensitive
   optical force sensor, that makes use of the variation on the light
   intensity or its optical rotation (theta) upon application of a force.
   In fact, it has been demonstrated that the application of the force
   induces a variation of the refractive index of the auxetic system,
   associated to the presence of stress. For the structure realized a
   sensitivity of about Delta(Delta theta)/Delta F = 0.033 rad/N in the
   range between 23 N and 28 N has been determined.
   Finally, the presented study suggests that it is possible to realize a
   sensitive and reversible optical force sensor taking advantages of the
   peculiar features of buckling periodic elastic materials.}},

Title = {{Understanding the influences of Mg doping on the physical properties of

Journal = {{RESULTS IN PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{19}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The structural, mechanical, and electronic properties of perovskite
   molybdates are a topic of frequent study in materials science. In this
   study, the influence of Mg doping on the physical metallurgy of
   perovskite molybdates is investigated using first-principles
   calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) and molecular
   dynamics (MD) simulation. Our calculated optimized lattice parameters
   (3.9945, 3.8964, 3.8634, 3.8440, and 3.7952 angstrom {[}mentioned only
   DFT data, MD data listed in Table 2] for x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4
   respectively) of SrMo1-xMgxO3 are highly consistent with other
   experimental results (3.9762, 3.9695, and 3.9649 angstrom for x = 0,
   0.1, and 0.2 respectively) and some available theoretical results
   (3.9720 angstrom for x = 0, no previous data available for Mg-doped
   systems). The calculated elastic constants satisfied the Born stability
   criteria, indicating that our studied materials are mechanically stable
   at all doping concentrations, which was also confirmed by the calculated
   negative values of Cohesive energy. The mechanical behaviors of
   perovskite, including elastic constants, elastic moduli, ductility, and
   elastic anisotropy, were investigated and discussed. Our computed
   results suggest that Mg doping can increase elastic moduli. The
   calculated Pugh's ratio increased from 0.42 to 0.71 {[}DFT] and from
   0.47 to 0.75 {[}MD] as well as the Poisson's ratio decreased from 0.31
   to 0.21 {[}DFT] and from 0.30 to 0.21 {[}MD] which transformed the
   compound from ductile to brittle due to the addition of Mg at Mo-site.
   The band structures, density of states, and charge density
   redistributions of the undoped and Mg-doped materials were predicted.
   Our simulation outputs clearly illustrated the importance of accounting
   for Mg doping's influence in theoretical simulations of the physical
   properties of the presently studied perovskite material.}},

   postbuckling behavior of FG-GRMMC laminated cylindrical panels on
   elastic foundations}},
Journal = {{THIN-WALLED STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{157}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic materials are one of the metamaterials that have potential
   applications in many scientific and engineering fields. In this paper,
   an investigation is presented on the postbuckling responses of axially
   loaded graphene reinforced metal matrix composite (GRMMC) laminated
   cylindrical panels with in-plane negative Poisson's ratio (NPR). The
   panels are made of GRMMC laminates and rest on an elastic foundation in
   thermal environments. The graphene volume fraction in GRMMC layer may
   vary across the panel thickness in order to achieve a piece-wise
   functionally graded (FG) pattern. The GRMMC layers have in-plane NPR and
   temperature dependent material properties. The governing differential
   equations for the GRMMC laminated cylindrical panels are formulated
   based on the Reddy's third order shear deformation shell theory and are
   solved by using a singular perturbation technique along with a two-step
   perturbation approach. Numerical investigation is carried out to study
   the influence of the in-plane NPR, the FG patterns, the thermal
   environmental conditions and the foundation stiffness on the
   postbuckling responses of the GRMMC laminated cylindrical panels under
   axial compressive load. The results reveal that the in-plane NPR can
   lead to a substantial change of the postbuckling behaviors of the GRMMC
   laminated cylindrical panels.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, series of full-scale cutting tests and cutting
   simulations are carried out to investigate the influence of installation

   process to calibrate macro properties of rock including uniaxial
   compressive strength (UCS), elastic modulus, Poisson's ratio, cohesion
   and internal friction angle is proposed and used to complete the
   calibration of coal model. The cutting simulations are performed using
   picks with different tip angles and rake angles. The results show that
   the peak cutting force (PCF) decreases with the increase of rake angle
   following an inverse proportional function when the rake angle is
   positive, while it varies following a parabolic curve in the condition
   of negative rake angle. Moreover, the crack mode changes from primarily
   shear failure to primarily tensile failure with the increase of rake
   angle. Finally, a multiple-attribute index is proposed to evaluate the
   cutting performance and select the optimum cutting parameters.}},

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{107}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Sandwich structures have superior mechanical properties to be applied in
   civil, marine, mechanical and aerospace engineering fields. Auxetic
   structures with negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) can contract laterally
   when compressed axially to be excellent fillers for the sandwich
   structures to improve the energy absorption performance. In this work, a
   cylindrical sandwich filled with double arrowed auxetic structure is
   proposed. An analytical model is established to predict the dynamic
   responses of the sandwich structure under axial impact loading. The
   theoretical model is composed of three parts: energy dissipated due to
   the auxetic filler, the thin walled tubes, and their interaction.
   Numerical simulations are performed to validate the theoretical model
   and the results indicate that the theoretical model proposed is accurate
   to predict the crushing platform stress of the cylindrical sandwich

Abstract = {{Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has severely
   impacted the lives of children and adolescents. School closure, one of
   the critical changes during the first COVID-19 wave, caused decreases in
   social contacts and increases in family time for children and

   suicide, which is one of the robust mental health outcomes. However, the
   impact of the COVID-19 crisis on children and adolescents in terms of
   suicide is unknown.
   Objective: This study investigates the acute effect of the first wave of
   the COVID-19 pandemic on suicide among children and adolescents during
   school closure in Japan.
   Data: Total number of suicides per month among children and adolescents
   under 20 years old between January 2018 and May 2020.
   Methods: Poisson regression was used to examine whether suicide
   increased or decreased during school closure, which spanned from March
   to May 2020, compared with the same period in 2018 and 2019. Robustness
   check was conducted using all data from January 2018 to May 2020.
   Negative binomial regression, a model with overdispersion, was also
   performed.
   Results: We found no significant change in suicide rates during the
   school closure (incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 1.15, 95\% confidence
   interval (CI): 0.81 to 1.64). We found the main effect of month, that
   is, suicides significantly increased suicides in May (IRR: 1.34, 95\%
   CI: 1.01 to 1.78) compared to March, but the interaction terms of month
   and school closure were not significant (p > 0.1).
   Conclusions: As preliminary findings, this study suggests that the first
   wave of the COVID-19 pandemic has not significantly affected suicide
   rates among children and adolescents during the school closure in Japan.}},

   composite renders - A numerical study}},

Abstract = {{Masonry buildings constructed along busy roads are vulnerable to
   vehicular impacts resulting in damage to property and harm to occupants.
   This paper presents two strategies that use either carbon fibre or
   auxetic composite render for mitigating the adverse effects of such
   impacts and compares the merits of the two strategies. As masonry is a
   relatively low strength brittle material, the rendering material should
   possess high energy absorption characteristics (as in auxetic composite)
   or high strength (as in carbon fibre composite) properties for impact
   damage mitigation. Towards this end, finite element models incorporating
   material and contact nonlinearities and (recently developed) carbon
   fabric and auxetic fabric composite renders possessing positive and
   negative Poisson's ratios respectively are developed and applied. These
   models are validated using experimental datasets and then applied to
   masonry walls impacted laterally at velocities ranging from 6 km/h to
   100 km/h. Results show that the failure mechanism of masonry walls
   varies from global to local with the increase in the impact velocity and
   that the auxetic composite render significantly minimises debonding
   risks, enhances energy dissipation characteristics, reduces the impact
   force and the impact damage on the masonry walls, compared to carbon
   fibre composite render.}},

Abstract = {{A first step when fitting multilevel models to continuous responses is
   to explore the degree of clustering in the data. Researchers fit
   variance-component models and then report the proportion of variation in
   the response that is due to systematic differences between clusters.
   Equally they report the response correlation between units within a
   cluster. These statistics are popularly referred to as variance
   partition coefficients (VPCs) and intraclass correlation coefficients
   (ICCs). When fitting multilevel models to categorical (binary, ordinal,
   or nominal) and count responses, these statistics prove more challenging
   to calculate. For categorical response models, researchers appeal to
   their latent response formulations and report VPCs/ICCs in terms of
   latent continuous responses envisaged to underly the observed
   categorical responses. For standard count response models, however,
   there are no corresponding latent response formulations. More generally,
   there is a paucity of guidance on how to partition the variation. As a
   result, applied researchers are likely to avoid or inadequately report
   and discuss the substantive importance of clustering and cluster effects
   in their studies. A recent article drew attention to a little-known
   exact algebraic expression for the VPC/ICC for the special case of the
   two-level random-intercept Poisson model. In this article, we make a
   substantial new contribution. First, we derive exact VPC/ICC expressions
   for more flexible negative binomial models that allows for
   overdispersion, a phenomenon which often occurs in practice. Then we
   derive exact VPC/ICC expressions for three-level and randomcoefficient
   extensions to these models. We illustrate our work with an application
   to student absenteeism.
   Translational Abstract
   Multilevel models (random effects, mixed-effects or hierarchical linear
   models) are now a standard generalization of conventional regression
   models for analyzing clustered and longitudinal data in the social,
   psychological, behavioral, and medical sciences. A natural first step in
   any multilevel analysis is to report the degree of clustering in the
   response because it is the assumed presence of clustering which is the
   fundamental motivation for fitting multilevel models. Confirming that
   there is a statistically significant degree of clustering is not enough.
   One must additionally communicate the practical importance of clustering
   and this is done by reporting variance partition coefficients (VPCs) and
   intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). Different VPC and ICC
   expressions have been proposed and are now widely used for multilevel
   continuous, binary, ordinal, and nominal response models. In contrast,
   there has been almost no work for multilevel count response models. In
   this article, we propose new VPC and ICC expressions for both Poisson
   and negative binomial count response models. We then derive VPC/ICC
   expressions for three-level and random-coefficient extensions to these
   models. We illustrate all our work with an application to student
   absenteeism.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In the current work, the concept of auxetic structures design is
   introduced into carbon nanotube-reinforced composite (CNTRC) laminate.
   Larger values of negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) of CNTRC laminate are
   obtained by setting the optimal orientation. Meanwhile, a theoretical
   model is presented for the nonlinear dynamic response of functionally
   graded (FG) CNTRC beam with NPR. Using Reddy's higher order shear
   deformation plate theory with von Karman's strain-displacement
   relations, the motion equations are obtained A two-perturbation approach
   and the fourth-order Runge Kutta method are then used to obtain the
   time-deflection curve of the auxetic FG-CNTRC beam. The effects of
   factors such as the CNT distribution, thermal field and foundation
   stiffness on the dynamic characteristic of the auxetic FG-CNTRC beam are
   studied in details. Numerical results indicate that the
   thermal-mechanical behavior of FG-CNTRC beams might be significantly
   improved by determining a proper distribution of CNTs. Furthermore, the
   results show that the change of temperature and foundation stiffness
   have a significant effect on the dynamic characteristic of FG-CNTRC
   laminated beams with NPR.}},

Abstract = {{The main objective of this paper is to reinvestigate the impacts of
   non-tariff measures (NTMs) on bilateral exports among Regional
   Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) countries. The study adds to
   the literature in two areas. First, we calculate coverage ratios for
   NTMs related to specific sustainable development goals (SDGs) imposed on
   bilateral trade between RCEP member countries. Second, to avoid
   aggregation bias, the analysis covers four major sectors, namely
   agrifood, health, logistics, and other manufacturing. The results of a
   Poisson pseudo maximum likelihood (PPML) regression in a gravity model,
   using average import data from 2016 to 2018 at the Harmonized Commodity
   Description and Coding Systems (HS) two-digit level (97 subsectors),
   show that the effects of SDG-related NTMs vary by sector. NTMs related
   to SDG 3 (good health and well-being) distort trade in health but
   enhance trade in logistics. NTMs related to SDG 12 (responsible
   consumption and production) have a negative impact on logistics but a
   positive impact on other manufacturing exports. The findings provide new
   perspectives on the varying impacts of SDG-related NTMs on trade.
   Interestingly, the study finds that NTMs addressing SDGs 3 and 12 have
   positive trade impacts. Policymakers should, however, regulate NTM
   implementation, to minimize negative impacts and ensure that domestic
   firms comply to promote sustainable production.}},

Abstract = {{The traditional welded-flange through-diaphragm CFST column connections
   may develop fracture failures at bottom flanges. The
   bottom-flange-bolted upper-flange-welded (BFB-UFW) connection adopts a
   bolted connection between the bottom flange and the bottom diaphragm to
   reduce the early fracture risk. However, the asymmetric connection
   design would cause different moment bearing mechanisms and then
   influence the seismic performance of the connection. In this study,
   cyclic tests were performed on two BFB-UFW connections and one
   traditional welded-flange connection to investigate detailed working
   mechanisms and the influence of the bottom bolts on seismic performances
   of the connection. The BFB-UFW displayed good deformation abilities with
   the maximum drift ratio being higher than 5\%. The bolted bottom flange
   connection could alleviate the deformation demand on beam flanges
   through relative plate sliding behaviors. Bolt slips in the bottom
   flange connection led to pinched hysteretic loops. The BFB-UFW
   connection with a strong bottom flange connection exhibited higher
   negative strengths than the positive bending strengths due to the
   Poisson effect and the asymmetric supporting effect from the bottom
   diaphragm. The BFB-UFW connection belongs to the semi-rigid
   full-strength type. Therefore, this connection can be applied to a
   moment resisting frame, but the stiffness, strength and ductility of the
   connection must be considered in structural design.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the normal impact of a rigid sphere on a half-space of
   elasto-plastic auxetic/metal foam using the finite element method. The
   dependence of the coefficient of restitution, peak force, maximum
   displacement, and contact duration on the yield strain, impact velocity,
   and elastic and plastic Poisson's ratio is analyzed. For a given elastic
   Poisson's ratio, the coefficient of restitution generally decreases with
   an increase in the plastic Poisson's ratio and impact velocity. When the
   plastic Poisson's is maintained constant, the coefficient of restitution
   increases with an increase of the elastic Poisson's ratio. These trends
   are explained using plastic energy dissipation. The energy dissipation
   trends are further investigated by decomposing it into deviatoric and
   hydrostatic parts. For a given impact velocity, the peak force is
   relatively insensitive to most of the elastic and plastic Poisson's
   ratio combinations. We also show that for the cases where the elastic
   and plastic Poisson's ratios are equal, the coefficient of restitution
   is relatively insensitive to their actual values. These findings can
   guide researchers to identify the right elastic and plastic Poisson's
   ratio combinations so that lattice materials with exceptional energy
   absorbing capacity can be designed using topology optimization.}},

Title = {{A Newton solver for micromorphic computational homogenization enabling
   multiscale buckling analysis of pattern-transforming metamaterials}},
Journal = {{COMPUTER METHODS IN APPLIED MECHANICS AND ENGINEERING}},

Abstract = {{Mechanical metamaterials feature engineered microstructures designed to
   exhibit exotic, and often counter-intuitive, effective behaviour such as
   negative Poisson's ratio or negative compressibility. Such a specific
   response is often achieved through instability-induced transformations
   of the underlying periodic microstructure into one or multiple
   patterning modes. Due to a strong kinematic coupling of individual
   repeating microstructural cells, non-local behaviour and size effects
   emerge, which cannot easily be captured by classical homogenization
   schemes. In addition, the individual patterning modes can mutually
   interact in space as well as in time, while at the engineering scale the
   entire structure can buckle globally. For efficient numerical
   predictions of macroscale engineering applications, a micromorphic
   computational homogenization scheme has recently been developed (Roko et
   al., J. Mech. Phys. Solids 123, 119-137, 2019). Although this framework
   is in principle capable of accounting for spatial and temporal
   interactions between individual patterning modes, its implementation
   relied on a gradient -based quasi-Newton solution technique. This solver
   is suboptimal because (i) it has sub-quadratic convergence, and (ii) the
   absence of Hessians does not allow for proper bifurcation analyses.
   Given that mechanical metamaterials often rely on controlled
   instabilities, these limitations are serious. Addressing them will
   reduce the dependency of the solution on the initial guess by perturbing
   the system towards the correct deformation when a bifurcation point is
   encountered. Eventually, this enables more accurate and reliable
   modelling and design of metamaterials. To achieve this goal, a full
   Newton method, entailing all derivations and definitions of the tangent
   operators, is provided in detail in this paper. The construction of the
   macroscopic tangent operator is not straightforward due to specific
   model assumptions on the decomposition of the underlying displacement
   field pertinent to the micromorphic framework, involving orthogonality
   constraints. Analytical expressions for the first and second variation
   of the total potential energy are given, and the complete algorithm is
   listed. The developed methodology is demonstrated with two examples in
   which a competition between local and global buckling exists and where
   multiple patterning modes emerge. The numerical results indicate that
   local to global buckling transition can be predicted within a relative
   error of 6\% in terms of the applied strains. The expected pattern
   combinations are triggered even for the case of multiple patterns. (C)

Abstract = {{Critical drawback of poor stiffness in traditional auxetic materials
   limits them to be applied where negative Poisson's ratio behavior and
   excellent load-bearing capacity are simultaneously desired. In this
   work, a general prescription for designing auxetic lattice structures
   with high stiffness and controllable isotropic/anisotropic elastic
   properties is proposed. Based on it, we rationally design a class of
   novel auxetic lattice structures whose deformation is mainly governed by
   the stretching mechanisms and conducted an investigation on a tree-like
   re-entrant structure. A combination of theoretical predictions,
   numerical simulations and tensile test experiments have been carried out
   to gain a comprehensive understanding of the structural in-plane elastic
   mechanical properties along both the principal axes as well as in the
   off-axis directions. Besides, theoretical model for designing tree-like
   re-entrant structure with isotropic elastic properties is established
   and experimentally verified with specimens fabricated with CFRP
   composite. The results of this research has proven the tree-like
   re-entrant structure exhibits excellent effective Young's modulus, shear
   modulus and obvious negative Poisson's ratio effect along
   omni-direction. Investigation on the directional dependence of
   structural effective elastic properties has further indicated the
   proposed structure presents a great potential for designing auxetic
   material with controllable anisotropic elastic properties. In
   particular, the proposed structure is capable in achieving isotropic
   design with any negative Poisson's ratio between -1 and 0. The design
   philosophy presented in this paper provides a general prescription for
   solving the challenge of poor stiffness in traditional auxetic materials
   and paves a new way for isotropic auxetic design. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

   properties and energy absorption capability}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITES PART B-ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{202}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{The material with negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) is a typical
   metamaterial, which is considered to have great prospects in energy
   absorption, but the low modulus and low strength of the materials are
   the biggest obstacles to its engineering applications. In this paper,
   the basic mechanical properties and energy absorption performance of an
   auxetic material with ultra-low density, named as a novel cross-chiral
   structure (NCCS), are systematically studied under quasi-static and
   dynamic compression. The results reveal that this auxetic material shows
   strong anisotropy and enhanced mechanical properties in the principal
   directions. Compared to the previously reported auxetic materials, it
   exhibits higher modulus and strength as well as superior energy
   absorption capability with the relative density less than 0.1, which is
   validated by both numerical simulations and experiments. In addition,
   the results indicate that the presented model can be optimized to
   achieve excellent mechanical properties and outstanding energy
   absorption capability with ultra-low densities, by tailoring strut's
   tilt angle and relative density. This architectured metamaterial is
   expected to find a bright future in the applications of energy
   absorption such as sandwich cores of armor.}},

Abstract = {{Background:
   Pediatric inpatient mortality rates are as high as 11\% in parts of
   sub-Saharan Africa. Unscheduled clinic visits also burden children in
   sub-Saharan Africa. Our objective was to identify factors associated
   with hospital admissions and unscheduled clinic visits among Tanzanian
   children < 24 months of age.
   Methods:
   We conducted a secondary analysis of 2 trials conducted in Dar es
   Salaam, Tanzania. We performed univariate and Poisson multivariable
   regression analyses to identify factors associated with hospital
   admissions and unscheduled clinic visits.
   Results:
   Of 4784 children < 24 months of age, 293 (6.1\%) were hospitalized at
   least once and 1308 (27.3\%) had >= 1 unscheduled clinic visit. Infants
   and children who were exposed to but HIV-negative had increased risk of
   hospital admission {[}adjusted risk ratios (aRR): 3.67; 95\% CI:
   2.45-5.50; P < 0.001] compared with HIV-unexposed children. Those who
   were HIV-positive had even higher risk of hospital admission compared
   with those not exposed to HIV (aRR: 10.87; 95\% CI: 7.01-16.89; P <
   0.001). Birth weight and breast-feeding status were not associated with
   increased risk of hospital admission. Children with Apgar scores < 7
   (aRR: 1.32; 95\% CI: 1.03-1.69; P = 0.001), not exclusively breast-fed
   up to 6 months of age (aRR: 1.34; 95\% CI: 1.12-1.60; P = 0.001), and
   who were HIV-exposed and HIV-negative (aRR: 2.35; 95\% CI: 2.08-2.66; P
   < 0.001) or HIV-positive (aRR: 3.02; 95\% CI: 2.52-3.61; P < 0.001) had
   higher risk of unscheduled clinic visits.
   Conclusions:
   Exposure to HIV and being HIV-positive were associated with the greatest
   risk for hospital admission and unplanned clinic visits among infants
   and children in Tanzania. Targeting these vulnerable populations in
   interventional studies may reduce morbidity.}},

   out-of-plane auxetic nonwoven scaffold that possesses a 3D
   interconnected highly porous structure with remarkable mechanical
   properties corresponding to conventional nonwoven material. A design
   strategy of utilizing larger fiber diameters to enhance the porosity and
   permeability characteristics successfully devised the nonwoven scaffold
   with an extraordinary out-of-plane auxetic effect. In situ tensile-X-ray
   microcomputed to-mography (microCT) analysis has been carried out to

Title = {{Optimal turbine blade design enabled by auxetic honeycomb}},
Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Gas turbine blades are subjected to unusually harsh operating
   conditions-rotating at high velocities in gas streams whose temperature
   can exceed the melting temperature of the blade. In order to survive
   these conditions, the blade must efficiently transfer heat to an
   internal cooling flow while effectively managing mechanical stresses.
   This work describes a new design strategy for the internal structure of
   turbine blades that makes use of architected materials tailored to
   reduce stresses and temperatures throughout the blade. A full 3D
   characterization was first performed to determine the thermomechanical
   properties of generalized honeycomb materials with different design
   parameters: honeycomb angle and wall thickness. A turbine blade cross
   section was then divided into multiple discrete domains so that
   different generalized honeycomb materials could be assigned to each of
   the domains. Optimization of the material assignments was performed in
   order to minimize the stress ratio-ratio of the maximum Mises' stress
   and the temperature dependent yield stress-in the entire model. The
   optimized design showed substantial improvement with respect to a
   baseline model; the factor of safety was increased by 171\%, while the
   maximum Mises' stress and temperature decreased by 42\% and 72\%
   respectively. The use of generalized honeycomb materials allows for
   local control of the material properties to tune the performance of the
   turbine blade. The results of the optimization clearly indicate that
   auxetic honeycombs outperform conventional designs; since their lower
   in-plane stiffness helps to reduce stresses caused by thermal gradients.
   Our results demonstrated the feasibility of using 3D-printing compatible
   architected materials in turbine blades to increase their factor of
   safety and potentially increase operating temperatures to improve
   thermal efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Developments in technology require the new materials, lighter and more
   efficient structures and also new manufacturing methods. In this study,
   after doing researches about topology optimization, regular honeycomb
   and re-entrant structures; the regular honeycomb and re-entrant
   structures were designed, and then Ti-6Al-4V material was chosen for
   these structures in finite element (FE) analyzing. The three different
   rib thickness values (t) of 1 mm, 1.5 mm and 2 mm were assigned for
   honeycomb and re-entrant structures in FE analyses. Also, the crack was
   created on the models, and then 2-D FE analyses were done for both
   cracked and un-cracked honeycomb and re-entrant structures under tensile
   forces through y axis. Afterwards, the effect of crack on stress
   intensity factor, stresses, strains and displacement were obtained and
   characterized the auxetic behavior of the regular honeycomb and
   re-entrant structures. Furthermore, increase in rib thickness decreases
   stress and strains for each structure. Moreover, re-entrant structures
   have negative Poisson's ratio due to their geometric properties and the
   notable effect of crack on the equivalent stress in re-entrant was
   emerged in comparison with honeycomb structure. As a result, the only
   possible fracture in honeycomb for thickness of 1 mm might be observed
   owing to stress intensity factor obtained from analyses bigger than
   fracture toughness of honeycomb structure.}},

   honeycombs with entrapped gas}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMPACT ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{146}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This work aims to study the uniaxial dynamic compression response of
   hexagonal honeycombs with different cell morphologies in the presence of
   an entrapped gas. A theoretical model is proposed to estimate the
   dynamic crushing strength of non-auxetic honeycombs while including the
   effect of the entrapped gas on the crushing process. The theoretical
   predictions are shown to agree well with the finite element (FE)
   simulations. From the numerical simulations, Hugoniot relations between
   the shock velocity and the impact velocity are obtained for various
   honeycomb geometries. It has been observed that shock velocity varies
   almost linearly with impact velocity. Using this fundamental relation,
   we derive the stress-impact velocity Hugoniot from the conservation law
   of momentum. The dynamic stress-strain states of a regular hexagonal
   honeycomb obtained from the FE simulations show a good agreement with
   the Hugoniot predictions. It is shown that the dynamic stress-strain
   states for various impact velocities lie on a unique curve, which is
   different from the quasi-static stress-strain response. The local
   strains behind the shock front are significantly lowered in the presence
   of an entrapped gas, and the stresses behind the shock front are higher
   as compared to the case where there is no entrapped gas. The variation
   of the plateau stresses with the cell morphology has been explained, and
   correlated to the energy absorption capacity of the honeycombs. A new
   method to characterize the energy absorption capacity of honeycombs is
   proposed, and the performance of various honeycombs has been compared
   through the dissipation performance parameter.}},

Abstract = {{A novel two-dimensional (2D) semiconducting carbon allotrope is proposed
   by inserting alkyne into tetrahexcarbon. This new carbon allotrope
   consists of tetra-rings and acetylenic linkages and is called
   TAL-carbon. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first 2D carbon
   allotrope composed of sp-sp(2)-sp(3) hybridized carbon atoms. Due to its
   unique puckered structure, TAL-carbon is the fourth 2D carbon material
   with an intrinsic in-plane negative Poisson ratio (NPR) reported after
   graphene, penta-graphene, and tetrahexcarbon. Materials with NPR exhibit
   a wide range of potential applications in biomedicine, aerospace
   industries, and precision instruments. TAL-carbon has an indirect band
   gap of 1.614 eV. At room temperature, it exhibits high in-plane electron
   mobility of up to similar to 3.5 x 10(4) cm(2)V(-1)s(-1), which is 30
   times higher than monolayer black phosphorus and two orders of magnitude
   higher than monolayer MoS2. The phonon dispersion curves and in-plane
   elastic constants indicate that TAL-carbon is dynamically and
   mechanically stable. Its equibiaxial strain limit reaches 13.7\%,
   similar to that of graphene. An ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD)
   simulation demonstrates that TAL-carbon is thermally stable at 300 K and
   1000 K. The results show that TAL-carbon is a promising 2D auxetic
   material for applications in nanomechanics and nanoelectronics.}},

Abstract = {{Topology Optimization (TO) is a powerful numerical technique to
   determine the optimal material layout in a design domain, which has

Title = {{Additive manufacturing meta-functional composites for engineered bridge
   bearings: A review}},
Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{262}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{One of the most important causes of bridge failure is the design and
   structural deficiencies of bridge bearings. Recently, typical bridge
   bearings with the reinforcement of steel or fibre have been widely used
   in base isolation system. Especially for fibre-reinforced rubber
   bearings, they offer numerous benefits as higher stiffness and strength,
   more flexibility, and decrease of transport and fabrication costs. Under
   vibration, common bridge bearings cannot perform well and the materials
   used in the bearings cannot sustain under environmental conditions. To
   develop the performance of these common bearings to obtain their
   superior physical and mechanical properties (e.g. lightweight, higher
   stiffness, better impact resistence, and vibration attenuation), the use
   of metamaterials (periodic structures) in the bearings is considered for
   this reason. The current paper is the world's first to present a
   comprehensive, state-of-the-art overview of the development of
   meta-functional composites for bridge bearing applications, exposed to
   both static and dynamic conditions. Also, the paper shows an approach to
   fabricate meta-functional composite bridge bearings via additive
   manufacturing (AM) technologies. Furthermore, the numerical simulation
   has been conducted to enable new insights into the behavior of a
   meta-functional bridge bearing suitable for real-life practial
   applications. These insights are fundamental to the performance
   bench-marking including the development of vibration-based condition
   monitoring and inspection for predictive bridge component maintenance.

Title = {{Manipulation of giant negative Poisson's ratios in three-dimensional
   graphene networks}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{102}},
Number = {{18}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{Three-dimensional (3D) graphene networks (3DGNs) have drawn broad
   interest recently for their superior physical properties, such as large
   surface area, high strength, superelasticity, tunable band gaps and
   topological properties, with potential applications in high-capacity
   energy storage and novel electronic systems. In this work, giant
   negative Poisson ratios (NPRs) up to -8.5 and colossal auxetic
   transverse contraction (or expansion) of more than 40\% (or 20\%) in
   3DGNs are predicted by first-principles calculations, adding another
   extraordinary mechanical property to 3DGNs. A mechanism dominated by
   sp(3)-carbon bond angle distortion and in-plane anisotropy variation is
   revealed that can explain such exceptional NPRs in 3DGNs. Furthermore,
   easy manipulation and enhancement of NPRs are achieved by applying
   biaxial stresses which increase the in-plane anisotropy of 3DGNs,
   providing a way for the rational design and application of NPR
   materials. These discoveries will deepen our understandings of 3DGNs and

Abstract = {{Very recently, a black-phosphorus-like nitrogen (bp-N) bulk has been
   synthesized in high-pressure experiments {[}D. Laniel, et al., Phys.
   Rev. Let., 2020, 124, 216001 and C. Ji, et al., Sci. Adv., 2020, 6,
   eaba9206]. However, the corresponding bp-N monolayer, i.e. a puckered N
   nanosheet, is unstable, which will decompose to loose N zigzag lines.
   Based on first-principles calculations, we find that the puckered
   geometry can be stabilized by inserting C-2 dimers between the upper and
   lower N zigzag lines. The formed C2N2 nanosheet possesses good
   energetic, dynamical, mechanical, thermal and chemical stabilities,
   which can maintain the free-standing state even in the presence of O-2
   gas. Owing to the phosphorene-like geometrical character, this C2N2
   nanosheet exhibits an auxetic mechanical behaviour with a negative
   Poisson's ratio in the out-of-plane direction. The C2N2 nanosheet is an
   indirect-gap semiconductor with a noticeable linear dichroism. More
   interestingly, a giant anisotropy appears in the hole mobility of the
   C2N2 nanosheet, which has a high (low) hole mobility of about 1700 (20)
   cm(2) V-1 s(-1) along the armchair (zigzag) direction. The corresponding
   anisotropic ratio is as large as 85 in the C2N2 nanosheet, which is the
   maximum mobility anisotropy reported in two-dimensional materials. The
   high hole mobility and large anisotropic ratio are also preserved in the
   multilayer C2N2 nanosheets. Our study demonstrates that the puckered
   N-based nanosheets possess robust structural stabilities and
   unconventional physical properties, which endow the system with many
   potential applications in flexible electronics, optoelectronics, and
   direction-sensitive sensors.}},

Title = {{Close-in blast resistance of large-scale auxetic re-entrant honeycomb
   sandwich panels}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SANDWICH STRUCTURES \& MATERIALS}},
Abstract = {{The protection of critical infrastructure, including government
   buildings, airports, religious buildings, military buildings and
   military vehicles, which are at risk to blast loads, has become
   important due to increasing terrorist activities in recent years.
   Sacrificial cladding systems based on negative Poisson's ratio core
   topologies have recently received more attention as a protective
   technology due to its excellent energy absorption capability. In this
   study, field blast tests were performed on metallic re-entrant
   honeycomb-cored sacrificial cladding systems as protective structures
   for steel plate structures. This study focused on the near-field blast
   loading conditions where liquid Nitromethane (NM) spherical charges were
   detonated in close proximity to the main structure. Two 6 mm thick mild
   steel plates and two steel plates protected with re-entrant
   honeycomb-cored sacrificial cladding systems were among the specimens
   tested. The proposed auxetic cladding system was fabricated from
   aluminium sheets using a novel in-house built folding machine. Numerical
   simulations were conducted utilising LS-DYNA software and the Blast
   Impact Impulse Model (BIIM). The results obtained from the numerical
   simulations are in good agreement with the experimental results. It was
   found that the deformation pattern of the sacrificial auxetic cladding
   system varies with the intensity of the blast loading, and there is a
   limit at which the proposed protective system ceases to effectively
   absorb the applied blast loading. The variation of negative Poisson's
   ratio of the system with blast loading was studied. It was found that
   the auxetic cladding system could become a solid projectile leading to
   damage amplification for very close-range blast loads due to rapid
   densification of the auxetic core. The proposed cladding systems with
   narrow re-entrant angles performed well under blast loads due to
   relatively low stiffness of the panels. Finally, the optimisation study
   was performed for the protective system. Overall, the experimental and
   numerical results assure that auxetic-based cladding systems are
   suitable for applications requiring blast protection such as armoured
   vehicles and critical physical infrastructure but need to be carefully
   designed for the given blast threat to prevent overloading of the
   protected structures.}},

Abstract = {{We examine in detail the activity coefficient of higher-charge
   electrolytes, which, in dilute solutions, can display negative
   deviations from the Debye-Huckel limiting law instead of the usual
   positive deviations typical of lower-charge electrolytes. This fact is
   of considerable relevance for scientists concerned with extrapolation to
   infinite dilution of thermodynamic and kinetic quantities. It is shown
   that this ``strange{''} behavior originates merely from the
   electrostatic interactions between each ion and all other ions, with no
   necessity of hypothesizing the presence of chemical association; these
   negative deviations, indeed, are predicted even at the level of the
   ``primitive model{''} (ions assumed as charged, unpolarizable, rigid
   spheres inside an unstructured, isotropic, dielectric fluid). Three
   different approximations for the behavior of the primitive model of
   low-charge and high-charge electrolytes are tested, in addition to the
   Debye-Huckel theory; i.e. IPBE (a numerical accurate integration of the
   Poisson-Boltzmann equation), the Mayer theory of the electrolytes in the
   so-called DHLL + B2 approximation, and the Bjerrum theory. In the
   Supporting Information, the fundamentals of the respective algorithms
   are reported, and the effects produced by the differences of size
   between cations and anions, are also examined.}},

Abstract = {{Background
   Due to the multiple health benefits of breastfeeding, it is essential to
   identify factors that may negatively interfere with this healthy
   practice. Among such factors are postpartum depression (PPD) and
   maternal satisfaction with breastfeeding. The objective of this study
   was to evaluate the association between maternal satisfaction with
   breastfeeding and symptoms of PPD in the first month after childbirth.
   Methods
   This cross-sectional study nested in a cohort study was conducted in
   Porto Alegre, Brazil, with 287 puerperal women selected at two maternity
   hospitals, one public and one private. Women were interviewed at their
   homes the week after the infant completed 30 days of life. A structured
   questionnaire was applied, as well as instruments to evaluate maternal
   satisfaction with breastfeeding (Maternal Breastfeeding Evaluation
   Scale) and to screen for PPD (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale). The
   association between higher satisfaction with breastfeeding (outcome) and
   negative PPD screening test was assessed using Poisson regression with
   robust variance, adjusting for specific covariables. Adjusted prevalence
   ratios (aPR) and respective 95\% confidence intervals (95\%CI) were
   estimated.
   Results
   The prevalence of increased satisfaction with breastfeeding (defined as
   women with scores above the median) was 47\% higher among women who
   screened negative for PPD when compared to those with a positive result
   (aPR 1.47; 95\%CI 1.01-2.16). This result was adjusted for maternal age
   and skin color, cohabitation with the infant's father, planned
   pregnancy, type of delivery, exclusive breastfeeding, and occurrence of
   breastfeeding problems.
   Conclusions
   The findings of this study showed an association between higher maternal
   satisfaction with breastfeeding and absence of PPD symptoms, reinforcing
   the importance of caring for the mental health of pregnant and puerperal
   women and paying attention to their satisfaction with breastfeeding.}},

Title = {{3D printing of chiral carbon fiber reinforced polylactic acid composites
   with negative Poisson's ratios}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITES PART B-ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{201}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Auextic materials possessing negative Poisson's ratios have gained great
   research interest by virtue of its various exotic mechanical properties
   while most of these metamaterials rely on the hollow cellular
   configuration, largely undermining the overall mechanical performance.
   It therefore restricts their application in load-bearing engineering
   fields. In order to solve this issue, we first designed a new class of
   chiral structures by integrating various polynomial curves. Based on the
   state-of-the-art 3D printing technique, these auxetic geometries were
   then fabricated into high-performance composites with chopped carbon
   fiber (CF) as the reinforcement. Guided by experimental characterization
   and finite element analysis, the influences of the polynomial orders (n)
   and the incorporation of CF on the mechanical properties were
   systematically studied. Results showed that the auxetic behaviour can be
   tailored by varying the n value inside the polynomial equation.
   Moreover, the tensile modulus, strength and energy absorption at break
   of printed chiral samples were all enhanced with the addition of CF,
   especially for the large improvement of modulus and absorbed energy by
   2-fold. Hence, these novel chiral composites present great potential in
   the development of high performance mechanical metamaterials.}},

Title = {{Large deformation and energy absorption of additively manufactured
   auxetic materials and structures: A review}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITES PART B-ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{201}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Different from conventional materials, materials with negative Poisson's
   ratios expand laterally when stretched longitudinally. Known as
   `auxetic' materials, the effect means they possess particularly
   fascinating properties, which have recently attracted considerable
   attention in the literature. A range of auxetic materials has been
   discovered, theoretically designed and fabricated. Developments in
   additive manufacturing (AM) techniques enable fabrication of materials
   with intricate cellular architectures. This paper outlines recent
   progress in the development of auxetic materials and structures, and
   their mechanical properties under quasi-static and dynamic loading are
   analysed and summarised. Limited experimental studies on 3D printed
   auxetic materials and structures are given more attention, ahead of
   extensively finite element (FE) simulations. A special focus is
   dedicated to their large, plastic deformation behaviour and energy
   absorption performance, which should be stressed in their engineering
   applications; no review paper has yet been found regarding this.
   Finally, this paper provides an overview of current study limitations,
   and some future research is envisaged in terms of auxetic materials and
   structures, nano-auxetics and additive manufacturing.}},

Title = {{Deformation behaviour of advanced textile composites with auxetic
   structure}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{252}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{The advanced composites - laminates, composed of auxetic and non-auxetic
   layers, were developed and subjected to tensile loading tests to
   characterize their deformation behaviour. The two-layer laminates were
   composed of the polymer foam with auxetic cellular structure and the
   conventional knitted fabric bonded together by the rubber-based
   adhesive, based on polymer binder, resins, additives and flammable
   organic solvents. All base materials, structured foams and laminates
   were tested. The influence of the adhesive on mechanical properties of
   the knitted fabric was also evaluated. The results of the study show
   that the cheaply fabricated laminates of knitted fabric reinforced by
   structured Ethylene-Vinyl Acetate (EVA) foam offer stiffness enhancement
   and decrease of the Poisson's ratio of the conventional fabric. The
   laminates also limit fabric warping during the deformation, thus
   increasing its stiffness. This behaviour can be beneficial in many
   applications in the textile industry by enhancing properties in
   durability, comfort and support.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a protect system consists of a re-entrant hexagon
   honeycomb cored sandwich panel and a homogenous steel plate was firstly
   proposed. The parametric study including boundary conditions, geometric
   and thickness parameters of the protect system was conducted. It was
   found that, under the presented set-up, the boundary conditions did not
   affect the energy absorption of the protect system, they only altered
   the internal energy distribution among the protect system. Finally, a
   novel multi-scale optimization was conducted to further improve the
   performance of the protect system. Another conventional multi-objective
   optimization was also conducted for comparison. The results showed that,
   by affording less computational effort, the multi-scale optimization
   improved the ASEA (areal specific energy absorption) by 4.9\% and
   reduced MaxD (maximum displacement) by 1.8\%, comparing to the
   conventional multi-objective optimization.}},

Abstract = {{Disordered solids often change their elastic response as they slowly
   age. Using experiments and simulations, we study how aging disordered
   planar networks under an applied stress affects their nonlinear elastic
   response. We are able to modify dramatically the elastic properties of
   our systems in the nonlinear regime. Using simulations, we study two
   models for the microscopic evolution of properties of such a material;
   the first considers changes in the material strength, while the second
   considers distortions in the microscopic geometry. Both models capture
   different aspects of the experiments including the encoding of memories
   of the aging history of the system and the dramatic effects on the
   material's nonlinear elastic properties. Our results demonstrate how
   aging can be used to create complex elastic behavior in the nonlinear

Abstract = {{High-performance stretchable triboelectric nanogenerators (STENGs) based
   on hierarchical auxetic films consisting of polyurethane (PU) foam and
   Ag electrode layers were fabricated. The high conformability and
   stretchability of the STENGs enable the dual-mode operation in both
   contact-separation and stretching-releasing modes. Compared with STENG
   devices with a single operation mode, our dual-mode STENG exhibits a
   high output voltage of 320 V and a current of 45 mu A with an
   instantaneous output power density of 3 mW. The working principles of
   dual-mode STENG and the relationships between its output performance and
   the various types of mechanical motions were systematically studied,
   providing a working mode of STENGs for various practical applications.
   The high output power generation from dual-mode STENG can be used to
   operate light-emitting diodes and charge a wearable electronic device.
   The proposed energy harvester offers a promising way to provide power
   sources for micropower systems, stretchable electronics, and
   self-powered biomechanical sensors.}},

Title = {{Long-term return and donation pattern of those who begin donating at
   different ages: A retrospective cohort analysis of blood donors in
   Australia}},

Abstract = {{Background: This study compared the likelihood of return to donate and
   donation rate ratio by age of donors at their first donation when
   followed up to 12 years.
   Study Design and Methods: Donation history of two cohorts of first-time
   donors (those donating in 2007 and 2013) was extracted until March 2019
   from Australian Red Cross Lifeblood's national database. Poisson
   regression analyses compared donor return and negative-binomial
   regression estimated the rate ratio of donations.
   Results: A total of 120 469 and 95 381 donors were included in the 2007
   and 2013 cohorts, respectively. Compared to donors aged 20-24 years, the
   likelihood of return in both cohorts increased consistently as age at
   first donation increased from 30-years and above. Average number of
   whole-blood and plasmapheresis donations increased as the age at first
   donation increased from 30-years onward. The whole-blood donation rate
   was highest for donors >= 60 years, while plasmapheresis donation rate
   was highest for donors aged 50-59 years. These patterns were largely
   consistent when stratified by sex.
   Conclusions: To continuously ensure the short- to mid-term sufficiency
   of blood supply in Australia, targeted recruitment of donors aged
   30-years and above may be considered, however its feasibility and impact
   should be explored further given relatively smaller proportion of new
   donors are middle-aged and older under current policies. Future studies
   with a longer follow-up period are needed to examine whether the
   frequency of donation among those who start donating at a younger age
   increases later in their life when they are 30-years or over.}},

Abstract = {{Soft robotics has been receiving increasing attention due to its
   flexibility and adaptability offered by embodied intelligence. A soft
   robot may undergo complex motions including stretching, contraction,
   bending, twisting, and their intricate combinations. Among these basic
   motions, bending plays a central role when a robot accomplishes tasks
   such as locomotion, grasping and manipulation. Although a rich
   repertoire of bending mechanisms has been reported, a systematic and
   rational design framework is still lack. In this paper, we provide a
   novel design strategy for soft bending actuators which allows integral
   modeling and design optimization. Nowadays, metamaterials are emerging
   as a new tool for soft robots, by encoding the desired complex motions
   directly within the material architectures, leading to conformable
   monolithic systems. We combine pneumatic actuators and flexible
   metamaterials to provide an alternative solution to soft bending
   actuators, with advantages of compact design, large bending motion, and
   convenient fabrication. A regular pneumatic chamber is embedded inside
   auxetic and non-auxetic metamaterials, and bending is generated when
   inflated. We carry out dimensionless analysis to identify the key design
   variables. To provide insight into design optimization, we develop a
   computation framework by modeling metamaterial structures with beam
   elements and the inner chamber with shell elements as an integral part,
   allowing efficient simulation of the coupled system. We systematically
   investigate how the bending angle varies with the key design variables
   and find the optimal design parameters. The experimental results are
   well in line with the simulation, and a remarkable bending motion of
   0.437mm is achieved.}},

Abstract = {{The research involving the crystal structures and properties of uranyl
   carbonate minerals is essential in actinide environmental chemistry due
   to the fundamental role played by these minerals in the migration of
   actinides from uranium deposits and nuclear waste repositories and in
   the investigation of accidental site contaminations. In this work, the
   crystal structure, hydrogen bonding network, X-ray diffraction pattern
   and mechanical properties of six important uranyl carbonate minerals,
   roubaultite (Cu-2{[}(UO2)(3)(CO3)(2)(OH)(2)]center dot 4H(2)O),
   fontanite (Ca{[}(UO2)(3)(CO3)(2)(OH)(2)]center dot 6H(2)O), sharpite
   (Ca{[}(UO2)(3)(CO3)(4)(OH)(2)]center dot 3H(2)O), widenmannite
   (Pb-2{[}(UO2)(CO3)(2)(OH)(2)]), grimselite (K3Na{[}(UO2)(CO3)(3)]center
   dot H2O) and cejkaite (Na-4{[}(UO2)(CO3)(3)]), are investigated using
   first principles solid-state methods based in density functional theory.
   The determination of the positions of the hydrogen atoms in the unit
   cells of fontanite, sharpite and grimselite minerals, defining the
   hydrogen bonding network in their crystal structures, has not been
   feasible so far due to the low quality of their experimental X-ray
   diffraction patterns. The full crystal structures of these minerals are
   obtained here and their hydrogen bonding networks are studied in detail.
   Furthermore, the experimental structures of roubaultite, widenmannite
   and cejkaite, obtained by refinement from X-ray diffraction data, are
   confirmed. In the six cases, the computed unit-cell parameters and the
   associated geometrical variables are in excellent agreement with the
   available experimental information. Furthermore, the X-ray diffraction
   patterns computed from the optimized structures are in satisfactory
   agreement with their experimental counterparts. The knowledge of the
   full crystal structures, being extraordinarily relevant for many
   scientific fields, is also extremely interesting because it opens the
   possibility of determining their physico-chemical properties using the
   first principles methodology. The measurement of these properties under
   safe conditions is very expensive and complicated due to the
   radiotoxicity of these minerals. In this paper, a large set of relevant
   mechanical properties of these minerals are determined including their
   bulk, shear and Young moduli, the Poisson's ratio, ductility, hardness
   and anisotropy indices and bulk modulus pressure derivatives. These
   properties have not been measured so far and, therefore, are predicted
   here. Four of these minerals, roubaultite, fontanite, sharpite and
   widemmannite, are highly anisotropic and exhibit negative mechanical
   phenomena under the effect of small external pressures.}},

   negative Poisson's ratio and tunable magnetism by doping}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{102}},

Abstract = {{Based on first-principles calculations, we predict a stable
   two-dimensional semiconductor, namely tin dioxide SnO2. By investigating
   its dynamical, thermal, and mechanical properties, we find that SnO2
   monolayer is an auxetic material with a large in-plane negative
   Poisson's ratio. Furthermore, our results show that SnO2 is an
   indirect-gap semiconductor with a band gap in the region of 3.7 eV and
   an extremely high electron mobility, similar to 10(3) cm(2)V(-1)s(-1).
   Interestingly, the band structure of SnO2 presents double
   Mexican-hat-like band edges in the valence bands near the Fermi level.
   Due to such a unique band feature, a ferromagnetic phase transition
   takes place with a half-metallic ground state that can be induced by
   hole doping within a very wide concentration range. Such a magnetic
   phase can be well explained by the Stoner mechanism. A peculiar feature
   of the magnetic state is the presence of large magnetocrystalline
   anisotropy that can switch from in-plane to out-of-plane upon hole
   doping. Hence, SnO2 monolayer can be tuned to be either an XY magnet or
   an Ising one, with a magnetic critical temperature above room
   temperature at proper hole concentrations. These findings demonstrate
   that the predicted phase of SnO2 is a rare example of p-type magnetism
   and a possible candidate for spintronic applications.}},

Title = {{Electric Auxetic Effect in Piezoelectrics}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{125}},
Number = {{19}},
Month = {{NOV 2}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic materials are characterized by a negative Poisson's ratio that
   they expand laterally in the directions perpendicular to the applied
   stretching stress and vice versa. Piezoelectrics will change their
   dimensions when exposed to an external electric field. Here we introduce
   the concept of the ``electric auxetic effect{''}: electric auxetic
   materials will contract or expand in all dimensions in response to an
   electric field. Such unusual piezoelectric response driven by an
   electric field is a close analogy to the auxetic effect driven by a
   stress field. A key feature of electric auxetic materials is that their
   longitudinal and transverse piezoelectric coefficients are of the same
   sign. We demonstrate using first-principles calculations that the
   Pca2(1) orthorhombic phase of ferroelectric HfO2 exhibits both the
   negative longitudinal piezoelectric effect and the electric auxetic
   effect. The unusual negative longitudinal piezoelectric effect arises
   unexpectedly from the domination of the negative internal-strain
   contribution over the positive clamped-ion contribution, a character
   often found in van der Waals solids. We confirm a few more electric
   auxetic materials with finite electric field calculations by screening
   through a first-principles-based database of piezoelectrics.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL TEXTILES}},
Abstract = {{The paper deals with development and characterization of 3D sandwich
   composite structures reinforced with newly-designed multi-cell
   flat-knitted spacer fabrics in terms of compressive behaviour and
   Poisson's ratio. Multi-cell spacer knitted preforms was produced on a
   computerized flat knitting machine. 3D composite samples with three
   different cross-sectional geometries were prepared via vacuum assisted
   resin transfer moulding method. Quasi-static compressive experiments
   were carried out on the prepared 3D composite samples. The Poisson's
   ratio of re-entrant 3D knitted composite varied between -6 and -1, which
   clearly points to existence of auxetic behaviour of the samples. The
   re-entrant 3D composites also demonstrated the highest initial slope and
   area under the compression force-displacement curve than spear-head or
   hexagonal composite structures which refer to higher energy absorbing
   capacity. The Poisson's ratio of 3D regular hexagonal knitted composites
   at small strain was usually 4 which gradually decreased to 1.6 as the
   exerted compressive strain increased. Additionally, 3D spear-head
   knitted composite having zero Poisson's ratio was also developed.}},

Abstract = {{The work studies the mechanical properties of chiral metallic nanotubes
   by the molecular statics method. The atomic structure of nanotubes was
   obtained by rolling up thin nanoplates from cubic crystals of copper,
   iron, aluminum, and cobalt with the (010) orientation at various chiral
   angles. It is shown that such nanotubes can experience torsion under
   tension and their Poisson's ratio decreases with increasing chiral angle
   within the range from 0 degrees to 45 degrees. Poisson's ratio of
   stretched copper and cobalt nanotubes becomes negative at certain chiral
   angles. A relationship is determined between the uniaxial deformation of
   nanotubes and their torsion at different chiral angles (reverse
   Poynting's effect). As the chiral angle increases, Young's modulus of
   nanotubes also increases. Atomistic modeling results are shown to agree
   qualitatively well with theoretical estimates obtained in the framework
   of anisotropic elasticity, but with significant quantitative differences
   for various crystalline materials.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Epidemiologic analyses of sarcoma are limited by the
   heterogeneity and rarity of the disease. Utilizing population-based
   surveillance data enabled us to evaluate the contribution of census
   tract-level socioeconomic status (CT-SES) and race/ethnicity on sarcoma
   incidence rates.
   Methods: We utilized the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results
   program to evaluate associations between CT-SES and race/ ethnicity on
   the incidence rates of sarcoma. Incidence rate ratios and 99\%
   confidence intervals were estimated from quasi-Poisson models. All
   models were stratified by broad age groups (pediatric: <20 years, adult:
   20-65 years, older adult: 65thorn years) and adjusted for sex, age, and
   year of diagnosis. Within each age group, we conducted analyses
   stratified by somatic genome (fusion-positive and fusion-negative
   sarcomas) and for subtypes with >200 total cases. AP value less than
   0.01 was considered statistically significant.
   Results: We included 55,415 sarcoma cases in 35 sarcoma subtype-age
   group combinations. Increasing CT-SES was statistically significantly
   associated with 11 subtype-age group combinations, primarily in the
   older age group strata (8 subtypes), whereas malignant peripheral nerve
   sheath tumors in adults were associated with decreasing CT-SES. Nearly
   every sarcoma subtype-age group combination displayed racial/ethnic
   disparities in incidence that were independent of CT-SES.
   Conclusions: We found race/ethnicity to be more frequently associated
   with sarcoma incidence than CT-SES. Our findings suggest that genetic
   variation associated with ancestry may play a stronger role than
   area-level SES-related factors in the etiology of sarcoma.
   Impact: These findings provide direction for future etiologic studies of
   sarcomas.}},

Title = {{Deep learning for topology optimization of 2D metamaterials}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{196}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Data-driven models are rising as an auspicious method for the
   geometrical design of materials and structural systems. Nevertheless,
   existing data-driven models customarily address the optimization of
   structural designs rather than metamaterial designs. Metamaterials are
   emerging as promising materials exhibiting tailorable and unprecedented
   properties for a wide spectrum of applications. In this paper, we
   develop a deep learning (DL) model based on a convolutional neural
   network (CNN) that predicts optimal metamaterial designs. The developed
   DL model non-iteratively optimizes metamaterials for either maximizing
   the bulk modulus, maximizing the shear modulus, or minimizing the
   Poisson's ratio (including negative values). The data are generated by
   solving a large set of inverse homogenization boundary values problems,
   with randomly generated geometrical features from a specific
   distribution. Such s data-driven model can play a vital role in
   accelerating more computationally expensive design problems, such as
   multiscale metamaterial systems. (c) 2020 The Author(s). Published by

Title = {{The in situ stress field and microscale controlling factors in the Ordos
   Basin, central China}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROCK MECHANICS AND MINING SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{135}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{To ensure the effectiveness of fracturing treatment and improve the
   production reserves of individual wells, it is important to accurately
   predict the in situ stress distribution to prevent the collapse of
   horizontal wells. From the perspective of reservoir development, under
   similar structural environments, microscopic factors, such as reservoir
   and petrophysical characteristics, are often the key factors that affect
   reservoir fracturing differences and drilling design in different well
   areas. Therefore, we need to understand the microscopic factors that
   affect the distribution of in situ stress. Here, we have determined the
   three-dimensional distribution of in situ stress in the Ordos Basin of
   China through the finite element numerical simulation method and
   revealed the influencing factors. By establishing a reservoir
   heterogeneity model and a geomechanical heterogeneity model and with the
   finite element method, the 3D distribution of reservoir physical
   parameters and in situ stress can be predicted, and the effects of the
   reservoir physical properties, fluid properties, rock acoustic velocity
   and mechanical properties on the in situ stress can be determined. The
   clay content is found to be negatively correlated with the horizontal
   stress difference (Delta sigma) and horizontal principal stress
   difference coefficient (Kh()). Rock density, porosity, and permeability
   have little effect on Delta sigma and K-h. Fluid properties affect the
   in situ stress magnitude. If the water saturation is greater than 60\%,
   this parameter has a negative correlation with Delta sigma and K-h.
   Poisson's ratio has a weak effect on Delta sigma but a significant
   negative correlation with K-h.}},

Abstract = {{The paper presents the results of a numerical simulation of the effects
   of N-2 on the characteristics of Trichel pulses in SF6 at 0.4MPa. The
   simulation was performed in a 2D axisymmetric geometry assuming a three
   species discharge model for the applied voltage on the discharge
   electrode to be -25 kV. Three drift-diffusion equations coupled with
   Poisson's equation are considered to determine the dynamic behavior of
   Trichel pulses and the temporal and spatial distributions of charged
   species. The reduced ionization coefficient, the reduced attachment
   coefficient, the electron mobility, and the electron diffusion
   coefficient of SF6/N-2 mixtures are obtained by solving the two-term
   Boltzmann equations. The content of N-2 varies from 20\% to 80\%. The
   distribution of three charged species and the reduced electric field at
   the discharge tip are presented at different instants of time to explain
   the formation mechanism of the Trichel pulses in SF6/N-2 mixtures. The
   time-dependent current, the total number of electrons, the positive
   ions, and the negative ions as well as the reduced electric field at the
   discharge tip under different SF6/N-2 mixtures are analyzed to
   investigate the sensitivities of these properties to the N-2 content.}},

Journal = {{SCIENCE ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{6}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Mechanical metamaterials offer exotic properties based on local control
   of cell geometry and their global configuration into structures and
   mechanisms. Historically, these have been made as continuous, monolithic
   structures with additive manufacturing, which affords high resolution
   and throughput, but is inherently limited by process and machine
   constraints. To address this issue, we present a construction system for
   mechanical metamaterials based on discrete assembly of a finite set of
   parts, which can be spatially composed for a range of properties such as
   rigidity, compliance, chirality, and auxetic behavior. This system
   achieves desired continuum properties through design of the parts such
   that global behavior is governed by local mechanisms. We describe the
   design methodology, production process, numerical modeling, and
   experimental characterization of metamaterial behaviors. This approach
   benefits from incremental assembly, which eliminates scale limitations,
   best-practice manufacturing for reliable, low-cost part production, and
   interchangeability through a consistent assembly process across part
   types.}},

Title = {{A comparative study on ratcheting deformation between negative Poisson's
   ratio electrode and thin film electrode in Li-ion battery cyclic
   operation}},
Journal = {{MECHANICS OF MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{150}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In the charging/discharging cycle of battery, electrode may
   expand/shrink cyclically and be in an asymmetric behavior of tension and
   compression. Based on this, electrode may undergo elastic deformation
   and inelastic deformation, which can naturally result in the electrode
   ratcheting deformation and capacity fading. In this paper, a new
   analytical model is developed to study the ratcheting deformation of
   thin film electrode and negative Poisson's ratio electrode (hollow
   re-entrant honeycomb shape) in battery cyclic operation. The influence
   of concentration-dependent material properties on electrode ratcheting
   deformation is discussed in detail. By the comparison between thin film
   electrode and negative Poisson's ratio electrode, it is found that the
   stress level in negative Poisson's ratio electrode is relatively low due
   to the faster appearance of the inelastic deformation. Furthermore, the
   structure optimization of negative Poisson's ratio electrode can
   suppress the ratcheting deformation (produce less accumulated
   deformation) in battery operating cycles and increase the battery cycle
   life about 8.1\% when compared with thin film electrode. Our work shows
   that the electrode mechanical degradation is in the form of ratcheting
   deformation when subjected to cyclic loading. The developed analytical
   model of negative Poisson's ratio electrode may help for the electrode
   design and provide a theoretical way to prolong the cycle life of the
   battery.}},

Abstract = {{Research in lattice structures and its application belongs to one of the
   most emerging disciplines in development of new types of engineering
   materials. High strength-to-weight ratio, special damping capabilities
   or auxetic behaviour are just a set of properties which can be directly
   influenced during design of these materials. Due to the geometric
   complexity of these structures, additive manufacturing is usually the
   only way to manufacture such a material. Among the others, HP Multijet
   Fusion additive technology with its supportless manufacturing approach
   offers one of the most convenient methods for production of lattice
   structures. Scope of this paper is design and mechanical testing of two
   types of lattice structures, namely body centred cubic structure and
   simple cross structure. Main attention is focused on printability of
   structures with different volume ratio in connection with their
   mechanical performance under uniaxial tensile loading. With respect to
   evaluated data, the cross structure shows more stiff behaviour for the
   same volume ratio and the same orientation in the build space of the
   machine. Body centred cubic structure on the other hand offers higher
   displacement to break.}},

   driven by hydrogel}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{196}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we developed a new design and preparation method of 2D
   and 3D composite metamaterial with adjustable isotropic negative
   hydration expansion (NHE) function based on re-entrant auxetic
   honeycomb. The metamaterial is composed of composite lattice
   microstructure with hydrogel driving layer and re-entrant framework and
   prepared by multi-material 3D printer. Experimental, simulation and
   theoretical investigation were carried out to demonstrate the design
   method and NHE deformation effects of the metamaterial. It was shown
   that the effective NHE coefficient depends on the length of the driving
   layer and the straight bar connecting the lattice microstructures. In
   addition, a non-monotonic relationship was found between the bandings
   angle theta 2 and the length ratio (s/a) due to the constraint effect on
   both ends of the composite beam. Through the parameter design of the
   lattice microstructure, the NHE coefficient of can be adjusted within
   the range of 0-22.4\%. For the 3D sample, the value of the NHE
   coefficient is among the largest achieved in experiments to date. This
   work provides a practical method for obtaining 2D and 3D metamaterial
   with adjustable NHE and can be applied to the design of macro-, microand
   nano-metamaterial. (c) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd. This

Abstract = {{Auxetic structures exhibit negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) and offer
   valuable enhancement of mechanical properties. This study presents a
   combined experimental and numerical investigation of the out-of-plane
   and in-plane performances of a recently proposed auxetic structure,
   re-entrant chiral auxetic (RCA), under quasi-static uniaxial
   compression. The popular hexagonal honeycomb and re-entrant honeycomb
   were also studied as benchmarks for comparison. Specimens were
   fabricated by fused deposition modelling (FDM) process. It was found
   that printing quality depends on the size and complexity of the printed
   structures. Deformation mode, stress-strain curves and energy absorption
   of the three types of structure were studied and compared. Specific
   energy absorption per unit volume, W-nu and per unit mass, SEA, were
   calculated up to the strain at the onset of densification. Results show
   that the out-of-plane energy absorption of the proposed structure
   outperformed that of the other two benchmarks. In contrast, when
   comparing the energy-absorbing efficiency, the hexagonal honeycomb
   revealed the highest energy absorption efficiency of 65\%, compared with
   44\% and 52\% for the re-entrant and the proposed RCA structure,
   respectively. For the in-plane compression, the proposed structure
   exhibited a negative Poisson's ratio and demonstrated anisotropic
   mechanical performance. (C) 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights

Abstract = {{Two innovative re-entrant hierarchical sandwich panels constructed by
   substituting the cell walls of re-entrant honeycombs with isotropic
   regular hexagon substructure (RHH) and equilateral triangle substructure
   (RHT) are proposed in this paper, and their crashworthiness performance
   has been investigated systematically. Based on the Euler beam theory,
   the Young's moduli of units of re-entrant hierarchical sandwich panels
   are derived. A comparison between the re-entrant hierarchical sandwich
   panels and re-entrant sandwich panel has been conducted to study their
   energy absorption ability. Furthermore, the parametric analysis based on
   numerical analysis has been carried out to discuss the effects of the
   gradient, arranged orientation of hierarchical sandwich cores and the
   impact velocities. Results show that both the two proposed sandwich
   panels can greatly improve the in-plane stiffness and the energy
   absorption capacity, and the energy absorption mechanisms are discussed.
   In addition, the graded sandwich panels can effectively reduce initial
   peak force under quasi-static compression, and the configuration of
   large- medium -small (LMS) performs the best under high impact velocity.
   The cross-arranged cores can significantly improve the impact resistance
   ability of RHT sandwich panels. This work provides a new solution for
   designing lightweight sandwich structures. (C) 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS.

   Theoretical and experimental studies}},
Journal = {{AEROSPACE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{106}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic cellular structures with outstanding mechanical performance and
   unique deformation characteristics have a variety of potential
   applications in aerospace, as ultralight load-bearing structures and
   vibration isolation structures. Herein, the in-plane compression
   behaviors of hybrid honeycomb metastructures, comprised of conventional
   and auxetic honeycombs, are systematically studied by using theoretical
   calculations, experimental characterization and numerical simulations.
   The theoretical formulae of elastic modulus and ultimate strength of the
   architected metastructure are derived by establishing stress analysis
   models. Three types of hybrid honeycomb metastructures are manufactured
   by selective laser melting (SLM) with 304 stainless steel. Finite
   element analysis is performed to unveil the deformation mechanism and
   failure modes. The theoretical prediction results of elastic modulus and
   ultimate strength are consistent with simulations and experimental
   results. In addition, the influences of panel and layer numbers on the
   mechanical behavior of hybrid honeycomb metastructures are discussed in
   detail. The results reveal that a hybrid metallic honeycomb
   metastructure, with stable and superior compressive properties, can be
   obtained by combining two types of cellular cells, i.e., conventional
   and auxetic honeycombs. These results provide a baseline for further
   research and development of novel metastructure designs. (C) 2020

Title = {{Postcolonoscopy Colorectal Cancer in Sweden From 2003 to 2012: Survival,
   Tumor Characteristics, and Risk Factors}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND \& AIMS: The rate of postcolonoscopy colorectal cancer
   (PCCRC) is a measure of colonoscopy quality, but there are conflicting
   results from studies of survival times of patients with PCCRC. We
   assessed survival times of patients with PCCRC and characterized the
   microscopic and macroscopic features of postcolonoscopy colorectal
   tumors.
   METHODS: We performed a population-based cohort study using data from a
   database in Sweden, on 458,937 colonoscopies (54.0\% women) performed
   from 2003 through 2012. Rates of colorectal cancer within 3 years of a
   colonoscopy were calculated based on the World Endoscopy Organization
   guidelines. Risk factors were evaluated using Poisson regression
   analysis. We used Cox regression models and Kaplan-Meier analyses,
   stratified by sex, to assess conditional survival. Logistic regression
   models were used to evaluate features of postcolonoscopy colorectal
   tumors, including stage location (right, left, or rectum)
   differentiation grade (high or low), synchronous tumors, perineural
   growth, resection margins, and mucinous and vessel characteristics.
   RESULTS: Within 36 months after a colonoscopy, there were 19,184
   individuals who had received a diagnosis of CRC; 1384 of these were
   PCCRCs (7.2\%). The proportion of individuals with PCCRC decreased from
   9.4\% in 2003 to 6.1\% in 2012. The largest risk factors for PCCRC were
   a prior diagnosis of CRC (relative risk {[}RR], 3.31; 95\% CI,
   2.71-4.04), ulcerative colitis (RR, 5.44; 95\% CI, 4.75-6.23), Crohn's
   disease (RR, 3.81; 95\% CI, 2.98-4.87), and prior polypectomy (RR, 2.32;
   95\% CI, 1.97-2.72). Individuals with PCCRCs had shorter survival times
   than individuals with CRCs detected during the index colonoscopy.
   Multivariate hazard ratios for PCCRC were 2.75 for men (95\% CI,
   2.21-3.42) and 2.00 for women (95\% CI, 1.59-2.52), respectively.
   Individuals with left-side PCCRC had shorter survival times than
   patients with CRC detected during the index colonoscopy. Postcolonoscopy
   colorectal tumors had increased odds of low differentiation grade (odds
   ratio, 1.27; 95\% CI, 1.09-1.49) compared with colorectal tumors
   detected during the index colonoscopy.
   CONCLUSIONS: In an analysis of colonoscopies in Sweden, the rate of
   PCCRCs decreased from 9.4\% in 2003 to 6.1\% in 2012. Diseases that
   require surveillance (such as prior colorectal neoplasms and
   inflammatory bowel diseases) are the largest risk factors for PCCRC.
   Patients with PCCRC have shorter survival times than patients with CRC
   detected during their initial colonoscopy-especially women and patients
   with left-side tumors.}},

   implementation for finite element analysis}},
Journal = {{COMPUTER METHODS IN APPLIED MECHANICS AND ENGINEERING}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials, which have negative Poisson's ratio, show potential
   to be used in many interesting applications. Finite element analysis
   (FEA) is an important phase in implementing auxetic materials, but may
   become computationally expensive because simulation often needs
   microscale details and a fine mesh. It is also necessary to check that
   topological aspects of the microscale reflects not only micro but
   macromechanical behavior. This work presents a phenomenological approach
   to the problem using data-driven spline-based techniques to properly
   characterize orthotropic auxetic material requiring neither analytical
   constraints nor micromechanics, expanding on previous methods for
   isotropic materials. Hyperelastic energies of auxetic orthotropic
   material are determined from experimental data by solving the
   equilibrium differential functional equations directly, so no fitting or
   analytical estimation is necessary. This offers two advantages; (i) it
   allows the FEA study of orthotropic auxetic materials without requiring
   micromechanics considerations, reducing modeling and computational time
   costs by two to three orders of magnitude; (ii) it adapts the
   hyperelastic energies to the nature of the material with precision,
   which could be critical in scenarios where accuracy is essential (e.g.
   robotic surgery). (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, it is shown experimentally for the first time that chiral
   mechanical metamaterials can induce their own global rotational motion,
   i.e. the rotation of the entire system with respect to its centre of
   mass, without any external forces acting on it. To better understand
   this effect, which is very different from other types of deformations
   studied in the literature and offers an insight into what aspects of
   dynamic behaviour of mechanical metamaterials are yet to be discovered,
   a number of different prototypes of chiral systems are analysed where it
   is shown what type of a design allows to maximise the extent of the
   exhibited rotation. In addition to this, the theoretical model
   corresponding to computer simulations utilising the Molecular Dynamics
   approach is proposed and used to establish the hypothetical limit of the
   considered phenomenon. It is also discussed what are the parameters that
   can be used in order to fine-tune the extent of the global rotation
   exhibited by chiral systems. Finally, it is discussed that the concept
   studied in this work can be used in numerous applications such as
   satellites, spacecraft, telescopes employed in space as well as novel
   robotics to control their global rotational motion.}},

Abstract = {{Protein structure is an important field of research, with particular
   significance in its potential applications in biomedicine and
   nanotechnology. In a recent study, we presented a general approach for
   comparing protein structures and origami models and demonstrated it with
   single-domain proteins. For example, the analysis of the a-helical
   barrel of the outer membrane protein A (OmpA) suggests that there are
   similar patterns between its structure and the Kresling origami model,
   providing insight into structure-activity relationships. Here we
   demonstrate that our approach can be expanded beyond single-domain
   proteins to also include multi-domain proteins, and to study dynamic
   processes of biomolecules. Two examples are given: (1) The eukaryotic
   chaperonin (TRiC) protein is compared with a newly generated origami
   model, and with an origami model that is constructed from two copies of
   the Flasher origami model, and (2) the CorA Magnesium transport system
   is compared with a newly generated origami model and with an origami
   model that combines the Kresling and Flasher origami models. Based on
   the analysis of the analog origami models, it is indicated that it is
   possible to identify building blocks for constructing assembled origami
   models that are analogous to protein structures. In addition, it is
   identified that the expansion/collapse mechanisms of the TRiC and CorA
   are auxetic. Namely, these proteins require a single motion for
   synchronized folding along two or three axes.}},

Abstract = {{Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is currently a global pandemic that
   affects patients with other pathologies. Here, we investigated the
   influence of treatments for osteoporosis and other non-inflammatory
   rheumatic conditions, such as osteoarthritis and fibromyalgia, on
   COVID-19 incidence. To this end, we conducted a cross-sectional study of
   2,102 patients being treated at the Rheumatology Service of Hospital del
   Mar (Barcelona, Spain). In our cohort, COVID-19 cumulative incidence
   from March 1 to May 3, 2020 was compared to population estimates for the
   same city. We used Poisson regression models to determine the adjusted
   relative risk ratios for COVID-19 associated with different treatments
   and comorbidities. Denosumab, zoledronate and calcium were negatively
   associated with COVID-19 incidence. Some analgesics, particularly
   pregabalin and most of the studied antidepressants, were positively
   associated with COVID-19 incidence, whereas duloxetine presented a
   negative association. Oral bisphosphonates, vitamin D, thiazide
   diuretics, anti-hypertensive drugs and chronic nonsteroidal
   anti-inflammatory drugs had no effect on COVID-19 incidence in the
   studied population. Our results provide novel evidence to support the
   maintenance of the main anti-osteoporosis treatments in COVID-19
   patients, which may be of particular relevance to elderly patients
   affected by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.}},

Abstract = {{Delicate metal parts with superior electrical, mechanical, and thermal
   properties have attracted a lot of interest, but it is yet challenging
   to fabricate. Herein, a strategy of making complex metallic structures
   is developed in this research through integrating a bioinspired
   catechol-based initiator, dopamine, as an example, into the
   three-dimensional (3D) printing process followed by the assistance of
   surface modification. The wealthy catechol groups growing on the polymer
   enable the metal coating with a high adhesion stability. A series of
   complex metallic structures were fabricated, such as Ni-Co, Cu, and Ni
   Eiffel towers, Ag micro-stretching-dominated architecture, and Au
   auxetic structure. The introduced metal coating enables the 3D-printed
   objects with multiple classes of functionalities, such as magnetism or
   high conductivity. In particular, this method allows in situ repairing
   of the damaged metallic structures, which not only prolongs the lifespan
   of products but also solves the long-lasting challenge of repairing 3D
   printing parts. The detailed fabrication and repairing processes of
   functional metallic parts are presented and discussed. The proposed
   strategy has great potential in practical applications related to
   electronics, energy storage, healthcare, and so on.}},

Month = {{OCT 27}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic foams continue to interest researchers owing to their unique and
   enhanced properties. Existing studies attest to the importance of
   fabrication mechanisms and parameters. However, disparity in
   thermo-mechanical parameters has left much debate as to which factors
   dominate fabrication output quality. This paper provides experimental,
   computational, and statistical insights into the mechanisms that enable
   auxetic foams to be produced, using key parameters reported within the
   literature: porosity; heating time; and volumetric compression ratio. To
   advance the considerations on manufacturing parameter dominance, both
   study design and scale have been optimised to enable statistical
   inferences to be drawn. Whilst being unusual for a manufacturing domain,
   such additional analysis provides more conclusive evidence of auxetic
   properties and highlights the supremacy of volumetric compression ratio
   in predicting Poisson's ratio outcomes in the manufacture process.
   Furthermore statistical results are exploited to formulate key
   recommendations for those wishing to maximise/optimise auxetic foam
   production.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundMalaria infection during pregnancy has negative health
   consequences for both mothers and offspring. Sub-microscopic malaria
   infection during pregnancy is common in most African countries. We
   sought to identify factors associated with sub-microscopic placental
   malaria, and its association with adverse pregnancy outcomes among
   HIV-negative pregnant women in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.MethodsWe
   recruited a cohort of pregnant women during their first trimester and
   assessed for the occurrence of placental malaria and pregnancy outcomes.
   The follow-up was done monthly from recruitment until delivery.
   Histopathology placental malaria positive results were defined as the
   presence of malaria pigment or parasitized erythrocytes on the slide
   (histology-positive (HP)), and the sub-microscopic placental infection
   was defined as positive Plasmodium falciparum DNA by polymerase chain
   reaction (DNA PCR) amplification in a negative histopathology test.
   Adverse pregnancy outcomes investigated included low birth weight (birth
   weight below 2.5kg), prematurity (live birth below 37weeks), and
   small-for-gestational-age (SGA) (live born with a birth weight below
   10th percentile for gestational age and sex). Weighted baseline category
   logit, log-binomial, and log-Poisson models were used to assess factors
   associated with placental malaria, and its association with adverse
   pregnancy outcomes.ResultsAmong 1115 women who had histopathology and
   DNA PCR performed, 93 (8\%) had HP placental infection, and 136 (12\%)
   had the sub-microscopic placental infection. The risk of sub-microscopic
   placental malaria was greater in women who did not use mosquito
   prevention methods such as bed nets, fumigation, or mosquito coils (odds
   ratio (OR)=1.75; 95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.05-2.92; P=0.03) and
   in women who were anemic (OR=1.59; 95\% CI: 1.20-2.11; P=0.001). Women
   who were underweight had reduced odds of sub-microscopic placental
   malaria infection (OR=0.33; 95\% CI: 0.17-0.62; P=0.001). Women who were
   overweight/obese had 1.48 times higher the odds of HP placental malaria
   compared to normal weight (OR=1.48; 95\% CI: 1.03-2.11; P=0.03). HP
   placental malaria infection was associated with an increased risk of SGA
   births (RR=1.30, 95\% CI: 0.98-1.72, P=0.07). In contrast, the
   sub-microscopic infection was associated with a reduced risk of SGA
   births (RR=0.61, 95\% CI: 0.43-0.88, P=0.01). Placental malaria was not
   associated with low birth weight or prematurity.ConclusionMalaria
   prevention methods and maternal nutrition status during early pregnancy
   were important predictors of sub-microscopic placental malaria. More
   research is needed to understand sub-microscopic placental malaria and
   the possible mechanisms mediating the association between placental
   malaria and SGA.}},

Title = {{Axisymmetric analysis of auxetic composite cylindrical shells with
   honeycomb core layer and variable thickness subjected to combined axial
   and non-uniform radial pressures}},
Journal = {{MECHANICS OF ADVANCED MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Abstract = {{An analytical method is proposed to determine the displacements of a
   composite cylindrical shell with auxetic honeycomb core layer and
   variable thickness under combined axial, internal, and external
   pressures. The thickness and pressure profiles can be arbitrary
   continuous functions. The displacements are defined in the framework of
   the first-order shear deformation theory. The composite shell consists
   of three layers, in which the inner and outer layers are isotropic and
   the core layer is made of an auxetic honeycomb material. The
   constitutive equations obey the Hooke law. The equilibrium equations
   which are a system of coupled differential equations with variable
   coefficients are extracted by employing the virtual work principle, and
   they are solved using the matched asymptotic expansion method of the
   perturbation technique. The effects of different parameters such as the
   geometry, honeycomb structure parameters, different load profiles, and
   the thicknesses on the results are studied. The results are compared
   with the finite element method and some other references.}},

Abstract = {{Breast cancer incidence is increasing among Asian Indian and Pakistani
   women living in the United States. We examined the characteristics of
   breast cancer in Asian Indian and Pakistani American (AIPA) and
   non-Hispanic white (NHW) women using data from the surveillance,
   epidemiology and end results (SEER) program. Breast cancer incidence
   rates were estimated via segmented Poisson regression using data between
   1990 and 2014 from SEER 9 registries, including New Jersey and
   California. Disease characteristics, treatment and survival information
   between 2000 and 2016 for 4900 AIPA and 482 250 NHW cases diagnosed
   after age 18 were obtained from SEER 18 registries and compared using
   descriptive analyses and multivariable competing risk proportional
   hazards regression. Breast cancer incidence was lower in AIPA than NHW
   women, increased with age and the rate of increase declined after age of
   46 years. AIPA women were diagnosed at significantly younger age (mean
   (SD) = 54.5 (13.3) years) than NHW women (mean (SD) = 62 (14) years, P <
   .0001) and were more likely than NHW cases (P < .0001) to have regional
   or distant stage, higher grade, estrogen receptor-negative, progesterone
   receptor-negative, triple-negative or human epidermal growth factor
   receptor 2-enriched tumors, subcutaneous or total mastectomy, and lower
   cumulative incidence of death due to breast cancer (hazard ratio = 0.79,
   95\% CI: 0.72-0.86, P < .0001). AIPA had shorter median follow-up (52
   months) than NHW cases (77 months). Breast cancer in AIPA women has
   unique characteristics that need to be further studied along with a
   comprehensive evaluation of their follow-up patterns.}},

Abstract = {{So far, negative Poisson's ratio foam (auxetic foam) is usually prepared
   by the transformation of conventional polymer foam, and it is a
   challenge to prepare auxetic foam directly from polymer resin. In this
   work, a novel method based on the synergism between the phase transition
   of water and the permeability rate difference of the CO2 blowing agent
   from air in the foaming process is put forward to prepare auxetic foam
   directly from the polymer resin. Using this method, herein, nylon
   elastomer (NE) foam with auxetic behavior is successfully prepared from
   NE resin by a one-pot CO2 foaming method inside an autoclave aided by
   water; the obtained auxetic foam has a Poisson's ratio value of -1.29
   and has excellent tensile cycle stability and energy absorption
   performance. This method breaks through the bottleneck for preparing
   auxetic foams from the polymer resin directly, which is also green and
   environment-friendly. It is believed that the abovementioned method also
   applies to other thermoplastic polymers, which paves a way for designing
   and preparing multifunctional auxetic foam materials in the future via a
   one-pot CO2 foaming process. Furthermore, this work first demonstrates
   that the transformation between auxetic foam and positive Poisson's
   ratio foam is reversible due to the closed cell structure, which
   provides an opportunity to reversibly adjust the performance and the
   shape of polymer foam materials.}},

Title = {{Rapid Fabrication of Sterile Medical Nasopharyngeal Swabs by
   Stereolithography for Widespread Testing in a Pandemic}},
Journal = {{ADVANCED ENGINEERING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{22}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The 3D printing of nasopharyngeal swabs during the COVID-19 pandemic
   presents a central case of how to efficiently address a break in the
   global supply chain of medical equipment. Herein a comprehensive study
   of swab design considerations for mass production by stereolithography
   is presented. The retention and comfort performance of a range of novel
   designs of 3D-printed swabs are compared with the standard flocked-head
   swab used in clinical environments. Sample retention of the 3D swab is
   governed by the volume, porosity density, and void fraction of the head
   as well as by the pore geometry. 3D-printed swabs outperform
   conventional flock-head swabs in terms of sample retention. It is argued
   that mechanically functional designs of the swab head, such as
   corkscrew-shaped heads and negative Poisson ratio heads, maximize sample
   retention and improve patient comfort. In addition, available designs of
   swab shafts for an optimized sample collection procedure are
   characterized. The study is conducted in vitro, using artificial mucus,
   covering the full range of human mucus viscosities in a 3D-printed model
   of a nasal cavity. The work sets the path for the resilient supply of
   widespread sterile testing equipment as a rapid response to the current
   and future pandemics.}},

Abstract = {{Northern Italy has been the first European area affected by the COVID-19
   pandemic and related social restrictive measures. We sought to evaluate
   the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on PICU admissions in Northern
   Italy, using data from the Italian Network of Pediatric Intensive Care
   Units Registry. We included all patients admitted to 4 PICUs from
   8-weeks-before to 8-weeks-after February 24(th), 2020, and those
   admitted in the same period in 2019. Incidence rate ratios (IRR)
   evaluating incidence rate differences between pre- and post-COVID-19
   periods in 2020 (IRR-1), as well as between the post-COVID-19-period
   with the same period in 2019 (IRR-2), were computed using zero-inflated
   negative binomial or Poisson regression modeling. A total of 1001
   admissions were included. The number of PICU admissions significantly
   decreased during the COVID-19 outbreak compared to pre-COVID-19 and
   compared to the same period in 2020 (IRR-1 0.63 {[}95\%CI 0.50-0.79];
   IRR-2 0.70 {[}CI 0.57-0.91]). Unplanned and medical admissions
   significantly decreased (IRR-1 0.60 {[}CI 0.46-0.70]; IRR-2 0.67 {[}CI
   0.51-0.89]; and IRR-1 0.52, {[}CI 0.40-0.67]; IRR-2 0.77 {[}CI
   0.58-1.00], respectively). Intra-hospital, planned (potentially delayed
   by at least 12 h), and surgical admissions did not significantly change.
   Patients admitted for respiratory failure significantly decreased (IRR-1
   0.55 {[}CI 0.37-0.77]; IRR-2 0.48 {[}CI 0.33-0.69]). Conclusions:
   Unplanned and medical PICU admissions significantly decreased during
   COVID-19 outbreak, especially those for respiratory failure. What is
   Known: center dot Northern Italy has been the first European area
   affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. center dot Although children are
   relatively spared from the severe COVID-19 disease, the pediatric care
   system has been affected by social restrictive measures, with a reported
   73-88\% reduction in pediatric emergency department admissions. What is
   New: center dot Unplanned and medical PICU admissions significantly
   decreased during the COVID-19 outbreak compared to pre-COVID-19 and to
   the same period in 2019, especially those for respiratory failure.
   Further studies are needed to identify associated factors and new

Abstract = {{Background/Aims The literature is scarce on the association between
   traumatic dental injuries (TDI) and oral health-related quality of life
   (OHRQoL) among adolescents, and there is no study assessing this
   relationship using clinical criteria for the assessment of TDI in this
   age group. The aim of this study was to assess the association between
   TDI and OHRQoL among 15 to 19yearold adolescents from Santa Maria,
   Brazil. Materials and Methods A population-based cross-sectional study
   was conducted including a representative sample of 1197 15 to 19yearold
   adolescents attending 31 public and private schools. The Oral Health
   Impact Profile-14 (OHIP-14) was used to evaluate the OHRQoL, and
   clinical examinations were performed to diagnose TDI based on the
   O'Brien classification. Demographic information, socioeconomic status,
   and clinical characteristics (caries experience, malocclusion, and
   gingivitis) were also collected as adjusting variables. Multilevel
   Poisson regression models were used to assess the association between
   TDI and OHRQoL. Rate ratios (RR) and 95\% confidence intervals (95\% CI)
   were estimated. Results The overall prevalence of TDI was 17\%, mild
   trauma was 12\%, and severe trauma was 5\%. In the adjusted models,
   adolescents with TDI had poorer OHRQoL than those without TDI (RR =
   1.10; 95\% CI = 1.05-1.16). This negative effect was related to the
   psychological disability domain (RR = 1.16; 95\% CI = 1.02-1.32), to the
   social disability domain (RR = 1.34; 95\% CI = 1.13-1.59), and to the
   handicap domain (RR = 1.35; 95\% CI = 1.10-1.66). Conclusions Despite
   its low severity, TDI negatively affected the OHRQoL of 15 to 19yearold
   adolescents from Santa Maria, Brazil.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we report a new multi-scale NPR composite based on
   auxetic fabric/elastomer matrix (AF/EM) composite structure. The
   multi-scale AF was obtained via using helical auxetic yarn (HAY) as weft
   yarns and constructing re-entrant hexagonal (REH) geometry structure on
   the macro scale, then the AF was combined with EM to fabricate the
   auxetic composite (AC). The AF and AC exhibit the NPR of - 1.492 and -
   0.379. Simultaneously, high tensile strain over 108\% (AF) and 82\% (AC)
   can be subjected, indicating good mechanical performance. The superior
   performance of the AC is its ability to maintain NPR and resilience,
   with elastic recovery ratio over 94\% and work recovery coefficient with
   a stable value over 80\% after 10 cycles. Also, the damping properties
   results further evidence the good elasticity of our AC. The paper shows
   that our AF and AC are promising candidates in protective composites.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic two-dimensional (2D) materials provide a promising platform for
   biomedicine, sensors, and many other applications at the nanoscale. In
   this work, utilizing a hypothesis-based data-driven approache, we
   identify multiple materials with remarkable in-plane auxetic behavior in
   a family of buckled monolayer 2D materials. These materials are
   transition metal selenides and transition metal halides with the
   stoichiometry MX (M = V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Cu, Zn, Ag, and X = Se, Cl, Br,
   I). First-principles calculations reveal that the desirable auxetic
   behavior of these 2D compounds originates from the interplay between the
   buckled 2D structure and the weak metal-metal interaction determined by
   their electronic structures. We observe that the Poisson's ratio is
   sensitive to magnetic order and the amount of uniaxial stress applied. A
   transition from positive Poisson's ratio (PPR) to negative Poisson's
   ratio (NPR) for a subgroup of MX compounds under large uniaxial stress
   is predicted. The work provides a guideline for the future design of 2D
   auxetic materials at the nanoscale.}},

Title = {{Association between meteorological indicators and COVID-19 pandemic in
   Pakistan}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH}},
Abstract = {{This study was designed to investigate the impact of meteorological
   indicators (temperature, rainfall, and humidity) on total COVID-19 cases
   in Pakistan, its provinces, and administrative units from March 10,
   2020, to August 25, 2020. The correlation analysis showed that COVID-19
   cases and temperature showed a positive correlation. It implies that the
   increase in COVID-19 cases was reported due to an increase in the
   temperature in Pakistan, its provinces, and administrative units. The
   generalized Poisson regression showed that the rise in the expected log
   count of COVID-19 cases was 0.024 times for a 1 degrees C rise in the
   average temperature in Pakistan. Second, the correlation between
   rainfall and COVID-19 cases was negative in Pakistan. However, the
   regression coefficient between the expected log count of COVID-19 cases
   and rainfall was insignificant in Pakistan. Third, the correlation
   between humidity and the total COVID-19 cases was negative, which
   implies that the increase in humidity is beneficial to stop the
   transmission of COVID-19 in Pakistan, its provinces, and administrative
   units. The reduction in the expected log count of COVID-19 cases was
   0.008 times for a 1\% increase in the humidity per day in Pakistan.
   However, humidity and COVID-19 cases were positively correlated in Sindh
   province. It is required to create awareness among the general
   population, and the government should include the causes, symptoms, and
   precautions in the educational syllabus. Moreover, people should adopt
   the habit of hand wash, social distancing, personal hygiene,
   mask-wearing, and the use of hand sanitizers to control the COVID-19.}},

   also used for the calculation of the values of the electrical parameters
   of the resonant shunt circuit, with objective the maximization of
   certain band gaps. The results indicate that the proposed technique can
   be used for the maximization of band gaps at certain frequency ranges,
   as well as at frequency bands which have not been considered in the

Title = {{A new anisotropic soft tissue model for elimination of unphysical
   auxetic behaviour}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOMECHANICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{111}},
Month = {{OCT 9}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic behaviour, the unphysical transverse expansion during uniaxial
   tension, is a common and undesirable feature of classical anisotropic
   hyperelastic constitutive models for soft tissue. In this study we
   uncover the underlying mechanism of such behaviour; high levels of
   in-plane compaction occurs due to increasing tension in
   strain-stiffening fibres, leading to unphysical out-of-plane expansion.
   We demonstrate that auxetic behaviour is primarily influenced by the
   ratio of fibre to matrix stiffness, and is accentuated by
   strain-stiffening fibres in a constant stiffness matrix (e.g., the
   widely used neo-Hookean matrix with exponentially stiffening fibres). We
   propose a new bilinear strain stiffening fibre and matrix (BLFM) model
   which allows close control of the fibre-matrix stiffness ratio, thereby
   robustly eliminating auxetic behaviour. We demonstrate that our model
   provides accurate prediction of experimentally observed outof-plane
   compaction, in addition to stress-stretch anisotropy, for arterial
   tissue subjected to uniaxial tension testing. (C) 2020 Published by

Title = {{Negative area compressibility in silver oxalate}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{56}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{269-277}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The presence of extremely large negative linear compressibilities (NLC)
   in crystalline silver oxalate was discovered in a recent work by using
   first principles solid-state calculations. Although the minimum value of
   the NLC was found for a negative applied hydrostatic pressure, in this
   work the presence of NLC in this material for positive applied pressures
   is verified experimentally by means of high-pressure X-ray diffraction
   experiments performed at room temperature in the Beijing synchrotron
   radiation facility. The results of this study demonstrate with certainty
   that the compressibility of silver oxalate along {[}010]
   crystallographic direction is negative for applied pressures in the
   range from 0.0 to 0.85 GPa. Since the measured compressibility decreases
   largely as the pressure decreases, large negative values of the
   compressibility are expected for negative applied pressures in agreement
   with the results found using first principles methods. Furthermore, the
   analysis of the variation of the lattice parameters of the crystal
   structure of silver oxalate under pressure in the principal axes
   reference system revealed that this material also exhibits the largest
   negative area compressibility phenomenon found so far at zero pressure,
   the values of the compressibilities along two of the principal axes
   being - 16.7 and - 20.0 TPa-1. The negative compressibility phenomenon
   in silver oxalate can be rationalized in terms of a ``chains of rotating
   parallelograms'' structural model.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, chiral metamaterials (CMM) were optimized from conceptual
   design to fine design with the effective elastic constants unchanged
   under finite strain. First, through calculation and comparison of
   examples, the unit cell method was selected to compute the effective
   elastic properties of the periodic chiral metamaterials under finite
   strain. Secondly, the conceptual design of chiral metamaterials with
   prescribed Poisson's ratios under finite strain was realized through
   density-based and feature-driven topology optimization. Then, the method
   of moving asymptotes (MMA) was used to solve the optimization problems.
   Based on the optimal configuration, chiral metamaterials with prescribed
   Poisson's ratios and Young's moduli under finite strain were carefully
   designed through shape optimization. Genetic algorithm was used to solve
   the optimization problem. Finally, the optimal models were fabricated by
   3D printing. The optimal design was validated by tensile test results,
   i.e., the designed chiral metamaterials can maintain effective elastic
   properties under large deformation, and the invariance of the effective
   elastic properties depends on the nonlinearity of the flexible chiral
   metamaterials.}},

   Different random colored noises are applied as the system excitation.
   First, a parametric study is performed; and some interesting results are
   observed from investigating the effects of geometric parameters,

   the structure. These parameters affect the natural frequencies, level of
   radiated sound, and mass of the structure. An optimization algorithm is
   applied to the geometrical parameters in order to simultaneously reduce
   the level of radiated sound and preserve the amount of total mass. By
   the use of the Genetic Algorithm (GA), we could achieve a remarkable

Title = {{Impact of providing free HIV self-testing kits on frequency of testing
   among men who have sex with men and their sexual partners in China: A
   randomized controlled trial}},
Journal = {{PLOS MEDICINE}},

Abstract = {{Background
   The HIV epidemic is rapidly growing among men who have sex with men
   (MSM) in China, yet HIV testing remains suboptimal. We aimed to
   determine the impact of HIV self-testing (HIVST) interventions on
   frequency of HIV testing among Chinese MSM and their sexual partners.
   Methods and findings
   This randomized controlled trial was conducted in 4 cities in Hunan
   Province, China. Sexually active and HIV-negative MSM were recruited
   from communities and randomly assigned (1:1) to intervention or control
   arms. Participants in the control arm had access to site-based HIV
   testing (SBHT); those in the intervention arm were provided with 2 free
   finger-prick-based HIVST kits at enrollment and could receive 2 to 4
   kits delivered through express mail every 3 months for 1 year in
   addition to SBHT. They were encouraged to distribute HIVST kits to their
   sexual partners. The primary outcome was the number of HIV tests taken
   by MSM participants, and the secondary outcome was the number of HIV
   tests taken by their sexual partners during 12 months of follow-up. The
   effect size for the primary and secondary outcomes was evaluated as the
   standardized mean difference (SMD) in testing frequency between
   intervention and control arms.
   Between April 14, 2018, and June 30, 2018, 230 MSM were recruited. Mean
   age was 29 years; 77\% attended college; 75\% were single. The analysis
   population who completed at least one follow-up questionnaire included
   110 (93\%, 110/118) in the intervention and 106 (95\%, 106/112) in the
   control arm. The average frequency of HIV tests per participant in the
   intervention arm (3.75) was higher than that in the control arm (1.80;
   SMD 1.26; 95\% CI 0.97-1.55; P< 0.001). This difference was mainly due
   to the difference in HIVST between the 2 arms (intervention 2.18 versus
   control 0.41; SMD 1.30; 95\% CI 1.01-1.59; P< 0.001), whereas the
   average frequency of SBHT was comparable (1.57 versus 1.40, SMD 0.14;
   95\% CI -0.13 to 0.40; P = 0.519). The average frequency of HIV tests
   among sexual partners of each participant was higher in intervention
   than control arm (2.65 versus 1.31; SMD 0.64; 95\% CI 0.36-0.92; P<
   0.001), and this difference was also due to the difference in HIVST
   between the 2 arms (intervention 1.41 versus control 0.36; SMD 0.75;
   95\% CI 0.47-1.04;P< 0.001) but not SBHT (1.24 versus 0.96; SMD 0.23;
   95\% CI -0.05 to 0.50;P= 0.055). Zero-inflated Poisson regression
   analyses showed that the likelihood of taking HIV testing among
   intervention participants were 2.1 times greater than that of control
   participants (adjusted rate ratio {[}RR] 2.10; 95\% CI 1.75-2.53,P<
   0.001), and their sexual partners were 1.55 times more likely to take
   HIV tests in the intervention arm compared with the control arm (1.55,
   1.23-1.95,P< 0.001). During the study period, 3 participants in the
   intervention arm and none in the control arm tested HIV positive, and 8
   sexual partners of intervention arm participants also tested positive.
   No other adverse events were reported. Limitations in this study
   included the data on number of SBHT were solely based on self-report by
   the participants, but self-reported number of HIVST in the intervention
   arm was validated; the number of partner HIV testing was indirectly
   reported by participants because of difficulties in accessing each of
   their partners.
   Conclusions
   In this study, we found that providing free HIVST kits significantly
   increased testing frequency among Chinese MSM and effectively enlarged
   HIV testing coverage by enhancing partner HIV testing through
   distribution of kits within their sexual networks.}},

Abstract = {{Background Self-reports of medical findings are indispensable in
   clinical practice and research but subject to recall bias. We analysed
   the recall accuracy of notifications about incidental findings (IFs)
   from a whole-body MRI examination and assessed determinants of recall
   error.
   Methods Data from 3746 participants of a postal follow-up survey
   conducted on average 2.47 years after examination in the
   population-based Study of Health in Pomerania were analysed. Among
   those, 2185 (58.3\%) underwent whole-body MRI at baseline, and findings
   of potential clinical relevance were disclosed in standardised postal
   letters. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and
   negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated to determine the
   accuracy of self-reports. Poisson regression analysis was conducted to
   analyse predictors for false-positive and false-negative recall.
   Results An IF was disclosed to 622 (28.5\%) individuals; 81.5\% had
   tumour relevance. The overall sensitivity and PPV of participants'
   self-reports were 80\% and 60\%, respectively. PPvs were higher among
   women, better educated and married participants and among those with
   good verbal memory. Among MRI participants, lower educational level was
   associated with a higher risk of false-positive recall (risk ratio (RR)
   1.44, 95\% CI 1.01 to 2.03), while increasing age was associated with a
   higher risk of false-negative recall (RR 1.64, 95\% CI 1.33 to 2.01).
   Conclusions Most participants correctly recalled disclosed IFs. However,
   the probability of an event in case of a positive recall is barely above
   50\%. Therefore, relying on subjects' recall of disclosed IFs will lead
   to a relevant proportion of errors. Clinicians and researchers should be
   aware of this problem and of participants' characteristics which may
   moderate the probability of correct decisions based on recalled
   findings.}},

Title = {{Effects of Doped Elements (Si, Cr, W and Nb) on the Stability,

   First-Principles Calculation}},

Abstract = {{First-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT)
   have been performed to explore the effects of Si, Cr, W, and Nb elements
   on the stability, mechanical properties, and electronic structures of
   MoAlB ternary boride. The five crystals, with the formulas of Mo4Al4B4,
   Mo4Al3SiB4, Mo3CrAl4B4, Mo3WAl4B4, and Mo3NbAl4B4, have been
   respectively established. All the calculated crystals are
   thermodynamically stable, according to the negative cohesive energy and
   formation enthalpy. By the calculation of elastic constants, the
   mechanical moduli and ductility evolutions of MoAlB with elemental
   doping can be further estimated, with the aid of B/G and Poisson's
   ratios. Si and W doping cannot only enhance the Young's modulus of
   MoAlB, but also improve the ductility to some degree. Simultaneously,
   the elastic moduli of MoAlB are supposed to become more isotropic after
   Si and W addition. However, Cr and Nb doping plays a negative role in
   ameliorating the mechanical properties. Through the analysis of
   electronic structures and chemical bonding, the evolutions of chemical
   bondings can be disclosed with the addition of dopant. The enhancement
   of B-B, Al/Si-B, and Al/Si-Mo bondings takes place after Si
   substitution, and W addition apparently intensifies the bonding with B
   and Al. In this case, the strengthening of chemical bonding after Si and
   W doping exactly accounts for the improvement of mechanical properties
   of MoAlB. Additionally, Si doping can also improve the Debye temperature
   and melting point of the MoAlB crystal. Overall, Si element is predicted
   to be the optimized dopant to ameliorate the mechanical properties of
   MoAlB.}},

Abstract = {{Studies on the application of auxetic metamaterials and structures in
   furniture joints are very limited. However, they have huge potential for
   use in ready-to-assemble furniture. This study aimed to design and

   experimentally and numerically analyze the withdrawal strength of these
   dowels. In the scope of the study, 24 auxetic dowels with different
   types and size of inclusions, different diameter of holes, and a
   non-auxetic reference dowel were designed and produced with appropriate
   muffs. Dowels were 3D printed from polyamide (PA12). Poisson's ratios,
   withdrawal strength, contact pressures, and friction coefficients of
   dowels were determined theoretically by means of numerical analyses and
   real static compression tests. After the pre-production of dowels, the
   dowels with triangular inclusions have not been found to have sufficient
   strength and stiffness. Withdrawal strength of dowels decreased as the
   size of inclusions is decreased, or dowel hole diameter is increased.
   Furthermore, contact pressures and stresses in auxetic dowels were
   considerably lower than non-auxetic dowels under the withdrawal force.}},

Title = {{Effects of Long-Term Selection in the Border Collie Dog Breed:
   Inbreeding Purge of Canine Hip and Elbow Dysplasia}},
Journal = {{ANIMALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Simple Summary
   For dog breeders, health is one of the main criteria when choosing a
   breeding animal; thus, selection for good anatomy is the key to reduce
   orthopedic disorders. In many dog breeds, radiographic screening for
   canine hip and elbow dysplasia is a compulsory test for breeding;
   however, these multifactorial traits are determined by genetic and
   environmental factors. Therefore, it is extremely difficult to eliminate
   these disorders from the population. In natural selection, such traits
   can be ``purged{''} out of the population with inbreeding. The study
   aimed to examine the inbreeding-purge of canine hip and elbow dysplasia
   in the border collie breed. The main conclusion was that
   over-representation of homozygous individuals may have a positive effect
   on hip and elbow conformation.
   Pedigree data of 13,339 border collie dog was collected along with
   canine hip dysplasia (CHD) and canine elbow dysplasia (CED) records
   (1352 CHD and 524 CED), and an inbreeding-purging (IP) model was
   created. Ancestral inbreeding coefficients were calculated by using a
   gene dropping simulation method with GRain 2.2 software. Cumulative
   logit models (CLM) for CHD and CED were fitted using a logit-link
   Poisson distribution and the classical (F\_(W)), and ancestral
   inbreeding (F\_(BAL), F\_(KAL), and F\_(KAL\_NEW)) coefficients as
   linear regression coefficients. The effective population size was
   calculated from F\_(W) and decreased in the examined period along with
   an increase of F\_(W); however, slight differences were found as a
   consequence of breeding dog imports. CHD values were lowered by the
   expansion of F\_(BAL), as the alleles had been inbred in the past. For
   CHD, signs of purging were obtained. There was a positive trend
   regarding the breeding activity (both sire and dam of the future litters
   should be screened and certified free from CHD and CED), as years of
   selection increased the frequency of alleles with favorable hip and
   elbow conformation. Division of the ancestral inbreeding coefficient
   showed that alleles that had been identical by descent (IBD) for the
   first time (F\_(KAL\_NEW)) had a negative effect on both traits, while
   F\_(KAL) has shown favorable results for alleles IBD in past
   generations. Some authors had proven this phenomenon in captive
   populations or experimental conditions; however, no evidence of
   inbreeding purge has ever been described in dog populations. Despite the
   various breeding practices, it seems that alleles of these polygenic
   disorders could be successfully purged out of the population with
   long-term selection.}},

   the developed model is further corrected based on the real condition and
   thus becomes capable to characterize the auxetic behavior of the ATB.
   During the analysis, it is found that the stiff wrap yarn cannot be

   be enhanced. By combining the filler and skeleton, the hierarchical
   composite materials are constructed. The magnitude of the enhancement
   depends on inner and outer filler's modulus mismatch, as well as the
   types of filling. Filler's auxeticity also largely enhances overall
   auxeticity of the outer- and all-filled honeycomb. In addition, for
   outer-filled honeycomb, its effective viscoelastic modulus and damping
   are significantly increased, while maintaining relatively light weight,

Abstract = {{Auxetics are materials that contract laterally when compressed, rather
   than expand, in contrast to common experience. Here we show that common
   metals and plastics can be rendered auxetic through the introduction of
   a regular array of holes. Under compression, these hard holey materials
   bypass localized failure modes, such as shear banding, and instead
   deform via a global pattern transformation previously reported in
   elastomeric structures. Despite significant variations in internal
   structure, the pattern transformation responsible for auxetic behaviour
   in both metals and plastics is governed by the buckling of the slender
   struts that comprise the microarchitecture. Furthermore, in contrast to
   elastomeric structures, holey sheets made from hard materials exhibit
   significant negative post-buckling stiffness. This suggests that, beyond
   the geometrical nonlinearities associated with topological
   modifications, material nonlinearities which arise during plastic
   deformation offer further potential for altering the material properties
   of the constituent. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Capability of achieving desired thermal expansions is critically
   important for various engineering applications. Inspired by the
   morphable kirigami patterns, three-dimensional (3D) mechanical
   metamaterials are designed and fabricated with their effective thermal
   expansion properties being coded within the fundamental
   thermo-mechanical coupled microstructures. With the concept of `bit'
   being introduced in the basic quarter unit, we construct ring-like unit
   cells which are assembled to form different 2D and 3D metamaterials with
   programmable elastic deformations upon changes in temperature. Both
   simulations and experiments are performed at different levels of the
   architectured materials indicating that the targeted isotropic and
   anisotropic deformations can be achieved in a large range (from -40\% to
   10\% strain). Finally, the positively correlated relation between
   thermal expansion property and Poisson's ratio is also discussed. This
   work opens up new avenues for potential mechanical metamaterial
   applications in deformable electronics, self-folding materials,
   artificial muscles, and robotics. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Study in circular auxetic structures for efficiency enhancement in
   piezoelectric vibration energy harvesting}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Piezoelectric (PZT) components are one of the most popular elements in
   vibration sensing and also energy harvesting. They are very well
   established, cost effective and available in different geometries
   however there are still several challenges in their application
   particularly in vibration energy harvesting. They are normally
   narrow-band elements and work in high-frequency range. Their efficiency
   and power extraction density are also generally low compared with
   different electromagnetic techniques. Auxetic structures are proposed
   here to enhance efficiency of the piezoelectric circular patches in
   vibration energy harvesting. These kinds of patches namely PZT buzzers
   are inexpensive (less than 10 USD) elements and easily available. Two
   novel circular auxetic substrates are proposed to improve power
   extraction capacity of the conventional piezoelectric buzzers. Negative
   Poison's ratio of the proposed meta-structure helps in efficiency
   enhancement. The concept is introduced, analyzed and verified through
   the finite element modeling and experimental testing. The idea is proved
   to work by comparing the harvested electrical power in the auxetic
   design against the conventional plain system. A parametric study is then
   carried out and effects of important electrical and geometrical
   parameters as well as the material property on the power extraction
   efficiency are assessed to arrive at optimum parameters. It is shown
   that by employing the auxetic design, a remarkable improvement in the
   harvested power is achievable. It is shown that for the two proposed
   auxetic designs, at the resonance frequency, we could reach to 10.2 and
   13.3 magnification factor with respect to the plain energy harvester.
   Another important feature is that the resonant frequency in these new
   designs is very much lower than the conventional resonators. Results of
   this study can open a new path to application of inexpensive PZT buzzers
   in large-scale vibration energy harvesting.}},

Title = {{4D printed auxetic structures with tunable mechanical properties}},
Journal = {{ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{35}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Additive manufacturing has revolutionized the entire design cycle across
   a wide range of industries. The majority of materials utilized in 3D
   printing result in rather rigid structures with a fixed set of
   properties. Four-dimensional printing (4D printing) addresses this
   limitation by relaxing the geometric/properties rigidity over time. The
   careful selection of structural designs and the use of active and smart
   materials enables a unique set of shapes and properties to be programmed
   and achieved. This deviation from rigid structures with a fixed set of
   properties enables novel and unique applications in robotics, deployable
   structures, biomedical, and aerospace industries. The current work is
   focused on an interesting class of structures, 2D auxetic cellular
   solids, which exhibit a negative Poisson's ratio. 4D printing of such
   structures allows for tunable structural stiffness, Poisson's ratio, and
   rigidity. This work aims to experimentally investigate the tunability of
   stiffness and Poisson's ratio in 4D printed auxetic structures
   fabricated using a thermoplastic shape-memory polymer. The attained
   structural stiffness was tuned in the range of 0.179 - 0.242 kN/mm while
   the in-plane Poisson's ratio was controlled from -0.33 up to even
   positive magnitudes of +0.69. This wide range of elastic properties was
   obtained from a single structure programmed to different deformation
   levels. Experimental evaluation of 4D printed SMP structures under
   constant cyclic programming/recovery conditions induced residual strains
   which consequently affected the mechanical properties by degrading the
   Poisson's ratio and structural stiffness. The magnitude of induced
   residual strains depends on the level of applied deformation during
   programing and the number of applied programing/recovery cycles. At the
   local level, full-field measurements revealed the localization of
   strains within the complex heterogeneous structure of the axially loaded
   auxetic honeycomb samples.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, three-dimensional tomographic studies of crustal seismic
   wave velocity structure beneath the Tibetan Plateau were carried out
   using seismic travel time data from China Digital Seismograph Network
   (CDSN) (2009-2016) seismic stations. The three-dimensional S-wave
   velocity structure and Poisson's ratio distribution of the Tibetan
   Plateau with a resolution of 1 degrees X 1 degrees X 20 km were
   obtained. The results show that the negative anomalous zones of S-wave
   velocity and high Poisson's ratio zones could be found from the upper
   crust to the lower crust under the high-potassium and potash volcanic
   belts of Kekexili and northern Qiangtang. This indicates that during the
   Tertiary Tibetan Plateau uplift, the East Kunlun Triassic suture zone
   reruptured due to continental collisions, resulting the upwelling of
   massive crust-mantle mixed molten material and volcanic eruption. This
   further reveals that the existence of Cenozoic volcanic belts in the
   northern Tibetan Plateau is closely related to the formation and uplift
   of the Tibetan Plateau. The Cenozoic rift zones of the Tibetan Plateau
   are located at both sides of the S-wave velocity negative anomaly zones
   in middle-lower crust, the Poisson's ratio below the rift zones in
   middle-lower crust are less than 0. 22. From the anomalous distribution
   of S-wave velocity and Poisson's ratio in middle-lower crust under the
   Cenozoic rift zones of Tibetan Plateau, it could be deduced that the
   Cenozoic rift of Tibetan Plateau had reached the bottom of the middle
   crust. This is consistent with the conclusions from the crustal density
   imaging study of the Tibetan Plateau using gravity inversion. The S-wave
   velocity and Poisson's ratio of the Tibetan Plateau change sharply with
   depth from lower crust to crust-mantle boundary, which indicates that
   large-scale interlayer detachment and horizontal shear occurred in the
   crust. The Poisson's ratio of the eastern tectonic syntaxis in the
   Tibetan Plateau is as high as 0. 29-0. 33, and the S-wave velocity
   perturbation under eastern tectonic syntaxis is negative. This infers
   that the crust below the eastern tectonic syntaxis is mainly composed of
   hard serpentinized peridotite. The negative anomalous zones of the
   S-wave velocity in the middle and lower crust of the Tibetan Plateau is
   widely expanded, and the bottom of the crust under Tibetan Plateau is
   almost covered by the negative anomalous zones of the S-wave velocity.
   Such characteristic of distribution of anomalous of the S-wave velocity
   may reflect the influence of pipeline flow in the lower crust.}},

Title = {{Cyclic tensile stimulation enrichment of Schwann cell-laden auxetic
   hydrogel scaffolds towards peripheral nerve tissue engineering}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{195}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The nervous system in the body is a complex network of nerves and cells
   that regulates several functions. Neural regeneration is a complex
   process that involves matrix secretion and remodeling, in which growth
   factors play a huge role in regulating such processes. Recent studies
   demonstrated the structures and topography of scaffolds are expected to
   provide a spectrum of unique biomimetic 3D microenvironments to regulate
   cell behavior. In this study, we fabricated auxetic scaffolds using fish
   gelatin methacrylamide and evaluated the effects of cyclic tensile
   stimulation effects on the neural differentiation capabilities of human
   Schwann cells. The auxetic hydrogels were found to withstand up to 20\%
   tensile strain without tears, and the hydrogels had lost only about 10\%
   weight after immersed for 14 days. The tensile forces were able to
   enhance cell viability and proliferation as compared to a static
   culture. In addition, the secretion of neural regeneration-related
   proteins was enhanced in the tensile stimulation group. The cell-laden
   auxetic scaffold with tensile stimulation caused improvement in the
   nerve growth factor and TRKA receptor expression. This is the first
   study to combine tensile stimulation with NGF. The initial results
   showed the positive potential of such conditions being applied in
   clinical applications. (c) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE TEXTILE INSTITUTE}},
Abstract = {{Two-component auxetic yarns with helical wrapping structure showed
   negative Poisson's ratio under axial tension. It was the interaction
   force, especially the normal force, between the two filaments that led
   to the outer contour diameter of the complex yarn being expanded. Both
   the deformation behavior of structure and cross section presented
   greater effect on Poisson's ratio and auxetic effect. However, the
   previous geometrical model that has been reported was without
   considering the interaction force between the two components. Mechanical
   model with axial tension and the normal force was carried out to
   theoretically calculate Poisson's ratio of the complex yarn. The results
   showed that the cross section of the filament was from circular shape to
   elliptical shape under the normal force. Theoretical value from the
   mechanical model with considering the effect of normal force on the
   radial strain was in good accordance with the experimental results of

Abstract = {{Metamaterials produced using additive manufacturing represent advanced
   structures with tunable properties and deformation characteristics.
   However, the manufacturing process, imperfections in geometry,
   properties of the base material as well as the ambient and operating
   conditions often result in complex multiparametric dependence of the
   mechanical response. As the lattice structures are metamaterials that
   can be tailored for energy absorption applications and impact
   protection, the investigation of the coupled thermomechanical response
   and ambient temperature-dependent properties is particularly important.
   Herein, the 2D re-entrant honeycomb auxetic lattice structures
   additively manufactured from powdered stainless steel are subjected to
   high strain rate uniaxial compression using split Hopkinson pressure bar
   (SHPB) at two different strain rates and three different temperatures.
   An in-house developed cooling and heating stages are used to control the
   temperature of the specimen subjected to high strain rate impact
   loading. Thermal imaging and high-speed cameras are used to inspect the
   specimens during the impact. It is shown that the stress-strain response
   as well as the crushing behavior of the investigated lattice structures
   are strongly dependent on both initial temperature and strain rate.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, making use of the coupled deformation features of
   reentrant and tetrachiral lattices, innovative 3D chiral metamaterials
   are designed, in which their mechanical properties and deformation
   mechanisms are explored in details. Firstly, three types of innovative
   3D chiral metamaterials are designed based on geometry topology in the
   (x) over bar(y) over bar plane, namely: tetrachiral, anti-tetrachiral
   and hybrid-tetrachiral, respectively. Secondly, the coupled tension and
   rotation deformation mechanisms of innovative 3D chiral metamaterials
   are investigated based on large deformation theories of representative
   unit cell. The theoretical formulas for extension stress, Poisson's
   ratio and rotation angle of the square loop are derived, it is found
   that wide range of negative Poisson's ratio can be obtained with the
   proposed 3D chiral metamaterials. Afterwards, tensile experiments are
   performed, and good agreements between theoretical, finite element and
   experimental results are presented, verifying the reliability of the
   theoretical models. Finally, influences of the geometry parameters on
   the mechanical behaviors of the proposed 3D auxetic metamaterials are
   also studied. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A calculation model has been developed for large-strain radial
   consolidation incorporating lateral deformation in order to solve the
   problem of poor consolidation prediction for dredged sludge at high
   water content in vacuum preloading process. The differential solution
   for the proposed model is given, considering the effect of initial water
   content on the compression behavior. The model is suitable for
   unconsolidated soil and normally consolidated soil, which can take into
   account such factors as lateral deformation, varying compressibility and
   permeability coefficients, smearing effect, self-weight stress, negative
   pressure attenuation along the depth, etc. The proposed model is
   verified by comparing it with other existing theoretical solutions.
   Poisson's ratio (v) is used to reflect the influence of lateral
   deformation on soil consolidation. The results show that lateral
   deformation has an important influence on soil consolidation degree,
   especially on consolidation degree defined by stress (U-p). The
   consolidation rate increases with the increase of v. The traditional
   equal-strain solution overestimates the consolidation rate of
   foundation. At the same normalized elevation, the void ratio increases
   while the excess pore water pressure decreases with the increase of v.}},

Abstract = {{Rotating unit systems constitute one of the main classes of auxetic
   metamaterials. In this work, a new design procedure for lightweight
   auxetic systems based on this deformation mechanism is proposed through
   the implementation of a hierarchical triangular truss network in place
   of a full block of material for the rotating component of the system.
   Using numerical simulations in conjunction with experimental tests on 3D
   printed prototypes, the mechanical properties of six types of auxetic
   structures, which include a range of rotating polygons and chiral
   honeycombs, were analysed under the application of small tensile loads.
   The results obtained show that there is almost no difference in the
   Poisson's ratios obtained from the regular, full structures and the ones
   made from triangular truss systems despite the latter, in some cases,
   being 80\% lighter than the former. This indicates that these systems
   could be ideal candidates for implementation in applications requiring
   lightweight auxetic metamaterial systems such as in the aerospace
   industry.}},

Title = {{Enhancing indentation and impact resistance in auxetic composite
   materials}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITES PART B-ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{198}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic materials exhibiting a negative Poisson's ratio are of great
   research interest due to their unusual mechanical responses and a wide
   range of potential deployment. However, due to the cellular structure
   and the bending or rotation deformation nature of the elements in
   auxetic materials, they usually have relative low stiffness, limiting
   their applications where high stiffness, strength, hardness, and energy
   absorption are simultaneously desired. To overcome this limitation, we
   apply the auxetic lattice structures as the reinforcements combining
   with the nearly incompressible soft materials as the matrix to create a
   class of high-performance composites. This coupled geometry and material
   design concept is enabled by the state-of-the-art additive manufacturing
   technique. Guided by static and dynamic experimental testing, we
   systematically study the indentation behavior of the 3D printed auxetics
   reinforced composites and achieve a significant enhancement of their
   indentation stiffness and impact resistance compared with the
   non-auxetic reinforced composites. By digital image correlation
   processing of experimental tests and numerical simulation, this improved
   mechanical performance is found due to two deformation mechanisms. The
   first mechanism is the negative Poisson's ratio effect of the auxetic
   reinforcements, which makes the matrix in a state of biaxial compression
   during indentation and impact and hence provides additional support. The
   second mechanism is the negative Poisson's ratio effect of the overall
   composites, which makes the auxetic reinforced composites denser at the
   site of the indentation and therefore are more resistant to indentation.
   The results show that auxetic structures can lead to design stiffer,
   harder and tougher composite materials. The material design strategy
   provides insights into the development of classes of novel auxetic
   composites with a wide range of mechanical and structural applications.}},

   adults: An observational study}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PSYCHOSOMATIC RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{137}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Objective: Mood disorders, child maltreatment, and medical morbidity are
   associated with enormous public health burden and individual suffering.
   The effect of mood disorders on medical morbidity, accounting for child
   maltreatment, has not been studied prospectively in a large,
   representative sample of community-dwelling US adults. This study tested
   the effects of mood disorders and child maltreatment on medical
   morbidity, and variation by subtypes. Methods: Participants were
   noninstitutionalized US adults in the National Epidemiologic Survey on
   Alcohol and Related Conditions (N = 43,093 wave 1, N = 34,653 wave 2).
   Mood disorders included lifetime DSM-IV episodes of depression,
   dysthymia, mania, or hypomania. Child maltreatment was defined as
   sexual, physical, or emotional abuse, or physical or emotional neglect
   before age 18. Survey-weighted zero-inflated poisson regression was used
   to study effects on medical morbidity, a summary score of 11
   self-reported medical conditions. Results were adjusted for age, sex,
   ethnicity/race, income, substance use disorders, smoking, and obesity.
   Results: Mood disorders and child maltreatment additively associated
   with medical morbidity at study entry and three years later, with
   similar magnitude as obesity and smoking. Mania/hypomania (incidence
   rate ratio {[}IRR] 1.06, 95\% CI 1.01-1.10) and child sexual (IRR 1.08,
   95\% CI 1.04-1.11) and emotional (IRR 1.05, 95\% CI 1.01-1.10) abuse
   were associated with higher medical morbidity longitudinally.
   Conclusions: Child maltreatment is common, and its long-range negative
   effect on medical morbidity underscores the importance of
   trauma-informed care, and consideration of early life exposures. History
   of mania/ hypomania should be considered in medical practice, and
   physical health must be emphasized in mental health care.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTER METHODS IN APPLIED MECHANICS AND ENGINEERING}},

Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{We describe a systematic approach for engineering the dispersive
   properties of elastic metamaterials in order to band-gap, at
   user-defined frequency ranges, the propagation of elastic waves,
   accounting simultaneously for both P and SV waves. To this end, we focus
   on the inverse design of a metamaterial's unit cell, and cast the design
   problem as an optimization problem, driven by the desired band gap, and
   constrained only by the cell's dispersive characteristics; the latter
   are expressed in terms of the Floquet-Bloch eigenvalue problem.
   Numerical results in the time-domain, using metamaterial assemblies with
   only narrow periodicity, demonstrate that the engineered metamaterial
   attains the desired behavior. Extensions to wave steering, shielding,
   and other wave-control applications, follow naturally. (C) 2020 Elsevier

Journal = {{THIN-WALLED STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{155}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{In this study, two dimensional double-U auxetic honeycombs (2D DUHs)
   composed of curved shell members have been proposed based on traditional
   double-V (concave quadrilateral or re-entrant double-arrowhead) auxetic
   honeycombs (2D DVHs). Theoretical analysis, numerical simulation and
   compression experiments are adopted to characterize the mechanical
   properties including equivalent Young's modulus, equivalent Poisson's
   ratio, and quasi-static collapse process of 2D DVHs and DUHs. Specimens
   of the 2D DUHs and DVHs made of Aluminum alloy (A6061) are fabricated
   through wire cut electrical discharge machining. Both numerical and
   experimental results illustrate that concave DUHs exhibit tunable
   negative Poisson's ratio and equivalent stiffness level compared to
   DVHs. Furthermore, DUHs have smooth geometry configurations that can
   reduce stress concentration at elastic region and exhibit stronger
   auxetic behavior during large deformation. Those mechanical properties
   of 2D DUHs satisfy the requirements for practical engineering
   applications such as energy absorption. The dynamic crushing responses
   of 2D DVHs and DUHs are also investigated, and it is found that the
   crushing collapse modes and plateau stress improvement of 2D DUHs are
   related to the crushing velocity. Finally, the local impact responses of
   2D DVHs and DUHs are studied numerically, the influences of impact
   velocity and indenter size are considered. This study provides useful
   instructions for the design, fabrication and analysis of auxetic
   structures, which has a broad prospect in some advanced technical
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{The present work is focused on the investigation of tetra-anti-chiral
   structures by means of experimental, numerical, and analytical methods.
   Specimens with different lengths of the ligaments were manufactured by
   laser cutting and were tested under a compressive load to investigate
   the value and evolution of Poisson's ratio. Based on the experimental
   investigation of the material used to manufacture the samples, finite
   element models were developed and solved using Ls-Dyna. Subsequently,
   based on the strain energy approach, an analytical solution for the
   estimate of the Poisson's ratio was derived. The solution is capable of
   estimating the value for structures with various configurations,
   including lengths and thickness of the ligaments. A simple beam finite
   element model was developed and implemented for solving in MATLAB, to
   extend the capabilities for evaluation and design of structures with

Title = {{Tuning the electronic and magnetic properties of pentagraphene through
   the C1 vacancy}},
Journal = {{2D MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Pentagraphene (PG), a two-dimensional allotrope of carbon with only
   five-membered rings, was recently predicted to exhibit a wide band gap,
   an unusual negative Poisson's ratio, and robust dynamical and thermal
   stability. However, its potential properties arising from defect
   engineering of five-membered rings have not been explored yet. In this
   work, we explore the C1 vacancy in PG using first-principles density
   functional calculations. The formation energy of this vacancy is
   surprisingly within the formation energy window of monovacancy (MV) in
   graphene. This defect introduces eight midgap levels indicating the
   possibility of studying the charge states. The charged defect is
   amphoteric with deep donor and deep acceptor levels. Introducing the
   vacancy in the sheet renders it inherently ferromagnetic (FM) with a
   magnetic moment of 4 mu(B). Upon further investigating spin polarization
   in PG, three possible unique magnetic configurations are found to exist:
   FM, ferrimagnetic (FiM), and anti-ferromagnetic (AFM). The energy
   difference between the FM and the FiM (AFM) states is similar to-62.4
   meV atom(-1)(similar to-81.9 meV atom(-1)). Despite FiM and AFM being
   lower in energy, interestingly, this intrinsic FM ordering of spins is
   preserved even when the defect concentration is increased. This
   observation would probably hint at the existence of a kinetic barrier
   between FM and AFM states which merits further investigations.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports a study on the large amplitude vibration and
   nonlinear bending behaviors of hybrid laminated plates made of carbon
   nanotube-reinforced composite (CNTRC) layers bonded with metal layer on
   the top surface. The hybrid CNTRC/metal laminated plates with
   out-of-plane negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) are proposed. The effective
   material properties of CNTRC layer are graded in the thickness direction
   in a piece-wise pattern. The material properties of both CNTRC layer and
   metal layer are temperature dependent. The plates are placed on an
   elastic foundation and in thermal environments. The Reddy's third order
   shear deformation plate theory is utilized to establish the motion
   equations of the hybrid CNTRC/metal laminated plate. These equations
   include the geometric nonlinearity in the von Karman sense, the thermal
   effects and the plate-foundation interaction. By employing a two-step
   perturbation approach the nonlinear vibration and bending solutions are
   obtained. A comparison of nonlinear responses of hybrid CNTRC/metal
   laminated plates with positive and negative Poisson's ratios under

Title = {{Study on mechanical properties of a hierarchical octet-truss structure}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{249}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{A hierarchical octet-truss lattice material was proposed by replacing
   the solid strut of the octet-truss structure with a tubular re-entrant
   structure. The tubular re-entrant structure was constructed via a sheet
   rolling oper-ation on a planar hexagonal re-entrant structure.
   Hierarchical octet-truss lattice materials with different rela-tive
   densities were fabricated via additive manufacturing by adjusting the
   re-entrant structure rib thickness, and their mechanical properties were
   studied and compared with the finite element model predictions and shown
   to be in excellent agreement with each other. The effects of
   hierarchical ranks on the mechanical prop-erties of structures were also
   discussed. Results showed that the Poisson's ratio of the hierarchical
   octet-truss structure is approximately 0.3 without being affected by the
   introduction of structural hierarchy. The stress -strain relationships
   of the hierarchical octet-truss structures exhibit dual-peak
   characteristic. The lattice stiff-ness, compressive strength, and energy
   absorption capacity of the models increased with an increasing rib
   thickness of the re-entrant structure of the first-order hierarchical
   octet-truss structure, and the maximum value of specific energy
   absorption (SEA) was achieved when the relative density is 30.2\%. The
   second-order hier-archical octet-truss structure exhibited lower
   collapse stress value, and a shorter stress plateau region than those of

Volume = {{249}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Traditional three dimensional (3D) block auxetics exhibit anisotropic
   cross-section changes even they exist in isotropic forms due to finite
   size and boundary effect. Herein, a systematic design strategy of
   axisymmetric aux-etic metamaterials is proposed with rotationally
   symmetric transverse deformation mode. The axisymmetric auxetics are
   obtained by the revolution of two-dimensional curved auxetic
   configurations along the axis of rota-tion and composed with shell
   elements. Finite element simulations and mechanical experiments reveal
   that the axisymmetric deformation mechanism cause transversely isotropic
   negative Poisson's ratio and enhance the specific Young's modulus
   compared to corresponding 2D and 3D cellular structures. The influence
   of geometric parameters on elastic constants is investigated
   numerically. Three kinds of 3D printing technologies are adopted to
   fabricate the axisymmetric auxetics which shows the relative Young's
   modulus and equivalent Poisson's ratio are independent of constitute
   materials. This study systematically characterizes the mechanical
   responses of axisymmetric auxetic metamaterials and expounds the
   potential multifunctional applications, such as reusable energy

Title = {{Experimental and numerical study of auxetic sandwich panels on 160 grams
   of PE4 blast loading}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SANDWICH STRUCTURES \& MATERIALS}},
Abstract = {{Mines, specifically as Anti-Tank (AT) mines are a significant threat for
   defence vehicles. While approaches such as v-shaped hulls are currently
   used to deflect the blast products from such threats, such a solution is
   not always usable when hull standoff is limited. As such the development
   of a low profile, energy absorbing solution is desirable. One approach
   that has potential to achieve these requirements are sandwich panels.
   While sandwich panel cores can be constructed from various materials,
   one material of particular interest are auxetics. Auxetic are materials
   that exhibit a negative Poisson's ratio. This material has potential to
   be an efficient an impact energy absorber by increasing stiffness at
   local deformation by gathering mass at the impact location. This study
   investigates the effectiveness of novel auxetic core infills alongside
   three other panel types (monolithic, air gap, polymer foam sandwich)
   against buried charges. 160 grams of PE4 were buried in 100 mm depth and
   500 mm stand off the target. Laser and High Speed Video (HSV) system
   were used to capture the deflection-time profile and load cell sensors
   were used to record the loading profile received by the panels.
   Experimental works were compared with numerical model. Explicit model
   were generated in LSDYNA software as `initial impulse mine' keyword. The
   result found that the auxetic and foam core panels were effective in
   reducing peak structural loading and impulse by up to 33\% and 34\%
   respectively. Air-filled panels were the most effective to reduce the
   deflection of the rear of the plate, however variation between capture
   methods (HSV and Laser system) were reported, while numerical modelling
   provided comparable plate deflections responses. When normalised against
   panel weight, the air filled panels were experimentally the most
   efficient per unit mass system with the auxetics being the least
   effective.}},

Abstract = {{Background This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of negative
   impacts of oral health conditions on the quality of life ofquilombolaand
   non-quilombolarural adolescents and identify associated factors. Methods
   This cross-sectional study was carried out in a rural area in the
   countryside of Bahia, Brazil, in 2015. Participants were asked to
   complete the Oral Impacts on Daily Performance Questionnaire. Prevalence
   and prevalence ratios (PR) were estimated together with their respective
   95\% confidence intervals. Multiple analysis was conducted using Poisson
   regression with robust error variance and hierarchical entry of
   variables. Results Of the 390 rural adolescents who took part in the
   study, 42.8\% werequilombolas, and 45.6\% of all participants reported a
   negative impact of their oral health conditions on their quality of
   life. The most prevalent impact was difficulty eating (32.6\%). After
   adjusted analysis, the following factors were found to be associated
   with the negative impact of oral health conditions on quality of life:
   age (PR = 1.04), feeling lonely (PR = 1.42), worst evaluation of oral
   health (PR = 1.52), need of dental care (PR = 1.33), and occurrence of
   toothache in the last 6 months (PR = 1.83).Quilombolasand
   non-quilombolaspresented with a different prevalence of discomfort when
   brushing their teeth and had different factors associated with the
   negative impact of oral health conditions on their quality of life.
   Bothquilombolaand non-quilombolarural adolescents showed a high
   prevalence of negative impact of oral health conditions on their quality
   of life. Conclusions These results support the need for improved oral
   healthcare for specific populations like thequilombolas. Furthermore,
   the results illustrate the importance of incorporating oral healthcare
   strategies that take into consideration the sociocultural context of
   adolescents.}},

Journal = {{MECHANICS OF ADVANCED MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Abstract = {{Honeycomb structure containing curved reentrant sides with negative
   Poisson's ratio (NPR) was designed and the impact dynamics behaviors
   were studied by finite element method. The Poisson's ratio and the
   energy absorption capacity of the honeycomb structure with different arc
   angle were studied under different compression velocities. The results
   show that the Poisson's ratio of the honeycomb structure can reach
   -0.373 with arc angle of 180 degrees. The energy absorption capacity of
   the honeycomb structure increased with an increasing compression
   velocity, and the deformation mode changed from X type to V type and I
   type. When the compression velocity is low, the dynamic response curve
   of the honeycomb structure with arc angle of 180 degrees has the
   characteristics of two-stage plateau region. When the compression
   velocity is high, the energy absorption capacity of the honeycomb
   structure increased with an increasing arc angle. When the arc angle is
   higher than 120 degrees, the honeycomb structure has NPR effect, and the
   energy absorption capacity of the honeycomb structure is better than the
   honeycomb structure with other arc angles.}},

Abstract = {{The present article is focused on investigating the influence of process
   parameters under compressive loading in case of reentrant auxetic
   structures fabricated by fused deposition modeling (FDM). Auxetic
   structures of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and poly-lactic acid
   (PLA) materials are fabricated. Three process parameters of FDM namely
   layer thickness, raster angle, and number of contours are considered to
   investigate their influence on compressive strength, stiffness, and
   specific energy absorption (SEA). Experiments are performed on the basis
   of central composite design and analysis is performed using ANOVA. It is
   found that compressive strength of auxetic structure improves with
   increase in layer thickness. But with increase in raster angle, it
   increases first and then decreases. Compressive stiffness of structures
   initially decreases and then increases with increase in raster angle,
   while it increases with increase in number of contours. SEA of
   structures increases with decrease in layer thickness. Based on the
   analysis of experimental results, regression models are developed to
   predict these responses. Also, multi-response optimization is performed
   to optimize strength, stiffness, and SEA. Auxetic structures failed
   under compressive loading are also examined using scanning electron
   microscope.}},

Abstract = {{An auxetic behaviour is evidenced in CoFe2O4 thin films grown by pulsed
   laser deposition on (100) MgO substrates under various O-2/N-2
   pressures. This rare behaviour for an intrinsic material is observed for
   intermediate oxidation conditions, in between two non auxetic domains
   delimited by high (>0.05 mbar) and low (<0.03 mbar) O-2/N-2 deposition
   pressures. Combining X-ray resonant diffraction and Mossbauer
   spectroscopy, we experimentally prove that the auxetic behaviour is
   related to the presence of cobalt ions in the tetrahedral sites. The
   impact of the structural modifications caused by the various oxidation
   conditions on the electronic and magnetic properties are studied for the
   various oxidation domains. Variations as important as a transition from
   a p-type semiconducting to an insulating behaviour, or from an in-plane
   to an out-of-plane magnetization are observed when spanning from the
   lowest (0.01 mbar) to the highest (1 mbar) studied oxidation pressures.

Abstract = {{Background Early detection of outbreaks of transmissible diseases is
   essential for public health. This study aimed to determine the
   performance of the wavelet-based outbreak detection method (WOD) in
   detecting outbreaks and to compare its performance with the Poisson
   regression-based model and exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA)
   using data of simulated pertussis outbreaks in Iran. Method The data on
   suspected cases of pertussis from 25th February 2012 to 23rd March 2018
   in Iran was used. The performance of the WOD (Daubechies 10 {[}db10] and
   Haar wavelets), Poisson regression-based method, and EWMA Compared in
   terms of timeliness and detection of outbreak days using the simulation
   of different outbreaks. In the current study, two simulations were used,
   one based on retrospectively collected data (literature-based) on
   pertussis cases and another one on a synthetic dataset created by the
   researchers. The sensitivity, specificity, false alarm, and
   false-negative rate, positive and negative likelihood ratios, under
   receiver operating characteristics areas, and median timeliness were
   used to assess the performance of the methods. Results In a
   literature-based outbreak simulation, the highest and lowest
   sensitivity, false negative in the detection of injected outbreaks were
   seen in db10, with sensitivity 0.59 (0.56-0.62), and Haar wavelets with
   0.57 (0.54-0.60). In the researcher simulated data, the EWMA (K = 0.5)
   with sensitivity 0.92 (0.90-0.94) had the best performance. About
   timeliness, the WOD methods showed the best performance in the early
   warning of the outbreak in both simulation approaches. Conclusion
   Performance of the WOD in the early alarming outbreaks was appropriate.
   However, this method would be best used along with other methods of
   public health surveillance.}},

Abstract = {{The behaviour of the auxetic structure under external load was regarded
   as the behaviour of the compliant (flexible) mechanism. The
   multi-objective topological optimization, based on genetic algorithms

   was performed on a quarter of a double-symmetric representative unit
   cell, which is a building block of the symmetrical auxetic structure.
   Static linear computational simulations were performed to determine the
   mechanical response of cell topologies. The proposed method leads to a
   set of best solutions positioned on the Pareto front with different
   topologies and gives a broad overview of possible designs of new auxetic
   structures. The method is highly effective and can be easily extended to

Abstract = {{In this paper, an investigation on the low-velocity impact (LVI)
   response of a shear deformable beam laminated by carbon nanotube
   reinforced composite (CNTRC) layers is performed. The composite beam is
   ``auxetic{''} due to the negative out-of-plane Poisson's ratio (NPR)
   through special symmetric stacking sequences of layers that are designed
   based on the Classical Laminate Theory. To study the effect of the
   out-of-plane NPR on the LVI response of the composite beam, a newly
   defined Hertz model is developed. The motion equations of Karman type
   for the CNTRC laminate beam are derived in the framework of the Reddy
   beam theory and solved by means of a two-step perturbation approach
   while the dynamic equation of the impactor is built on Newton's Law.
   Since temperature-dependent material properties of both carbon nanotube
   (CNT) and matrix are employed, the thermal influence on the LVI behavior
   is also investigated. Moreover, a piece-wise method is employed herein
   to investigate the effect of functionally graded (FG) patterns of the
   CNT reinforcements on the impact response. Numerical results elucidating
   the effects of temperature, FG distribution, and CNT volume fraction on
   the out-of-plane Poisson's ratio and impact response of the beam are
   obtained by using a Range-Kutta method and discussed in details.}},

Title = {{Service utilisation trends in the manual therapy professions within the

Abstract = {{Background Better understanding of the dynamics and temporal changes in
   manual therapy service utilisation may assist with healthcare planning
   and resource allocation. The objectives of this study were to quantify,
   describe, and compare service utilisation trends in the manual therapy
   professions within the Australian private healthcare setting between
   2008 and 2017. Methods Data regarding the number of services, total
   cost, and benefits paid were extracted for each manual therapy
   profession (i.e. chiropractic, osteopathy, and physiotherapy) for the
   period 2008-2017 from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority.
   The number of registered providers for each profession were obtained
   from the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency. Descriptive
   statistics were produced for two time periods (i.e. 2008-2012 and
   2013-2017) for each manual therapy profession. Annual percentage change
   during each time period was estimated by fitting Poisson regression
   models. Test for the equality of regression coefficients was used to
   compare the trends in the two time periods within each profession, and
   to compare the trends across professions within a time period. Results A
   cumulative total of 198.6 million manual therapy services with a total
   cost of \$12.8 billion was provided within the Australian private
   healthcare setting between 2008 and 2017. Although service utilisation
   and total cost increased throughout the ten-year period, the annual
   growth was significantly lower during 2013-2017 than 2008-2012. Whereas
   osteopathy and physiotherapy experienced significant annual growth in
   the number of services and total cost during 2013-2017, negative growth
   in the number of services was observed for chiropractic during the same
   period. The annual number of services per provider declined
   significantly for chiropractic and physiotherapy between 2013 and 2017.
   Conclusion Service provision under private health insurance general
   treatment cover constitute a major source of revenue for manual therapy
   professions in Australia. Although manual therapy service utilisation
   increased throughout the ten-year period from 2008 to 2017, the annual
   growth declined. There were diverging trends across the three
   professions, including significantly greater decline in annual growth
   for chiropractic than for osteopathy and physiotherapy.}},

Abstract = {{Although a number of interesting physical properties such as a negative
   Poisson's ratio (NPR) and Dirac semimetal (DS) properties have been
   recently predicted in two-dimensional (2D) materials, the realization of
   a 2D material that exhibits both of these DS and NPR features has rarely
   been reported. Here by adopting particle swarm optimization (PSO)
   algorithms combined with first-principles methods, we successfully
   construct a novel SiO monolayer (Pmna), the dynamic and thermal
   stability of which was characterized using phonon spectrum calculations
   and molecular dynamics simulations. In particular, Young's modulus and
   Poisson's ratio calculations showed that thePmnamonolayer exhibits high
   mechanical anisotropy with an in-plane NPR originating from its puckered
   atomic arrangement. More notably, the band structure of thePmnamonolayer
   possesses zero bandgap with four Dirac cones in its first Brillouin
   zone, exhibiting a DS feature. From the calculations of orbital-resolved
   band structures, the Dirac cone was revealed to originate from the
   orbital hybridization of Si and O atoms. ThePmnamonolayer is the first
   2D structure in the Si-O system that has both an NPR and Dirac
   semi-metal properties, providing a new model for exploring 2D
   multifunctional materials.}},

Abstract = {{The auxetic structures are structures with negative Poisson ratio that
   behave under tension or compression as opposed to ordinary materials.
   Due to the unique mechanical properties, such as increasing the
   resistance against collision and different formation capability,
   extensive research is ongoing. In this research, using finite element
   modeling, simulation of various geometrical parameters of auxetic cell
   structures have been studied. Verification of the results is done by
   experimental tests of the model made by 3D printing technology. By
   introducing different measurement methods such as image processing, the
   modeling results are compared with experimental tests that show high
   accuracy results. In this analysis, the effect of the angle between the
   cell components, unit cell dimensions, thickness, and density of cells
   are investigated. In addition, new designs to improve the performance of
   the auxetic structure such as the use of different thicknesses are
   studied. Auxetic structures are part of advanced structures such as
   composites and biomaterials with diverse properties and applications in
   various fields such as military, medical, textile, and aerospace
   industries. Auxetic applications are excellent in absorbing impact force
   as bulletproof vests and similar equipment, high strength to weight in
   lightweight sandwich panels, and in tissue engineering like stent
   application.}},

   buckling-induced auxetic behavior will disappear when the base material

Title = {{Quasi-static crushing behavior of novel re-entrant circular auxetic
   honeycombs}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITES PART B-ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{197}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{Honeycombs with re-entrant (RE) unit cells were found to have negative
   Poisson's ratios (NPRs) and enhanced energy absorption capabilities than
   regular hexagon honeycombs. For further improved energy absorption
   capacity, a novel re-entrant circular (REC) honeycomb configuration is
   proposed in this work by replacing the sloped cell wall of the regular
   re-entrant honeycomb with double circular arc cell walls, which can
   dissipate extra energy due to more formed plastic angles during the
   crushing process. The in-plane quasi-static crushing response of the REC
   honeycomb with large deformation was investigated theoretically and
   numerically. The numerical modeling methods in LS-DYNA software were
   validated by using the quasi-static crush test data of 3D-printed REC
   honeycomb specimens. Experiment and numerical simulations both revealed
   that quasi-static load can result in an ``X{''} mode deformation of the
   REC honeycomb. Based on the simulated deformation profiles of the
   representative unit, theoretical models were derived to predict the REC
   honeycomb's crushing strength, i.e. plateau stress. Good agreements were
   found between the theoretical and the numerical results within a
   relative error about 9\%. Parametric analyses further showed that the
   unit cell configuration has a great effect on the crushing strength of
   the REC honeycomb. The REC honeycomb presents a varied Poisson's ratio
   with the global strain of the honeycomb; smaller radius to height ratio
   and length to height ratio were found to yield more pronounced NPR
   effect. Moreover, compared with the regular RE honeycomb, the specific
   energy absorption of the REC honeycomb is much higher due to the

Title = {{Abnormal elasticity and lattice dynamics in the L1(0)-FePd crystalline
   alloy at high pressure}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MAGNETISM AND MAGNETIC MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{510}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{We have systematically explored the pressure dependence of magnetism,
   electronic structure, elasticity and lattice dynamics of the
   ferromagnetic L1(0)-FePd crystalline alloy by employing first-principles
   calculations. All predicted properties of the ground state are well
   consistent with available experimental and theoretical results. The
   total magnetic moment decreases slowly with pressure before the
   ferromagnetic collapse critical pressure of about 164 GPa and then
   sharply decreases near the 164 GPa, and the (C-44 -C-66) value changed
   from positive to negative. The phonon dispersion relations and phonon
   densities of state are also investigated at zero and high pressures.
   Owing to the spontaneous magnetization of the system, the ferromagnetic
   L1(0)-FePd crystalline alloy is dynamically stable at pressures below
   171 GPa (above which the magnetism completely disappears). When the
   pressure was greater than 171.4 GPa, the system dynamics became
   unstable. The calculated elastic properties indicate that the L1(0)-FePd
   alloy is mechanically stable up to 180 GPa. The ferromagnetic L1(0)-FePd
   crystalline alloy has good ductility and metallicity outside the
   ferromagnetic collapse pressure region, but the L1(0)-FePd crystalline
   alloy has an abnormal phenomenon of a sudden sharp increase in
   brittleness near 162 GPa. We found this anomaly from the Pugh ratio B/G
   and Poisson's ratio of the system and the change of Cauchy pressures
   (C-12-C-66) and (C-13 -C-44) with pressure, and this anomaly was
   analyzed with compression factor and magnetoelastic force.}},

Title = {{Elasto-plastic behavior of the Fontainebleau sandstone based on a
   refined continuous strain deviation approach}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND CIVIL ENGINEERING}},
Abstract = {{The elasto-plastic behavior of the Fontainebleau sandstone is studied
   from experimental and numerical points of view on the basis of a series
   of conventional triaxial compression tests. Five distinct stages of the
   axial strain curve are quantified in terms of four stress thresholds
   (crack closure stress sigma(cc), crack initiation stress sigma(ci),
   crack damage stress sigma(cd)and short-term peak strength sigma(p)). The
   onset of dilation and total volumetric strain reversal occur at axial
   stress level 30-50\% and 50-80\% of sigma(p), respectively. A refined
   continuous strain deviation (RCSD) method is proposed to more accurately
   define the elastic parameters. Other internal state variables are
   determined accordingly. Some important information are gained as
   follows: (1) the Poisson's ratio decreases with the increase of the
   confining pressure; (2) at the same stress level, the higher of the
   confining pressure, the smaller of the negative plastic volumetric
   strain (dilatancy); (3) the evolution of the friction-like coefficient
   and the plastic volumetric strain can be described with an exponential
   function and a hyperbolic function, respectively. A strictly
   experimental based constitutive model is proposed to study the
   elasto-plastic behavior of the Fontainebleau sandstone. All numerical
   aspects including formulations, algorithms and experimental validations,
   are presented in detail.}},

Abstract = {{The maximum tangential strain energy density (MTSED) criterion was
   modified by taking the influences of stress intensity factors and

   Furthermore, the Poisson's ratio and T-stress influencing the fracture
   characteristics of cracked components were discussed by using the
   extended MTSED criterion. Moreover, the predicted values of this
   extended MTSED criterion and some testing results were comparatively
   analysed. The results indicate that the Poisson's ratio and T-stress
   have no impact on the out-of-plane initiation angle; however, their
   effects on fracture resistance ratios are significant especially for
   pure mode III. A positive T-stress increases the fracture resistance
   ratio, and it is opposite for a negative T-stress. The predicted values
   calculated by the extended MTSED criterion agree very well with the
   testing data obtained with edge-notched disc bend samples especially for
   pure mode III case.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, the auxetic fabrics have gained much importance in the
   scientific and industrial community due to their excellent
   impact-resistance property. Due to this property, they have several
   applications, including automotive, aerospace, and ballistic areas. The
   auxetic three-dimensional (3D) woven fabrics are a less explored domain
   in the auxetic community. Herein, special attention is given to the
   numerical analysis of the 3D auxetic structure. The negative Poisson's
   ratio of 3D auxetic structures is studied using ANSYS workbench
   structural analysis module. The effect of binding yarn float length on
   negative Poisson's ratio is tested on ten different 3D orthogonal
   through the thickness structures with binding yarn float length of 1:1,
   2:1, and 3:1. Furthermore, the effect of the number of binding yarns and
   the number of layers is also studied numerically. The results show that
   the auxeticity of the woven structure increases with increasing the
   number of binding yarns and their float length. Moreover, decreasing the
   number of layers from 3 to 1 increases the auxeticity.}},

Abstract = {{The argillaceous slate obviously shows softening characteristics under
   water-rock interaction. The relationship between the uniaxial
   compressive strength (UCS), elastic modulus, Poisson's ratio and water
   absorption time in the softening process of argillaceous slate is
   analyzed by conducting uniaxial compression tests. The laws of pore
   generation, expansion and breakthrough in the softening process under
   water-rock interaction are studied by using the nuclear magnetic
   resonance (NMR). The relationship between porosity and water absorption
   time in the softening process is analyzed. The evolution rule of
   microstructure in the softening process of argillaceous slate under
   water-rock interaction is analyzed by the scanning electron microscope
   (SEM). Based on the fractal theory, the change rule of the fractal
   dimension under different soaking time is studied. The fractal dimension
   value of pore microstructure, porosity, UCS and elastic modulus are
   selected as the changes of describing the interaction system of
   argillaceous slate and water solution by using the nonlinear dynamics
   theory. The applicability of the model is verified with experimental
   data. The results show that UCS and elastic modulus decrease with the
   increase of water absorption time, showing a negative linear
   correlation, but there is no obvious relationship between the Poisson's
   ratio and water absorption time. At the early stage of immersion, the
   water-rock interaction is strong, and the micropores in the slate expand
   and penetrate to form larger pores, and the porosity increases rapidly.
   With the increase of water absorption time, the pores in the
   argillaceous slate are connected with each other to form large pores,
   which leads to the complex network structure. The fractal dimension of
   argillaceous slate increases logarithmically and tends to be stable
   gradually. The results calculated by the nonlinear model are close to
   the experimental data, which shows that the softening process of
   argillaceous slate has the obvious nonlinear dynamic characteristics,
   and the softening law of argillaceous slate under water-rock interaction
   can be better characterized by the nonlinear dynamic model. The results
   can provide a reference for the theoretical study of soft rock-water
   interaction.}},

Title = {{Anemia and its associated factors among women of reproductive age in
   eastern Africa: A multilevel mixed-effects generalized linear model}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{15}},

Month = {{SEP 11}},
Abstract = {{Background Anemia in women of reproductive age is a major public health
   challenge for low- and middle-income countries with a long-term negative
   impact on the health of women, their children, and the economic growth
   of the society. Even though the world health organization targeted a
   50\% global reduction of anemia among women of reproductive age by 2025,
   with the current trend it is unlikely to achieve this goal. Objective
   This study aimed to assess the prevalence and associated factors of
   anemia among women of reproductive age in eastern Africa. Methods A
   secondary data analysis, using demographic and health survey (DHS) data
   of 10 eastern African countries, was conducted. For our study, a total
   weighted sample of 101524 women of reproductive age was used. We
   employed a multilevel mixed-effects generalized linear model (using
   Poisson regression with robust error variance). Both unadjusted and
   adjusted prevalence ratios with their 95\% confidence interval were
   reported. Results The prevalence of anemia in eastern Africa was 34.85
   (95\%CI: 34.56-35.14) ranging from 19.23\% in Rwanda to 53.98\% in
   Mozambique. In the multivariable multilevel analysis, being older age,
   having primary and above education, being from households with second to
   highest wealth quantiles, being currently working, not perceiving
   distance as a big problem, use of modern contraceptive methods, and
   rural residence was associated with a lower prevalence of anemia. While,
   being married and divorced/separated/widowed, women from female-headed
   households, women from households with unimproved toilet facility and
   unimproved water source, ever had of a terminated pregnancy, having high
   parity, and being from large household size was associated with a higher
   prevalence of anemia. Conclusion The prevalence of anemia in eastern
   Africa was relatively high. Both individual level and community level
   factors were associated with the prevalence of anemia in women of
   reproductive age. Therefore, giving special attention to those women who
   are at a higher prevalence of anemia such as younger women, those who
   are from households with low socioeconomic status, unimproved toilet
   facility, and source of drinking water, as well as pregnant women could
   decrease anemia in women of reproductive age.}},

Journal = {{PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART C-JOURNAL OF
   MECHANICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},
Abstract = {{The main purpose of this research is to investigate the
   thermoporoelastic behavior of non-homogeneous circular plate made up of
   auxetic metamaterial rested on an auxetic material plate. The plate is
   non-uniform, restrained with flexible support at outer edge and
   subjected to structure-structure interaction and thermo-mechanical load.
   The plate material is graded in transverse direction and the Poisson's
   ratio is constant. Based on the linear thermoporoelasticity theory, the
   governing state equations in terms of displacements and temperature are
   acquired. At first, the one-dimensional heat equation including
   quadratic type heat source is solved to compute the nonlinear
   distribution of temperature across the thickness. Then, the state
   equations are solved semi-analytically using state-space (SS) method and
   differential quadrature (DQ) rule to predict the elastic field
   quantities. A comprehensive parametric discussion is accomplished to
   elucidate the effects of key parameters on the steady-state response of
   the plate to mechanical and thermal loads. The computed results indicate
   that the auxeticity of the structure and supporting medium, as well as
   the thermal environment, play a significant role in the
   thermoporoelastic behavior of the plate.}},

Title = {{Development of 3D auxetic structures using para-aramid and ultra-high
   molecular weight polyethylene yarns}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE TEXTILE INSTITUTE}},
Abstract = {{In recent times, auxetic woven structures gained considerable attention
   from the researchers due to their excellent impact properties in
   high-performance areas. Researchers have done much work on the auxetic
   behavior of the natural and low-performance yarns in two-dimensional
   structures. Keeping in view the structural application of auxetic
   structures, in this work, three-dimensional (3D) woven auxetic fabrics
   were developed on conventional weaving machines with high-performance
   yarns. Effect of high-performance yarns (Para-aramid and UHMWPE) as the
   main structure and binding threads on the auxeticity of 3D fabric
   structures and the impact properties of their corresponding composites
   were discussed. For this purpose, eight different orthogonal 3D woven
   structures were produced with para-aramid filament yarn as warp and
   weft, whereas ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) filament
   yarn was used as a binder. The tensile load was applied to the 3D
   fabrics to check their auxeticity, and a change in thickness was
   recorded. The results showed that as the float length of binder yarn and
   warp yarn increases with the equal and same ratio, the auxeticity also
   increases. While auxeticity decreases as the difference between the
   float length of binder yarn and warp yarn increases. The Negative
   Poisson's Ratio (NPR) of 3D woven fabrics ranged from -0.9 to -2.98. In
   the second step, these 3D woven fabrics were fabricated into their
   composites using unsaturated polyester resin, and the hand-layup
   technique. Their impact strength was measured using the Charpy test
   method. Auxetic woven composites made of high-performance yarns
   structures showed impact strength ranging from 55.64 kJ/m(2)to 158.46
   kJ/m(2).}},

Title = {{Perceived discrimination in health services and associated factors in
   Manaus Metropolitan Region, Brazil: a cross-sectional population-based
   study}},
Journal = {{ETHNICITY \& HEALTH}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: Discrimination is the differentiated treatment of
   individuals due to prejudgments. Discriminatory practices in health care
   result in negative effects on patients' health. In Brazil, skin color
   represents the main form of racial discrimination, which may have an
   impact on the accessibility and quality of health care. The Brazilian
   Amazon lacks investigations on this topic at the population level. This
   study aims to estimate the prevalence of perceived discrimination in
   health services and associated factors in the Manaus Metropolitan
   Region, state of Amazonas, Brazil. Design: A population-based
   cross-sectional study was conducted with a probabilistic sample of
   adults interviewed in 2015. The associated factors were investigated by
   calculating the prevalence ratio (PR) using Poisson regression with
   robust variance. Results: A total of 4,001 participants were included.
   The overall prevalence of perceived discrimination was 12.9\% (95\%
   confidence interval {[}CI]: 11.8-13.9\%). When compared to the reference
   categories, women (PR = 1.43; 95\%CI: 1.20-1.70), individuals with brown
   skin color (Brazilian mixed race; PR = 1.33; 95\%CI: 1.04-1.71), people
   who suffer from hypertension (PR = 1.27;95\%CI: 1.03-1.57), and people
   who frequently used health services (p <= 0.03) experienced more
   discrimination from health professionals. Conclusions: The prevalence of
   perceived discrimination in health services in Manaus Metropolitan
   Region is frequent and is associated with ethnic, social and
   health-related factors. Investments in inclusive public health policies
   and a better quality of health assistance are required to tackle this
   problem.}},

Abstract = {{Herein, the effect of symmetric carbon fiber composites laminates with
   angle-ply stacking sequences ({[}+/-beta/+/-theta](S)) in the design of
   composite piezoelectric energy harvesters (PEHs) is evaluated. Some of
   those specific stacking sequences also feature negative Poisson's ratio
   (NPR) or near zero Poisson's ratio (NZPR) through the thickness for ply
   angles theta < 45 degrees. Six different architectures with similar
   in-plane elastic modulusE(1)and different positive Poisson's ratio and
   NPRv(13)values are considered here. Finite element models are developed
   to understand the distribution of the voltage density of the laminates
   with the different stacking sequences and their bending properties.
   Experimental tests (three-point bending and vibration) are also
   performed. Both the simulations and the experimental results show that
   the PEH with the stacking sequences of near zerov(13)generate the
   highest power compared with the other composite energy harvesters. The
   maximum voltage frequency response function (FRF) happens at the
   fundamental resonance, and the PEH with near zerov(13)has also the
   lowest resonance frequency compared with the other stacking sequences.}},

Journal = {{ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{43}},
Month = {{OCT 22}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic mechanical metamaterials, which expand transversally when
   axially stretched, are widely used in flexible electronics and
   aerospace. However, these chiral metamaterials suffer from three severe
   limitations as a typical auxetic metamaterials: narrow strain range,
   non-tunable mechanical behaviors, and fixed properties after
   fabrication. In this work, 4D printing chiral metamaterials with
   tunable, programmable, and reconfigurable properties are developed. The
   deformation mode transforms from bending dominated to stretching
   dominated under large deformation, leading to the stress-deformation
   (sigma-lambda) behavior of the auxetic metamaterials similar to those of
   the biomaterials ({''}J{''}-shaped), such as tissues or organs. The
   programmability and reconfigurability of the developed chiral
   metamaterials allow mechanical behavior to change between different
   biomaterials with high precision. Furthermore, scaffolds with
   personalized mechanical properties as well as configurations and
   metamaterials-based light-emitting diode integrated devices demonstrate
   potential applications in tissue engineering and programmable flexible
   electronics.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate an effective approach to enhance the output performance
   of a flexible piezoelectric energy harvester by using flexible
   electrodes with negative Poisson's ratio (NPR). The relationship between
   open-circuit voltage and Poisson's ratio of electrodes is established
   theoretically by deriving the analytical expression. It reveals a
   continuous increasing trend in open-circuit voltage with the decrease in
   Poisson's ratio of the electrodes. Further, graphene-assembled
   macro-film (GAMF), an NPR material with excellent flexibility and high
   conductivity, is used as the electrodes to fabricate flexible
   piezoelectric energy harvesters. Compared with the energy harvesters
   using silver electrode, the harvesters made by GAMF electrodes, with an
   NPR of -0.39, achieve nearly 1.7-times enhancement in open-circuit
   voltage and 1.6-times in short-circuit current for output performance.
   The experimental results are highly consistent with the simulation
   results, indicating that the GAMF has great prospects in developing
   flexible piezoelectric energy harvesters with enhanced electrical output
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose This study aimed to evaluate parents' perceptions of the oral
   health status of children enrolled in public preschools and associated
   factors.
   Methods This was a cross-sectional study with data collected via
   self-administered questionnaire. A total of 474 questionnaires were
   distributed in public preschools in the city of Canoas, Rio Grande do
   Sul, the southernmost state of Brazil. Poisson regression models were
   used in the multivariate analysis (p < 0.05).
   Results The study included 171 (36\%) valid questionnaires. The
   prevalence of parents who perceived the oral health status of their
   children as negative was 29.8\% (n = 51). Mother being unemployed (vs
   employed) increased by 16\% the likelihood of parents perceiving the
   oral health status of their children as negative (prevalence ratio
   {[}PR] 1.16; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI] 1.02-1.31. Parents having
   (vs having not) observed difficulties in the child's ability to eat
   increased by 27\% the likelihood of perceiving the child's oral health
   status as negative (PR 1.27; 95\% CI 1.08-1.48), while child's tooth
   brushing 1-2 (vs 3 or more) times a day and family income up to 2 (vs 3
   or more) minimum wages increased it by 14\% (PR 1.14; 95\% CI 1.03-1.27
   for both). Current or past use (vs no use) of pacifiers increased by
   12\% the likelihood of parents' negative perceptions (PR 1.12; 95\% CI
   1.00-1.25).
   Conclusion We can conclude that unemployed mothers, low-income families,
   parents having observed child's feeding difficulties, child's tooth
   brushing 1-2 times a day, and current or past use of pacifiers
   contributed significantly to parents' negative perception of the child's
   oral health status. These factors are essential for the planning,
   implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of actions aimed at
   controlling the oral health of children enrolled in public preschools.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction
   Food insecurity (FI), defined as inadequate access to affordable and
   quality nutrition, has negative health consequences. FI and violence
   share similar root causes. The aim of this study was to determine the
   association of FI with gunshot injury (GSI) incidence.
   Methods
   We performed a retrospective review of all patients from 2012 to 2018
   who sustained a GSI. Food access data was abstracted from the US
   Department of Agriculture. We analyzed the impact of FI, low food access
   (LA), and low food access with no vehicle (LANV) on the incidence of GSI
   using Poisson regression. We also compared high-risk zip codes for GSI,
   FI, LA, and LANV using geospatial analysis.
   Results
   There were 1700 patients in our cohort from 33 different zip codes. The
   median incidence of GSI per zip code was 142 (85-164); 5 zip codes
   comprised 50\% of all GSI events. FI (incidence rate ratio {[}IRR] 4.05,
   95\% CI 3.98-4.13, P < .0001), LA (IRR 2.97, 95\% CI 2.92-3.03. P <
   .0001), and LANV (IRR 2.58, 95\% CI 2.55-2.62, P < .0001) were
   significant predictors of GSI incidence. The FI model was superior to
   the LA and LANV models. Geospatial analysis demonstrated that both FI (P
   < .0001) and LANV (P < .0001) were significantly associated with GSI,
   while LA was not (P > .05).
   Conclusion
   FI is an independent risk factor for GSI incidence. Additionally, a
   majority of GSI events occur in a minority of communities. These data
   provide a novel opportunity for social services to guide future violence
   prevention strategies.}},

Title = {{3D Printing metamaterials towards tissue engineering}},
Journal = {{APPLIED MATERIALS TODAY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{20}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The rapid growth and disruptive potentials of three-dimensional (3D)
   printing demand further research for addressing fundamental fabrication
   concepts and enabling engineers to realize the capabilities of 3D
   printing technologies. There is a trend to use these capabilities to
   develop materials that derive some of their properties via their
   structural organization rather than their intrinsic constituents,
   sometimes referred to as mechanical metamaterials. Such materials show
   qualitatively different mechanical behaviors despite using the same
   material composition, such as ultra-lightweight, super-elastic, and
   auxetic structures. In this work, we review current advancements in the
   design and fabrication of multi-scale advanced structures with
   properties heretofore unseen in well-established materials. We classify
   the fabrication methods as conventional methods, additive manufacturing
   techniques, and 4D printing. Following a comprehensive comparison of
   different fabrication methods, we suggest some guidelines on the
   selection of fabrication parameters to construct meta-biomaterials for
   tissue engineering. The parameters include multi-material capacity,
   fabrication resolution, prototyping speed, and biological compatibility.

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Modern advanced manufacturing technologies have made possible the
   tailored design and fabrication of complex nanoscale architectures with
   anomalous and enhanced properties, including mechanical and optical
   metamaterials; structured materials which are able to exhibit unusual
   mechanical and optical properties that are derived from their geometry
   rather than their intrinsic material properties. In this work, we
   fabricated for the first time an ultrathin 2D auxetic metamaterial with
   nanoscale geometric features specifically designed to deform in-plane by
   using focused-ion-beam milling to introduce patterned nano-slits within
   a thin membrane. The system was mechanically loaded in-situ and
   exhibited in-plane dominated deformation up to 5\% tensile strain and a
   Poisson's ratio of -0.78. Furthermore, the porosity and aperture shape
   of the metamaterial have been shown to change considerably upon the
   application of strain, with pore dimensions showing a fourfold increase
   at 5\% strain. This mechanically-controlled tuneability makes this
   metamaterial system an ideal candidate for use as a reconfigurable
   nano-filter or a nano light-modulator. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Modulation of multi-directional auxeticity in hybrid origami
   metamaterials}},
Journal = {{APPLIED MATERIALS TODAY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{20}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{A novel origami metamaterial with programmable multi-directional
   auxeticity is proposed by hybridizing the concept of re-entrant
   honeycomb with the Miura pattern. Normal Miura-based origami
   metamaterials have been widely shown to exhibit negative in-plane
   Poisson's ratio. However, negative out-of-plane Poisson's ratio cannot
   be realized in these set of materials, essentially limiting their
   capability for prospective applications in many multi-functional devices
   and systems. Here we propose a hybrid Miura-based meta material that can
   show both in-plane and out-of-plane negative Poisson's ratios. More
   interestingly, we are able to program the Poisson's ratios to have mild
   to extreme auxeticity and map their mutual interaction as a function of
   the microstructural configuration. Besides the single-layer meta-sheets,
   we have shown that a class of multi-layer stacked metamaterial with
   uniform and graded configurations can be developed to achieve
   multi-objective functional goals. Theoretical and experimental analyses
   are combined in this paper to demonstrate the concepts of modulating
   multi-directional Poisson's ratios. The fundamental mechanics of the
   proposed origami based metamaterial being scale-independent, this novel
   class of deployable hybrid materials can be directly transferred for
   application in a range of milli-, micro, and nanometer-size systems,
   essentially opening avenues for the design of energy absorbers, sensors,
   actuators, medical stents, catalysis, drug delivery systems, adaptive
   wings for next-generation of aircrafts and other deployable mechanical
   and electronic systems at multiple length-scales. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Open cell foams with auxeticity and modulus 5 times larger than the

   different thicknesses. Foams have been also subjected to tensile
   training at different maximum strains to assess their mechanical
   performance. The tensile modulus and Poisson's ratio values of the
   auxetic foams produced in this work can reach 25 MPa and-0.4 in one
   plane and can feature a negative Poisson's ratio up to-1.3 for thinner
   specimens. Smaller thicknesses and higher tensile training strains can
   also reduce the stiffness but enhance the auxeticity of this porous

Abstract = {{Our objective was to construct textile braiding manufacturing methods to
   facilitate high precision and accurate measurements using optical fiber
   Bragg grating sensors for various structures. We aimed to combine
   three-dimensional (3D) braiding processing with the optical Bragg
   grating sensor's accurate metrology. Outside the limits of the sensor's
   epoxy attachment methods, the textile braiding method can diversify the
   scope of application. The braiding process can be used to design a 3D
   fabric module process for multiple objective mechanical fiber
   arrangements and material characteristics. Optical stress-strain
   response conditions were explored through the optimization of design
   elements between the Bragg grating sensor and the braiding. Here, Bragg
   grating sensors were located 75\% away from the fiber center. The sensor
   core structure was helical with a 1.54 cm pitch, and a polyurethane
   synthetic yarn was braided together with the sensor using a weaving
   machine. From the prototype results, a negative Poisson's ratio resulted
   in a curled braided Bragg grating sensor. The number of polyurethane
   strands was studied to determine the role of wrap angle in the braiding.
   The 12-strands condition showed an increase in double stress-strain
   response rate at a Poisson's ratio of 1.3\%, and the 16-strands
   condition was found to have noise affecting the sensor at a Poisson's
   ratio of 1.5\%. The findings suggested the application of braiding
   fabrication to the Bragg grating sensor could help to develop a new
   monitoring sensor.}},

Title = {{Mechanical Properties of Corner Joints Made of Honeycomb Panels with
   Double Arrow-Shaped Auxetic Cores}},

Abstract = {{The development of both light and strong wood-derived materials is an
   interesting research area, particularly in terms of usability in, e.g.,
   furniture constructions. Honeycomb panels being current industry
   standard are relatively thick (32 mm and 40 mm), thus their
   attractiveness in designing furniture is limited. In a few studies, it
   has been shown that honeycomb panels with paper cores are characterized
   by unsatisfactory mechanical properties, especially when the composite
   thickness is less than 20 mm. From the literature, it is also evident
   that mechanical properties might be improved by introducing auxetic
   features into the core structure. Even though it is a concept with great
   potential, there are a few studies dealing with honeycomb panels with
   auxetic cores made of paper. Furthermore, there is no research on the
   corner joints made from such material. For this reason, the aim of the
   study was to test the bending behavior of the corner adhesive joints
   made of honeycomb panels with double arrow-shaped auxetic cores. Within
   the research, the core cell was adopted based on literature and
   preliminary studies, paper auxetic cores were produced by the use of the
   designed and 3d printed device, and joints stiffness and strength were
   calculated analytically based on the experiment results. Evaluated
   corner joints stiffness, both in compression and tension test, is
   greater for samples made of panels with designed auxetic cores.
   Surprisingly, in the analyzed range of elasticity, it was statistically
   proved that the values of joint stiffness coefficient K did not vary
   significantly between compared joints pairs.}},

Abstract = {{Shape-morphing magnetic soft machines are highly desirable for diverse
   applications in minimally invasive medicine, wearable devices, and soft
   robotics. Despite recent progress, current magnetic programming
   approaches are inherently coupled to sequential fabrication processes,
   preventing reprogrammability and high-throughput programming. Here, we
   report a high-throughput magnetic programming strategy based on heating
   magnetic soft materials above the Curie temperature of the embedded
   ferromagnetic particles and reorienting their magnetic domains by
   applying magnetic fields during cooling. We demonstrate discrete,
   three-dimensional, and reprogrammable magnetization with high spatial
   resolution (similar to 38 mu m). Using the reprogrammable magnetization
   capability, reconfigurable mechanical behavior of an auxetic
   metamaterial structure, tunable locomotion of a surface-walking soft
   robot, and adaptive grasping of a soft gripper are shown. Our approach
   further enables high-throughput magnetic programming (up to 10
   samples/min) via contact transfer. Heat-assisted magnetic programming
   strategy described here establishes a rich design space and
   mass-manufacturing capability for development of multiscale and
   reprogrammable soft machines.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: In South Africa, evidence shows high HIV prevalence in
   older populations, with sexual behavior consistent with high HIV
   acquisition and transmission risk. However, there is a dearth of
   evidence on older people's HIV incidence. Methods: We used a 2010-2011
   cohort of HIV-negative adults in rural South Africa who were 40 years or
   older at retest in 2015-2016 to estimate HIV incidence over a 5-year
   period. We used Poisson regression to measure the association of HIV
   seroconversion with demographic and behavioral covariates. We used
   inverse probability sampling weights to adjust for nonresponse in 2015,
   based on a logistic regression with predictors of sex and age group at
   August 2010. Results: HIV prevalence increased from 21\% at baseline to
   23\% in the follow-up survey. From a cohort of 1360 individuals, 33
   seroconverted from HIV negative at baseline, giving an overall HIV
   incidence rate of 0.39 per 100 person-years {[}95\% confidence interval
   (CI): 0.28 to 0.57]. The rate for women was 0.44 (95\% CI: 0.30 to
   0.67), double than that for men, 0.21 (95\% CI: 0.10 to 0.51). Incidence
   rate ratios (IRRs) again show women's risk of seroconverting double than
   that of men (IRR = 2.04,Pvalue = 0.098). In past age 60, the IRR of
   seroconversion was significantly lower than that for those in their 40s
   (60-69, IRR = 0.09,Pvalue = 0.002; 70-79, IRR = 0.14,Pvalue = 0.010).
   Conclusions: The risk of acquiring HIV is not zero for people older than
   50 years, especially women. Our findings highlight the importance of
   acknowledging that older people are at high risk of HIV infection and
   that HIV prevention and treatment campaigns must take them into
   consideration.}},

Journal = {{MATERIALS TODAY COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{24}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In this study, a total of five 3D re-entrant honeycomb (RH) specimens
   made of polyamide were fabricated with various configurations by using
   additive manufacturing (AM) technique. Uniaxial quasi-static compressive
   tests were conducted on the RH specimens. The damage modes, the
   stress-strain curves and Poisson's ratios were recorded and analysed.
   The five specimens exhibited negative Poisson's ratios between-0.105
   and-0.193. The effects of geometric parameters on the mechanical
   properties were analysed and discussed. In addition, 3D finite element
   (FE) models were established by using a commercial finite element
   software (ANSYS), and verified by comparing the predicted stress-strain
   curves and deformation patterns with the experimental results.
   Furthermore, an analytical model of 3D RH unit cell under uniaxial
   compression was proposed based on Timoshenko beam theory and large
   deflection beam theory. The proposed analytical model can well predict
   the mechanical properties of 3D RH unit under compression.}},

Abstract = {{The combination of theoretical calculations, computer simulations, and
   experimental evaluation of Poisson's ratio was carried out for
   re-entrant honeycomb auxetic structure. Optimal honeycomb cell
   parameters were determined for 3D-printed samples made from
   thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU). The low-cycle compression tests of
   3D-printed re-entrant honeycomb auxetic samples showed that the
   structure based on auxetic hexagonal cell can withstand almost 1.75
   times more very low cycle fatigue cycles than the similar non-auxetic
   structure. Neither failure nor layer delamination in 3D structures were
   detected in the auxetic sample after 500 compression cycles. 3D-printed
   auxetic structures offer a promising candidate for applications in

Abstract = {{This work describes the behavior of a novel class of hierarchical
   slotted and asymmetrical edge cellular shapes honeycombs with auxetic
   and non-auxetic configurations subjected to edgewise compression.
   Hierarchical (slotted) and non-hierarchical specimens including
   hexagonal, re-entrant and asymmetric re-entrant have been 3D printed by
   using PLA plastic and tested under edgewise compression along the
   in-plane directions. The material properties of the PLA plastics have
   been determined via tensile tests, and Finite Element analyses have been
   performed using the LS-DYNA code to benchmark force-displacement curves
   with the experimental results. The numerical models were validated by
   comparing the load-displacement responses with the experimental results
   for each sample. Linear elastic properties, crashworthiness and energy
   absorption capability of the novel honeycomb structures are evaluated
   from the experimental and numerical standpoint. Specific metrics like
   compressive normalized modulus, compressive strength and specific energy
   absorption (SEA) are evaluated. The Poisson's ratio of the novel
   honeycomb configurations has been evaluated and the impact of the
   deformation mechanisms of the different cellular shapes during
   crashworthiness has been studied. The results show that the use of the
   slotted and asymmetric cells proposed in this work could increase
   strength, stiffness and energy absorption capacity and also increase the
   stability of the samples during deformation.}},

Abstract = {{This study attempted to maximize the cell proliferation by delivering
   effective physical stimulation to cells by creating a negative Poisson's
   ratio by modifying the shape of the pores of the scaffold to cause
   effective bone cell proliferation in bone tissue regeneration. Polymer
   and ceramic materials used as scaffolds are poly(lactic-co-glycolic
   acid) (PLGA), hydroxyapatite (HA), and beta-tricalcium phosphate
   (beta-TCP). The support was prepared by salt leaching to provide an
   environment for cell survival, seeding MG-63 cells, and stimulating the
   support with a negative Poisson's ratio so that the cells were
   sufficiently stimulated. In the case of the control (PLGA/HA) support
   specimen, the cell proliferation rate when compressed stimulation was
   applied was about 21.4, 25.8, and 39.9\% higher than the proliferation
   rate without stimulation over 1, 3, and 5 days, respectively. The
   results showed that the experimental group (PLGA/HA/beta-TCP) scaffold
   specimens showed high results of 37.6, 57.7 and 71.6\% when compression
   stimulation was applied. This means that the PLGA/HA/beta-TCP scaffolds,
   which replaced the amount of HA with beta-TCP about 40\%, helped the
   growth of bone cells by about 30\%, compared with the previous study
   PLGA/HA composite scaffolds in compression stimulation.}},

   with a Star Structure}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{17}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Elastic metamaterials have promising applications in wave control and
   vibration isolation, due to their extraordinary characteristics, e.g.,
   negative Poisson ratio, band gaps, effective negative mass density and
   effective negative modulus. How to develop new functional metamaterials
   using a special structure has always been a hot topic in this field. In
   this study, a three-dimensional (3D) star structure is designed to
   construct metamaterials with both negative static and dynamic
   properties. The results show that the 3D star structure formed a wide
   band gap at lower frequency and had a negative Poisson's ratio.
   Different from conventional acoustic metamaterials, the main physical
   mechanism behind the low-frequency band gap of the 3D star structure is
   the resonance mode formed by the bending deformation of each rib plate,
   which made it easier to achieve effective isolation of low-frequency
   elastic waves with a low mass density. In addition, many structural
   parameters of the 3D star structure can be modulated to effectively
   adjust the band gap frequency by changing the angle between the concave
   nodes and aspect ratio. This study provides a new way to design the 3D
   acoustic metamaterials and develop the lightweight vibration isolation
   devices.}},

Title = {{Geometric Non-Linear Analysis of Auxetic Hybrid Laminated Beams
   Containing CNT Reinforced Composite Materials}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{17}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In the current work, a novel hybrid laminate with negative Poisson's
   ratio (NPR) is developed by considering auxetic laminate which is
   composed of carbon nanotube-reinforced composite (CNTRC) and
   fiber-reinforced composite (FRC) materials. The maximum magnitude of
   out-of-plane NPR is identified in the case of (20(F)/20 (c)/-20 (c)/20
   (c))(S)laminate as well. Meanwhile, a method for the geometric
   non-linear analysis of hybrid laminated beam with NPR including the
   non-linear bending, free, and forced vibrations is proposed. The beam
   deformation is modeled by combining higher-order shear-deformation
   theory (HSDT) and large deflection theory. Based on a two-step
   perturbation approach, the asymptotic solutions of the governing
   equations are obtained to capture the linear and non-linear frequencies
   and load-deflection curves. Moreover, a two-step perturbation
   methodology in conjunction with fourth-order Runge-Kutta method is
   employed to solve the forced-vibration problem. Several key factors,
   such as CNT distribution, variations in the elastic foundation, and
   thermal stress, are considered in the exhaustive analysis. Theoretical
   results for some particular cases are given to examine the geometric
   non-linearity behavior of hybrid beam with NPR as well as positive
   Poisson's ratio (PPR).}},

Abstract = {{Background Since October, 2017 (and until October, 2020), pre-exposure
   prophylaxis (PrEP) has only been available in England, UK, through the
   PrEP Impact Trial, by purchasing it from some genitourinary medicine
   clinics, or via online sources. Here we report changes from 2013 to 2018
   in PrEP and postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) awareness and use among
   HIV-negative gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM)
   and assess predictors of PrEP initiation.
   Methods In the prospective cohort study Attitudes to, and Understanding
   of Risk of Acquisition of HIV 2 (AURAH2), MSM were recruited from three
   sexual health clinics in England: two in London and one in Brighton, UK.
   Men were eligible if they were aged 18 years or older and HIV-negative
   or of unknown HIV status. Participants self-completed a baseline paper
   questionnaire at one of the three clinics between July 30, 2013, and
   April 30, 2016, and were subsequently able to complete 4-monthly and
   annual online questionnaires, which were available between March 1,
   2015, and March 31, 2018, and collected information on
   sociodemographics, health and wellbeing, HIV status, and sexual
   behaviours. PrEP and PEP use in the previous 12 months was obtained at
   baseline and in annual questionnaires. We assessed trends over calendar
   time in 3-month periods from first enrolment to the end of the study
   period (July-December, 2013, was counted as one period) in use of PrEP
   and PEP using generalised estimating equation logistic models. We used
   age-adjusted Poisson models to assess factors associated with PrEP
   initiation among participants who reported never having used PrEP at
   baseline.
   Findings 1162 men completed a baseline questionnaire, among whom the
   mean age was 34 years (SD 10.4), and of those with available data, 942
   (82\%) of 1150 were white, 1076 (94\%) of 1150 were gay, and 857 (74\%)
   of 1159 were university educated. 622 (54\%) of 1162 men completed at
   least one follow-up online questionnaire, of whom 483 (78\%) completed
   at least one annual questionnaire. Overall, PrEP use in the past year
   increased from 0\% (none of 28 respondents) in July to December, 2013,
   to 43\% (23 of 53) in January to March, 2018. The corresponding increase
   in PrEP use among men who reported condomless sex with two or more
   partners was from 0\% (none of 13 respondents) to 78\% (21 of 27). PEP
   use peaked in April to June, 2016, at 28\% (41 of 147 respondents), but
   decreased thereafter to 8\% (four of 53) in January to March, 2018.
   Among 460 men who had never used PrEP at baseline, predictors of
   initiating PrEP included age 40-44 years (incidence rate ratio {[}IRR]
   4.25, 95\% CI 1.14-15.79) and 45 years and older (3.59, 1.08-11.97)
   versus younger than 25 years; and after adjustment for age, recent HIV
   test (5.17, 1.89-14.08), condomless sex (5.01, 2.16-11.63), condomless
   sex with two or more partners (5.43, 2.99-9.86), group sex (1.69,
   1.01-2.84), and non-injection chemsex-related drugs use (2.86,
   1.67-4.91) in the past 3 months, PEP use (4.69, 2.83-7.79) in the past
   12 months, and calendar year (Jan 1, 2017, to March 31, 2018 vs July 30,
   2013, to Dec 31, 2015: 21.19, 9.48-47.35). Non-employment (0.35,
   0.14-0.91) and unstable or no housing (vs homeowner 0.13, 0.02-0.95)
   were associated with reduced rates of PrEP initiation after adjustment
   for age. About half of PrEP was obtained via the internet, even after
   the PrEP Impact trial had started (11 {[}48\%] of 23 respondents in
   January to March, 2018).
   Interpretation PrEP awareness and use increased substantially from 2013
   to 2018 among a cohort of MSM in England. Improving access to PrEP by
   routine commissioning by National Health Service England could increase
   PrEP use among all eligible MSM, but should include public health
   strategies to target socioeconomic and demographic disparities in
   knowledge and use of PrEP. Copyright (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published

Abstract = {{Anti-collision beam of front door has significant influence on occupant
   protection and side crashworthiness. In order to improve the
   comprehensive side impact performance of vehicle, this work proposes a
   novel negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) door anti-collision beam based on
   star-shaped cellular structural material, and optimizes it by a
   reliability-based optimization scheme. First, the parametric model of
   NPR anti-collision beam, vehicle model assembling NPR beam, occupant
   restraint system model and side collision model are established. Then,
   the basic mechanical properties of the NPR structure are investigated
   under considering the axial normal force, transverse shear force and
   bending moment of each rod, and the macro performance of NPR beam are
   analyzed. Next, a deterministic optimization integrating optimal Latin
   hypercube sampling (OLHS) method, response surface model (RSM) and
   NSGA-II algorithm is conducted to improve the performance of novel NPR
   beam. Finally, considering the uncertainties of design variables, a
   reliability-based optimization is further executed to enhance the
   robustness of the deterministic optimization by using Design for Six
   Sigma (DFSS) method. Simulation results show that the ultimate optimized
   NPR anti-collision beam can not only ameliorate driver's protection and
   side crashworthiness, but also ensure the reliability and lightweight

Title = {{Chiral two-dimensional periodic blocky materials with elastic
   interfaces: Auxetic and acoustic properties}},
Journal = {{EXTREME MECHANICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{39}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Two novel chiral block lattice topologies are here conceived having
   interesting auxetic and acoustic behavior. The architectured chiral
   material is made up of a periodic repetition of square or hexagonal
   rigid and heavy blocks connected by linear elastic interfaces, whose
   chirality results from an equal rotation of the blocks with respect to
   the line connecting their centroids. The governing equation of the
   Lagrangian model is derived and a hermitian eigenproblem is formulated
   to obtain the frequency band structure. An equivalent micropolar
   continuum is analytically derived through a standard continualization
   approach in agreement with the procedure proposed by Bacigalupo and
   Gambarotta (2017) from which an approximation of the frequency spectrum
   is obtained. Moreover, the overall elastic moduli of the equivalent
   Cauchy continuum are obtained in closed form via a proper condensation
   procedure. The parametric analysis involving the overall elastic moduli
   of the Cauchy equivalent continuum model and the frequency band
   structure is carried out to catch the influence of the chirality angle
   and of the ratio between the tangential and normal stiffness of the
   interface. Finally, it is shown how chirality and interface stiffness
   may affect strong auxeticity and how the equivalent micropolar model
   provides dispersion curves in excellent agreement with the current ones
   for a wide range of the wave vector magnitude. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the problem of noise-to-state practical
   stability in mean (NSpS-M) (which is a natural generalization of
   noise-to-state stability in mean) and the problem of almost sure global
   asymptotic stability (GAS a.s.) for a class of random nonlinear
   time-varying impulsive switched systems. By using the notions of average
   impulsive switched interval and Poisson process, unified sufficient
   stability criteria on NSpS-M and GAS a.s. are derived. Two remarkable
   distinctions from the existing results lie in that: (1) stabilizing,
   inactive and destabilizing impulses are simultaneously considered; (2)
   the coefficient of the derivative of a Lyapunov function is allowed to
   be a time-varying function which can be both positive and negative and
   may even be unbounded. As an accompaniment, a less conservative unified
   criterion on NSpS-M for a special case is also presented by taking into
   account the stabilization role of the gain constant of the time-varying
   coefficient. Two examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness
   of our derived criteria.}},

Title = {{Crashworthiness of novel concentric auxetic reentrant honeycomb with
   negative Poisson's ratio biologically inspired by coconut palm}},
Journal = {{THIN-WALLED STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{154}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Lightweight auxetic reentrant honeycombs (ARH) with negative Poisson's
   ratio (NPR) are very promising for crashworthiness applications due to
   high specific-strength and energy-absorption (EA). To dig up the
   potential of ARH, a bio-inspired self-similar ``concentric auxetic
   reentrant honeycomb (CARH){''} is proposed to reinforce the EA. Finite
   element model is established and verified via available reference
   results for quasi-static-, low-, medium- and high-velocity compression.
   Two types of CARHs including CARH-I and CARH-II are designed to
   systematically explore the crashworthiness. The quasi-static and dynamic
   compression behaviors and EA characteristics are compared among
   different structures. There is a harvest that the bio-inspired CARHs
   show higher plateau stress and EA than the traditional ARH, while
   CARH-II > CARH-I. To clearly understand strengthening mechanisms,
   different global and unicellular shrinkage deformation modes (e.g.,
   ``x{''}, ``X{''}, ``I{''}, ``V{''}, etc.) are revealed under different
   velocities. Summarily, the enhancement is due to coupling deformation
   and energy-dissipation of more plastic-hinges. The horizontal strain of
   each layer is studied to reveal the NPR effect, which shows a
   significant velocity effect on the horizontal strain. From parametric
   studies, typical parameters (e.g. wall-thickness, distance and number of
   concentric walls) have considerable effects on crashworthiness of CARH.
   The present bio-inspired design and findings offer a reference for the
   development of honeycomb with special functions.}},

Journal = {{THIN-WALLED STRUCTURES}},

Abstract = {{Honeycombs based composites are applied in a wide spectrum of
   applications. In the present study, the performance of novel foam
   concrete filled auxetic aluminium honeycombs subjected to quasi-static
   and low velocity compression is experimentally and numerically
   investigated. The response mode, crushing resistance and energy
   absorption capacity of hollow and foam concrete filled auxetic
   honeycombs are experimentally studied under quasi-static and low
   velocity loading. Numerical models, validated with the test results, are
   employed in parametric study to further examine the performance. If
   properly designed, the interaction between the auxetic honeycomb and
   foam concrete reinforces each other, making the two components to work
   in synergy. It is found that the response modes of the composites change
   from compression failure with low peak stress and stable plateau stress
   to shear failure with high peak stress and severely fluctuated plateau
   stress with increasing foam concrete density. The response of foam
   concrete filled honeycombs gradually transforms from the quasi-static
   mode with global deformation to dynamic mode with localized crushing
   near loading end, and the effective Poisson's ratio of the composites
   decreases, both with increasing compression speed.}},

Title = {{Modeling the service-route-based crash frequency by a
   spatiotemporal-random-effect zero-inflated negative binomial model: An
   empirical analysis for bus-involved crashes}},
Journal = {{ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{144}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Previous studies related to bus crash frequencies modeling are limited
   and the statistical models are usually developed at the road segment or
   zonal level. This study focuses on modeling crash frequencies
   specifically at the bus-service-route level, which is useful and
   important to policymakers and bus operation companies toward the
   improvement of the safety level of bus networks, especially for
   developing countries where buses are still a major mode of urban
   travels. Using the observed data adopted from one of the bus operating
   companies in Beijing, China, we proposed a spatiotemporal-random-effect
   zero-inflated negative binomial (spatiotemporal ZINB) model to
   investigate bus crash occurrence and identity key influential factors at
   the bus-service-route level. The model was motivated to accommodate the
   special statistical characteristics of the excessive zeros and, more
   importantly, the potential spatiotemporal correlations of the data.
   Three degenerated versions of this model were also developed for
   comparison purposes. Results indicate that the proposed spatiotemporal
   ZINB model is statistically superior to the others according to a
   comprehensive judgment based on the EAIC, EBIC, and RMSE criteria. The
   estimated coefficients reveal the impacts of related factors on the
   likelihood of bus-involved crashes from bus operation factors including
   total passengers, number of drivers, and proportion of male drivers as
   well as planning factors including route length and stop density. On the
   other hand, the standard deviations of the introduced structured and
   unstructured spatiotemporal random-effects are statistically significant
   indicating that the observations are correlated within each route,
   between neighbor routes and across years. Corresponding policy and
   practical implications are provided for bus operating companies and
   planning departments toward the improvement of bus safety.}},

   mechanism of borophene with defects}},
Journal = {{THIN SOLID FILMS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{709}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{In this work, we used molecular dynamics simulations to study the effect
   of vacancy defects and impurity defects on the tensile properties of
   monolayer borophene under uniaxial tension. The effects of the number of
   point defects and defect angle on the fracture behavior and the tensile
   properties were investigated under different tensile strains along the
   zigzag direction and armchair direction. Furthermore, the impact of
   temperature on their mechanical properties has been analyzed and
   discussed. We find that borophene has anisotropic properties, Young's
   modulus of the borophene nanosheet at 1 K is 165.03 Nm(-1) in the zigzag
   direction and 390.02 Nm(-1) in the armchair direction. The borophene has
   a negative Poisson's ratio in the direction perpendicular to the atomic
   plane. The mechanical strength and the ultimate strain of borophene
   decrease as increasing the temperature. Moreover, the stress
   concentration around the vacancy defect leads to the initial crack
   formed at the vacancy position and the reduction of the fracture
   strength. If increasing the dimension of the vacancies projected onto
   the direction, which is perpendicular to the tensile direction, the
   fracture strength, fracture strain, and Young's modulus will decrease.
   Besides, the mechanical strength of borophene is reduced by the
   substitutional C atoms defects. With the angle defect of theta = 60
   degrees the fracture of nanosheet which has C impurity defects easier
   occurs than the angle defect of theta = 0 degrees in both zigzag and
   armchair tensile directions.}},

Abstract = {{The anisotropic mechanical properties of Tl4Ag18Te11 compound was
   investigated elaborately for the first time by using Density Functional
   Theory calculations with the Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package in this
   work. Tl4Ag18Te11 compound was optimized in the I4mm space group and the
   formation energy was determined as a negative value that is the
   indication of the experimental synthesizability of this compound. The
   optimized crystal structure was employed for the calculations of the
   elastic constants and the obtained values revealed the mechanical
   stability of Tl4Ag18Te11 compound. The polycrystalline properties were
   determined such as shear modulus, Poisson's ratio, etc. In addition, the
   anisotropic elastic properties were presented. The direction dependent
   sound waves velocities, polarization of the sound waves, enhancement
   factor and the power flow angle were determined. The thermal
   conductivity studies were performed and the minimum thermal conductivity
   (0.259 W m(-1)K(-1)) and the diffusion thermal conductivity (0.202 W
   m(-1)K(-1)) were calculated. This study illustrates the capability of
   this compound for the thermoelectric materials.}},

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{148}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In this study, the mechanical performance of a three-dimensional (3D)
   re-entrant structure subjected to dynamic compression was experimentally
   investigated using a high-speed Instron machine. Quasi-static tests were
   conducted for comparison. All samples were fabricated by multi-jet
   fusion technology. A finite element (FE) model was developed using
   ABAQUS/Explicit and validated against the dynamic test results in terms
   of deformation mode, plateau stress, and Poisson's ratio. The validated
   FE model was subsequently employed to study the effects of the number of
   unit cells, geometrical parameters (aspect ratio, H/L, and re-entrant
   angle, theta) of the re-entrant unit cell, and compressive velocity. The
   results showed that the structure with H/L = 1 and theta = 45 degrees
   had the highest specific energy absorption (SEA) when compressed in the
   Z direction and the structure with H/L = 1.1 and theta = 75 degrees had
   the highest SEA when compressed in the X direction. Moreover, the
   performance of the 3D re-entrant structure was compared with that of a
   2D re-entrant structure with the same geometrical parameters. The energy
   absorption of the 3D re-entrant structure was also compared with other
   popular cellular structures using an Ashby chart.}},

Title = {{Compression and shear behaviour of graded chiral auxetic structures}},
Journal = {{MECHANICS OF MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{148}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Graded chiral auxetic cellular metal structures were produced from
   copper alloy powder using Selective Electron Beam Melting (SEBM)
   technique and tested under compressive and shear loading conditions. The
   predesigned geometry of chiral structures has a variable chiral
   amplitude through the length of the specimens, which results in graded
   porosity of the analyzed auxetic structures. The deformation mechanisms
   and mechanical response were evaluated with compression and shear
   testing at two loading velocities. The infrared thermography has been
   used to track the evolution of plastic deformation in the specimens. The
   deformation process under compression loading starts in the area with
   the largest chiral amplitude and then continues through the whole height
   of the specimen. The shear loading shows two significantly different
   groups of responses, which are affected by local defects causing the
   start of failure in different parts of structure. The results of
   experimental testing were further used for validation of developed
   finite element models of chiral structures. The influence of graded
   porosity on the mechanical response of chiral structures was evaluated
   with parametric computational simulations and compared to the non-graded
   structure with constant chiral amplitude and same weight. The non-graded
   auxetic structure offers a stiffer response due to deformation uniformly
   distributed through the height of the specimens but fails abruptly at
   lower strains.}},

Title = {{Chiral constrained stent: Effect of structural design on the mechanical
   and intravascular stent deployment performances}},
Journal = {{MECHANICS OF MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{148}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The high mortality of atherosclerosis-caused cardiovascular disease has
   promoted the requirement of designing novel intravascular stents with
   comprehensive robust mechanical performances, which is critical for
   re-constructing the blocked artery and recovering the biomechanical
   functions of artery vessels during vascular interventional therapy
   procedures. In this study, a chiral constrained structure with
   zero/negative Poisson's ratio and robust expansion transformation
   ability is proposed through combining the axial constraint effect of
   tetrachiral element and the good stretchability of oscillating wave
   element along circumferential direction. Afterwards, through applying
   the theoretical prediction, experimental tests and finite element
   analysis, the mechanical properties and stenting performances of the
   chiral constrained structure are explored. The modified tetrachiral
   topology shows strong orthotropic after integration of oscillating wave
   strut profile, indicating its capability of handling radial loads
   without great longitudinal recoil (foreshortening). Finally, stent
   deployment performances have been evaluated through a highly nonlinear
   coupling analysis of the stenosed vessels system, in terms of
   transformation characteristics, dogboning, radial recoil,
   foreshortening, and plaque prolapse ratio, etc. Especially, remarkable
   non-conventional performances of anti-dogboning and anti-foreshortening
   are identified in chiral constrained stent. Synthetically index is
   generated to compensate the competing behaviors among the above terms,
   and to improve the comprehensive mechanical performances of chiral
   constrained stent. These results show the potential in generating a new
   family of the intravascular stent with chiral mechanical metamaterials
   and provide a promising clinical application in curing atherosclerosis.}},

Title = {{Design and characterization of 3D AuxHex lattice structures}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{181}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel three dimensional (3D) AuxHex lattice structure
   consisting of auxetic re-entrant and hexagonal components is proposed.
   Theoretical models of elastic constants and quasi-static plateau stress
   are established which indicate that the AuxHex lattice structures have
   zero Poisson's ratio and better energy absorption capacity than
   traditional auxetic re-entrant cellular structures. Numerical simulation
   is also used to study the mechanical properties of 3D AuxHex lattice
   structures, which presents good agreements with theoretical models. The
   experimental specimens are fabricated via 3D printing technique and the
   compression tests are also carried out to validate the accuracy of
   theoretical models and numerical simulations. To overcome the problem of
   unstable quasi-static crushing of 3D AuxHex structures with thin struts
   (low relative density), the hybrid stable AuxHex lattice (HSAL)
   structure is designed by inserting auxiliary structure to AuxHex lattice
   to make the AuxHex structures more stable and obtain higher energy
   absorption efficiency. The influence of material gradient index is
   investigated numerically, which shows the positive and negative
   gradients have different effects on the energy absorption behavior under
   various loading conditions.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{Waste plastics are often indiscriminately disposed into the built
   environment and sometimes voyaged into the sea, constitute nuisance to
   the built environment and disturb aquatic life. These threats have
   birthed researches for the promotion of circular economy in plastic
   waste management. However, few studies have investigated the use of
   waste plastic in the production of eco-bricks. This study examined the
   effect of moisture content and soil types on the characterisation of
   eco-bricks under compressive load. Samples of eco-bricks were produced
   using laterite, sharp sand and stone dust at 0\%, 5\%, 10\%, 15\% and
   20\% moisture contents as infill materials. The soil samples were tested
   of specific gravity, fineness modulus and uniformity coefficient
   computation to determine the suitability of the samples, while the
   eco-bricks produced with the soil samples were subjected to compressive
   load. The study found a positive relationship between soil moisture
   content and compressive strength of eco-bricks produced with sharp sand
   and stone dust while the compressive strength of laterite bottle bricks
   had a negative relationship with the moisture content. Also, the
   specific strength, Poisson's ratio and bulk density of the eco-bricks
   were satisfactory at varying soil moisture contents. The study concludes
   that soil moisture content affects the performance of bottle bricks and
   adequate consideration for soil types in the production of eco-bricks is
   paramount. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Literature on the mechanical performance of additively manufactured (AM)
   negative Poisson's ratio (-nu) structures has been primarily focused on
   beam-based re-entrant structures with chevron crosslinks. The walled
   variants of this architecture have been shown to exhibit lateral
   instability. This is where a layered framework can be advantageous as
   they provide increased lateral stability. Much less is known regarding
   the behaviour of such architecture, let alone their thin/thick-walled
   variants. This study explores the influence of design parameters namely
   wall thickness (t) and angle (theta) on the mechanical performance of
   thin and thick-walled inherently stable -nu. lattices. The design is
   achieved through conceiving linearly arranged AlSi10Mg re-entrant
   unit-cells while discarding the traditional chevron crosslinks. The
   printed prototypes were experimentally tested and response surface (RS)
   models were generated to study the parametric influence on the elastic
   modulus (E), compressive strength (sigma(c)), failure strain
   (epsilon(f)), -nu and relative density (rho(r)). The results demonstrate
   that both thin- and thick-walled structures exhibit. of -0.108 to -0.257
   despite the interaction effects between t and theta. The elastic modulus
   can be increased by either increasing t or theta without considering the
   interaction effects at 0.3 <= t <= 1 mm and 45 degrees <= 0 <= 85
   degrees. This study presents a new understanding regarding the
   fabrication and performance of re-entrant structures by AM.}},

Title = {{In-plane impact resistance enhancement with a graded cell-wall angle
   design for auxetic metamaterials}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{247}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic metamaterials have demonstrated promising applications in
   crushing energy absorption. This paper proposes cell-wall angle graded
   auxetic metamaterials and investigates the potential benefits to
   in-plane impact resistance by using dynamic finite element analysis. It
   is the first study on enhancing impact resistant ability of auxetic
   metamaterials by using the cell-wall angle graded design. Firstly, the
   effectiveness of this graded design for enhanced energy absorption is
   uncovered and the underlying mechanism is discussed. Then, various
   influencing factors, including impact velocity, magnitude of cell-wall
   angle gradient, cell-wall thickness, are explored in details, and the
   results for the graded structures and uniform structures are compared.
   The experiment testing is also conducted to validate the initial
   simulation model by using a 3D printed specimen of the graded design. It
   is discovered that for the impact with a quasi-static or low velocity,
   the angle graded design could always deliver an enhanced energy
   absorption. Also, with the increase of the impact speed, the enhanced
   energy absorption could only happen when the crushing direction is along
   the structural weak-to-strong direction. The results shed light on a new
   approach to realize the application potential of mechanical
   metamaterials.}},

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{83}},
Month = {{SEP-OCT}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a stiffening method by which new inclined walls are
   added to the classical re-entrant honeycomb cell. This modification
   boosts the in-plane rigidity of the re-entrant cell without significant
   loss from auxetic behaviour. This study focuses on the in-plane
   elasticity moduli and negative Poisson's ratios along the principal
   axes. Analytical expressions that calculate the elasticity moduli and
   negative Poisson's ratios are derived; both finite element modelling and
   experiments reported in the literature validate the expressions of this
   work. Further, the variation in the in-plane elastic properties of the
   core cell is examined by altering the new wall's geometric, sectional,
   and material parameters. The results from the analytical expressions and
   the finite element models match very closely and demonstrate the boosted
   rigidity of the cell proposed in this work. This work also provides a
   benchmark of the new cell against the classical cell that can be used to
   tailor the in-plane elasticity moduli and negative Poisson's ratios to
   suit the needs of different applications.}},

Journal = {{BIRTH DEFECTS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{113}},
Number = {{2, SI}},
Pages = {{161-172}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{Background Causes of most birth defects are largely unknown. Genetics,
   maternal factors (e.g., age, smoking) and environmental exposures have
   all been linked to some birth defects, including neural tube, oral
   cleft, limb reduction, and gastroschisis; however, the contribution of
   cumulative exposures across several environmental domains in association
   with these defects is not well understood. Methods The Environmental
   Quality Index (EQI) and its domains (air, water, land, sociodemographic,
   built) were used to estimate county-level cumulative environmental
   exposures from 2006-2010 and matched to birth defects identified from
   Texas Birth Defects Registry and live birth records from births in years
   2007-2010 (N= 1,610,709). Poisson regression models estimated prevalence
   ratios (PR) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) for associations between
   10 birth defects and the EQI. Results We observed some positive
   associations between worst environmental quality and neural tube,
   anencephaly, spina bifida, oral cleft, cleft palate, cleft lip with and
   without cleft palate, and gastroschisis {[}PR range: 1.12-1.55], but
   near null associations with limb reduction defects. Among domain
   specific results, we observed the strongest positive associations with
   the sociodemographic domain across birth defects but varied positive
   associations among the air and water domains, and negative or null
   associations with the land and built domains. Overall, few
   exposure-response patterns were evident. Conclusions Our results
   highlight the complexities of cumulative, simultaneous environmental
   exposures in the prevalence rates of 10 selected birth defects. We were
   able to explore the impact of overall and domain specific environmental
   quality on birth defects and identify potential domain specific drivers
   of these associations.}},

Abstract = {{The determination of the full crystal structure of the uranyl sulfate
   mineral uranopilite, (UO2)(6)(SO4)O-2(OH)(6)center dot 14H(2)O,
   including the positions of the hydrogen atoms within the corresponding
   unit cell, has not been feasible to date due to the poor quality of its
   X-ray diffraction pattern. In this paper, the complete crystal structure
   of uranopilite is established for the first time by means of first
   principles solid-state calculations based in density functional theory
   employing a large plane wave basis set and pseudopotential functions.
   The computed unit-cell parameters and structural data for the
   non-hydrogen atoms are in excellent agreement with the available
   experimental data. The computed X-ray diffraction pattern is also in
   satisfactory agreement with the experimental pattern. The infrared
   spectrum of uranopilite is collected from a natural crystal specimen
   originating in Jachymov (Czech Republic) and computed employing density
   functional perturbation theory. The theoretical and experimental
   vibrational spectra are highly consistent. Therefore, a full assignment
   of the bands in the experimental infrared spectrum is performed using a
   normal mode analysis of the first principles vibrational results. One
   overtone and six combination bands are recognized in the infrared
   spectrum. The elasticity tensor and phonon spectra of uranopilite are
   computed from the optimized crystal structure and used to analyze its
   mechanical stability, to obtain a rich set of elastic properties and to
   derive its fundamental thermodynamic properties as a function of
   temperature. Uranopilite is shown to have a large mechanical anisotropy
   and to exhibit the negative Poisson's ratio and negative linear
   compressibility phenomena. The calculated specific heat and entropy at
   298.15 K are 179.6 and 209.0 J K(-1)mol(-1), respectively. The computed
   fundamental thermodynamic functions of uranopilite are employed to
   obtain its thermodynamic functions of formation in terms of the elements
   and the thermodynamic properties of a set of chemical reactions relating
   uranopilite with a representative group of secondary phases of spent
   nuclear fuel. From the reaction thermodynamic data, the relative
   stability of uranopilite with respect to these secondary phases is
   evaluated as a function of temperature and under different hydrogen
   peroxide concentrations. From the results, it follows that uranopilite
   has a very large thermodynamic stability in the presence of hydrogen
   peroxide. The high stability of uranopilite under this condition justify
   its early crystallization in the paragenetic sequence of secondary
   phases occurring when uranium dioxide is exposed to sulfur-rich
   solutions.}},

Abstract = {{The complex cellular structure of trabecular bone possesses lightweight

   printed bone-like cellular structure. This is achieved by conducting
   extensive analytical simulations of the bone-inspired unit cell in
   parallel to traverse every possible combination of its key design
   parameters. The analytical framework is validated using experimental
   data and used to evolve the most optimal cellular structure, with the
   maximum energy absorption as the key performance criterion. The design
   charts developed in this work can be used to guide the development of a

Abstract = {{The objective of the study is 2-fold. First, it estimates the 2019 new
   coronavirus disease (COVID19) flattening curve using Panel Random
   Coefficient Model. This allows each country to have its trajectory while
   allowing for random error effects to transfer across countries. Second,
   it calculates the expected number of days to reach the flattening point

   policies around the world using Poisson regression. This study avails
   global COVID19 incidence data for 190 countries between January 22, 2020
   and May 11, 2020. In the absence of a vaccine or of more appropriate
   treatment options, non-pharmaceutical approaches must be used to control
   the spread of the COVID19. This study proposed that the contact tracing,
   stay at home restrictions and international movement restrictions are
   most effective in controlling the spread and flattening the COIVD19
   curve. At the same time, habits that hurt the immune system like smoking
   have a negative effect on the flattening of the curve. The government
   should integrate these policies in their lockdown plan to make it smart

   those married/cohabiting (RR 3.95 {[}95\% CI 1.97-7.91], as compared to
   single) and prescribed ART (RR 2.27 {[}95\% CI 1.07-4.83]). No
   differences in self-reported stigma indicators were observed by
   disclosure status to MSP but disclosure to FSP was associated with a
   lower likelihood of ever having been assaulted (26.5\% versus 45.2\%,
   p=0.042).ConclusionsHIV status disclosure to sexual partners was
   uncommon among Nigerian MSM and TGW living with HIV but was associated
   with improved HIV care outcomes. Disclosure was not associated with
   substantially increased experiences of stigma. Strategies to encourage
   HIV status disclosure may improve HIV management outcomes in these
   highly-marginalized populations with a high burden of HIV infection.}},

Abstract = {{Aims This study explores the differences in sickness absence trends in
   women according to reproductive age group and medical diagnoses. Methods
   Data were obtained from two administrative registries: the Continuous
   Working Life Sample and the Catalonian Institute of Medical Evaluations
   from 2012 to 2014, containing 47,879 female employees. Incidence rates
   and incidence risk ratios derived from Poisson and negative binomial
   models were calculated to compare sickness absence trends among
   reproductive age groups based on Catalonian birthrates:
   early-reproductive (25-34 years old), middle-reproductive (35-44) and
   late-reproductive (45-54), according to diagnostic groups, selected
   diseases, type of contract, occupational category, and country of
   origin. Results Younger women show a higher incidence of overall
   sickness absence compared to late-reproductive-aged women. Incidence
   risk ratios of sickness absence decreased significantly from
   early-reproductive to late-reproductive age for low back pain,
   hemorrhage in early pregnancy, nausea and vomiting, and abdominal and
   pelvic pain. Discussion The higher incidence of sickness absence due to
   pregnancy-related health conditions in early-reproductive women compared
   to other reproductive age groups, may explain the sickness absence
   differences by age in women. Proper management of sickness absence
   related to pregnancy should be a goal to reduce the sickness absence gap
   between younger and older women.}},

Title = {{HIV serologically indeterminate individuals: Future HIV status and risk

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 26}},
Abstract = {{Background Indeterminate HIV test results are common, but little is
   known about the evolution of indeterminate serology and its
   sociodemographic and behavioral correlates. We assessed future HIV
   serological outcomes for individuals with indeterminate results and
   associated factors in Rakai, Uganda. Methods 115,944 serological
   results, defined by two enzyme immunoassay (EIAs), among 39,440
   individuals aged 15-49 years in the Rakai Community Cohort Study were
   assessed. Indeterminate results were defined as contradictory EIAs.
   Modified Poisson regression models with generalized estimating equations
   were used to assess prevalence ratios (PRs) of subsequent HIV
   serological outcomes and factors associated with HIV indeterminate
   results. Results The prevalence of HIV serologically indeterminate
   results was 4.9\%. Indeterminate results were less likely among women
   than men (adjPR 0.76, 95\% CI 0.71,0.81), in unmarried participants than
   married participants (adjPR 0.92, 95\% CI 0.85,99), and in individuals
   with primary (adjPR 0.90, 95\% CI 0.80,1.02), secondary (adjPR 0.83,
   95\% CI 0.73,0.96) and post-secondary (adjPR 0.75, 95\% CI 0.60,0.94)
   education, relative to no education. The proportions of persons with
   indeterminate results progressing to HIV positive, negative or
   indeterminate results in subsequent visits was 5\%, 71\% and 24\%,
   respectively. Conclusion HIV serologically indeterminate results were
   associated with gender and marital status. HIV surveillance programs
   should develop a protocol for reporting individuals with mixed or
   persistently indeterminate HIV results on multiple follow-up visits.
   Most indeterminate results became HIV-negative over time, but follow-up
   is still needed to detect positive serologies.}},

Abstract = {{Five transverse rod (TR)-containing main-chain liquid crystalline
   polymers (LCPs) are examined in both the powder and fiber forms by wide
   angle X-ray diffraction. Data from the diffraction experiments are
   consistent with the site-connectivity-driven TR-reorientation mechanism
   for intrinsic auxetic character in these macromolecules. Shifts in peak
   maxima, intensity distributions in the interchain interaction region,
   and calculated volume increase accompanying fiber formation are all in
   line with expectations from considerations of this mechanism. The narrow
   window for experimental conditions necessary for fiber preparation and
   subsequent X-ray observation of this phenomenon is detailed. A close
   examination of space-filling Corey-Pauling-Koltun (CPK) molecular models
   reveals the details of local packing of rods and connected polymer
   chains in the quiescent nematic polymer melt prior to fiber drawing. It
   is found that two rod-reorientation possibilities exist each of which
   leads to increased interchain separation as required for auxetic
   response. Suggestions for future experiments and materials design for

Abstract = {{The Half Heusler alloy (HHA) MnCrP has been studied theoretically for
   structural, elasto-mechanical and phonon properties. The structure is
   optimized and the calculated structural parameters are close to the
   literature. This optimized data is used to estimate three independent
   second-order cubic elastic constants C-11, C-12 and C-44. The mechanical
   stability criteria are explored by these constants and further used to
   estimate the elastic moduli; Young's, bulk and shear modulus. The
   mechanical parameters like Poisson's ratio, Pugh's ratio, anisotropic
   factor, Cauchy pressure, shear constant, Lame's constants, Kleinman
   parameter are also calculated and discussed. Discussions reveal the
   ductile nature, ionic behavior, anisotropic nature and mechanical
   stability of MnCrP. The metallic nature, compressibility, stiffness and
   interatomic forces of material are also described. Furthermore, the
   Debye temperature, where the collective vibrations shifts to an
   independent thermal vibrations, is also calculated. Longitudinal and
   transverse sound velocities are also obtained to investigate the phonon
   modes of oscillation. These phonon modes confirm the stability of the
   alloy as no negative phonon frequencies in the phonon-dispersion curves.
   These curves are used to estimate the reststrahlen band where light
   reflects 100\% and the suitability of material is checked for Far
   Infrared (FIR), photographic, optoelectronic devices and sensors.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose As a kind of common lightweight porous materials, honeycombs
   have a wide range of applications in aerospace, architecture, packaging
   and other fields. In this paper, four types of new gradient honeycombs
   with negative Poisson's ratio are obtained, including angle gradient,
   thickness gradient and functional gradient, which are obtained by
   changing the geometric or physical parameters of cells. Methods The
   dynamic responses of gradient auxetic honeycombs under different impact
   speeds are studied by ABAQUS display dynamic finite element method, and
   the deformation profiles of gradient honeycomb models are obtained. The
   nominal stress-strain curves and energy absorptions of the gradient
   auxetic honeycombs are studied, and the dynamic bearing capacity of the
   four kinds of gradient auxetic honeycombs is further analyzed. Results
   and Conclusion The results obtained in this paper show that the
   thickness of cell walls has a great influence on the impact resistance
   and vibration energy absorption of honeycomb structures. As for gradient
   honeycombs, the angle gradient honeycomb is better than the other three

Abstract = {{The article discusses the 2D problem of manufacturability of the minimum
   compliance designs of the structural elements made of inhomogeneous
   materials of local isotropic or square symmetry properties. The
   available isotropic material design (IMD) and cubic material design
   (CMD) methods deliver the optimal distribution of the elastic moduli
   within the design domain. Within the 2D setting, the cubic symmetry
   reduces to the symmetry of a square. The varying underlying
   microstructures corresponding to the optimal designs are recovered by
   matching the values of the optimal moduli with the values of the
   effective moduli of the representative volume elements (RVEs) computed
   by the asymptotic homogenization method for periodic media. The shape of
   the RVE and its internal symmetries are properly selected providing
   assumed isotropy or symmetry of a square of the homogenized constitutive
   tensor. The microstructure topology is described by parametric
   description of single (or several) fibers in RVE. The periodicity of the
   structure and the final topology of the material within RVE is ensured
   by multiplication of a single fiber in accordance with the symmetries
   adopted for RVE. The ability to model an auxetic behavior within the
   subdomains where the optimal Poisson's ratio assumes negative values is

Abstract = {{Serum albumin is a major determinant of hospitalization in patients with
   end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Previous reports generally use the
   Poisson model to evaluate the relationships between outcome and response
   variables. However, hospitalization data are often overdispersed, and
   few studies using appropriate methods exist in the literature.This
   retrospective cohort study included 426 patients with ESRD receiving
   hemodialysis treatment between 2014 and 2018. Using a negative binomial
   regression model with hierarchical multivariable adjustments, we
   investigated the relationship between serum albumin, hospital
   admissions, and total hospitalization days. Mean age and mean baseline
   serum albumin levels were 64.7 +/- 11 years and 3.5 +/- 0.5 g/dL,
   respectively. At least one hospitalization was identified in 402 (94\%)
   patients. The incidence rate was 1.48 (95\% CI, 1.41-1.56) admissions
   per patient-year during the follow-up period of 5 years. A negative
   linear association was observed between serum albumin and
   hospitalization frequency. Hospitalization rates (95\% CI) were 1.81
   (1.65-1.98), 1.44 (1.3-1.59), 1.36 (1.22-1.51), and 1.33 (1.2-1.48) per
   patient-year in serum albumin levels <= 3, 3.1 to <= 3.3, 3.4 to <= 3.7,
   and >= 3.8 g/dL, respectively. Case mix-adjusted incidence rate ratio
   was 0.82 (95\% CI, 0.70-0.94), while it was robust to further
   adjustments for malnutrition and inflammation markers. Similar results
   were observed in hospitalization days and time to the first
   hospitalization. These findings, which result from the negative binomial
   model using overdispersed data, suggest that lower serum albumin is
   related to increased hospitalization rates and hospital days in incident
   hemodialysis patients.}},

Title = {{Foundations for Soft, Smart Matter by Active Mechanical Metamaterials}},
Journal = {{ADVANCED SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{18}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Emerging interest to synthesize active, engineered matter suggests a
   future where smart material systems and structures operate autonomously
   around people, serving diverse roles in engineering, medical, and
   scientific applications. Similar to biological organisms, a realization
   of active, engineered matter necessitates functionality culminating from
   a combination of sensory and control mechanisms in a versatile material
   frame. Recently, metamaterial platforms with integrated sensing and
   control have been exploited, so that outstanding non-natural material
   behaviors are empowered by synergistic microstructures and controlled by
   smart materials and systems. This emerging body of science around active
   mechanical metamaterials offers a first glimpse at future foundations
   for autonomous engineered systems referred to here as soft, smart
   matter. Using natural inspirations, synergy across disciplines, and
   exploiting multiple length scales as well as multiple physics,
   researchers are devising compelling exemplars of actively controlled
   metamaterials, inspiring concepts for autonomous engineered matter.
   While scientific breakthroughs multiply in these fields, future
   technical challenges remain to be overcome to fulfill the vision of
   soft, smart matter. This Review surveys the intrinsically
   multidisciplinary body of science targeted to realize soft, smart matter
   via innovations in active mechanical metamaterials and proposes ongoing
   research targets that may deliver the promise of autonomous, engineered
   matter to full fruition.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials are a family of rationally designed artificial
   structures that have unique effective properties gained from the
   distribution of the internal architecture rather than of the chemical
   composition. This article used the modified solid isotropic material
   with penalization method for topology optimization of 2D re-entrant
   auxetic structures with different Poisson's ratios and volume fractions.
   The obtained structures were verified by the finite-element method (FEM)
   using the commercial FEM software and also validated by the experimental
   approach. A good agreement was achieved between the experimental and
   numerical results. Then, the cell geometry effect on Poisson's ratio
   under large tension was investigated. Our study revealed that the
   location and stiffness of rotation joints are two new parameters
   affecting Poisson's ratio value. Poisson's ratio will decrease by
   decreasing the stiffness of rotation joints and positioning the rotation
   joints closer to the middle of the structure. So, from the investigation
   of the optimizer performance, it was achieved that re-entrant auxetic
   structures with different Poisson's ratios could be easily designed by
   changing just the location of rotation joints. This will be applicable
   in many applications like sensor field.}},

Abstract = {{Chiral materials may exhibit negative Poisson's ratio and
   deformation-mode coupling phenomena. The finite element numerical method
   is adopted to analyze a class of 2D chiral and nonchiral materials and
   to show the effects of microstructural geometry on their effective
   elastic properties and coupling between tension/compression and bending.
   With the same area fraction (AF), nonchiral samples show larger
   effective moduli than chiral ones. The number of unit cells may reduce
   negativity in effective Poisson's ratio of the chiral samples due to
   nonuniform lateral deformation under uniaxial straining. Increasing AF
   in a hierarchical pattern in the chiral samples makes their Poisson's
   ratio more negative. Bending occurs in the chiral samples when they are
   under uniform, uniaxial, tensile, or compressive straining due to the
   coupling of deformation modes. The sensibility of tension-bending
   coupling may be controlled by the chiral microstructure. Optimization of
   the coupling sensitivity may help develop novel mechanical sensors.}},

   detail, including SiS, SiSe, and Si2SSe. We reveal that the large values
   of negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) make these monolayers promising
   candidates for auxetic materials. Specifically, the in-plane NPR value
   of SiS monolayers reaches up to -0.19 in thexdirection. In addition, the
   electrons in SiS monolayers have remarkably high mobility in
   thexdirection, while the holes prefer to conduct in theydirection.
   Furthermore, under biaxial strain, the bandgaps of all these monolayers
   can be tuned effectively with ranges over 1.2 eV. All these appealing
   properties make SiS monolayers promising candidates for nanomechanic and

Title = {{Combined analytical and numerical approach for auxetic FG-CNTRC plate
   subjected to a sudden load}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING WITH COMPUTERS}},
Abstract = {{In the current work, the dynamic behavior of functionally graded carbon
   nanotube-reinforced composite (FG-CNTRC) plate with negative Poisson's
   ratio (NPR) is investigated by combining higher-order shear deformation
   theory and large deflection theory. First, explicit solutions are
   proposed to predict the effective Poisson's ratio (EPR) of the
   laminates. Taking carbon nanotube-reinforced composite (CNTRC) as an
   example, the maximum NPR is obtained for (+/-theta)(3T) laminate as
   well. Results show that the EPR (v(13)(e), v(23)(e)) can range from a
   positive value of 0.311 to a negative value of 0.63. For the dynamic
   response problem, the asymptotic solutions with a two-step perturbation
   approach are derived for FG-CNTRC plates to capture the relationship
   between the center deflection and time. Several key factors such as
   functionally graded distribution, variations in the elastic foundation,
   and thermal stress produced by changing the temperature field are
   considered in the subsequent analysis. Numerical simulations are carried
   out to examine the corresponding dynamic behavior of FG-CNTRC plates
   when these factors are taken into account.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional porous piezoelectric ceramics can possess superior figures
   of merit only at very high values of porosity, leading to bad
   fragileness, small stiffness, low toughness, and the difficulty of
   polarization. To this end, this study for the first time shows that it
   is possible that the piezoelectric ceramic with ultra-low porosity is
   capable of superior figures of merit based on the concept of auxetic
   piezoelectric ceramics. Owing to the ultra-low porosity and auxetic
   effect, the auxetic piezoelectric ceramic shall also possess larger
   stiffness, higher toughness, and is more easily polarized. First, the
   auxetic piezoelectric ceramic with ultra-low porosity is proposed to
   achieve highly tunable electromechanical properties on the basis of the
   rotating square mechanism. Then, using a multiscale finite element
   method, the effects of geometric architecture and polarization
   directions on the electromechanical properties including Poisson's
   ratios, elastic coefficients, piezoelectric stress coefficients,
   dielectric coefficients, and figures of merit in the auxetic
   piezoelectric ceramics are investigated in detail. Furthermore, the
   stress fields in conventional and proposed porous piezoelectric ceramics
   subjected to mechanical and electrical loads are compared and discussed.
   Finally, it can be concluded that the auxetic piezoelectric ceramic
   exhibits (a) giant negative Poisson's ratios (smaller than-5), (b)
   negative elastic coefficients, (c) more extensible, higher piezoelectric
   sensitivity, lower acoustic impedance, stronger crack resistance than
   conventional porous piezoelectric ceramics with the same porosity, and
   (d) larger stiffness than conventional porous piezoelectric ceramics
   with similar figures of merit.}},

Abstract = {{In this cross-sectional study, we evaluated the associations between
   precarious employment and health-related outcomes in salaried workers
   from 28 countries in Europe (2014). We used data from the Flash
   Eurobarometer 398 among salaried workers (n = 7,702). We fitted
   multi-level generalized linear models (GLMM) using the Poisson family
   and country as the random effect, to calculate the crude (cPR) and
   adjusted (aPR) prevalence ratios with their 95\%CI of health-related
   outcomes (health problems, sick leave, health and safety risks in the
   workplace) according to precarious employment. We found significant
   associations between having a precarious employment and health problems
   caused or worsened by the work (stress/depression/anxiety,
   musculoskeletal problems, infectious diseases, respiratory problems,
   accidents/injuries and allergies), sick leave of more than 15 days

   association of precarious employment, understood as a multidimensional

Abstract = {{The measurements of particle multiplicity distributions have generated
   considerable interest in understanding the fluctuations of conserved
   quantum numbers in the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) hadronization
   regime, in particular near a possible critical point and near the
   chemical freeze-out. Net-protons and net-kaons have been used as proxies
   for the net-baryon number and net-strangeness, respectively. We report
   the measurement of efficiency- and centrality-bin width-corrected
   cumulant ratios (C-2/C-1,C-3/C-3) of net-A distributions, in the context
   of both strangeness and baryon number conservation, as a function of
   collision energy, centrality, and rapidity. The results are for Au + Au
   collisions at five beam energies (root s(NN) = 19.6, 27, 39, 62.4, and
   200 GeV) recorded with the Solenoidal Tracker at RHIC (STAR). We compare
   our results to the Poisson and negative binomial (NBD) expectations, as
   well as to ultrarelativistic quantum molecular dynamics (UrQMD) and
   hadron resonance gas (HRG) model predictions. Both NBD and Poisson
   baselines agree with data within the statistical and systematic
   uncertainties. UrQMD describes the measured net-A C-1 and C-3 at 200 GeV
   reasonably well but deviates from C-2, and the deviation increases as a
   function of collision energy. The ratios of the measured cumulants show
   no features of critical fluctuations. The chemical freeze-out
   temperatures extracted from a recent HRG calculation, which was
   successfully used to describe the net-proton, net-kaon, and net-charge
   data, indicate A freeze-out conditions similar to those of kaons.
   However, large deviations are found when comparing with temperatures
   obtained from net-proton fluctuations. The net-A cumulants show a weak
   but finite dependence on the rapidity coverage in the acceptance of the
   detector, which can be attributed to quantum number conservation.}},

Abstract = {{The main objective of this research is to investigate the hygroelastic
   behavior of a non-homogeneous circular plate made up of porous
   metamaterial resting on an auxetic material plate. The mechanical
   properties of the main plate, as well as moisture concentration, vary as
   an exponential function in the transverse direction. Poisson's ratio is
   constant. The elastic supporting medium is developed by considering the
   structure-structure coupling. Based on the linear hygroelasticity
   theory, the governing state equations in terms of displacements and
   moisture concentration are acquired. At first, the Fickian equation is
   solved to compute the nonlinear distribution of moisture through the
   plate thickness, and then the state equations are semi-analytically
   solved using the state-space (SS) method and the differential quadrature
   (DQ) rule to predict the elastic field quantities. A comprehensive
   parametric analysis is accomplished to elucidate the effects of key
   parameters on the steady-state response of the plate under the
   mechanical and hygral loads.}},

Abstract = {{Atomic structure, thermodynamic and mechanical behaviours of the
   penta-silicene (p-silicene) obtained by cooling from the melt are
   studied by the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We find
   thatp-silicene can `naturally' form from the liquid state using the
   appropriate interatomic potential, density and buckling. The
   charge-optimised many body (COMB) potential is employed. Depending on
   the cooling rate used in simulations, `crystalline' or
   amorphousp-silicene can be obtained. `Crystallisation' and glass
   transition temperatures (TX=1620KandTg=1230K, respectively) have
   reasonable values compared to those of the hexa-silicene (h-silicene).
   We find that the Poisson's ratio of the obtained `crystalline'p-silicene
   is positive unlike the negative one found for thep-graphene. The reasons
   for the formation ofp-silicene instead of tetra-silicene (t-silicene)
   are analysed and discussed, i.e. 2D liquid silicene with COMB potential
   has a significant fraction of pentagons which grow with decreasing
   temperature, unlike 2D liquid silicene with the Stillinger-Weber
   potential.}},

Abstract = {{A detailed study of the behavior under pressure of four important
   organic acids using the first-principles solid-state methodology is
   presented. These organic acids are the l-(+)-lactic, maleic, succinic
   and citric acids. The citric acid monohydrate is also investigated. The
   computed crystal structures and associated X-ray diffraction patterns
   are in very good agreement with their experimental counterparts. The
   elastic tensors of these materials are determined using the finite
   deformation method and the mechanical stability of their structures is
   studied. A set of relevant elastic properties is obtained in terms of
   the computed elastic tensors. This set includes the bulk, shear and
   Young moduli, the Poisson's ratio, the ductility, hardness and
   anisotropy indices and the bulk modulus pressure derivatives. In the
   solid state, these organic acids are shown to be stable, relatively weak
   and very anisotropic materials and, with the exception of citric acid
   monohydrate, all of them exhibit the negative Poisson's ratio (NPR)
   phenomenon. The deformation of the crystal structures under isotropic
   pressures and anisotropic stresses is then evaluated and analyzed. The
   organic acids considered display the negative linear compressibility
   (NLC) phenomenon in several narrow pressure ranges. The presence of
   large NLC effects in these materials is mainly related to the onset of
   pressure induced phase transitions or sudden structural rearrangements.
   The lactic acid exhibits a large NLC effect under the effect of
   isotropic pressures due to the proximity of a pressure induced phase
   transition occurring at a pressure of P similar to 1.0 GPa. The maleic
   acid shows NLC under isotropic pressures of the order of P similar to
   1.1 GPa but no phase transition is observed. Under anisotropic stresses
   directed along the minimum Poisson's ratio direction, maleic acid also
   shows a large NLC effect at small external pressures of P similar to 0.1
   GPa. Succinic acid displays small NLC effects in several pressure ranges
   under isotropic pressures but large NLC values under anisotropic
   stresses directed along the minimum NPR direction because it undergoes a
   pressure induced phase transition near P similar to 1.5 GPa. Finally,
   the citric acid shows small NLC values for negative isotropic pressures
   near -0.5 GPa and a large NLC effect under low anisotropic stresses (P
   similar to 0.1 GPa) which is accompanied by the breaking of one
   intramolecular hydrogen bond present in this material at zero pressure.}},

Abstract = {{IntroductionPre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) programmes have been
   initiated in sub-Saharan Africa to prevent HIV acquisition in key
   populations at increased risk. However, data on PrEP uptake and
   retention in high-risk African communities are limited. We evaluated
   PrEP uptake and retention in HIV hyperendemic fishing villages and
   trading centres in south-central Uganda between April 2018 and March
   2019.
   MethodsPrEP eligibility was assessed using a national risk screening
   tool. Programme data were used to evaluate uptake and retention over 12
   months. Multivariable modified Poisson regression estimated adjusted
   prevalence ratios (aPR) and 95\% Confidence intervals (CIs) of uptake
   associated with covariates. We used Kaplan-Meier analysis to estimate
   retention and multivariable Cox regression to estimate adjusted relative
   hazards (aRH) and 95\% CIs of discontinuation associated with
   covariates.
   Results and discussionOf the 2985 HIV-negative individuals screened;
   2750 (92.1 \%) were eligible; of whom 2,536 (92.2\%) accepted PrEP. Male

   0.77 to 0.94) fisher folk were less likely to accept compared to
   HIV-discordant couples. Median retention was 45.4 days for both men and
   women, whereas retention was higher among women (log rank, p < 0.001)
   overall. PrEP discontinuation was higher among female sex workers (aRH =
   1.42, 95\% CI = 1.09 to 1.83) and female fisher folk (aRH = 1.99, 95\%
   CI = 1.46 to 2.72), compared to women in discordant couples. Male fisher
   folk (aRH = 1.37, 95\% CI = 1.07 to 1.76) and male truck drivers (aRH =
   1.49, 95\% CI = 1.14 to 1.94) were more likely to discontinue compared
   to men in discordant couples. Women 30 to 34 years tended to have lower
   discontinuation rates compared to adolescents 15 to 19 years (RH = 0.78
   {[}95\% CI = 0.63 to 0.96]).
   ConclusionsPrEP uptake was high, but retention was very low especially
   among those at the highest risk of HIV: fisher folk, sex workers and
   truck drivers and adolescent girls. Research on reasons for PrEP
   discontinuation could help optimize retention.}},

Title = {{4D Printing of NiTi Auxetic Structure with Improved Ballistic
   Performance}},
Journal = {{MICROMACHINES}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic structures have attracted attention in energy absorption
   applications owing to their improved shear modulus and enhanced
   resistance to indentation. On the other hand, four-dimensional (4D)
   printing is an emerging technology that is capable of 3D printing smart
   materials with additional functionality. This paper introduces the
   development of a NiTi negative-Poisson's-ratio structure with
   superelasticity/shape memory capabilities for improved ballistic
   applications. An analytical model was initially used to optimize the
   geometrical parameters of a re-entrant auxetic structure. It was found
   that the re-entrant auxetic structure with a cell angle of -30 degrees
   produced the highest Poisson's ratio of -2.089. The 4D printing process
   using a powder bed fusion system was used to fabricate the optimized
   NiTi auxetic structure. The measured negative Poisson's ratio of the
   fabricated auxetic structure was found in agreement with both the
   analytical model and the finite element simulation. A finite element
   model was developed to simulate the dynamic response of the optimized
   auxetic NiTi structure subjected to different projectile speeds. Three
   stages of the impact process describing the penetration of the top
   plate, auxetic structure, and bottom plate have been identified. The
   results show that the optimized auxetic structures affect the dynamic
   response of the projectile by getting denser toward the impact location.
   This helped to improve the energy absorbed per unit mass of the NiTi
   auxetic structure to about two times higher than that of the solid NiTi
   plate and five times higher than that of the solid conventional steel
   plate.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The associations between anemia and household water source
   and sanitation remain unclear.
   Objectives: We aimed to assess the associations between anemia and
   household water source or sanitation in preschool children (PSC; age
   6-59 mo) using population-based surveys from the Biomarkers Reflecting
   Inflammation and Nutritional Determinants of Anemia (BRINDA) project.
   Methods: We analyzed national and subnational data from 21 surveys,
   representing 19 countries (n = 35,963). Observations with hemoglobin
   (Hb) and >= 1 variable reflecting household water source or sanitation
   were included. Anemia was defined as an altitude-adjusted Hb
   concentration <110 g/L. Household water source and sanitation variables
   were dichotomized as ``improved{''} or ``unimproved.{''} Poisson
   regressions with robust variance estimates were conducted for each
   survey, adjusting for child sex, age, household socioeconomic status,
   maternal education, and type of residence.
   Results: Access to an improved water source and improved sanitation
   ranged from 29.9\% (Burkina Faso) to 98.4\% (Bangladesh, 2012), and from
   0.2\% (Kenya, 2007) to 97.4\% (Philippines), respectively. Prevalence of
   anemia ranged from 20.1\% (Nicaragua) to 83.5\% (Bangladesh, 2010).
   Seven surveys showed negative associations between anemia and improved
   sanitation. Three surveys showed association between anemia and improved
   water, with mixed directions. Meta-analyses suggested a protective
   association between improved household sanitation and anemia {[}adjusted
   prevalence ratio (aPR) = 0.88; 95\% CI: 0.79, 0.98], and no association
   between improved household water and anemia (aPR = 1.00; 95\% CI: 0.91,
   1.10). There was heterogeneity across surveys for sanitation (P < 0.01;
   I-2 = 66.3\%) and water (P < 0.01; I-2 = 55.8\%).
   Conclusions: Although improved household sanitation was associated with
   reduced anemia prevalence in PSC in some surveys, this association was
   not consistent. Access to an improved water source in general had no
   association with anemia across surveys. Additional research could help
   clarify the heterogeneity between these conditions across countries to
   inform anemia reduction programs.}},

Title = {{Auxetic tubular scaffolds via melt electrowriting}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{193}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Auxetics are an interesting class of materials that expand in transverse
   directions when tensile loading is applied. For example, in contrast to
   conventional materials, an auxetic tube will increase in diameter when
   stretched along its axis. To date, auxetic tubular scaffolds have been
   proposed for applications in tissue engineering and soft robotics;
   however, they have not yet been routinely produced in
   precisely-engineered microfibre structures using the melt electrowriting
   additive manufacturing method. Using a custom melt electrowriting device
   and rotating mandrel collector, scaffolds with a re-entrant honeycomb
   unit cell pattern were designed and fabricated from polycaprolactone
   microfibres. These scaffolds were tensile tested to characterise their
   auxetic properties compared to traditional crosshatch-patterned tubular
   scaffolds. The auxetic scaffolds exhibited an increase in diameter up to
   80.8\%, as predicted from the unit cell pattern at maximum strain of
   14.1\%, resulting in a Poisson's ratio of -5.8. By comparison,
   crosshatch scaffolds exhibited a similar stress-strain profile to the
   auxetic tubular scaffold with identical pore size, however significant
   radial compression was observed leading to a Poisson's ratio of +5.7.
   This study reports the design and fabrication of auxetic tubular
   microfibre scaffolds fabricated via melt electrowriting for the first
   time and offers a versatile fibre patterning system towards applications
   in biofabrication and robotics. (c) 2020 The Authors. Published by

Title = {{A design framework for gradually stiffer mechanical metamaterial induced
   by negative Poisson's ratio property}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{192}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Gradually stiffer (GS) mechanical metamaterial is a novel kind of
   adaptive structures under nonlinear varying loads for cushioning and
   vibration damping in engineering. These man-made metamaterials in
   applications are usually tailored by trial-and-error. This study
   develops a design framework that integrates the topology optimization,
   parametric design and compression experiment for the GS mechanical
   metamaterials induced by the negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) property.
   Firstly, a parametric level set method is incorporated with the
   numerical homogenization method to topologically optimize a series of
   microstructural unit cells with different NPRs. Then, the nonlinear
   static analysis is respectively applied to different unit cells to check
   their GS behavior. Secondly, typical microstructures with GS property
   are selected and simplified to perform the subsequent parametric design
   to analyze the expected property. Thirdly, the obtained mechanical
   metamaterials are fabricated by using the additive manufacturing (AM).
   GS properties of the obtained designs are analyzed and verified by both
   the simulation and compression experiments. Results show that we could
   obtain the GS mechanical metamaterial based on NPR properties for their
   similar characteristics. This study demonstrates that the proposed
   design framework is effective to tailor innovative layouts of the GS
   mechanical metamaterials. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier

Title = {{Bending Behavior of Lightweight Wood-Based Sandwich Beams with Auxetic
   Cellular Core}},
Journal = {{POLYMERS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The work concerns a three-point bending test of beams made of plywood,
   high density fibre boards, cardboard, and wood-epoxy mass. The goal of
   the investigation was to determine the effect of thickness and type of
   wood-based facings on stiffness, strength, ability to absorb, and
   dissipate the energy of sandwich beams with an auxetic core. The
   cognitive goal of the work was to demonstrate the possibility of using
   recycled materials for facings and cores instead of popular wood
   composites. Experimental studies and numerical calculations were
   performed on correctly calibrated models. Experimental studies have
   shown that the beams with HDF facings (E = 1528 MPa, MOR = 12.61 MPa)
   and plywood facings (E = 1248-1395 MPa, MOR = 8.34-10.40 MPa) have the
   most favourable mechanical properties. Beams with plywood facings also
   have a good ability to absorb energy (1.380-1.746 J), but, in this
   respect, the beams manufactured of HDF (2.223 J) exhibited better
   capacity. The use of an auxetic core and facings of plywood and
   cardboard significantly reduces the amount of dissipated energy (0.0093
   J, 0.0067 J). Therefore, this type of structures can be used for
   modeling beams carrying high deflections.}},

Title = {{Dynamical Network Analysis of the South Korean Dialects Compared to

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE KOREAN PHYSICAL SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{77}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{303-311}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate the network properties of the South Korean
   dialects. Among 153 words in ``The Linguistic Atlas of Korea{''}, 33
   words satisfying our criteria were surveyed. We set 138 basic
   administrative districts that make up South Korea as nodes and construct
   a language network by using a defined procedure. The network shows
   neither a small-world (small-world coefficient < 5) nor a scale-free
   (degree distribution forms like a unimodal Poisson) property in the
   general complex network. Also, the assortativity is seen to show
   transition from negative to positive at about the threshold value of 15.
   The number of Korean linguistic groups, which is the most import result
   in this study, is constantly four with s-curved Newman modularity in the
   threshold range 13 similar to 22. The Korean dialect division by using a
   network modularity method is almost identical to the classification of
   traditional linguists (Central, Southwest, Southeast, and Jeju).
   Furthermore, subgroups can be obtained by performing a hierarchical
   dialect division. As a result, South Korean dialects are classified into
   seven minor groups, and some regions (e.g., Southern Gang-won) belong to
   groups different from those of the traditional classification method.}},

Title = {{Multiple Server SRPT With Speed Scaling Is Competitive}},
Journal = {{IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON NETWORKING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{28}},

Abstract = {{Can the popular shortest remaining processing time (SRPT) algorithm
   achieve a constant competitive ratio on multiple servers when server
   speeds are adjustable (speed scaling) with respect to the flow time plus
   energy consumption metric? This question has remained open for a while,
   where a negative result in the absence of speed scaling is well known.
   The main result of this paper is to show that multi-server SRPT with
   speed scaling can be constant competitive, with a competitive ratio that
   only depends on the power-usage function of the servers, but not on the
   number of jobs/servers or the job sizes (unlike when speed scaling is
   not allowed). When all job sizes are unity, we show that round-robin
   routing is optimal and can achieve the same competitive ratio as the
   best known algorithm for the single server problem. Finally, we show
   that a class of greedy dispatch policies, including policies that route
   to the least loaded or the shortest queue, do not admit a constant
   competitive ratio. When job arrivals are stochastic, with Poisson
   arrivals and i.i.d. job sizes, we show that random routing and a simple
   gated-static speed scaling algorithm achieves a constant competitive
   ratio.}},

Title = {{Quasi-stationary modeling of the DBD plasma flow control around airfoil}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 1}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of numerical simulation of a dielectric
   barrier discharge (DBD) plasma actuator and shows its effectiveness to
   control air flow around the NACA(National Advisory Committee for
   Aeronautics)0015 airfoil. The actuator consists of two tape electrodes
   separated by a dielectric layer, and it is mounted on the suction side
   of the airfoil at 18\% of the chord length. An alternating voltage with
   20 kV magnitude and 10 kHz frequency is applied between both electrodes.
   The physical model of the DBD includes the drift of two ionic species,
   positive and negative, and the Poisson equation for the electric
   potential distribution. The spatio-temporal distribution of the electric
   field, the space charge density in the ambient air, and the surface
   charge density on the dielectric layer have been determined. The time
   average electric body force was entered into the air flow model, which
   was solved using the Spalart-Allmaras turbulence technique. The
   simulation of the air flow was performed for the free-stream velocities
   between 5 m/s and 20 m/s (Reynolds numbers 1.65 x 10(5)-6.61 x 10(5)
   based on the chord length). The results of computations show the effect
   of the electrohydrodynamic actuation on the flow pattern, the lift and
   drag coefficients, the pressure coefficient, and the flow fluctuation
   near the airfoil. The ability of the DBD actuation to effectively
   control the aerodynamic airfoil characteristics has been confirmed, and
   its limitations for the discussed case have been determined.}},

Journal = {{EATING BEHAVIORS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{38}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Background: Although adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) have been
   linked to negative health behaviors in adulthood, few studies have
   investigated if the impact continues until late adulthood. We examined
   the association between ACEs and fruit and vegetable intake (FVI) among
   older adults in Japan.
   Methods: Data came from the Japan Gerontological Evaluation Study
   (JAGES), 2013 in which 24,271 individuals aged >= 65 years participated.
   The number of ACEs was calculated (0, 1 and >= 2) while low FVI was
   defined as consuming fruit and vegetables less than once a day. A
   sex-stratified multilevel Poisson regression analysis was used to
   investigate the association between ACEs and low FVI.
   Results: Among men, 35.4\% reported at least one ACE while the
   corresponding figure for women was 30.6\%. Compared to those without
   ACEs, the prevalence ratios for low FVI among those who reported >= 2
   ACEs were 1.51 (95\% confidence interval {[}CI] = 1.30-1.75) for women
   and 1.28 (95\% CI = 1.14-1.44) for men after adjusting for age and
   childhood economic hardship. Although these associations were attenuated
   after adjusting for socio-demographic and health-related variables, the
   link between ACEs and low FVI remained statistically significant among
   women. Of the seven individual forms of ACE, psychological neglect was
   significantly associated with low FVI (PR = 1.16, 95\% CI = 1.03-1.31)
   among women in the final model.
   Conclusions: ACEs are associated with low FVI among older Japanese
   adults. Our results suggest that the detrimental effect of ACEs on
   health behavior may stretch across the life course.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has been associated with
   increased risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD). We investigated the
   impact of HCV cure on CKD in HIV-positive persons in the EuroSIDA study.
   Methods: HIV-positive persons with known HCV status and at least three
   serum creatinine measurements after 1/1/2004 were compared based on
   time-updated HCV-RNA and HCV treatment: anti-HCV-negative, spontaneously
   cleared HCV, chronic untreated HCV, successfully treated HCV, and
   HCV-RNA positive after HCV treatment. Poisson regression compared
   incidence rates of CKD {[}confirmed (>3 months apart) eGFR Results:
   Fourteen thousand, seven hundred and fifty-four persons were included;
   at baseline 9273 (62.9\%) were HCV-Ab negative, 696 (4.7\%) spontaneous
   clearers, 3021 (20.5\%) chronically infected, 922 (6.2\%) successfully
   treated and 842 (5.7\%) HCV-RNA positive after treatment. During 115 335
   person-years of follow-up (PYFU), 1128 (7.6\%) developed CKD; crude
   incidence 9.8/1000 PYFU (95\% CI 9.2-10.4). After adjustment, persons
   anti-HCV negative {[}adjusted incidence rate ratio (aIRR) 0.59; 95\% CI
   0.46-0.75] and spontaneous clearers (aIRR 0.67; 95\% CI 0.47-0.97) had
   significantly lower rates of CKD compared with those cured whereas
   persons chronically infected (aIRR 0.85; 95\% CI 0.65-1.12) and HCV-RNA
   positive after treatment (aIRR 0.71; 95\% CI 0.49-1.04) had similar
   rates. Analysis in those without F3/F4 liver fibrosis using a more
   rigorous definition of CKD showed similar results. Conclusion: This
   large study found no evidence that successful HCV treatment reduced CKD
   incidence. Confounding by indication, where those with highest risk of
   CKD were prioritized for HCV treatment in the DAA era, may contribute to
   these findings.}},

Abstract = {{Recent advances in hyperelastic materials and self-sensing sensor
   designs have enabled the creation of dense compliant sensor networks for
   the cost-effective monitoring of structures. The authors have proposed a
   sensing skin based on soft polymer composites by developing soft
   elastomeric capacitor (SEC) technology that transduces geometric
   variations into a measurable change in capacitance. A limitation of the
   technology is in its low gauge factor and lack of sensing
   directionality. In this paper, we propose a corrugated SEC through
   surface texture, which provides improvements in its performance by
   significantly decreasing its transverse Poisson's ratio, and thus
   improving its sensing directionality and gauge factor. We investigate
   patterns inspired by auxetic structures for enhanced unidirectional
   strain monitoring. Numerical models are constructed and validated to
   evaluate the performance of textured SECs, and to study their
   performance at monitoring strain on animal skin. Results show that the
   auxetic patterns can yield a significant increase in the overall gauge
   factor and decrease the stress experienced by the animal skin, with the
   re-entrant hexagonal honeycomb pattern outperforming all of the other
   patterns.}},

Abstract = {{Thermal expansion and stress of solid materials can significantly affect
   structural safety and instrument accuracy in many engineering fields. An
   alternative way to overcome these drawbacks is to use materials with
   controllable coefficients of thermal expansion (CTEs). This work
   presents a new three-dimensional (3D) material with controllable CTEs
   that is composed of chiral honeycomb layers connected by a set of
   inclined struts. Although each single chiral layer has positive CTEs, by
   carefully designing geometric parameters and material constituents, the
   negative thermal expansion (NTE) can be established. Analytical
   solutions of the equivalent CTEs are proposed using the classical beam
   theory, which were verified by finite element simulations. The results
   show that the proposed material can achieve a large range of CTEs (from
   positive to negative), and has negative Poisson's ratios in the chiral
   honeycomb planes. In addition, isotropic negative and zero thermal
   expansion can be obtained with appropriate design parameters.}},

Abstract = {{Spatial contexts and spatial mobility are important factors of the HIV
   epidemic and sexually transmitted infections. Using global positioning
   system (GPS) devices, we examined the associations of objectively
   measured spatial mobility with sexual risk behaviors among gay, bisexual
   and other men who have sex with men (MSM) in New York City. This
   observational study included a subgroup of 253 HIV-negative MSM from the
   Project 18 Cohort Study, who participated in the GPS monitoring
   sub-study. Spatial mobility was measured as (1) distance traveled and
   (2) activity space size defined as daily path area during 2-week of GPS
   tracking. We examined the associations of these measures with numbers of
   male sexual partners and condomless anal intercourse (CAI) acts during
   last six months using quasi-Poisson models, adjusting for
   socio-demographics. Results demonstrated that spatial mobility was
   positively associated with sexual risk behaviors, for example, with CAI
   (incidence rate ratio {[}IRR] = 1.01 for a 10 km increase in distance
   traveled and IRR = 1.04 for a 1 km(2) increase in 50 m-buffer activity
   space size). Our findings may enhance the understanding of spatial
   contexts of HIV risk. Future studies should be conducted to examine the
   mechanisms for the associations between spatial mobility behaviors with
   sexual risk behaviors as well as the influence of neighborhood
   characteristics in various neighborhood contexts, which may guide the
   place-based HIV prevention services.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic textiles are defined as textiles with negative Poisson's ratio.
   These textiles possess unique properties that render them suitable for
   special applications. This work aims to investigate the effect of fabric
   structural parameters such as thread densities, weave design and warp
   yarn count. Thus, 30 fabric samples were woven at 3 weft and 2 warp
   densities, respectively. Two warp counts and three weave designs of
   plain, basket 3/3 and weft-backed satin 6 were used. The samples were
   uniaxially loaded in weft direction and dimensional changes at various
   strains levels were evaluated. The evaluation was carried out using the
   image processing technique based on MATLAB software. The weft yarns used
   were found to exhibit auxetic behavior at the whole spectrum of the
   strain level used. The least weft yarn Poisson's ratio was found to be
   -0.9. It was established that in general the fabric samples exhibit
   auxetic effect within the stated range of strain. Additionally, it was
   concluded that while fabric thread densities together with warp count
   influence the minimum fabric Poisson's ratio, auxetic behavior of the
   samples is not dependent on weave design alone. Rather, it was
   illustrated that the combined effect of weave design in association with
   stated structural parameters on auxetic feature cannot be ignored.}},

   bio-nanometamaterials}},
Journal = {{PHYSICA SCRIPTA}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{95}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Microtubules are protein-based filaments that carry out essential
   biological roles of eukaryotic cells. They play,in vivo, critical roles
   in a wide variety of physical situations such as maintaining cell shape,
   supporting cellular motions, and playing significant roles in both
   intracellular transport and cellular division. To perform some of these
   functions, microtubules may need to form different topologies in various
   orientations. Therefore, the need to introduce different structures of
   microtubules arises. Orientation-dependent architected structures are a
   type of periodic architected materials that can exhibit various
   mechanical properties in different orientations. In the present study,
   several periodic architectures of various topologies are investigated
   numerically, and their mechanical properties (elastic modulus, Poisson's
   ratio, and natural frequencies) are analyzed in different spatial
   orientations. For this purpose, the representative volume elements are
   constructed by considering unit cells of different models aligned in
   different spatial angles, and their elastic moduli and Poisson's ratios
   are obtained by the finite element method. Then the finite element
   equation of motion for the given structures are solved to find their six
   natural frequencies. Besides, Bloch's theorem is implemented to study
   wave propagation and compare the bandgap widths of the structures in
   different orientations. It is found that while the elastic properties of
   some architected structures may increase as the orientation angle
   increases from zero, for some others, a reduction in the elastic moduli
   can be observed as the angle rises. Further, it is seen that some
   structures may exhibit positive (and high) values of Poisson's ratio in
   some angles, while for a different orientation, these values turn out to
   be negative. Also, the effects of orientation angle on the natural
   frequencies and stop-band performance are observed to be significant in
   some topologies and negligible in some others. A better understanding of
   the behavior of architected structures in different orientations may
   provide new ways to design and manufacture various structures with
   enhanced and tunable mechanical properties.}},

Abstract = {{A novel 3D anti-tetrachiral structure with negative Poisson's ratio,
   based on a 2D anti-tetrachiral structure, was proposed in this paper.
   The 3D structure consists of two different perpendicular 2D
   anti-tetrachiral honeycomb cells connected by ligaments. The deformation
   mechanism of the structure was investigated, and analytical solutions
   for the Poisson's ratio of the cellular structure were obtained, which
   indicates a wide range of mechanical property via adjusting its
   geometric parameters. It was found that one of the Poisson's ratios is
   always -1 and is independent of the geometric parameters. Based on the
   energy method, the equivalent elastic moduli of the proposed structure
   along the three primary directions were also obtained. The analytical
   results were agree well with finite element analysis results. It was
   verified that the present analytical model can provide a relatively

   honeycomb with negative Poisson's ratio under planar compression have
   been investigated in this paper. Re-entrant hexagonal unit cell
   specimens were fabricated by aluminum alloy and polyurethane foam. The
   deformation modes and force-displacement curves of the unit cell
   specimens under compression were carried out experimentally and
   numerically, and a good agreement was observed between experimental
   results and numerical simulation results. Subsequently, mechanical
   behaviors of foam filled and void re-entrant hexagonal honeycomb under
   planar compression were observed by numerical simulation. Compared to
   the void honeycomb, the foam filled honeycomb has a higher specific
   energy absorption capability due to a higher plateau stress. According
   to the mechanism of auxetic effect, the re-entrant honeycomb would move
   inward when subjected to compression along the orthogonal direction,
   which cause a biaxial compression of the foam and an increasing of
   stiffness/strength/energy absorption capability. The present
   investigations provide thorough insight into the strengthened re-entrant
   hexagonal cellular honeycomb, and could be used in the development of
   novel light weight smart functional structures.}},

Abstract = {{A novel class of chiral structures having intersecting ligaments acting
   as the node is presented in this study. Depending on the geometric
   parameters, this arrangement may allow both the ligaments connecting the
   nodes together as well as the ligaments that compose the node itself to
   bend upon the application of a uniaxial force. Hence, such structures
   are capable of deforming through two distinct mechanisms, i.e. bending
   of the ligaments between the nodes and bending of the ligaments in the
   nodes. The novel six ligament (hexa) arrangement, a structure derived
   from the hexachiral, was chosen for the purpose of investigating these
   novel designs. This was studied through the use of finite element
   simulations and mechanical testing of 3D printed specimens. Analysis of
   the results supports the suggestion that a hierarchical deformation
   system exist. The value of the Poisson's ratio was found to be dependent
   on the relative thickness of the respective ligaments.}},

Title = {{Evolutionary topology optimization for mechanical metamaterials with
   auxetic property}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{AUG 1}},
Abstract = {{Mechanical metamaterials with auxetic property have attracted a lot of
   attention in both the computational intelligence and engineering
   applications. However, the works relate to the efficient Bi-directional
   evolutionary structural optimization (BESO) method is infrequent due to
   the discrete nature of design variables. This paper obtains the
   orthotropic materials with auxetic property by imposing two numerical
   strategies on the sensitivity calculation and variable updating, which
   are used to stabilize the evolutionary process and easy to be
   implemented. In addition, this paper develops a robust objective
   function while taking into account of the mechanical properties in all
   directions of the material microstructure, and the explicit sensitivity
   information of the objective function with respect to design variables
   is derived, then the powerful OC-type algorithm is adopted to solve this
   problem. The macroscopic equivalent elastic behavior is evaluated by the
   comprehensible energy-based homogenization method (EBHM). Several
   numerical examples are tested to demonstrate the feasibility and
   effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for the design of orthotropic
   materials with auxetic properties. Finally, two experiments are arranged
   to further illustrate the effect of negative Poisson's ratio of the
   designed material microstructures.}},

Journal = {{CEMENT \& CONCRETE COMPOSITES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{111}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic behavior refers to material with negative Poisson's ratio. In
   this research, a new type of cementitious auxetic material is developed.
   A novel crack bridging auxetic mechanism is discovered which is in
   contrast with a local buckling mechanism commonly employed to trigger
   auxetic behavior. Taking advantage of 3D printing techniques,
   cementitious cellular composite (CCC) specimens with auxetic cellular
   structures were produced. Meanwhile, cementitious materials with
   different fiber content were used as constituent material. Uniaxial
   compression and cyclic loading tests were performed on the CCCs.
   Experiments show that with proper constituent material, CCCs can exhibit
   auxetic behavior which is induced by crack bridging process of the
   cementitious constituent material. In addition, strain hardening
   behavior can be identified in the stress-strain curve under uniaxial
   compression and consequently high specific energy absorption is
   obtained. Furthermore, 2.5\% of reversible deformation which is
   significantly higher than conventional cementitious materials under
   cyclic loading is obtained within 25,000 cycles. Obvious fatigue damage
   is observed in the first 3000 cycles, afterwards signs of mechanical
   properties recovering can be found. The discovered auxetic mechanism
   indicates a new designing direction for brittle materials to achieve
   auxetic behaviors.}},

Abstract = {{Nanoporous gold (np-Au) exhibits variations in the value of the plastic
   Poisson's ratio, nu(p) - ranging from negative to positive - often for
   similar relative densities and ligament diameters. We investigate the
   effect of pre-existing lattice defects on nu(p) of np-Au using molecular
   dynamics simulations. Uniaxial compression of np-Au samples that have
   the same porous morphology, but distinct defect densities, shows that a
   high density of pre-existing defects reduces nu(p). We interpret this
   observation by linking nanoscale tension-compression asymmetry in
   individual ligaments to the synergistic interplay between defects and
   surfaces, and ultimately to the plastic transverse coupling in np-Au.

Abstract = {{Hydraulic geometry relations comprise a classic way to understand
   characteristics of a river. However, environmental changes pose large
   uncertainties for the reliability of such relations. In the current
   study, on the basis of the ordinary differential equations (ODEs) formed
   through linear treatment of the deterministic power-law hydraulic
   geometry relations, a set of stochastic differential equations (SDEs)
   driven by Fractional white noise and Poisson noise are developed to
   simulate the historical dynamic probability distributions of typical
   hydraulic geometry variables such as slope, width, depth, and velocity
   with bankfull discharge variation over time in the lower Yellow River of
   China. One group of possible stochastic average behaviors within the
   next 50 years are calculated under three different design incoming
   water-sediment conditions (including 300, 600, and 800 million t of
   annual average sediment discharge). In each part of the lower reaches,
   after estimation of the SDE parameters using a nonparametric maximum
   likelihood estimation (MLE) method, the model is carefully examined
   using Monte Carlo simulation as compared with the deterministic control
   models. The results of this comparison reveal the potential responses of
   hydraulic geometry characteristics to environmental disturbances, and
   the average trends mainly agree with the measurements. Comparisons among
   the three different prediction results reveal the stochastic average
   solution generally is greater than the deterministic solution. The
   results also confirm the severe negative impacts that result from the
   condition of 300 million t of incoming sediment, thus, pointing out the
   need to raise the level of river evolution alert for the lower Yellow
   River of China in the future. Moreover, with the help of the stochastic
   computation, the stream power and hydraulic width/depth ratio could be
   representative of an effective systematic measure for river dynamics.
   The proposed stochastic approach is not only important to development in
   the field of fluvial relations, but also beneficial to the practical
   design and monitoring of a river system according to specified accuracy
   requirements. (C) 2020 International Research and Training Centre on

Abstract = {{Stretchable and conductive hydrogels have been intensively studied as
   wearable electronics to monitor the physiological activities of human
   bodies. However, it remains a challenge to fabricate robust hydrogels as
   sensors with complex 3D structures. Here, we designed a 3D printable ink
   from cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs), deep eutectic solvents (DESs), and
   ionically cross-linked polyacrylic acid (PAA). DESs composed of choline
   chloride and ethylene glycol served as a nonvolatile medium with high
   ionic conductivity. The dispersion of CNCs in a mixture of DESs, acrylic
   acid, and Al3+ ions formed ionogels with a reversible physical network
   for 3D printing. After the printing process, the ionogel was solidified
   by the photopolymerization of acrylic acid in the presence of Al3+ ions
   to form a second ionically cross-linked network. The first physical
   network of CNCs provides an energy-dissipating mechanism to make a
   strong and highly stretchable nanocomposite ionogel. When compared to
   hydrogels, we found that the DES/CNC nanocomposite ionogel was more
   stable in the air because of the low volatility of DESs. We further used
   the DES/CNC ink to 3D print an auxetic sensor with negative Poisson's
   ratios so that the sensor provided a conformal contact with the skin
   during large deformation. In addition, the auxetic sensor could
   continuously monitor and identify different motions of the human body by
   the change in resistance. These results demonstrate a simple and rapid
   strategy to fabricate stable and sensitive strain sensors from cheap and
   renewable feedstock.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic architectures with a negative Poisson's ratio have attracted
   increasing attention due to their intriguing physical properties and
   numerous promising applications and recent advancements in manufacturing
   techniques. However, fabrication of three-dimensional (3D) polymeric
   auxetic architectures with a tailored hierarchically porous structure
   and desired physical/mechanical properties remains challenging. Herein,
   3D nanofibrous Kevlar aerogel architectures with porosity at multiple
   scales have been designed and fabricated through a new additive
   manufacturing strategy,i.e., integration of direct ink writing and
   freeze-casting with non-toxic solvent-based inks followed by special
   drying techniques. The highly porous 3D nanofibrous Kevlar aerogel
   architectures achieve excellent mechanical properties with an ultralow
   density (down to 11.9 mg cm(-3)) and large specific surface area (up to
   350 m(2)g(-1)). The Poisson's ratio is tunable in a wide range, spanning
   from -0.8 to 0.4, by adjusting the spatial arrangement of the designed
   pattern struts. Finally, these nanofibrous Kevlar aerogel architectures
   have been further functionalized into hydrophobic, luminescent and
   thermoresponsive architectures by using fluorocarbon resin, functional
   dyes and organic phase-change materials respectively. The
   multi-functional auxetic aerogel architectures demonstrate potential for
   a broad range of applications.}},

Title = {{Estimating reservoir geomechanical parameters for enhanced reservoir

Abstract = {{Reservoir geomechanical parameters in ``Tobi{''} Field, Niger Delta were
   estimated using well log data with the intention of improving reservoir
   characterization and establishing stress regime of the field. A suite of
   well log data were interpreted, reservoirs were identified and
   correlated across three (3) wells and their geomechanical parameters
   computed from empirical relations. Three (3) reservoir units were
   delineated from these wells that falls within the hydrocarbon windows
   (Agbada Formation). We estimated several geomechanical parameters, which
   include, but is not limited to, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, bulk
   compressibility, unconfined compressive strength (UCS), shear modulus,
   heat production, vertical stress (overburden), minimum horizontal
   stress, maximum horizontal stress, shear stress normal to fault plane,
   shear stress in direction of dip, and shear stress in direction of
   strike. The bivariate crossplots of heat production and Young's modulus
   indicated that the amount of heat produced by the shaly materials
   affects the elastic properties of the reservoir units and flow rate. The
   crossplots of Poisson's ratio versus compressional velocity are
   expressly well-defined and exponentially decaying with the compressional
   velocity, indicating an inverse relationship between the two (2)
   parameters. For stress tensor analysis, the study confirmed the defining
   condition of S-v > S-Hmax > S(hmin)as normal fault, which is fault
   regime prevalent in the study area, in line with Andersen's
   classification. Rotation of principal stresses on fault plane showed
   negative shear stress in strike direction. This research concluded that
   geomechanical parameters of hydrocarbon reservoirs in ``Tobi{''} field
   are diagnostic in reservoir characterization and in establishing the
   type of faults in reservoirs.}},

Abstract = {{With the rapid growth and advance in the Internet of things and
   flexible/on-skin electronics, stretchable/flexible energy storage
   devices are being unprecedentedly needed and widely pursued. However, it
   remains a great challenge to realize devices with both high storage
   capacity and satisfactory mechanical stretchability/flexibility. Herein,
   by synergistically combining 3D printing with electrodeposition, a
   3D-printed stretchable structural supercapacitor with thick electrodes
   and a 3D Negative Poisson's Ratio (NPR) multicellular framework was
   developed. Benefiting from the well-designed NPR lattice electrode
   architecture and unique 3D nanoflower-on-nanosheet structured
   CoNi2S4/NiCo-LDHs nanocomposites, the assembled stretchable symmetric
   supercapacitor was highly stretchable (up to similar to 55\%) and
   flexible (up to 180 degrees) with a favorable capacitance of 28.71 F
   cm(-3), superior energy density of 0.582 mW h cm(-3)and satisfied
   stability in stretching and bending cycles (75.2\% of its initial
   capacitance after 1000 periodic stretch/release cycles), which are
   highly comparable to those obtained for previously reported stretchable
   supercapacitors. The strategy proposed here provides new insights in
   developing next-generation highly customized 3D structural strengthening
   energy storage devices for human-machine interfaces and real wearable
   and intelligent miniaturized electronics.}},

Title = {{Does Risk of Progression from Barrett's Esophagus to Esophageal
   Adenocarcinoma Change Based on the Number of Non-dysplastic Endoscopies?}},

Abstract = {{Background There is a large Barrett's esophagus patient population
   undergoing endoscopic surveillance. Methods to stratify patients into
   higher and lower risk groups may enable more varied surveillance
   intervals for patients with non-dysplastic Barrett's esophagus that
   could optimize use of endoscopy resources. Objective We aimed to assess
   whether risk of progression to esophageal adenocarcinoma differed in
   patients with multiple endoscopic biopsies negative for dysplasia.
   Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study among individuals from
   the population-based Northern Ireland Barrett's register with a
   histologically confirmed diagnosis of non-dysplastic Barrett's esophagus
   (with intestinal metaplasia) between 1993 and 2010, who had at least one
   endoscopic biopsy conducted at least 12 months after diagnosis. We used
   Poisson regression to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRR) and 95\%
   confidence intervals (CI) for the association between number of
   successive endoscopies showing non-dysplastic Barrett's esophagus and
   risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma alone, and combined with high-grade
   dysplasia, at the next endoscopy. Results We identified 1761 individuals
   who met our eligibility criteria. Subsequent risk of progression to
   esophageal adenocarcinoma was lower at the next endoscopy following two
   endoscopies showing non-dysplastic Barrett's esophagus (IRR 0.26, 95\%
   CI 0.10-0.66) than following one endoscopy showing non-dysplastic
   Barrett's esophagus. Similar findings were apparent for risk of
   progression to esophageal adenocarcinoma or high-grade dysplasia (IRR
   0.41, 95\% CI 0.22-0.79). Conclusion The lower risk of malignant
   progression in individuals with persistent non-dysplastic Barrett's
   esophagus over two consecutive endoscopic biopsies but not for longer
   term persistence does not support hypotheses of persistence being an
   indicator of less biologically aggressive lesions. Instead, the initial
   difference may be attributable to post-endoscopy cancers and support the
   necessity of adhering to robust quality standards for endoscopic
   procedures.}},

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{305}},
Number = {{9}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this work is to fabricate polyamide 6 (PA6) composite
   filament with enhanced mechanical properties and low cost for fused
   deposition modeling (FDM). The composite filaments are obtained by
   compounding PA6 and talcum fillers and then single screw extruding.
   Virgin PA6 and commercial e-PA6 are set as controls. First, the
   rheological behaviors and thermal properties of PA6/talc, PA6, and e-PA6
   pellet materials are investigated, including viscosity, melting
   temperature, crystallinity, and decomposition temperature, which are
   important parameters for fabricating filament feedstocks. The results
   show that 10 wt\% addition of talcum content accelerates the increase of
   the viscosity among the processing temperature. Accordingly, virgin PA6
   and PA6/talc5 with good flowability are produced and subsequently
   evaluated by tensile and flexural tests. It is notable that the
   introduction of talcum increases the diameter constant and shape
   stability of PA6-based filament. Also, it is found that both PA6 and
   Pa6/talc5 filaments exhibit superior tensile properties to the
   commercial e-PA6 counterparts. Especially, PA6/talc5 filaments achieve
   the maximum tensile yield strength of 67.1 MPa and modulus of 3.10 GPa.
   Finally, auxetic lattice parts are successfully printed via FDM using
   lab-made PA6, PA6/talc5, and commercial e-PA6 filaments, and PA6/talc5
   exhibits remarkable loading and energy absorption capability.}},

Abstract = {{The flexing of the ligaments at the edge of a finite hexagonal honeycomb
   array is studied using analytical and numerical methods. It is shown
   that when compressed axially, the ligaments on the border of a hexagonal
   honeycomb array bend outwardly in contrast to the interior ligaments
   that bend to a negligible extent, if at all. This boundary effect
   reduces the overall auxeticity of re-entrant hexagonal honeycombs.
   Analytical expressions that account for the edge effects on the
   Poisson's ratio and Young's modulus are obtained using Castigliano's
   second theorem. These are then tested against numerical simulations
   showing good agreement at least for the values of the parameters used.
   Additional investigations indicate that the use of a larger ligament
   thickness for the ligaments residing on the border of the system
   mitigates this edge effect on the Poisson's ratio.}},

Abstract = {{Background. High costs of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) have led
   health-care insurers to limit access worldwide. Using a natural
   experiment, we evaluated the impact of removing fibrosis stage
   restrictions on hepatitis C (HCV) treatment initiation rates among
   people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and then examined
   who was left to be treated.
   Methods. Using data from the Canadian HIV-HCV Coinfection Cohort, we
   applied a difference-in-differences approach. Changes in treatment
   initiation rates following the removal of fibrosis stage restrictions
   were assessed using a negative binomial regression with generalized
   estimating equations. The policy change was then specifically assessed
   among people who inject drugs (PWID). We then identified the
   characteristics of participants who remained to be treated using a
   modified Poisson regression.
   Results. Between 2010-2018, there were a total of 585 HCV initiations
   among 1130 eligible participants. After removing fibrosis stage
   restrictions, DAA initiations increased by 1.8-fold (95\% confidence
   interval {[}CI] 1.3-2.4) controlling for time-invariant differences and
   secular trends. Among PWID the impact appeared even stronger, with an
   adjusted incidence rate ratio of 3.6 (95\% CI 1.8-7.4). However, this
   increased treatment uptake was not sustained. At 1 year following
   universal access, treatment rates declined to 0.8 (95\% CI .5-1.1).
   Marginalized participants (PWID and those of indigenous ethnicity) and
   those disengaged from care were more likely to remain HCV RNA positive.
   Conclusions. After the removal of fibrosis restrictions, HCV treatment
   initiations nearly doubled immediately, but this treatment rate was not
   sustained. To meet the World Health Organization elimination targets,
   the minimization of structural barriers and adoption of tailored
   interventions are needed to engage and treat all vulnerable populations.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},

Volume = {{270}},
Month = {{JUL 15}},
Abstract = {{A new concept to enhance efficiency of the acoustic energy harvesting is
   presented and experimentally tested in this paper. An auxetic latticed
   resonator backed by an acoustic rectangular tube is proposed for this
   purpose. The concept is tested and proved by comparing the extracted
   power against performance of a conventional cantilever resonator at
   resonant-resonant condition. The problem is modeled by the Finite
   Element Method. The models are validated using experimental tests. The
   energy harvesting performance is numerically evaluated in different
   sound powers, geometrical aspects and electrical properties. In a
   parametric study, performance of the proposed auxetic resonator is
   compared with a plain one. It is shown that employing the concept can
   remarkably enhance performance of the acoustic energy harvesting system.
   At low frequencies, 138 Hz in this study, at an optimum situation we
   could arrive at a large magnification factor around 10.5 for 100 dB

Title = {{Re-entrant auxetic lattices with enhanced stiffness: A numerical study}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{178}},
Month = {{JUL 15}},
Abstract = {{Traditional auxetic lattices are featured with negative Poisson's ratio
   but weak stiffness. In this work, a set of auxetic lattices with
   enhanced stiffness are proposed by adding a strengthening rib into
   conventional auxetic unit cells in a direction perpendicular to the
   re-entrant direction. The effective mechanical properties of these
   variants are calculated using the fast Fourier transform-based
   homogenization method, which show that their Young's modulus in 2D can
   be improved by approximately 200\% along the strengthening direction
   without significant sacrifice of auxetic property. However, such an
   enhancement is weakened in 3D as the variant of a tetrahedral cell has
   an approximate 100\% improvement of Young's modulus only at low relative
   density. Though the stiffness of a variant hexahedral cell can be
   doubled in 3D at a wide range of relative density, its Poisson's ratio
   remains negative only in a narrow range of relative density. The
   findings in this work will offer new opportunities for the applications
   of auxetic materials which not only need negative Poisson's ratio but
   also high stiffness.}},

Title = {{Design of Self-Expanding Auxetic Stents Using Topology Optimization}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN BIOENGINEERING AND BIOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{JUL 14}},
Abstract = {{Implanting stents is the most efficient and minimally invasive technique
   for treating coronary artery diseases, but the risks of stent thrombosis
   (ST) and in-stent restenosis (IRS) hamper the healing process. There
   have been a variety of stents in market but dominated byad hocdesign
   motifs. A systematic design method that can enhance deliverability,
   safety and efficacy is still in demand. Most existing designs are
   focused on patient and biological factors, while the mechanical failures
   related to stenting architectures, e.g., inadequate stent expansion,
   stent fracture, stent malapposition and foreshortening, are often
   underestimated. With regard to these issues, the self-expanding (SE)
   stents may perform better than balloon-expandable (BE) stents, but the
   SE stents are not popular in clinic practice due to poor deliverability,
   placement accuracy, and precise match of the stent size and shape to the
   vessel. This paper addresses the importance between stent structures and
   clinic outcomes in the treatment of coronary artery disease. First, a
   concurrent topological optimization method will be developed to
   systematically find the best material distribution within the design
   domain. An extended parametric level set method with shell elements is
   proposed in the topology optimization to ensure the accuracy and
   efficiency of computations. Second, the auxetic metamaterial with
   negative Poisson's ratio is introduced into the self-expanding stents.
   Auxetics can enhance mechanical properties of structures, e.g., fracture
   toughness, indentation and shear resistance and vibration energy
   absorption, which will help resolve the drawbacks due to the mechanical
   failures. Final, the optimized SE stent is numerically validated with
   the commercial software ANSYS and then prototyped using additive
   manufacturing techniques. Topological optimization gives a rare
   opportunity to exploiting the unique advantages of additive
   manufacturing. Hence, the topologically optimized auxetic architectures
   will provide a new solution for developing novel stenting structures,
   especially conductive to self-expanding SE stents. The new design will
   overcome the limitations of conventional SE stents associated with
   mechanical structures while maintain their valuable features, to help
   reduce the occurrence of ST and ISR and benefit the clinic practice in
   treating coronary heart disease.}},

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional (2D) materials with both ferroelasticity and negative
   Poisson's ratios have attracted intensive interest, but it is very rare
   to have both ferroelasticity and negative Poisson's ratios in a single
   material. Directional positive and negative Poisson's ratios in a
   switchable ferroelastic dielectric may enable non-destructive readout in
   ferroelastic data storage. Herein, we propose 14 kinds of stable 2D
   semiconductors: AB monolayers (A = Sc, Y, La; B = N, P, As, Sb, Bi)
   based on first-principles calculations. The band gaps of AB monolayers
   cover a wide range from 0.69 eV to 2.15 eV. Mechanical analysis reveals
   that these materials are flexible and 12 of 14 are predicted to possess
   an in-plane negative Poisson's ratio (NPR). Moreover, 10 of these 14
   systems possess an out-of-plane NPR. More encouragingly, all AB
   monolayers are identified as 2D ferroelastic materials with reversible
   strains of around 5.94\% to 20.30\%. The ferroelastic switching
   barriers, mechanical properties and electronic structures of these
   materials are discussed in detail. Such outstanding properties make the
   AB monolayers very promising as switchable anisotropic 2D materials for
   nanoelectronics and micromechanical applications.}},

Title = {{Non-affinity in multi-material mechanical metamaterials}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JUL 13}},
Abstract = {{Non-affine deformations enable mechanical metamaterials to achieve their
   unusual properties while imposing implications for their structural
   integrity. The presence of multiple phases with different mechanical
   properties results in additional non-affinity of the deformations, a
   phenomenon that has never been studied before in the area of extremal
   mechanical metamaterials. Here, we studied the degree of non-affinity,
   Gamma, resulting from the random substitution of a fraction of the
   struts, rho(h), that make up a lattice structure and are printed using a
   soft material (elastic modulus = E-s) by those printed using a hard
   material (E-h). Depending on the unit cell angle (i.e., theta = 60
   degrees, 90 degrees, or 120 degrees), the lattice structures exhibited
   negative, near-zero, or positive values of the Poisson's ratio,
   respectively. We found that the auxetic structures exhibit the highest
   levels of non-affinity, followed by the structures with positive and
   near-zero values of the Poisson's ratio. We also observed an increase in
   Gamma with E-h/E-s and rho(h) until E-h/E-s=10(4) and rho(h)=75\%-90\%
   after which Gamma saturated. The dependency of Gamma upon rho(h) was
   therefore found to be highly asymmetric. The positive and negative
   values of the Poisson's ratio were strongly correlated with Gamma.
   Interestingly, achieving extremely high or extremely low values of the
   Poisson's ratio required highly affine deformations. In conclusion, our
   results clearly show the importance of considering non-affinity when
   trying to achieve a specific set of mechanical properties and underscore
   the structural integrity implications in multi-material mechanical
   metamaterials.}},

Title = {{Development of helical auxetic yarn with negative Poisson's ratio by
   combinations of different materials and wrapping angle}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL TEXTILES}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic materials have negative Poisson ratio which has a multiple
   ranges of functional applications. The helical auxetic yarn was
   successfully developed through direct twist system by using core and
   wrap yarn or filament, which shows Auxeticity when the HAY is stretched
   in longitudinal direction in response it expand in transverse direction,
   Helical Auxetic Yarns were developed using various parameters of the
   core and warp filament, these parameters are wrapping angle (Twist per
   meter), diameter ratio, and modulus ratio. The strength of Helical yarn
   was characterized using single yarn strength and Image J software was
   used for the calculation of poisson's ratio. According to test results,
   it is concluded that the core filament of helical auxetic yarn increased
   its thickness in transverse direction under stress, and a considerable
   negative poisson's ratio was calculated. The values of negative
   poisson's ratio described that the auxeticity had a direct relation with
   core filament thickness or diameter and inversely proportional to the
   linear density of wrap filament, in case of the wrap angle the
   auxeticity of HAY yarn had an inverse effect with wrap angle.
   Kevlar/polypropylene combination sample showed maximum auxeticity at a
   15-degree angle while Kevlar/nylon combination sample showed minimum
   auxeticity at a 25-degree wrap angle.}},

   Ratio for High-Energy Dissipation}},
Journal = {{ADVANCED MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{33}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Cellular plastics have been widely used in transportation, aerospace,
   and personal safety applications owing to their excellent mechanical,
   thermal, and acoustic properties. It is highly desirable to impart them
   with a complex porous structure and composition distribution to obtain
   specific functionality for various engineering applications, which is
   challenging with conventional foaming technologies. Herein, it is
   demonstrated that this can be achieved through the controlled freezing
   process of a monomer/water emulsion, followed by cryopolymerization and
   room temperature thawing. As ice is used as a template, this method is
   environmentally friendly and capable of producing cellular plastics with
   various microstructures by harnessing the numerous morphologies of ice
   crystals. In particular, a cellular plastic with a radially aligned
   structure shows a negative Poisson's ratio under compression. The rigid
   plastic shows a much higher energy dissipation capability compared to
   other materials with similar negative Poisson's ratios. Additionally,
   the simplicity and scalability of this approach provides new
   possibilities for fabricating high-performance cellular plastics with
   well-defined porous structures and composition distributions.}},

Title = {{Full-scale finite element modeling and nonlinear bending analysis of
   sandwich plates with functionally graded auxetic 3D lattice core}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SANDWICH STRUCTURES \& MATERIALS}},
Abstract = {{This paper investigates the nonlinear bending behavior of sandwich
   plates with functionally graded auxetic 3D lattice core. First and
   foremost, an auxetic 3D lattice metamaterial with negative effective
   Poisson's ratio (EPR) is designed and examined via theoretical and
   finite element methods with experimental verifications using specimens
   fabricated by 3D printing. Furthermore, three functionally graded
   configurations of the auxetic 3D lattice core through the plate
   thickness direction are proposed and compared with the uniform
   distribution case. Full-scale finite element modeling and nonlinear
   thermal-mechanical analysis are performed for the sandwich plates, with
   the temperature-dependent material properties of both core and face
   sheets taken into account. Numerical results revealed that the auxetic
   core can remarkably reduce the lateral deflections, with comparison to
   their non-auxetic counterpart with positive EPR. Parametric studies are
   further carried out to demonstrate the effects of functionally graded
   configurations, temperature rises, facesheet-to-core thickness ratios,
   boundary conditions, and strut radii on the nonlinear bending
   load-deflection curves, along with EPR-deflection curves in the large
   deflection region.}},

Abstract = {{Multivariate distributions are more and more used to model the
   dependence encountered in many fields. However, classical multivariate
   distributions can be restrictive by their nature, while Sarmanov's
   multivariate distribution, by joining different marginals in a flexible
   and tractable dependence structure, often provides a valuable
   alternative. In this paper, we introduce some bivariate mixed Sarmanov
   distributions with the purpose to extend the class of bivariate Sarmanov
   distributions and to obtain new dependency structures. Special attention
   is paid to the bivariate mixed Sarmanov distribution with Poisson
   marginals and, in particular, to the resulting bivariate Sarmanov
   distributions with negative binomial and with Poisson-inverse Gaussian
   marginals; these particular types of mixed distributions have possible
   applications in, for example modelling bivariate count data. The
   extension to higher dimensions is also discussed. Moreover, concerning
   the dependency structure, we also present some correlation formulas.}},

Abstract = {{Poisson's ratio is one of the fundamental features of materials,
   reflecting the transverse strain response to the applied certain axial
   strain. The materials with a negative Poisson's ratio, also known as

   interest because of their unusual mechanical behavior and extensive
   applications in mechanical nanodevices. Here, we proposed and studied a
   novel hyperbolic two-dimensional graphene-like structure (GLS) showing a
   negative Poisson's ratio behavior by first-principles calculation. The
   thermodynamic, dynamic, lattice dynamic, and mechanical stabilities of
   the GLS were carefully studied. In addition, we also explored the
   electronic structure, mechanical characteristics, and optical-electronic
   characteristics. The GLS not only displays a negative Poisson's ratio in
   certain directions but also shows low-gap semiconductor characteristics
   and superior electronic conductivity. It is a potential sunscreen
   material because of the outstanding reflection and absorption for
   ultraviolet and infrared light.}},

Title = {{Association Between Changes in Timing of Spring Onset and Asthma
   Hospitalization in Maryland}},
Journal = {{JAMA NETWORK OPEN}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 6}},
Abstract = {{Importance Ongoing climate change is affecting the health of communities
   across the globe. While direct consequences, including morbidity and
   mortality tied to increases in the frequency of extreme weather events,
   have received significant attention, indirect health effects,
   particularly those associated with climate change-driven disruptions in
   ecosystems, are less understood.
   Objective To investigate how ongoing changes in the timing of spring
   onset related to climate change are associated with rates of asthma
   hospitalization in Maryland.
   Design, Setting, and Participants This cross-sectional study of 29 257
   patients with asthma used general additive (quasi Poisson) and
   mixed-effect (negative binomial) models to investigate the association
   between changes in the timing of spring onset, detected using satellite
   observations, and the risk of asthma hospitalization in Maryland from
   2001 to 2012. Data analysis was conducted from January 2016 to March
   2019.
   Exposures Phenology data, derived from the National Aeronautics and
   Space Administration's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer,
   were used to calculate location-specific median dates for start of
   season from 2001 to 2012. How the start of season for a given year and
   location deviated from the long-term average was calculated and
   categorized as very early, early, normal, or late.
   Main Outcomes and Measures Daily asthma hospitalization in Maryland
   during the spring season (ie, March to May).
   Results There were 108 58 total asthma hospitalizations during the study
   period, of which 29 257 (27.0\%; 14 379 {[}49.1\%] non-Hispanic black
   patients; 17 877 {[}61.1\%] women) took place during springtime. In the
   unadjusted model, very early (incident rate ratio {[}IRR], 1.17; 95\%
   CI, 1.07-1.28) and late (IRR, 1.07; 95\% CI, 1.00-1.15) onset of spring
   were associated with increased risk of asthma hospitalization. When the
   analysis was adjusted for extreme heat events and concentrations of
   particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 mu m, the
   risk remained significant for very early spring onset (IRR, 1.10; 95\%
   CI, 1.02-1.20) but not for late spring onset (IRR, 1.03; 95\% CI,
   0.97-1.11).
   Conclusions and Relevance These results suggest that ongoing changes in
   the timing of spring onset, which are related to climate variability and
   change, are associated with asthma hospitalization. Given the high
   burden of allergic diseases and the number of individuals sensitized to
   tree pollen, these findings serve as a wake-up call to public health and
   medical communities regarding the need to anticipate and adapt to the
   ongoing changes in the timing and severity of the spring allergy season.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this article is to provide some insights on the
   osmo-inelastic response under stretching of annulus fibrosus of the
   intervertebral disc. Circumferentially oriented specimens of square
   cross section, extracted from different regions of bovine cervical discs
   (ventral-lateral and dorsal-lateral), are tested under different
   strain-rates and saline concentrations within normal range of strains.
   An accurate optical strain measuring technique, based upon digital image
   correlation, is used in order to determine the full-field displacements
   in the lamellae and fibers planes of the layered soft tissue. Annulus
   stress-stretch relationships are measured along with full-field
   transversal strains in the two planes. The mechanical response is found
   hysteretic, rate-dependent and osmolarity-dependent with a Poisson's
   ratio higher than 0.5 in the fibers plane and negative (auxeticity) in
   the lamellae plane. While the stiffness presents a regional-dependency
   due to variations in collagen fibers content/orientation, the
   strain-rate sensitivity of the response is found independent on the
   region. A significant osmotic effect is found on both the auxetic
   response in the lamellae plane and the stiffness rate-sensitivity. These
   local experimental observations will result in more accurate
   chemo-mechanical modeling of the disc annulus and a clearer multi-scale
   understanding of the disc intervertebral function.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents the computational analysis for determining the
   fatigue life of two conventional 2D auxetic cellular structures: (i) A
   chiral auxetic structure, (ii) A re-entrant auxetic structure. The
   low-cycle fatigue analysis using a damage initiation and damage
   evolution law was performed, where the needed material parameters were
   obtained previously from the experimentally determined stabilised
   hysteresis loop of inelastic strain energy. The direct cyclic algorithm
   implemented in the Abaqus/Standard software was used for the
   computational analyses to obtain the stabilised response of a model
   subjected to the cyclic loading. In order to examine the damage
   evolution paths, finite elements with severe damage were detected, and
   then removed from the finite element model in the subsequent numerical
   simulations.
   The computational fatigue analyses have shown that the chiral auxetic
   structure demonstrates a higher fatigue strength than the re-entrant
   auxetic structure which is probably due to the fact that, in the chiral
   structure, the stresses are distributed more uniformly along the
   individual cells. To confirm the computational results, the cyclic
   experimental testing has been performed for both auxetic structures. The
   comparison between computational and experimental results shows a
   reasonable agreement.}},

Abstract = {{Natural nonlinear materials, e.g., biological materials and polymers,
   are mechanically weak. It has been a major challenge to develop a
   nonlinear material with potential mechanical applications. Here, we
   develop a nonlinear elastic metamaterial with giant and
   tailorable-nonreciprocal elastic moduli. The metamaterial is designed
   with a microstructural axial asymmetry, which activated nonlinear
   microstructural deforma- tions in the axial direction and
   microstructural residual moments. This gives a robust load dependence of
   the nonlinear elastic modulus (i.e., secant modulus). The nonlinear
   elastic modulus is observed decreasing or increasing depending on, both,
   the direction and magnitude of the applied load. The nonlinear elastic
   modulus is increased by approximately 400\% upon switching the load
   direction and the activation of a microstructural buckling. Thus, the
   nonlinear elastic modulus is generally nonreciprocal, and the
   meta-material disobeys the Maxwell-Betti reciprocal theorem. This
   metamaterial is demonstrated by means of experimental and analytical
   mechanics. Various material samples are experimentally tested and their
   non-reciprocal elastic moduli are measured. In addition, the relation
   between the material's nonreciprocity and its topological mechanics is
   defined. The developed metamaterial can find many important mechanical
   applications such as making mechanical resonators with enhanced mass
   sensitivity.}},

Abstract = {{Today, the human being endeavors to manufacture devices and materials
   capable of doing something in an intelligent way. Shape memory polymers
   are a series of smart materials, capable of retrieving their original
   shape from a temporary form by applying external stimuli, for example,
   heat, electricity, magnetism, light, pH, and humidity. In this research,
   the behavior of temperature-sensitive shape memory polymer-based
   structures with positive and negative Poisson's ratio has been analyzed.
   The purpose is the material design of smart structures with tunable
   Poisson's ratio using topology optimization. In this study, a
   meta-structure is designed, which is made by a smart material. Not only
   does this structure have shape memory effects, but also it has negative
   Poisson's ratio, which can be used in new sensors, actuators, and
   biomedical applications. After creation of the unit cell and the
   representative volume element and formation of final three-dimensional
   structure, finite element modeling is conducted based on a
   thermo-visco-hyperelastic constitutive model at large deformations.
   Examining the behavior of structures in tensile pre-strains of 20\%,
   10\%, and 5\%, it is observed that pre-strain has no considerable effect
   on Poisson's ratio, but under compressive strain of 20\%, it is
   concluded that the type of loading is effective on Poisson's ratio and
   the results are different in tension and compression modes. Finally, the
   influence of temperature rate on the behavior of structures is
   inspected, and it is concluded that the more slowly the temperature
   changes, the more strain or shape recovery is accomplished at a specific
   temperature.}},

Abstract = {{Mechanical metamaterials represent a class of deformable systems, which
   exhibit macroscopic deformations, mechanical, and/or thermal properties.
   These emerge due to the structure of their subunits rather than their
   materials composition and typically exhibit anomalous (normally
   negative) macroscopic structural, mechanical, or thermal
   property/properties caused by a change in shape/size of the system.
   Herein, a class of honeycombs is discussed, which push to the extreme
   the classical definition of ``mechanical metamaterials,{''} exhibiting
   temperature-tunable Poisson's ratio properties. More specifically,
   centrosymmetric honeycombs with T-shaped joints constructed from
   different materials are shown to exhibit temperature-dependent Poisson's
   ratio values, which can be either positive or negative (auxetic)
   depending on the external stimulus the system is subjected to. The sign
   and magnitudes of the Poisson's ratio values are explained in terms of
   particular geometries that these composite honeycomb systems attain at
   different temperature conditions. In particular, auxeticity is
   attributed to the transformation of the T-shaped units to re-entrant
   units. Practical aspects on how these properties may be achieved are
   discussed, including the possibility that the changes in shape, and
   hence Poisson's ratios, are inducedviadifferent extents of dryness on
   opposite surfaces of ligaments made from absorbent materials.}},

Abstract = {{To improve vehicle side crashworthiness, this paper first introduces the
   negative Poisson's ratio structure to the traditional B-pillar and
   proposes a negative Poisson's ratio B-pillar. Then, the performance of
   the negative Poisson's ratio B-pillar is studied in detail by comparison
   with a traditional B-pillar and honeycomb B-pillar. Aiming at the
   problem that the side crashworthiness is also significantly affected by
   the side structure parameters of vehicle body, the factorial analysis
   theory is adopted to screen out the side structure parameters with
   significant effect. Based on this, by combining the optimal Latin
   hypercube design and response surface model, a multi-objective
   optimization design is conducted for those structure parameters based on
   non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II. Finally, the normal boundary
   intersection method is adopted to seek the Pareto optimal solution, and
   the simulation results show that compared with the traditional B-pillar,
   the negative Poisson's ratio B-pillar optimized by non-dominated sorting
   genetic algorithm II has better comprehensive crashworthiness. The
   results of this paper can provide some basis for the design and

Abstract = {{Poisson's ratio is the ratio of the displacement in the lateral
   direction to the displacement in the longitudinal direction when a
   material is deformed. The value of Poisson's ratio is constant for
   isotropic and homogeneous materials. The range of Poisson's ratio varies
   from -1 to 0.5 theoretically, but the value is typically positive.
   Recently, negative Poisson's ratios have attracted significant attention
   to researchers. Negative values are observed in some artificial
   structures; however, these structures do not exhibit isotropic
   characteristics. In this study, the characteristics of negative
   Poisson's ratios were investigated, and it was found that reentrant
   lattice structures can have negative Poisson's ratio values. Conceptual
   design for such structures was carried out, and detailed design
   considering the isotropic characteristics was performed through
   optimization to extremize the negative value of the Poisson's ratio. The
   optimization formulation was defined, and the size/shape structural
   optimization techniques were employed in finalizing the structures.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Weight stigmatization during adolescence may compromise the
   development of social relations important for the development. This
   study examined the associations between weight status and likelihood of
   nomination (indegree) for five different social network
   typesdfriendship, romantic, admiration, succeed, and popularity.
   Methods: Data for the study were from 1,110 tenth grade students (aged
   11-19 years) from four high schools in one Los Angeles school district
   in 2010. Multiple Poisson regression analyses using generalized linear
   model were conducted to examine the relationship between weight status
   (underweight/normal weight/overweight measured with body mass index
   calculated from self-reported height and weight) and adolescents'
   indegree for the five different networks.
   Results: Obese adolescents were significantly less likely to be
   nominated as romantic interest (odds ratio {[}OR]:.29, 95\% confidence
   interval {[}CI]:.19-42), admired (OR:.80, 95\% CI:.65-.97), or popular
   (OR:.71, 95\% CI:.57-88) compared with their normal weight peers.
   Overweight adolescents were also less likely to be nominated as a
   romantic interest (OR:.57, 95\% CI:.42-.78) or popular (OR:.67, 95\%
   CI:.53-.84) compared with those who were normal weight. Underweight
   adolescents were also less likely to be nominated as friends (OR:.76,
   95\% CI:.60e98), someone admired (OR:.61, 95\% CI:.42-.89), likely to
   succeed (OR:.62, 95\% CI:.44-.87), or popular (OR:.40, 95\% CI:.25-.64).
   Conclusions: Our results suggest weight status is associated with being
   selected by peers into different types of adolescent networks.
   Underweight, overweight, and obese adolescents are at an increased risk
   for social isolation because of their weight. This may have a negative
   impact on their peer relations important for social development,
   self-esteem, and mental health. (C) 2020 Society for Adolescent Health

Abstract = {{This paper experimentally investigates the behavior of sandwich beam
   with auxetic core subjected to low-velocity impact loading. Two types of
   sandwich beams with different topologies of auxetic cellular cores were
   produced. Furthermore, a test procedure involving a cylindrical impactor
   was developed, and a parametric study was designed and performed. The
   results revealed that, at the same level of impact energy, the peak load
   decreased by increasing the re-entrant angle would make the auxetic,
   sample with the highest re-entrant angle an ideal candidate for
   protective applications. However, in other applications where the
   structure needs to be protected from damage at a higher level of impact
   energy, the auxetic sample with the lowest re-entrant angle exhibited
   the best performance due to the highest amount of failure energy.
   Finally, the results showed that once the core structure changed from
   the conventional to auxetic, the energy level leading to damage to the
   structure increased so that it was escalated by a factor of 2 in the
   auxetic sample compared to the conventional sample. This is due to the
   negative Poisson's ratio effect of structure that makes unit cells be
   drawn into the projectile impact area and, in turn, the structure is
   strengthened.}},

Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the effects of magnetic field, Joule heating and
   volumetric heat generation on the heat transfer and fluid flow in a
   Cu-Water nanofluid filled lid driven cavity using enhanced
   streamfunction velocity method are investigated. The cavity is heated by
   a uniform volumetric heat density and side walls have constant
   temperature. The top wall moves with constant velocity in +x direction,
   while no-slip boundary conditions are imposed on the other walls of the
   cavity. An inclined fixed magnetic field is applied to the left side
   wall of the cavity. The dimensionless governing equations are solved
   numerically for the stream function and temperature using finite
   difference method for various Richardson(Ri), Reynolds(Re), Hartmann
   (Ha), Eckert(Ec)numbers, magnetic field angle(alpha) and solid volume
   fraction of the nanofluid(phi) in MATLAB software. To discretize the
   streamfunction-velocity formulation, a five point constant coefficient
   second-order compact finite difference approximation which avoids
   difficulties inherent in the conventional streamfunction vorticity and
   primitive variable formulations is used. The stream function equation is
   solved using fast Poisson's equation solver on a rectangular grid
   (POICALC function in MATLAB) and the temperature equation is solved
   using Jacobi bi-conjugate gradient stabilized (BiCGSTAB) method. The
   heat transfer within the cavity is characterized by Nusselt number
   (N-ui). The results show that N-ui is significantly increased by
   increasing Ri and phi and increasing the Reynolds number enhances
   convective cooling. The heat transfer within the cavity is decreased by
   increasing Hartmann number which improves conduction heat transfer and
   reduces N-ui. Joule heating has a negative effect on the convection
   within the cavity and convection is decreased by increasing the value of
   Ec. It can be investigated that N-ui is decreased by increasing Ec due
   to the strong distortion effect of Joule heating on convection current
   of heat transfer}},

Abstract = {{This study evaluated the shape memory and tensile property of 3D-printed
   sinusoidal sample/nylon composite for various thickness and cycles.
   Sinusoidal pattern of five thicknesses: 0.2 mm, 0.4 mm, 0.6 mm, 0.8 mm,
   and 1.0 mm were 3D-printed on nylon fabric by the fused deposition
   modeling (FDM) 3D printer using shape memory thermoplastic polyurethane
   (SMTPU). Afterward, shape memory and tensile property was investigated
   up to 50 shape memory cycles. The study found that 3D-printed sinusoidal
   sample/nylon composite had a 100\% shape recovery ratio for various
   thicknesses up to 50 cycles. The average shape recovery rate gradually
   decreased from 3.0 degrees/s to 0.7 degrees/s whereas the response time
   gradually increased with the increase of a 3D-printed pattern thickness.
   The stress and initial modulus gradually increased with the increase of
   the cycle's number. Thus, the shape memory property had a similar
   tendency for various cycles whereas the tensile property gradually
   increased with the increase of the cycle number. Moreover, this study
   demonstrated that this 3D-printed sinusoidal sample/nylon composite can
   go through more than 50 cycles without losing its tensile or shape
   memory property. This 3D-printed sinusoidal sample/nylon composite has
   vast potential as smart, reinforced, and protective clothing that

Journal = {{METALS}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{In this study, a computational fatigue analysis of topology optimised
   auxetic cellular structures made of Selective Laser Melting (SLM)
   AlSi10Mg alloy is presented. Structures were selected from the Pareto
   front obtained by the multi-objective optimisation. Five structures with
   different negative Poisson's ratios were considered for the parametric
   numerical analysis, where the fillet radius of cellular struts has been
   chosen as a parameter. The fatigue life of the analysed structures was
   determined by the strain-life approach using the Universal Slope method,
   where the needed material parameters were determined according to the
   experimental results obtained by quasi-static unidirectional tensile
   tests. The obtained computational results have shown that generally less
   auxetic structures tend to have a better fatigue life expectancy.
   Furthermore, the fillet radius has a significant impact on fatigue life.
   In general, the fatigue life decreases for smaller fillet radiuses (less
   than 0.3 mm) as a consequence of the high-stress concentrations, and
   also for larger fillet radiuses (more than 0.6 mm) due to the moving of
   the plastic zone away from the edge of the cell connections. The
   obtained computational results serve as a basis for further
   investigation, which should be focused on the experimental testing of
   the fabricated auxetic cellular structures made of SLM AlSi10Mg alloy
   under cyclic loading conditions.}},

Abstract = {{This study aims to evaluate the impact of pavement physical
   characteristics on the frequency of single-vehicle run-off-road (ROR)
   crashes in two-lane separated rural highways. In order to achieve this
   goal and to introduce the most accurate crash prediction model (CPM),
   authors have tried to develop generalized linear models, including the
   Poisson regression (PR), negative binomial regression (NBR)), and
   non-linear negative binomial regression models. Besides exposure
   parameters, the examined pavement physical characteristics explanatory
   variables contain pavement condition index (PCI), international
   roughness index (IRI) and ride number (RN). The forward procedure was
   conducted by which the variables were added to the core model one by
   one. In the non-linear procedure and at each step, 39 functional forms
   were checked to see whether the new model gives better fitness than the
   core/previous model. Several measurements were taken to assess the
   fitness of the model. In addition, other measurements were employed to
   estimate an external model validation and an error structure. Results
   showed that in PR and NBR models, variables coefficients were not
   significant. Findings of the suggested nonlinear model confirmed that
   PCI, as an objective variable, follows the experts anticipation (i.e.,
   better pavement manner associates with less ROR crashes). Finally, it
   should be noted that the roughness variable was insignificant at the
   assumed significance level, so it had no contribution to ROR crashes.
   The results imply that improving the pavement condition leads to a more
   probable decrease in the ROR crashes frequency.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: This study aimed to estimate the association between
   second-hand smoke (SHS) exposure in children and asthma, wheezing and
   perceived health.
   Method: A cross-sectional study based on a telephone survey was
   performed on a representative sample of 2411 children under 12 years old
   in Spain. Exposure to SHS in private and public settings, and the
   prevalence of asthma, wheezing and perceived poor health were described.
   The association between health indicators and SHS exposure was analyzed
   using multivariate Poisson regression models with robust variance
   according to age and educational level.
   Results: The prevalence of SHS exposure in children was 29.2\% in
   private settings and 42.5\% in public settings. There was no association
   between SHS exposure and asthma, wheezing and perceived poor health in
   children <= 5 years. In children aged 6-11 years with parents with
   primary/secondary education, presenting asthma (adjusted prevalence
   ratio {[}aPR]: 2.1; 95\% confidence interval {[}95\%CI]: 1.2-3.8) and
   worse perceived health (aPR: 1.6; 95\%CI: 1.1-2.1) were positively
   associated with SHS exposure in private settings. In children with
   parents with university studies, a negative association between SHS
   exposure and asthma (aPR: .3; 95\%CI: 0.1-0.7) and wheezing (aPR: 0.3;
   95\%CI: 0.1-0.8) was observed.
   Conclusions: There are differences in the association between SHS
   exposure and asthma, wheezing and poor perceived health according to
   educational level. Interventions with an equity perspective aimed at
   reducing SHS exposure in childhood should be implemented. (C) 2018

Abstract = {{Background: A diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) may impact the choice
   of parenthood. Objective: To investigate the number of live births,
   abortions and ectopic pregnancies among persons with MS. Methods: From
   the Danish Multiple Sclerosis Registry, we extracted data from all
   persons diagnosed with MS from 1960 to 1996 and matched each MS person
   with four reference persons. We used a negative binomial regression
   model for the live births and Poisson regression model for abortions and
   ectopic pregnancies. The total fertility rate (TFR) during 1960-2016 and
   the annual number of live births in the MS population were analysed.
   Results: Persons with MS had fewer children than reference persons.
   Fewer women with MS had elective abortions after diagnosis (incidence
   rate ratio (IRR) = 0.88; 95\% confidence interval (CI) = 0.78-1.00) than
   reference persons. There was no difference regarding the number of
   elective abortions, spontaneous abortions or ectopic pregnancies after
   onset. The TFR was lower for women with MS than for reference persons,
   and the number of annual live births by MS persons increased during
   1960-2016. Conclusion: MS seems to considerably impact reproductive
   choices, especially after clinical diagnosis, resulting in the MS
   population having fewer children than the general population.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction The timing of cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis has
   been debated with most studies favoring early cholecystectomy (< 72 h of
   onset). However, most reported studies are from single institution
   studies with only a few population-based studies. The purpose of this
   study is to compare clinical outcomes of patients undergoing
   cholecystectomy within 72 h of emergency department (ED) presentation to
   patients undergoing cholecystectomy following 72 h in a large statewide
   database. Methods The New York SPARCS administrative database was used
   to identify all adult patients presenting to the ED with a diagnosis of
   acute cholecystitis from 2005 to 2016. Patients aged < 18, missing data,
   or other biliary diagnoses were excluded from the analysis. Early
   cholecystectomy was defined as within 72 h of presentation to the
   emergency department. Early vs late groups were compared in terms of
   overall complications, bile duct injury (BDI), hospital length of stay
   (LOS), 30-days ED visits and readmissions. The linear trends of yearly
   early/late cholecystectomies were examined using a log-linear Poisson
   regression models. Multivariable logistic regression model was used to
   compare complications, BDI, and 30-day readmission/ED visits after
   controlling for confounding factors. Multivariable generalized linear
   regression for a negative binomial distributed count data was used to
   compare LOS. Results Following the application of the
   inclusion/exclusion criteria, there were 109,862 patients who presented
   to an ED with the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. The majority of
   patients underwent early cholecystectomy (n = 93,761, 85.3\%), whereas
   only 16,101 patients underwent late cholecystectomy (14.7\%). There was
   an increasing trend of early cholecystectomy from 2005 (81.1\%) to 2016
   (87.8\%). On multivariable regression, patients with early
   cholecystectomy were less likely to have complications (OR 0.542, 95\%
   CI 0.518-0.566), had shorter LOS (ratio 0.461, 95\% CI 0.458-0.465),
   were less likely to have 30-day readmission (OR 0.871, 95\% CI
   0.816-0.928), 30-day ED visits (OR 0.909, 95\% CI 0.862-0.959), and bile
   duct injury (OR 0.654, 95\% CI 0.444-0.962) compared to late
   cholecystectomy patients. Conclusion Early cholecystectomy (< 72 h) is
   associated with fewer complications, specifically BDI, shorter LOS, and
   fewer 30-day readmissions and ED visits. For patients presenting to the
   ED for acute cholecystitis, early cholecystectomy should be preferred.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Purpose: The efficiency of prehospital care chain
   response and the adequacy of hospital resources are challenged amid the
   coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, with suspected
   consequences for patients with ischemic stroke eligible for mechanical
   thrombectomy (MT). Methods: We conducted a prospective national-level
   data collection of patients treated with MT, ranging 45 days across
   epidemic containment measures instatement, and of patients treated
   during the same calendar period in 2019. The primary end point was the
   variation of patients receiving MT during the epidemic period. Secondary
   end points included care delays between onset, imaging, and groin
   puncture. To analyze the primary end point, we used a Poisson regression
   model. We then analyzed the correlation between the number of MTs and
   the number of COVID-19 cases hospitalizations, using the Pearson
   correlation coefficient (compared with the null value). Results: A total
   of 1513 patients were included at 32 centers, in all French
   administrative regions. There was a 21\% significant decrease (0.79;
   {[}95\%CI, 0.76-0.82];P<0.001) in MT case volumes during the epidemic
   period, and a significant increase in delays between imaging and groin
   puncture, overall (mean 144.9 +/- SD 86.8 minutes versus 126.2 +/-
   70.9;P<0.001 in 2019) and in transferred patients (mean 182.6 +/- SD
   82.0 minutes versus 153.25 +/- 67;P<0.001). After the instatement of
   strict epidemic mitigation measures, there was a significant negative
   correlation between the number of hospitalizations for COVID and the
   number of MT cases (R-2-0.51;P=0.04). Patients treated during the COVID
   outbreak were less likely to receive intravenous thrombolysis and to
   have unwitnessed strokes (bothP<0.05). Conclusions: Our study showed a
   significant decrease in patients treated with MTs during the first
   stages of the COVID epidemic in France and alarming indicators of
   lengthened care delays. These findings prompt immediate consideration of
   local and regional stroke networks preparedness in the varying contexts
   of COVID-19 pandemic evolution.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic fabrics with traditional filaments and auxetic structures have
   been provided by knitting method; however, the auxetic behavior and
   applicability of woven fabric with auxetic yarns remain to be studied.
   Thus, the paper aims to present the special characters of woven fabrics
   with heliacal auxetic yarns. Auxetic yarns with the maximum value of
   Poisson's ratio -0.88 were used as weft yarns to do the weaving by the
   semi-automatic loom. Then the properties of the fabrics have been tested
   and analyzed under tensions of different directions (warp, weft, and
   diagonal). The results indicated that the fabric presented auxetic
   effect with the maximum value of Poisson's ratio -0.3 under diagonal
   tension and also showed self-curling and self-folding behavior in
   natural state. Moreover, the relationship between properties and fabric
   weaves was also discussed and analyzed. It is expected that the study of
   fabrics with helical auxetic yarns could promote the practical
   applications of auxetic textiles such as the self-folding property for
   smart cladding materials.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTER METHODS IN APPLIED MECHANICS AND ENGINEERING}},

Volume = {{366}},
Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{Topology optimization is a technique in the engineering area that allows
   obtaining optimal designs of devices, mechanisms, complex structures and
   even design the microstructure of an auxetic material. Classically, the
   focus was made on considering the problem of obtaining such designs
   comprised of only one material. More recently, some efforts have been
   made to incorporate more than one material to the optimization problem.
   The present work addresses the topology optimization problem considering
   multiple materials on a fixed project domain. For the geometric
   description of the material domains, the concept of multiple level-sets
   has been used, meanwhile, its nucleation and evolution are governed by
   functions constructed from the topological derivative of a functional to
   be minimized The topological optimization algorithm developed to solve
   the multi-material topological optimization problem is described and its
   optimality condition is well established. Numerical examples applied to
   planar elasticity, bending plate, bi-dimensional steady-state heat
   transfer and optimal design of piezoelectric actuator problems are
   presented. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A single Rayleigh mode may exist with multiple values of phase-velocity
   at one frequency}},
Journal = {{GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL}},

Pages = {{582-594}},

Abstract = {{Other than commonly assumed in seismology, the phase velocity of
   Rayleigh waves is not necessarily a single-valued function of frequency.
   In fact, a single Rayleigh mode can exist with three different values of
   phase velocity at one frequency. We demonstrate this for the first
   higher mode on a realistic shallow seismic structure of a homogeneous
   layer of unconsolidated sediments on top of a half-space of solid rock
   (LOH). In the case of LOH a significant contrast to the half-space is
   required to produce the phenomenon. In a simpler structure of a
   homogeneous layer with fixed (rigid) bottom (LFB) the phenomenon exists
   for values of Poisson's ratio between 0.19 and 0.5 and is most
   pronounced for P-wave velocity being three times S-wave velocity
   (Poisson's ratio of 0.4375). A pavement-like structure (PAV) of two
   layers on top of a half-space produces the multivaluedness for the
   fundamental mode. Programs for the computation of synthetic dispersion
   curves are prone to trouble in such cases. Many of them use
   mode-follower algorithms which loose track of the dispersion curve and
   miss the multivalued section. We show results for well established
   programs. Their inability to properly handle these cases might be one
   reason why the phenomenon of multivaluedness went unnoticed in
   seismological Rayleigh wave research for so long. For the very same
   reason methods of dispersion analysis must fail if they imply wave
   number k(l)(omega) for the lth Rayleigh mode to be a single-valued
   function of frequency.. This applies in particular to deconvolution
   methods like phase-matched filters. We demonstrate that a slant-stack
   analysis fails in the multivalued section, while a Fourier-Bessel
   transformation captures the complete Rayleigh-wave signal. Waves of
   finite bandwidth in the multivalued section propagate with positive
   group-velocity and negative phase-velocity. Their eigenfunctions appear
   conventional and contain no conspicuous feature.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{177}},
Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{A novel 3D closed-cell cellular structure with different negative
   Poisson's ratio under tension and compression was presented. The 3D
   closed-cell cellular structure was generated by assembling the plane
   repeat units and sinusoidal wavy sheets units into the frame seamlessly.
   Four kinds of cellular structures with different responses under tension
   and compression are introduced. The mechanical properties of the
   proposed models were investigated. By choosing different repeated units,
   either positive or negative Poisson's ratio in three orthogonal
   directions can be achieved. Experiments and numerical simulations
   results show that the 3D closed-cell cellular structures have different
   responses under tension and compression loads. Considering material
   nonlinearities, the numerical results are analyzed using the
   instantaneous Poisson's ratio. The instantaneous Poisson's ratio can
   transit from negative to positive as the loads increase in 4 models. The
   results show that we can predict the auxetic response in a specific
   direction based on the repeated units that assembled into the frame.
   This designed structure provides an effective way to achieve a
   combination of negative, positive or zero Poisson's ratio.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMPACT ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{141}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The quasi-static and high strain rate response of chiral auxetic
   cellular structures were evaluated in this work. Samples of the chiral
   auxetic structures were fabricated with the Selective Electron Beam
   Melting (SEBM) technique from copper powder. Uniaxial quasi-static and
   low-speed dynamic compression tests were performed on a universal
   testing machine, while high strain rate tests up to 5000 s(-1) were
   performed using the one-stage powder gun. The experimental measurements
   together with infrared thermography and high-speed camera images were
   used to study the deformation mechanism of chiral auxetic structures. A
   significant effect of the shock enhancement observed in experiments at
   higher loading velocities was characterised by evaluating the specific
   energy absorption and specific strength. This phenomenon was further
   analysed in more detail by using parametric computational simulations,
   which offered more detailed analysis of mechanical behaviour at
   different strain rates. The computational results indicate that the
   plateau stress of chiral auxetic structure increases exponentially with
   increasing loading velocity. An empirical polynomial approximation was
   extracted from the computational results, which enables estimation of
   the plateau stress of auxetic cellular structures at arbitrary loading
   velocity in between the analyses velocity limits.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMPACT ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{141}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{This study aims to explore the crushing behavior of aluminum (AL) -
   carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) tubes with different hybrid
   configurations subjected to quasi-static and dynamic loading conditions.
   First, a series of experimental tests are carried out to explore the
   crushing behaviors of hybrid tubes in comparison with the corresponding
   individual tubes made of single material. The experimental results
   indicate that the H-II hybrid tube, made of an outer aluminum circular
   tube and internally adhered CFRP layers, generates a unique deformation
   pattern; whose outer aluminum tube inverses externally and inner CFRP
   layers crush progressively. With these distinctive deformation features,
   the H-II hybrid tubes are considered to be ideal with superior
   crashworthiness and energy-absorbing capacity. It is also found that
   loading rate has little influence on deformation pattern of hybrid tubes
   and single material tubes, while energy-absorbing capacity of hybrid
   tubes and individual CFRP tubes under dynamic loading are substantially
   lower than those under quasi-static loading. Second, numerical
   simulations are performed for the H-II hybrid tubes to provide further
   insights into their underlying energy-absorbing mechanisms. It is found
   that the external inversion mode of the outer aluminum tube is the major
   energy-absorbing mechanism, in which the contribution of the outer
   aluminum tube to total energy absorption decreases with increase in
   thickness of CFRP layers. The internal energy of the externally inversed
   aluminum tube is considerably higher than internal energy of typical
   progressively-folded AL tube (sole aluminum tube). Third, a parametric
   study is further conducted, which indicates that with increasing
   aluminum wall thickness, the specific energy absorption (SEA) increases.
   Besides, it is found that varying fiber orientation of inner CFRP layers
   leads to no evident change in the deformation mode and SEA of the H-II
   hybrid tubes. When the interfacial strength in between aluminum and CFPR
   reaches a certain level, there is no evident increase in the total
   energy absorption with further increase of the interface strength, but
   the initial peak crushing force increases notably. These results are
   expected to deepen the understanding of crushing behavior of the H-II
   hybrid tubes, thereby providing guidance for the crashworthiness design.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials exhibit a negative Poisson's ratio. Herein, the
   performance of rectangular auxetic membranes, under uniform load, is
   evaluated in terms of the maximum stress encountered. To facilitate
   convenient calculation, empirical modeling is conducted on the exact
   solution to reproduce displacement coefficients that are sufficiently
   accurate. A dimensionless maximum stress is then introduced to allow the
   effect from the membrane's Poisson's ratio and aspect ratio to be
   directly observed. Results reveal that 1) the dimensionless maximum
   stress reduces monotonically and nonmonotonically for conventional and
   auxetic membranes, respectively, 2) for the same Poisson's ratio
   magnitude the stresses in auxetic membranes are lower than those from
   conventional ones, 3) the optimal Poisson's ratio, on the basis of
   dimensionless maximum stress minimization, falls within the negative
   range, and 4) the dimensionless maximum stress minimization is
   especially effective for square membranes as well as very long and
   narrow membranes. It is therefore recommended that material auxeticity
   be taken into account-alongside geometrical and other material
   properties-in designing membranes and highly compliant very thin plates.}},

Title = {{Physical Modeling Test on Deformation and Failure of Rock Slope with New
   Support System}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN CIVIL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{2020}},
Month = {{JUN 29}},
Abstract = {{In order to explore the monitoring and control method of rock slope,
   indoor physical model testing of collapse control and monitoring were
   carried out with the example of a rock slope collapse area project in
   Jietai Temple in Beijing, China, as the prototype. Based on the
   similarity theory, in this study, a new structural support with Negative
   Poisson's Ratio bolt and flexible anchored net was utilized to reinforce
   the rock slope. Following a graded loading sequence, the collapse
   failure characteristics and the overall control effect of energy
   absorption reinforcement measures were explored. The experimental
   results demonstrated that the entire process of slope collapse presented
   four distinct stages of failure: fracture generation, fracture
   propagation, partial collapse, and overall collapse. The full-field
   displacement nephogram and the displacement monitoring point of the
   collapse area indicated that the large deformation and failure of the
   collapsed surrounding rock were effectively controlled, while the
   Negative Poisson's Ratio bolt and the flexible anchored net had good
   reinforcement effects. The experimental stress record presented that the
   change of pressure curve was an apparent regularity in the entire
   process of slope collapse, which reflects the change state of internal
   force of surrounding rock; it includes the function of monitoring of
   slope collapse. It was indicated that the Negative Poisson's Ratio bolt
   along with the large-deformation flexible anchored net had good
   reinforcement monitoring effect on the rock slope collapse disaster.}},

Abstract = {{Aim To estimate the prevalence of visual impairment (VI) and associated
   factors and further quantify its association with social isolation,
   depression and life satisfaction among older adults in Ghana.
   Methods WHO Study on Global AGEing and Adult Health Ghana dataset for
   older adults 50 years and above was used for this study. Social
   isolation, depression and life satisfaction were our primary outcomes
   with VI being our secondary outcome. We employed negative binomial,
   Poisson and generalised negative binomial regression models individually
   modified with Coarsened Exact Matching method of analysis. All analysis
   was performed by adopting robust SE estimation using Stata V.15.
   Results The prevalence of VI was 17.1\% (95\% CI14.3 to 20.2) and the
   factors associated include age groups, educational level, religion,
   region, where the participant was born, and difficulty in
   work/households activity (p<0.05). The inferential analysis shows that
   the significant log-likelihood score of social isolation and life
   satisfaction for older adults with VI was 0.25 more (95\% CI 0.03 to
   0.47) and 0.04 less (95\% CI -0.08 to -0.01), respectively, compared
   with those without VI. The prevalence of depression among older adults
   with VI was significantly 90\% higher compared with non-VI (adjusted
   prevalence ratio (95\% CI) = 1.90 (1.17 to 3.09), p<0.001).
   Conclusion The prevalence of VI is associated with increasing age,
   educational level and self-rated health. VI was identified to be
   associated with social isolation, depression and diminishing life
   satisfaction. In order to achieve sustainable development goal \#3, a
   national focus on geriatric care as part of the implementation of the
   National Ageing Policy will garner improvement in the quality of life of
   older adults with visual VI in Ghana. Eye health practitioners at all
   levels of the health systems should consider the psychosocial
   consequences of VI for the optimum care of the older adult client.}},

Abstract = {{With the development of deep energy resources, understanding variations
   in the physical and mechanical properties of rocks at different depths
   is significant. In this paper, core samples from ten different burial
   depths (1000 m, 1300 m, 1600 m, 1850 m, 2600 m, 3500 m, 4800 m, 5100 m,
   5600 m, and 6400 m) were collected from the Songke No. 2 (SK-2) well and
   the Daqing Oilfield. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
   study involving the physical property and uniaxial compression testing
   of rock cores from such a large range of burial depths. The experimental
   results show that the content of weak phase minerals decreases with
   increasing depth. The change in the hard phase minerals varies
   nonlinearly with depth. From 3500 to 5600 m, the content of hard phase
   minerals decreases, while the content of the middle phase minerals
   increases. The elastic modulus exponentially increases with increasing
   depth, while Poisson's ratio decreases with increasing depth.
   Additionally, the uniaxial compressive strength displays a nonlinear
   logarithmic increase with increasing depth. Finally, the effects of
   petrophysical properties on the mechanical behavior of rock at different
   depths are discussed. The elastic modulus, Poisson's ratio, and
   compressive strength all have a negative correlation with the content of
   weak phase minerals. These results have important value for studying the
   mechanics of rocks at different depths.}},

Abstract = {{The increasing number of protein-based metamaterials demands reliable
   and efficient theoretical and computational methods to study the
   physicochemical properties they may display. In this regard, we develop
   a simulation strategy based on Molecular Dynamics (MD) that addresses
   the geometric degrees of freedom of an auxetic two-dimensional protein
   crystal. This model consists of a network of impenetrable rigid squares
   linked through massless rigid rods. Our MD methodology extends the
   well-known protocols SHAKE and RATTLE to include highly non-linear
   holonomic and non-holonomic constraints, with an emphasis on collision
   detection and response between anisotropic rigid bodies. The presented
   method enables the simulation of long-time dynamics with reasonably
   large time steps. The data extracted from the simulations allow the
   characterization of the dynamical correlations featured by the protein
   subunits, which show a persistent motional interdependence across the
   array. On the other hand, non-holonomic constraints (collisions between
   subunits) increase the number of inhomogeneous deformations of the
   network, thus driving it away from an isotropic response. Our work
   provides the first long-timescale simulation of the dynamics of protein
   crystals and offers insights into promising mechanical properties
   afforded by these materials.}},

Abstract = {{A novel lithium ion battery (LIB) anode material with high capacity is
   found, which is made of cross-linked graphene sheets. The new material,
   named bco-C20, has a 3D honeycomb structure composed of unit cells of 20
   atoms, and exhibits a body-centered orthorhombic crystal structure. The
   thermal, dynamic, and mechanical stabilities of such a material are well
   evaluated by molecular dynamics simulation, phonon dispersion, and
   Born-Huang criteria. As a promising semimetal, bco-C20 possesses a
   unique electronic band structure with cross-linked Dirac nodal-rings.
   The Fermi velocities are from 8.25 x 10(5)m s(-1)to 10.45 x 10(5)m
   s(-1), indicating good electronic transport properties. A comparison
   with most of the 3D carbon materials demonstrates that bco-C20 also has
   the good material properties of high strength and fracture toughness
   that are very close to those of graphene. Furthermore, a negative
   Poisson's ratio of up to -0.25 is very helpful for the new material to
   bear compressive load. Most importantly, as a promising anode material
   in LIBs, bco-C20 has a high theoretical capacity of 893 mA h g(-1), low
   diffusion barrier of 0.02-0.12 eV, average open-circuit voltage of 0.41
   V, and negligible volume change of 3.7\%. Some related properties of
   lithiated bco-C20 are also evaluated and discussed. This study should be
   helpful for expanding the family of 3D carbon materials with
   extraordinary properties as well as their promising applications in
   advanced energy fields.}},

Abstract = {{Liquid crystalline elastomers (LCEs) have been actively investigated as
   stimuli-controlled actuators and soft robots. The basis of these
   applications is the ability of LCEs to undergo a reversible shape change
   upon a liquid crystalline (LC)-isotropic phase transition. Herein, we
   report the synthesis of a novel LCE based on a side-chain liquid
   crystalline polymer (SCLCP). In contrast to known LCEs, this LCE
   exhibits a striking anomalous shape change. Subjecting a mechanically
   stretched monodomain strip to LC-disorder phase transition, both the
   length and width of the strip contract in isotropic phase, and both
   elongate in LC phase. This thermally induced behaviour is the result of
   a subtle interplay between the relaxation of polymer main chain oriented
   along the stretching direction and the disordering of side-group
   mesogens oriented perpendicularly to the stretching direction. This
   finding points out potential design of LCEs of this peculiar type and
   possible applications to exploit.}},

Abstract = {{3D printed, stimuli-responsive materials that reversibly actuate between
   programmed shapes are promising for applications ranging from biomedical
   implants to soft robotics. However, current 3D printing of reversible
   actuators significantly limits the range of possible shapes and/or shape
   responses because they couple the print path to mathematically
   determined director profiles to elicit a desired shape change. Here, we
   report a reactive 3D-printing method that decouples printing and
   shape-programming steps, enabling a broad range of complex architectures
   and virtually any arbitrary shape changes. This method involves first
   printing liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) precursor solution into a
   catalyst bath, producing complex architectures defined by printing.
   Shape changes are then programmed through mechanical deformation and UV
   irradiation. Upon heating and cooling, the LCE reversibly shape-shifts
   between printed and programmed shapes, respectively. The potential of
   this method was demonstrated by programming a variety of arbitrary shape
   changes in a single printed material, producing auxetic LCE structures
   and symmetry-breaking shape changes in LCE sheets.}},

Abstract = {{The paper proposes an innovative concept for energy absorption in case
   of localized impacts. The concept is based on the contraction of
   cellular structures with negative Poisson's ratio under impact, which is
   combined with the energy absorption capability of a foam filler. An
   experimental assessment was accomplished considering a 3D-printed
   polymeric hexa-chiral frame filled with open-cell soft polyurethane foam
   inserts, subjected to quasistatic and dynamic indentation. The energy
   absorbed by the combination of the auxetic frame and foam is
   significantly higher than the sum of the energies absorbed by
   constituent elements tested separately. Based on the experiments, a
   numerical approach for foam-filled absorbers is developed and validated.
   Then non-linear models of metallic chiral units are considered in a
   genetic optimization process, set up to optimize the maximum frame
   contraction under compression before its failure. Finally, the
   previously validated numerical approach is applied to the optimized
   geometries, and it is shown that the foam filler can provide significant
   enhancement of specific absorbed energy and load uniformity ratio also
   for frames made of ductile metallic material.}},

Title = {{Pet-Keeping in Relation to Asthma, Rhinitis, and Eczema Symptoms Among
   Adolescents in Kuwait: A Cross-Sectional Study}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PEDIATRICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{JUN 23}},
Abstract = {{Background:Findings on the associations between household pet-keeping
   and allergic diseases, including asthma, rhinitis, and eczema, have been
   contradictory, with investigations reporting positive, negative, and
   null associations. This study sought to estimate the prevalence of
   pet-keeping among families in Kuwait and to assess the associations
   between pet-keeping and symptoms of allergic diseases among adolescents.
   Methods:Schoolchildren aged 11-14 years (n= 3,864) were enrolled in this
   cross-sectional study. The children's parents completed questionnaires
   regarding their child's environmental exposures, including pet-keeping
   in the past 12 months, and clinical history and symptoms of allergic
   diseases. Associations were assessed using Poisson regression with
   robust variance estimation, and adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) and
   their 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated.
   Results:Pet-keeping in the past 12 months was reported by 42.8\% of the
   participating families. Birds, cats, rabbits, fish, and dogs were kept
   by 28.3, 13.2, 7.8, 3.9, and 3.1\% of all households, respectively.
   Current cat ownership was significantly associated with current wheezing
   (aPR 1.29, 95\% CI 1.05-1.58), current rhinitis symptoms (aPR 1.18, 95\%
   CI 1.02-1.36), and ever doctor-diagnosed eczema (aPR 1.25, 95\% CI
   1.03-1.50). Current rabbit-keeping was positively associated with
   multiple symptoms of asthma (e.g., study-defined current asthma: aPR
   1.38, 95\% CI 1.04-1.82) and eczema (e.g., severe eczema: aPR 1.94, 95\%
   CI 1.02-3.71). Similarly, current bird-keeping was associated with
   study-defined current rhinitis (aPR 1.19, 95\% CI 1.05-1.41) and current
   itchy rash (aPR 1.27, 95\% CI 1.10-1.46). Conclusions:Household
   pet-keeping is very common and diverse in Kuwait and was found to be
   positively associated with symptoms of allergic diseases among
   adolescents. The findings of associations between rabbit-keeping and
   symptoms of asthma and eczema add to the existing literature and further
   highlight the importance of considering the pet type when assessing such
   associations.}},

Abstract = {{We analyze the ferroelectric domain-wall induced negative capacitance
   (NC) effect in Metal-FE-Insulator-Metal (MFIM) and
   Metal-FE-Insulator-Semiconductor (MFIS) stacks through phase-field
   simulations by self-consistently solving time-dependent Ginzburg Landau
   equation, Poisson's equation and semiconductor charge equations.
   Considering Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 as the ferroelectric material, we study 180
   degrees ferroelectric domain formation in MFIM and MFIS stacks and their
   polarization switching characteristics. Our analysis signifies that the
   applied voltage-induced polarization switching via soft domain-wall
   displacement exhibits non-hysteretic characteristics. In addition, the
   change in domain-wall energy, due to domain-wall displacement, exhibits
   a long-range interaction and thus, leads to a non-homogeneous effective
   local negative permittivity in the ferroelectric. Such effects yield an
   average negative effective permittivity that further provides an
   enhanced charge response in the MFIM stack, compared to
   Metal-Insulator-Metal. Furthermore, we show that the domain-wall induced
   negative effective permittivity is not an intrinsic property of the
   ferroelectric material and therefore, is dependent on its thickness, the
   gradient energy coefficient and the in-plane permittivity of the
   underlying insulator. Similar to the MFIM stack, MFIS stack also
   exhibits an enhanced charge/capacitance response compared to
   Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (MOS) capacitor. Simultaneously, the
   multi-domain state of the ferroelectric induces non-homogeneous
   potential in the underlying insulator and semiconductor layer. At low
   applied voltages, such non-homogeneity leads to the co-existence of
   electrons and holes in an undoped semiconductor. In addition, we show
   that with the ferroelectric layer being in the 180 degrees multi-domain
   state, the minimum potential at the ferroelectric-dielectric interface
   and hence, the minimum surface potential in the semiconductor, does not
   exceed the applied voltage (in-spite of the local differential
   amplification and charge enhancement).}},

Title = {{Design and modelling of auxetic double arrowhead honeycomb core sandwich
   panels for performance improvement under air blast loading}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SANDWICH STRUCTURES \& MATERIALS}},
Abstract = {{In the present study, a 2D-based large-scale metallic auxetic double
   arrowhead honeycomb core sandwich panel (DAHSP) was proposed and its
   deformation response, energy dissipation characteristics and associated
   mechanisms under air blasts were investigated using a validated
   numerical model. It aims at the performance improvement of DAHSPs
   through the design of core relative density with respect to different
   strategies. The DAHSPs considered mainly experienced a local dome
   superimposed upon global deformation of front face and global
   deformation of back face, while the core webs were heavily buckled and
   progressively collapsed. The results confirmed the material
   concentration effect of DAH cores induced by the negative Poisson's
   ratio (NPR). It was found that the panel deformation response was highly
   related to their deformation/failure mechanisms. Relative to core web
   thickness, the increase of number of core layers led to a more
   remarkable decrease in permanent deflections. However, the decline of
   inclined angles not always reduced the back face deflection due to the
   competition between enhanced bending stiffness and deteriorated local
   contact force. An ideal means to decrease the panel deformation is to
   enlarge the inclined angles at low relative density but to decrease the
   horizontal distance when the relative density increases to a high level.
   The panel with thinner core webs at low relative density and the panel
   with narrowed inclined angles at high relative density is more
   beneficial to plastic energy absorption. In addition, a core
   configuration with a thinner tendon but a thicker stuffer promoted the
   exploitation of NPR and further improved the panel energy absorption.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic woven fabrics made with special geometrical structures have
   gained the interest of textile scientists in recent years. This paper
   reports a study on auxetic woven fabric based on a double-directional
   parallel in-phase zig-zag foldable geometrical structure. Such a fabric
   has been already produced and investigated for its negative Poisson's
   ratio effect in two principal directions (weft and warp directions).
   However, its negative Poisson's ratio effect in biased tensile
   directions as well as under repeated tensile loading conditions has not
   been studied yet. Therefore, in this paper, these two limitations are
   addressed. The auxetic woven fabric was firstly fabricated, and then
   subjected not only to tensile tests in different tensile directions,
   including two principle directions and three biased directions, but also
   to repeated tensile loading. It was found that both the negative
   Poisson's ratio effect and the resistance to tensile deformation are
   dependent upon the tensile direction, and the highest negative Poisson's
   ratio effect and higher resistance to tensile deformation are obtained
   in two principal directions.}},

Abstract = {{Background With more and more medical device databases being developed,
   there is an increasing interest in learning the geographical patterns of
   medical-device-related adverse events (AEs). For a specific medical
   device and an adverse event (AE) of interest, our aim is to detect a
   spatial-cluster signal that has a significantly higher AE rate than the
   AE rates for other regions, when the exposure information is available.
   Methods We develop a likelihood ratio test (LRT) method incorporating
   exposure information, by geographical region, for spatial-cluster signal
   detection when the underlying observed health outcome associated with
   the medical device of interest is a Poisson-modeled count data (e.g., an
   outcome of AE count). Results An extensive simulation study shows that
   this method has good power, sensitivity, specificity, positive
   predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV). The
   application of the method is demonstrated by two hypothetical case
   studies regarding a medical device that is used for patients who have
   reached end-stage heart failure. Discussion A methodological framework
   for exploring geographic patterns in device safety surveillance is
   discussed, including safety data collection, statistical tools, and
   display of the analysis results. The proposed statistical method can be
   used for spatial-cluster signal detection for an AE of interest from
   medical device registries or other databases that have patient-level
   geographical information.}},

Title = {{Effect of steel fibers on geopolymer properties - The best synopsis for
   civil engineer}},
Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{246}},
Month = {{JUN 20}},
Abstract = {{Recently, the introduction of steel fibers to geopolymers as a
   reinforcement has developed and increased owing to the rapid development
   of geopolymers. Despite geopolymers exhibit potential properties such as
   low energy consumption and carbon footprint, flame resistance, fire
   resistance, valuable compressive strength and good durability, they
   suffer from low flexural and tensile strengths. To solve these problems,
   steel fibers are added to geopolymers to improve their ductility,
   toughness, flexural and tensile strengths. The present paper targets to
   summarize the earlier studies carried out on the influence of steel
   fibers on the fresh and the hardened properties of the geopolymers. This
   review confirmed that the incorporations of steel fibers into
   geopolymers have a positive effect on flexural strength, splitting
   tensile strength, ductility, modulus of rupture, modulus of elasticity,
   Poisson's ratio, toughness, chemical resistance, shrinkage, sorptivity,
   water absorption, permeability, water penetration depth, load carrying
   capacity, crack propagation and post-cracking. In addition, in most
   cases compressive strength increased. On the other hand, they have a
   negative effect on porosity and workability. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All

   starts with defining TSMs and how to classify and name TSMs. The article
   also introduces the theoretical modeling of TSMs, the software developed
   for analyzing TSMs and the parametric studies performed. Findings After
   these studies, new materials are introduced that have abilities such as
   negative Poisson ratio inXandYdirection, negative Poisson ratio in one
   direction (eitherxor y), self-remodeling under stress. Research
   limitations/implications The research is done in 2D, further studies in
   3D using 3D printing are required to make the suggested materials a
   viable real-world solution. Originality/value The main contribution of
   this research work is the proposed nomenclature that creates a system
   for researchers to experiment and create novel and unique versions of
   the proposed materials. Furthermore, some of the materials developed

Title = {{HIV testing, care and viral suppression among men who have sex with men
   and transgender individuals in Johannesburg, South Africa}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{15}},

Month = {{JUN 17}},
Abstract = {{Introduction Men who have sex with men and transgender individuals
   (MSM/TG) carry a disproportionately high burden of HIV, including in
   South Africa. However, there are few empirical population-representative
   estimates of viral suppression and the HIV care cascade including HIV
   testing among this population, nor of factors associated with these
   outcomes. Methods We conducted a respondent driven sampling (RDS) survey
   among 301 MSM/TG in Johannesburg in 2017. Participants gave blood
   samples for HIV testing and viral load. Participants self-completed a
   survey including sociodemographics, HIV testing history, and engagement
   in care. We calculated RDS-II weighted estimates of the percentage of
   HIV-negative MSM/TG reporting HIV testing in the previous 6 months,
   their testing experience and preferences. Among those HIV-positive, we
   estimated the percentage status-aware, on ART, and virally suppressed
   (<50 viral copies/ml plasma). We conducted RDS-weighted robust Poisson
   regression to obtain weighted prevalence ratios of factors associated
   with 1) HIV testing among those HIV-negative; and 2) viral suppression
   among those HIV-positive. Results There were 118/300 HIV-positive
   MSM/TG, (37.5\%). Of the HIV-negative MSM/TG, 61.5\% reported that they
   had tested for HIV in the previous 6 months, which was associated with
   selling sex to men (Prevalence Ratio = 1.67, 95\% CI 1.36-2.05). There
   were 76/118 HIV-positive MSM/TG (56.5\%) who reported having previously
   tested positive for HIV and 39/118 (30.0\%) who reported current ART.
   There were 58/118 HIV-positive MSM/TG with viral loads <50 copies/ml
   plasma (46.9\%). Viral suppression was associated with older age
   (adjusted PR = 1.03, 95\% CI 1.00-1.06 for each year), neighbourhood,
   and having bought sex from men (adjusted PR = 1.53, 95\% CI 1.12-2.08).
   Conclusions HIV prevalence was very high. Viral suppression among those
   HIV-positive was similar to the general male population in South Africa,
   but remains far short of national and international targets. A majority
   of HIV-negative MSM/TG had HIV tested in the previous 6 months, though
   there is room for improvement.}},

Abstract = {{Exploiting the unique properties of three-dimensional (3D) auxetic
   scaffolds in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine applications
   provides new impetus to these fields. Herein, the results on the
   fabrication and characterization of 3D auxetic scaffolds for tissue
   engineering applications are presented. The scaffolds are based on the
   well-known re-entrant hexagonal geometry (bowtie) and they are
   fabricated by multiphoton lithography using the organic-inorganic
   photopolymer SZ2080. In situ scanning electron
   microscopy-microindentations and nanoindention experiments are employed
   to characterize the photocurable resin SZ2080 and the scaffolds
   fabricated with it. Despite SZ2080 being a stiff material with a
   positive Poisson's ratio, the scaffolds exhibit a negative Poisson's
   ratio and high elasticity due to their architecture. Next, mouse
   fibroblasts are used to seed the scaffolds, showing that they can
   readily penetrate them and proliferate in them, adapting the scaffold
   shape to suit the cells' requirements. Moreover, the scaffold
   architecture provides the cells with a predilection to specific
   directions, an imperative parameter for regenerative medicine in many
   cell-based applications. This research paves the way for the utility of
   3D auxetic metamaterials as the next-generation adaptable scaffolds for
   tissue engineering.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic mechanical metamaterials (AMMs), as an exciting paradigm of
   metamaterials, have attracted increasing attention due to their
   interesting mechanical properties (e.g. negative Poisson's ratio), as
   well as the emergence of advanced manufacturing technology (e.g. 3D
   printing). Although various reviews on AMMs, their structures,
   properties, and applications, have existed, it still lacks a
   comprehensive review in terms of manufacturing methods. Herein, the
   latest progress in AMMs is extensively reviewed, including AMMs'
   structures, characteristics, manufacturing methods, and applications. In
   addition, the current challenges and future works of AMMs are concluded
   and discussed. This Review aims to serve as a collection of knowledge
   that supplies more comprehensive understanding and inspiration to
   support further developments of AMMs from the perspective of design and

   residents of the municipality of Natal (Northeast Brazil), diagnosed
   with BC and submitted to oncological treatment. Data collection took
   place between July/2015 and May/2016 from medical records and
   individuals' interviews, and from theMedical Outcome Study-Social
   Support Survey.Descriptive, bivariate and multivariate statistics were
   carried out through Poisson's regression with robust variance and
   significance level 0.05. Prevalence of LSS in women with BC was 22.8\%
   with confidence interval 14.6-39.94. Type of access to public services
   (p< .03), prevalence ratio (PR) 1.84 and negative self-rated health (p<
   .001), PR 4.47 were associated with LSS. These results were obtained
   after adjustments by the variables age and presence of chronic diseases.
   The associations established herein could have been mostly related to
   fragilities of the Brazilian health system, and can contribute to the

Abstract = {{Herein, the deformation and properties of cellular structures of

   developed and used to simulate structures of different sample dimensions

   Structures with different sizes and aspect ratios, beam angles, and
   lattice patterns are comparatively studied. The numerical results show a
   good agreement with the experimental data on samples of various
   sizes/patterns. The main deformation modes and key stages of the corner
   edge-wall contact and structure deformation are presented, and the key
   mechanism is analyzed. Poisson's ratio and stability of the auxeticity
   of different structures are established. The link between the structural
   and auxeticity stabilities and the characteristic of the corner
   edge-wall contact in MR and MSs are discussed. The MSs with alternative
   MR columns at opposite orientations show a better shape stability and
   higher critical strain for a stable auxeticity.}},

Abstract = {{The high pressure and elastic properties of a hybrid ABX(3)-type
   perovskite, {[}C(NH2)(3)]{[}Cd(HCOO)(3)] (CdGF), based on the A-site
   guest molecules are revealed via combining the high-pressure synchrotron
   X-ray diffraction experiments with density functional theory (DFT)
   calculations. The experimental results indicate that the anisotropic
   axial compressibilities are K-a = 2.8(4) and K-c = 20.9(10) TPa-1 within
   the pressure scope of 4.12 GPa, and calculations reveal the microscopic
   evolution of structure under pressure and demonstrate that this
   structural anisotropy is a consequence of the directional guest molecule
   and the cooperative effect of hydrogen bonding and octahedral tilting.
   In addition, full elastic constants of the perovskite were calculated to
   describe Young's moduli, shear moduli and Poisson's ratios. Notably,
   these discrete moduli are governed by the orientational guest molecule
   suggesting that the perovskite may display positive (negative) linear
   compression if it is flexible (rigid) along one principal axis.}},

Journal = {{MECHANICS OF ADVANCED MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Abstract = {{A multimaterial strategy is adopted in combination with the structure
   innovation to achieve enhanced structural stiffness, and meanwhile, to
   retain the auxetic behavior for auxetic metamaterials. A bimaterial
   reentrant structure with additional soft arch-like beams and hinges is
   proposed, and then investigated using both experimental and simulation
   approaches. The results indicate that the buckling issue of the
   beam/wall can be significantly reduced if the strength of the hinge is
   kept small, and the reduction of auxetic behavior due to increased
   stiffness can also be minimized. Therefore, the strategy to enhance the
   design flexibility for auxetic metamaterials is verified.}},

Title = {{Impact of migration from an illicit drug scene on hospital outcomes
   among people who use illicit drugs in Vancouver, Canada}},
Journal = {{DRUG AND ALCOHOL REVIEW}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{924-931}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Introduction and Aims People who use illicit drugs (PWUD) are vulnerable
   to an array of negative health outcomes, and increased hospital services
   utilisation. PWUD are also a transient population which poses challenges
   to the provision of optimal health care. The objective of this study was
   to identify out-migration patterns from Vancouver's Downtown Eastside
   (DTES), a neighbourhood where services for PWUD are concentrated, and to
   estimate the impact of these patterns on hospitalisation events among
   PWUD.
   Design and Methods Data were collected through three prospective cohorts
   of PWUD in Vancouver, which were linked with health administrative data.
   Latent class growth analysis was used to define migration trajectory
   groups. Poisson regression was used to estimate the effect of migration
   patterns on hospitalisation events.
   Results A total of 1180 participants were included in the study. Four
   latent classes were identified: early migration out (243, 20.6\%);
   frequent revisit (112, 9.5\%); late migration out (219, 18.6\%); and
   consistently living in the DTES (606, 51.4\%). Compared with those who
   consistently lived in the DTES, participants in the early migration out
   group had lower hospitalisation events (adjusted rate ratio = 0.65; 95\%
   confidence interval: 0.48-0.90).
   Discussion and Conclusion We found that PWUD who migrated out of the
   DTES early had lower hospitalisation events compared to those who
   consistently lived in the DTES, which may be a function of lesser
   addiction severity among this trajectory group. These findings
   underscore a need to provide transitional health and social service
   supports for other trajectory groups in an effort to minimise
   hospitalisation for preventable causes.}},

Title = {{Towards an Integrated Methodology for Model and Variable Selection Using
   Count Data: An Application to Micro-Retail Distribution in Urban Studies}},
Journal = {{URBAN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Over the last two decades, a growing number of works in urban studies
   have revealed how micro-retail distribution is significantly related to
   specific properties of the urban built environment. While a wide variety
   of urban form measures have been investigated using sophisticated
   analytical approaches, the same attention has not equally been found in
   statistical procedures. Several essential features of micro-retail
   statistical distribution and modelling assumptions are frequently
   overlooked, compromising the statistical robustness of outcomes. In this
   work we focus on four main aspects: (i) the discrete, non-negative and
   highly skewed nature of store distribution; (ii) its zero-inflation;
   (iii) assessment of the contextual effect; and (iv) the
   multicollinearity generated by the inclusion of highly related urban
   descriptors. To overcome these limitations, we propose an integrated
   methodological framework for both modelling and variable selection
   assessment based on generalized linear models (GLMs) and elastic-net
   (Enet) penalized regression (PR), respectively. The procedure is tested
   via a real case study of the French Riviera, which is described using a
   large dataset of 105 street-based urban form measures. The outcomes of
   this procedure show the superiority of the zero-inflate negative
   binomial count regression approach. A restricted number of urban form
   properties are found to be related to the micro-retail distribution
   depending on the specific scale and morphological context under
   analysis.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of impulse load applied for different duration on the
   distribution of normalised dynamic radial stresses in positive and
   negative Poisson's ratio medium was investigated in this study. For
   solving the non-stationary problem in the case of plane deformation for
   structurally inhomogeneous materials, the model of Cosserat continuum
   was applied. This model enables accounting for the influence of
   shear-rotation deformation of micro-particles of the medium. In the
   framework of Cosserat elasticity, on applying the Fourier transforms for
   time variable and developing the boundary integral equation method,
   solving of the non-stationary problem reduces to the system of singular
   integral equations, where the components that determine the influence of
   shear-rotation deformations are selected. The numerical calculations
   were performed for the foam medium with positive and negative Poisson's
   ratio for different values of time duration of impulse. Developed
   approach can be used to predict the mechanical behaviour of foam auxetic
   materials obtained at different values of a volumetric compression ratio
   under the action of time variable load based on analysis of the
   distribution of radial stresses in foam medium.}},

Abstract = {{In this research contribution, the static behavior and failure
   mechanisms are developed for a three-dimensional (3D) printed dogbone,
   auxetic structure and sandwich composite using acoustic emissions (AEs).
   The skins, core and whole sandwich are manufactured using the same
   bio-based material which is polylactic acid reinforced with micro-flax
   fibers. Tensile tests are conducted on the skins and the core while
   bending tests are conducted on the sandwich composite. Those tests are
   carried out on four different auxetic densities in order to investigate
   their effect on the mechanical and damage properties of the materials.
   To monitor the invisible damage and damage propagation, a highly
   sensitive AE testing method is used. It is found that the sandwich with
   high core density displays advanced mechanical properties in terms of
   bending stiffness, shear stiffness, facing bending stress and core shear
   stress. In addition, the AE data points during testing present an
   amplitude range of 40-85 dB that characterizes visible and invisible

   Glasses}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{In glass materials, Poisson's ratio (nu) has been proposed to be
   correlated with a variety of features, including atomic packing density
   (C-g), liquid fragility (m), and network connectivity. To further
   investigate these correlations in oxide glasses, here, we study cesium
   borate and cesium silicate glasses with varying modifier/former ratio
   given the difference in network former coordination and because cesium
   results in relatively high nu compared to the smaller alkali modifiers.
   Within the binary glass series, we find positive correlations between nu
   on one hand andmandC(g)on the other hand. The network former is found to
   greatly influence the correlation between nu and the number of bridging
   oxygens (n(BO)), with a negative correlation for silicate glasses and
   positive correlation for borate glasses. An analysis based on
   topological constraint theory shows that this difference cannot be
   explained by the effect of superstructural units on the network
   connectivity in lithium borate glasses. Considering a wider range of
   oxide glasses from the literature, we find that nu generally decreases
   with increasing network connectivity, but with notable exceptions for
   heavy alkali borate glasses and calcium alumino tectosilicate glasses.}},

   method}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS TODAY COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{23}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{According to the anisotropy and non-homogeneity of composite sandwich
   panels with negative Poisson's ratio (NPR), the variational asymptotic
   method combined with multiscale technology (VAMM) is used to analyze its
   effective properties. Firstly, in the microscale, the effective
   properties of the unidirectional fiber reinforced composite (UDFRC)
   forming the facesheets are obtained by means of asymptotic
   homogenization analysis, which can be used as lamina properties. Then,
   in the mesoscale, an asymptotic analysis of the typical unit cell is
   carried out to deduce the effective plate properties (A, B, and D
   matrices) of composite sandwich panels with NPR according to the
   heterogeneity of the structure. Finally, the influence of the layup
   configurations and fiber volume fractions of UDFRC on the equivalent
   plate properties of composite sandwich panels with NPR is analyzed.
   Numerical results show that the 3D responses of composite sandwich
   panels with NPR using VAMM are in agreement with those of 3D FEM model,
   while in a much more efficient manner. The layup configurations of
   facesheets have great influence on the equivalent plate properties of
   the structure. Furthermore, the degree of anisotropy and negative
   Poisson's ratio of the whole structure decrease with increasing fiber
   volume fraction of UDFRC.}},

Abstract = {{Recent advances in lithography technology and the spread of 3D printers
   allow us a facile fabrication of special materials with complicated
   microstructures. The materials are called ``designed materials{''} or
   ``architectured materials{''} and provide new opportunities for material
   development. These materials, which owing to their rationally designed
   architectures exhibit unusual properties at the micro- and nano-scales,
   are being widely exploited in the development of modern materials with
   customized and improved performance. Meta-materials are found to possess
   superior and unusual properties as regards static modulus (axial stress
   divided by axial strain), density, energy absorption, smart
   functionality, and negative Poisson's ratio (NPR). However, in spite of
   recent developments, it has only been feasible to fabricate a few such
   meta-materials and to implement them in practical applications. Against
   such a backdrop, a broad review of the wide range of cellular auxetic
   structures for mechanical metamaterials available at our disposal and
   their potential application areas is important. Classified according to
   their geometrical configuration, this paper provides a review of
   cellular auxetic structures. The structures are presented with a view to
   tap into their potential abilities and leverage multidimensional
   fabrication advances to facilitate their application in industry. In
   this review, there is a special emphasis on state-of-the-art
   applications of these structures in important domains such as sensors
   and actuators, the medical industry, and defense while touching upon
   ways to accelerate the material development process.}},

Abstract = {{Polyurethane foams are one of the most common auxetic structures
   regarding energy absorption enhancement. This present study evaluates
   the result reliability of two different numerical approaches, the
   H-method and the P-method, to obtain the best convergence solution. A
   polymeric re-entrant cell is created with a beam element and the results
   of the two different methods are compared. Additionally, the numerical
   results compare well with the analytical solution. The results show that
   there is a good agreement between converged FE models and the analytical
   solution. Regarding the computational cost, the P-method is more
   efficient for simulating the re-entrant structure subjected to axial
   loading. During the second part of this study, the re-entrant cell is
   used for generating a polymeric auxetic cellular tube. The mesh
   convergence study is performed on the cellular structures using the H-
   and P- methods. The cellular tube is subjected to tensional and
   compressive loading, the module of elasticity and Poisson's ration to
   calculate different aspect ratios. A nonlinear analysis is performed to
   compare the dynamic response of a cellular tube versus a solid tube. The
   crashworthiness indicators are addressed and the results are compared
   with equivalent solid tubes. The results show that the auxetic cellular
   tubes have better responses against compressive loading. The primary
   outcome of this research is to assess a reliable FE approach for
   re-entrant structures under axial loading.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Social media monitoring during TV broadcasts dedicated to
   vaccines can provide information on vaccine confidence. We analyzed the
   sentiment of tweets published in reaction to two TV broadcasts in Italy
   dedicated to vaccines, one based on scientific evidence {[}Presadiretta
   (PD)] and one including anti-vaccine personalities {[}Virus (VS)].
   Methods: Tweets about vaccines published in an 8-day period centred on
   each of the two TV broadcasts were classified by sentiment. Differences
   in tweets' and users' characteristics between the two broadcasts were
   tested through Poisson, quasi-Poisson or logistic univariate regression.
   We investigated the association between users' characteristics and
   sentiment through univariate quasi-binomial logistic regression.
   Results: We downloaded 12 180 tweets pertinent to vaccines, published by
   5447 users; 276 users tweeted during both broadcasts. Sentiment was
   positive in 50.4\% of tweets, negative in 37.7\% and neutral in 10.1\%
   (remaining tweets were unclear or questions). The positive/negative
   ratio was higher for VS compared to PD (6.96 vs. 4.24, P<0.001).
   Positive sentiment was associated to the user's number of followers (OR
   1.68, P<0.001), friends (OR 1.83, P<0.001) and published tweets (OR
   1.46, P<0.001) and to being a recurrent user (OR 3.26, P<0.001).
   Conclusions: Twitter users were highly reactive to TV broadcasts
   dedicated to vaccines. Sentiment was mainly positive, especially among
   very active users. Displaying anti-vaccine positions on TV elicited a
   positive sentiment on Twitter. Listening to social media during TV shows
   dedicated to vaccines can provide a diverse set of data that can be
   exploited by public health institutions to inform tailored vaccine
   communication initiatives.}},

Abstract = {{This study intended for the assessment of the stiffness, tensile and
   bursting properties of 3D printed auxetic sinusoidal patterns of
   different density and thickness deposited on the nylon fabric by means
   of fused deposition modeling (FDM) with the use of thermoplastic
   polyurethane (TPU) filament. Morphology, weight variation, flex
   stiffness, tensile property, Poisson's ratio and bursting strength were
   analyzed for the characteristic evaluation of produced composite. The
   prototypes of two auxetic pattern repeat of 47 mmx43 mm and 20 mmx20 mm
   were developed named as low density (LD) and high density (HD)
   respectively. Both patterns were repeatedly combined to produce bigger
   size patterns and 3D printed with various thicknesses. Weight variation
   is found proportional to the density and thickness of 3D printed auxetic
   sinusoidal. Maximum up to 552 \% weight increase was recorded for LD
   pattern and for HD 857 \%. Flex stiffness increased with the rise of
   density and thickness of 3d printed auxetic sinusoidal pattern. Maximum
   flex stiffness for HD was 7.21 cm-g and for LD 4.73 cm-g. Warp direction
   is stiffest comparing with diagonal and weft in all cases. In case of
   tensile strength, a great extent of elongation was noticed due to the
   presence of auxetic sinusoidal 3D pattern and TPU filament. Maximum,
   more than 500 \% elongation was showed by HD diagonal direction. HD
   patters exhibited more strength and toughness than LD patterns. In
   addition, warp direction is strongest and diagonal direction is weakest
   whereas the weft stays in between. Both LD-1.0 and HD-1.0 3D printed
   pattern showed negative Poisson's ratio and the value was between -1.0
   to 0. The enhanced bursting strength is found in HD patterns up to 1514
   kPa comparing up to 1449 for LD. Thus, this study confirmed the
   excellent stiffness, tensile and bursting properties of HD 3D printed
   auxetic sinusoidal pattern/nylon composite over LD.}},

Abstract = {{Mechanical metamaterials are usually designed to exhibit novel
   properties and functionalities that are rare or even unprecedented. What
   is common among most previous designs is the quasi-static nature of
   their mechanical behavior. Here, we introduce a previously unidentified
   class of strain rate-dependent mechanical metamaterials. The principal
   idea is to laterally attach two beams with very different levels of
   strain rate-dependencies to make them act as a single bi-beam. We use an
   analytical model and multiple computational models to explore the
   instability modes of such a bi-beam construct, demonstrating how
   different combinations of hyperelastic and viscoelastic properties of
   both beams, as well as purposefully introduced geometric imperfections,
   could be used to create robust and highly predictable strain
   rate-dependent behaviors of bi-beams. We then use the bi-beams to design
   and experimentally realize lattice structures with unique strain
   rate-dependent properties including switching between auxetic and
   conventional behaviors and negative viscoelasticity.}},

Journal = {{MATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{A 4D imaging study (3D + time) combining synchrotron tomography with in
   situ tensile testing has been carried out to observe the fibre and
   network level micromechanics of paper made from northern bleached
   softwood kraft (NBSK). Quantitative image analysis and digital volume
   correlation is used to characterize local deformation, the evolution of
   fibre-fibre contacts, and fibre straightening in a ``freeze-dried{''}
   handsheet as well as standard handsheets low consistency refined at
   different refining energies. In the freeze-dried handsheet having low
   fibre conformability, the results show that deformation at the network
   level occurs because of fibre straightening and possible inter-fibre
   bond breakage. Further, significant out-of-plane deformation near the
   failure regions was observed, which led to auxetic behaviour. In the
   refined handsheets, a strong inverse correlation is seen between
   refining energy, thickness expansion, and the number of broken fibres.
   The use of out-of-plane strain norms is proposed as a method to
   determine network efficiency (i.e. the ratio of the network's elastic
   modulus to that of the constituent fibres) as well as the relative
   contribution of fibre pull-out to the overall failure of the handsheet.}},

Abstract = {{College students, as a large part of young adults, are a vulnerable
   group to several risky behaviors including smoking and drug abuse. This
   study aimed to utilize and to compare count regression models to
   identify correlates of cigarette smoking among college students. This
   was a cross-sectional study conducted on students of Hamadan University
   of Medical Sciences. The Poisson, negative binomial, generalized
   Poisson, exponentiated-exponential geometric regression models and their
   zero-inflated counterparts were fitted and compared using the Vuong test
   (alpha = 0.05). A number of 1258 students participated in this study.
   The majority of students were female (60.8\%) and their average age was
   23 years. Most of the students were non-smokers (84.6\%). Negative
   binomial regression was selected as the most appropriate model for
   analyzing the data (comparable fit and simpler interpretation). The
   significant correlates of the number of cigarettes smoked per day
   included gender (male: incident-rate-ratio (IRR = 9.21), birth order
   (Forth: IRR = 1.99), experiencing a break-up (IRR = 2.11), extramarital
   sex (heterosexual (IRR = 2.59), homosexual (IRR = 3.13) vs. none), and
   drug abuse (IRR = 5.99). Our findings revealed that several high-risk
   behaviors were associated with the intensity of smoking, suggesting that
   these behaviors should be considered in smoking cessation intervention
   programs for college students.}},

   load-specific, multiscale inner material architectures}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{175}},
Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{In the current work we investigate the extension of the elastic and
   plastic design space of metamaterials by means of multiscale,
   load-specific inner material architectures. In particular, we analyse
   the use of a second scale of material architecturing at the level of the
   elements of the primal lattice structure. To that scope, we consider a
   wide range of inner element designs, from mere hollow shapes to
   double-curved architectures that allow for reduced relative density
   values. Thereupon, we evaluate both analytically and numerically the
   effective elastic and plastic behaviour of square, two-scale
   metamaterial lattice structures, as a function of their second level of
   inner material architecturing. We observe that hollow inner element
   designs allow for a substantially enhanced shear response performance
   both in the elastic and plastic analysis range, retaining invariant
   their specific axial loading behaviour. The performance improvement
   depends on the inner element design parameters and can be up to eighty
   per cent with respect to the reference, single-scale lattice design
   within the elastic analysis range. Accordingly, the results suggest that
   double-curved inner element architectures allow for a shear response
   improvement that can outperform the one of hollow element designs at the
   cost of a reduced axial loading performance.}},

Title = {{Dynamic crushing responses of bio-inspired re-entrant auxetic honeycombs
   under in-plane impact loading}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS TODAY COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{23}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{In order to improve the impact energy absorption abilities and maintain
   good crushing load uniformity of auxetic honeycombs, a re-entrant
   arc-shaped honeycomb (RAH) model is proposed according to the concept of
   bio-inspired structure design. The in-plane impact resistances and
   absorbed-energy characteristics of bio-inspired auxetic RAHs subjected
   to a constant velocity crushing are numerically studied by using
   ABAQUS/EXPLICIT. It is shown that due to the introduction of re-entrant
   arc-shaped structures, the dynamic response curves of bio-inspired RAHs
   have better crushing load uniformity than conventional re-entrant
   honeycombs. Except for the relative density and impact velocity, the
   dynamic crushing behaviors of bio-inspired RAHs also depend upon the
   cell micro-structure parameters (e.g., the curvature). Based on the
   one-dimensional (1D) shock theory and absorbed-energy efficiency method,
   an empirical equation is deduced to evaluate the dynamic plateau stress
   of bio-inspired RAHs. The finite element (FE) results coincide well with
   those calculated by the empirical formulas. Moreover, the specific
   energy absorption (SEA) and energy dissipation rules of bio-inspired
   RAHs are discussed, which are also dependent on the curvature. These
   researches will provide technical support for the innovative structure
   design and dynamic optimization design of auxetic cellular structures.}},

Title = {{Transactional Sex and Incident Chlamydia and Gonorrhea Among Black Men
   Who Have Sex With Men in Atlanta, Georgia}},
Journal = {{SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{47}},

Abstract = {{Background
   Black men who have sex with men (BMSM) are disproportionately affected
   by sexually transmitted infections (STI), including chlamydia and
   gonorrhea. Transactional sex is an hypothesized risk factor for STI
   acquisition in BMSM. Methods
   We estimated the association of transactional sex with incident
   chlamydia/gonococcal infection among BMSM using longitudinal data from a
   randomized trial in Atlanta (2012-2015). BMSM were eligible for
   inclusion if they tested human immunodeficiency virus
   (HIV)-antibody-negative and reported both >= 2 male sex partners and any
   condomless anal sex in the last year. We defined chlamydia/gonorrhea
   incidence as the first occurrence of either rectal or urogenital
   chlamydia or gonococcal infections after a negative result at
   enrollment. We used Poisson regression to estimate the incidence rate
   (IR) for chlamydia/gonorrhea over 12 months. Incidence rate ratios (IRR)
   compared estimates by reported experience of transactional sex. Subgroup
   analyses assessed potential heterogeneity by age and sexual identity.
   Results
   This analysis included 416 BMSM, of whom 191 (46\%) were gay-identified,
   146 (42\%) reported a history of transactional sex, and 57 (14\%) had
   prevalent chlamydia/gonococcal infection at baseline. Over a median of 1
   year of follow-up, an additional 55 men tested laboratory-positive for
   chlamydia/gonorrhea (IR, 17.3 per 100 person-years). Transactional sex
   was not associated with chlamydia/gonorrhea incidence overall. However,
   among gay-identified BMSM, transactional sex was associated with
   incident chlamydia/gonorrhea (IRR, 2.9; 95\% confidence interval,
   1.2-6.8). Conclusions
   Economic and social vulnerabilities may motivate engagement in high-risk
   sexual behaviors through commodified sex, potentially increasing the
   burden of STIs among BMSM. In this investigation, the relationship
   between transactional sex and chlamydia/gonorrhea was not homogenous
   across BMSM with diverse sexual identities in Atlanta, suggesting that
   within select sexual networks, transactional sex may drive STI risks.
   Delivering accessible and targeted STI screening for marginalized BMSM
   should be prioritized for STI and HIV prevention.}},

Abstract = {{Folds are marvellous features of mountain terrains, but despite
   extensive research, many fundamental problems have still not been
   solved. In terrains of sandstone, fold hinges are rarely straight lines
   but curved, forming a pattern characterized by doubly plunging,
   elliptical dome-and-basin structures. Such structures are an obvious
   manifestation of coeval or successive shortening deformation in two
   orthogonal principal directions in the horizontal plane. Based on an
   anatomic investigation of the fold pattern of sandstone beds at the
   rocky beaches of Saint-Jean-Port-Joli (Quebec, Canada), we propose that
   the doubly plunging folds may result from a transition from a plane
   deformation to a constrictional deformation due to auxetic effects of
   quartz-rich rocks. The sandstone beds possessed potentially such
   negative values of Poisson's ratio that, when placed under compression
   in one direction, they become contracted in the transverse direction,
   producing a series of doubly plunging folds. Further work is needed to
   approve or disapprove the interpretation.}},

Abstract = {{Objective The purpose of this study was to investigate the associations
   between dietary habits, emotional states, and subjective oral symptoms
   in Korean adolescents.
   Methods Data from 62,276 adolescents were derived from the 13th Korean
   Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey, conducting from June 1, 2017 to
   June 30, 2017. Oral symptoms were assessed by asking students whether
   they had experienced any of following symptoms within the last 12
   months: (i) have you had a crack in your teeth or had any broken teeth
   not caused by exercise or other accidents?, (ii) have you experienced
   any toothaches while drinking or eating cold or hot beverages or foods?,
   (iii) have you ever felt throbbing in your teeth?, and (iv) have you
   experienced any gum pain or gum bleeding? A multivariable Poisson
   regression model for prevalence ratio (PR) was conducted.
   Results Of the participants, 53.1\% experienced subjective oral
   symptoms. After adjusting for confounders, participants with consumption
   of sweet drinks more than five times weekly in dietary behaviors (PR:
   1.17 {[}95\% confidence interval (CI); 1.13-1.21]), feeling stress in
   the emotional state (PR: 1.27 {[}95\% CI; 1.24-1.31]), and never
   brushing teeth (PR: 1.22 {[}95\% CI; 1.14-1.30]) in the frequency of
   toothbrushing had higher risks of having oral symptoms compared to the
   reference group.
   Conclusion Many adolescents in Korea experienced oral symptoms. The
   consumption of sweet drinks, infrequent toothbrushing, and a negative
   emotional state adversely affected perceived oral symptoms. Public
   concern about the oral health of adolescents is warranted.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To evaluate healthcare utilization in Medicaid enrolled
   children with neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) in the first 2 years of
   life.
   Study design A retrospective, longitudinal cohort study evaluating
   Medicaid enrolled children born in New York (1999-2011) and Texas
   (1999-2010) was performed. Healthcare utilization, including inpatient
   days, emergency department and outpatient visits, and filled
   prescriptions in children after birth hospitalization was assessed. A
   tapered propensity-matching methodology was used, matching each child
   with NAS with 5 children without NAS, first on demographics, then on
   both demographics and clinical covariates (clinical diagnoses and
   congenital anomalies at birth). Poisson and negative binomial regression
   were used to calculate healthcare utilization ratios (HUR).
   Results In the first 2 years of life, children with NAS (n = 3799) had
   increased healthcare utilization with more inpatient days and emergency
   department visits than demographically similar children without NAS.
   This increased utilization however did not persist after matching on
   clinical covariates and performing multiple comparisons adjustment
   (inpatient days {[}HUR, 1.01; 95\% CI, 0.88-1.16; P = .89], total
   emergency department visits {[}HUR, 1.06; 95\% CI, 1.01-1.11; P = .02]).
   Children with NAS conversely had 9\% fewer outpatient office visits
   (HUR, 0.91; 95\% CI, 0.87-0.95; P < .0001).
   Conclusions A diagnosis of NAS does not appear to be an independent
   predictor of increased healthcare utilization in the first 2 years of
   life. These results differ from some other published studies, but may
   suggest that the increased healthcare utilization observed in children
   with NAS is due to higher incidences of perinatal complications and
   congenital anomalies in children with prenatal drug exposures.}},

Journal = {{COMPOSITES COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{19}},
Pages = {{30-36}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{This paper proposes a metacomposite that shrinks regardless of
   temperature decrease or increase, i.e. it exhibits positive and negative
   thermal expansions with cooling and heating, respectively, which leads
   to auxetic behavior. This metacomposite is constructed from rigid rods
   and bimaterial strips; the ends of the rigid rods are connected in
   series by freely-rotating pin joints while neighboring chains of rigid
   rods are linked by bimaterial strips that are connected to the mid-spans
   of the rigid rods by fixed joints. Thermal deformation results indicate
   that the magnitude of the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of the
   metacomposite parallel to the rigid rod is about 3 times greater than
   that parallel to the bimaterial strips. Upon thermal deformation,
   prescription of stretching parallel to the chains of rigid rods indicate
   a Poisson's ratio that is approximately -1/3. Results also show that the
   effective in-plane CTE and Poisson's ratio are influenced by the CTE
   ratio of the bimaterial phases and aspect ratio of the bimaterial strip.
   The possibility of this auxetic metacomposite to achieve in situ
   signswitching of CTE avails greater design options to the materials
   engineer.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is devoted to the investigation of the effects of the
   realistic tension-compression asymmetry and anisotropy of phase
   transformations of shape memory alloy wires embedded in composite
   sandwich plates with auxetic cores on the resulting nonlinear
   vibrations. A third-order zigzag description of the displacement field
   that takes into account the thickness variations of the flexible core
   and a novel three-dimensional dynamic elasticity stress and displacement
   correction is proposed and employed. The governing equations are
   extracted based on Hamilton's principle and solved using an iterative
   finite element procedure. A comprehensive phase transformation algorithm
   and a constitutive model that are capable of accurately tracking the
   nested hysteresis loops and sub-loops and reverse loading of the shape
   memory alloy are proposed, considering the tension-compression
   anisotropy. Interactions of the core compliance, auxeticity, and
   especially, the transformations anisotropy on the dynamic responses are
   studied numerically and three-dimensional plots are presented for
   distributions of the martensite volume fraction. Results show that the
   realistic tension-compression anisotropy of the shape memory alloy
   material leads to results that are quite different from those based on
   the assumption of the symmetry of the material properties and
   significantly increases the differences between the damping roles of the
   shape memory alloy wires of the upper and lower layers of the sandwich

Abstract = {{In statistics, stochastic orders formalize such a concept that one
   random variable is bigger than another. In this paper, we develop a new
   class of discrete bivariate distributions based on a stochastic order
   defined by the likelihood ratio. We derive general formula for the joint
   distributions belonging to the class. It will be seen that, from the
   proposed class, specific families of distributions can be efficiently
   generated just by specifying the `baseline seed distributions'. An
   important feature of the proposed discrete bivariate model is that,
   unlike other discrete bivariate models already proposed in the
   literature such as the well-known and most popular bivariate Poisson
   distribution by Holgate, it can model both positive and negative
   dependence. A number of new families of discrete bivariate distributions
   are generated from the proposed class. Furthermore, the generated
   bivariate distributions are applied to analyze real data sets and the
   results are compared with those obtained from some conventional models.}},

Journal = {{THIN-WALLED STRUCTURES}},

Abstract = {{Honeycomb structure, which presents potential ability in energy
   absorption and impact resistance, has advantages of simplicity,
   lightweight, easy manufacturing and designability. In this study,
   honeycomb structure panel is expanded to cylindrical shell by adopting
   the rolled-up algorithm and the crushing behaviors of the randomly
   honeycomb cylindrical shell (RHCS) structures are investigated under
   axial loading. The influence of geometrical and topological parameters,
   i.e. the thickness-to-diameter ratio, cell irregularity, relative
   density on the deformation evolution and energy absorption performance
   is systematically performed. It is found that the deformation modes of
   RHCS structures are significantly affected by thickness-to-diameter
   ratio and cell irregularity. Moreover, the rate-independent,
   rigid-plastic hardening (R-PH) idealisation with two parameters is
   adopted to characterize the crushing responses of RHCS structures and
   the parameters are quantified as power-law relations with respect to
   relative density. Further, the crushing behaviors of density-graded RHCS
   structures with continuously varying in density are carried out under
   different impact velocities. Results indicated that the introduction of
   density gradients can strongly affect the deformation mode, crushing
   force and energy absorption performance of density-graded RHCS
   structures. Combining with analysis of crushing front propagation, the
   theoretical determination of crushing responses of the density-graded
   RHCS under different loading rates is presented based on R-PH model. The
   results of predicted crushing force-time histories of density-graded
   RHCS structures show versatile agreement with that of finite element
   values at both impact and support ends. Additionally, the energy
   absorption capacity that is related to deformation mechanisms of
   density-graded RHCS structures is investigated.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the thermal shock resistance of an auxetic ceramic
   honeycomb plate is studied based on the fracture mechanics concept for
   the cases of a central crack or an edge crack. The transient temperature
   field and transient thermal stress field are obtained for both auxetic
   and non-auxetic structures. The relationship between the thermal stress
   intensity factor (TSIF) and the internal cell angle, crack length and
   time is determined and the critical temperature for the initiation of
   crack propagation is predicted. Results show that compared with the
   non-auxetic ceramic honeycombs which are at an internal cell angle of 30
   degrees, the critical temperature of the auxetic ceramic honeycombs
   whose cell are orientated at an angle of - 30 degrees increases by
   78.5\% and the TSIF at the crack tip decreases by 40\%, respectively.
   Hence, the auxetic structures have better thermal shock resistance. This
   study indicates that auxetic ceramic honeycombs have significant
   potential applications in harsh temperature environments.}},

Abstract = {{A 3D numerical simulation of the mechanical behaviour of a chiral
   auxetic cellular structure subjected to multiaxial loading conditions is
   presented in this paper. The proposed computational models are used to
   study the geometry effect of the unit cell on the Poisson's ratio and
   deformation behaviour of the analysed chiral auxetic structure. A 3D
   computational model of a chiral auxetic structure is built using beam
   finite elements in the framework of LS DYNA software. Here, the lattice
   model is positioned between rigid plates and assembled in a way to
   simulate hydro-compression loading conditions. Between the contacting
   surfaces, interactions in normal (contact) and tangential (friction)
   directions are prescribed, with the node-to-surface approach. The
   developed computational model offers insight into the deformation
   (damage) behaviour of the analysed chiral auxetic cellular structure,
   and enables better understanding of its crushing behaviour under
   multiaxial loading.}},

Abstract = {{A detailed structural, spectroscopic, mechanical and thermodynamic
   characterization of the bismuth uranyloxide hydroxy-hydrate mineral
   uranosphaerite, Bi(UO2)O2OH, is obtained using the X-ray diffraction and
   infrared and Raman spectroscopic techniques and first principles
   solid-state methods based on density functional theory employing plane
   wave basis sets and pseudopotentials. The full crystal structure of
   uranosphaerite, including the positions of the hydrogen atoms within the
   corresponding unit cell, is determined by the first time from X-ray
   diffraction data taken from a natural crystal sample from Menzenschwand
   uranium deposit (Germany). The crystal structure obtained from X-ray
   diffraction is confirmed by using the first principles methodology. The
   computed structural parameters and X-ray diffraction pattern are in
   excellent agreement with their experimental counterparts. From the
   energy-optimized crystal structure, the mechanical and dynamical
   stability of uranosphaerite is studied and a rich set of mechanical
   properties are determined. Uranosphaerite is shown to display the
   negative Poisson's ratio phenomenon. The experimental infrared spectrum
   is recorded from a natural sample from Schneeberg (Germany) and the
   Raman spectrum is collected from two crystal samples from Hagendorf and
   Schneeberg localities (Germany). Both spectra are also determined using
   density functional perturbation theory and compared with the observed
   spectra. Since the computed and experimental spectra have a very high
   degree of consistence, the infrared and Raman bands are completely
   assigned using a normal coordinate analysis of the theoretical
   vibrational results. The spectral zone from 1000 to 3000 cm(-1) in the
   infrared and Raman spectra is shown to be plagued of low intensity
   combination bands. Eleven and eight combination bands are identified in
   the infrared and Raman spectra, respectively. The fundamental
   thermodynamic functions of uranosphaerite are computed as a function of
   temperature using phonon calculations. The computed specific heat and
   entropy at 298.15 K are 147.7 and 180.4 J.K-1.mol(-1), respectively. The
   computed thermodynamic parameters are used to determine the
   corresponding thermodynamic properties of formation in terms of the
   elements as a function of temperature and the Gibbs free energies of
   reaction of a series of reactions involving uranosphaerite and a
   representative subset of the most important secondary phases of spent
   nuclear fuel. The relative stability of uranosphaerite with respect to
   these phases as a function of temperature and under different
   concentrations of hydrogen peroxide is reported.}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Non-linear homogenization of hyperelastic materials is reviewed and
   adapted to topology optimization. The homogenization is based on the
   method of multiscale virtual power in which the unit cell is subjected
   to either macroscopic deformation gradients or equivalently to Bloch
   type displacement boundary conditions. A detailed discussion regarding
   domain symmetry of the unit cell and its effect on uniaxial loading
   conditions is provided. The density approach is used to formulate the
   topology optimization problem which is solved via the method of moving
   asymptotes. The adjoint sensitivity analysis considers response
   functions that quantify both the displacement and incremental
   displacement. Notably, the transfer of the sensitivities from the
   microscale to the macroscale is presented in detail. A periodic filter
   and thresholding are used to regularize the topology optimization
   problem and to generate crisp boundaries. The proposed methodology is
   used to design hyperelastic microstructures comprised of Neo-Hookean
   constituents for maximum load carrying capacity subject to negative

Title = {{Customizable fabrication for auxetic graphene assembled macrofilms with
   high conductivity and flexibility}},
Journal = {{CARBON}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{162}},
Pages = {{545-551}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic materials with negative Poisson's ratios unusually exhibit
   intuitive mechanical behaviors, such as cross-section expansion instead
   of contraction during tension. Such behaviors are interesting because
   they may enhance unusual mechanical properties. However, controllable
   preparation of materials with negative Poisson's ratio is still a major
   challenge. In this study, we report the synthesis of a flexible auxetic
   graphene assembled macrofilm (GAMF) from graphene oxide nanosheets by a
   thermal annealing and press assistant method. The obtained materials
   exhibit good flexibility and significantly wide tunable negative
   Poisson's ratios ranging from -0.11 to -0.53. We also develop a
   reconstruction model for characterization the uniaxial tension of GAMF
   based on X-ray tomographic images. The tensile simulation result
   predicts the function relationship between Poisson's ratio and critical
   thickness of pore channels, which is in good agreement with the
   experimental data. As a result, an effective tunable way is proposed for
   customizable fabrication of GAMF with tunable negative Poisson's ratios,
   and the GAMF materials with good flexibility, high electrical
   conductivity and superior auxetic behavior looks promising for future
   development of wearable electronics. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Chiral honeycombs of different types have been found to display auxetic
   behavior (a negative Poisson's ratio). This paper investigates the
   constitutive relations and the auxetic properties of tetrachiral
   honeycombs. It is found that coupling between shearing and stretching
   exists in tetrachiral honeycombs and this causes some ambiguity when
   calculating the Poisson's ratio. An ``effective Poisson's ratio{''} is
   proposed, as opposed to the traditional definition of Poisson's ratio.
   This proposed parameter correctly describes the auxeticity of
   tetrachiral and other honeycombs. An analytical expression for this
   ``effective Poisson's ratio{''} is derived, which describes the
   relationship between the geometric dimensions and auxeticity of the

Abstract = {{In order to study the deformation behavior of double arrowhead (DAH)

   the industrial design of SolidWorks software, the finite element
   analysis of Abaqus software and three-dimensional printed technology.
   Results show that the DAH structure expanded in the direction
   perpendicular to the force first and contracted with the strain
   increasing when it was pulled by the uniaxial force, no matter which
   direction the force is applied. Besides, the auxetic effect of the DAH
   structure under the tensile force in the X direction is longer than that
   under the tensile force in the Y direction. It is more resistant to
   compression when the DAH structure is subjected to transverse tensile
   forces than when it is subjected to longitudinal tensile forces. The
   angle of the V-shaped short truss has a significant impact on the
   negative Poisson's ratio of the DAH structure, while the angle of the
   V-shaped long truss angle has little influence on its auxetic
   performance. Specifically, the smaller the angles, the better the
   auxetic effect.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, a novel layered carbon-based material, i.e. the hydrogen
   substituted graphdiyne (HsGDY), has been synthesized through an in situ
   cross-coupling reaction of triethynylbenzene (Nat. Commun., 2017, 8,
   1172). Herein, the most favorable stacking order for bulk layered HsGDY
   (b-HsGDY) was determined based on firstprinciples calculations, and then
   its mechanical and electronic properties under biaxial strain were
   systematically studied. The results show that the ABC-stacking structure
   is the most favorable configuration for b-HsGDY. Interestingly, this
   material exhibits a behavior similar to an auxetic material under
   biaxial tensile strain and its band gap increases with the increase of
   either the tensile strain or the compression strain within the strain
   range of - 0.03 <= epsilon <= 0.05. These extraordinary properties endow
   the b-HsGDY with great potential in designing electromechanical devices.}},

Abstract = {{Background This study investigates whether alcohol use predicts the
   periodontal pocket development over an 11-year follow-up period.
   Methods The study participants' periodontal condition was examined both
   in the Health 2000 and 2011 Surveys (BRIF8901). Participants were aged
   30 to 65 years, dentate, periodontally healthy, and did not have
   diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis in 2000. Periodontal outcome measures
   in 2011 were the number of teeth with deepened (>= 4 mm) periodontal
   pockets and the presence of deepened periodontal pockets. The exposure
   in 2000 was alcohol use (amount {[}g/week], frequency {[}any alcohol or
   different beverages]). Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) with 95\% confidence
   intervals (CI) were estimated using negative binomial regression model
   and Poisson regression model with a robust variance estimator.
   Results Overall, the amount of alcohol use or use over the risk limit in
   2000 was inconsistently associated with the development of periodontal
   pockets (IRRs varied from 0.6 to 1.0). The frequency of alcohol use (any
   alcohol or different beverages) had an inconsistent association with the
   presence of periodontal pockets (IRRs varied from 0.5 to 1.2) while
   there was an inverse association with the number of teeth with
   periodontal pockets. Among smokers, there were no clear associations
   between any of the exposures and either of the outcomes. The same was
   found among non-smokers except an inverse association was found between
   frequency of alcohol use and the number of teeth with periodontal
   pockets.
   Conclusion Alcohol use was not consistently associated with the
   periodontal pocket development over a period of 11 years.}},

Abstract = {{People engaged in informal employment are not insured by any labour or
   social protection. Welfare state regimes could affect the relationship
   between informal employment and health. This study aimed to assess the
   relationship between informal employment and health status in the
   non-agricultural working population in Central America, by welfare state
   regime and gender. Based on a sample of 8680 non-agricultural workers
   (First Central American Survey of Working Conditions and Health), we
   conducted Poisson regression models with robust variance to obtain
   prevalence ratios (PR) and their confidence intervals (95\% CI) of poor
   health status (self-perceived and mental health) of workers with
   informal employment versus those with formal employment. Models were
   adjusted by age and occupation and stratified by welfare state regime
   and gender. We found that prevalence of poor health status was highest
   among women and workers in informal employment. Positive associations
   between informal employment and poor self-perceived health were found in
   familialist and highly familialist countries for both genders, being
   highest in women in familialist countries (PR: 1.39, 95\% CI:
   1.08-1.80). Significant associations were only found for poor mental
   health among women in familialist countries (PR: 1.24, 95\% CI:
   1.01-1.53) and men in highly familialist countries (PR: 1.34, 95\% CI:
   1.00-1.79). Our results suggest that universal social protection
   policies could reduce the negative effects of informal employment on
   health status for both women and men. Future development of labour and
   social policies integrating a gender perspective might be crucial to
   address health inequalities related to informal employment in Latin
   American countries.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents full-scale modeling and nonlinear dynamic analysis
   of sandwich plates with auxetic 3D lattice core, which is further
   designed to possess three functionally graded (FG) configurations
   through the plate thickness direction for the first time. The effective
   Poisson's ratio (EPR) and fundamental frequencies of auxetic 3D lattice
   metamaterials are analyzed and verified by static and vibration tests
   using specimens fabricated by 3D printing. Considering the large
   deflection nonlinearity of sandwich plates and the accompanying changes
   in effective properties of lattice microstructures, full-scale FE
   modeling and nonlinear dynamic thermal-mechanical analysis are
   performed, with material properties assumed to be temperature dependent.
   Numerical results revealed that the auxetic core can significantly
   reduce the dynamic deflections, in comparison with its counterpart with
   positive EPR. Furthermore, FG configurations have distinct effects on
   the natural frequencies and dynamic deflection-time curves of sandwich
   plates, along with EPR-deflection curves in the large deflection region.}},

Title = {{Preparation of auxetic warp-knitted spacer fabric impregnated with shear
   thickening fluid for low-velocity impact resistance}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL TEXTILES}},
Abstract = {{This paper reports the preparation of auxetic warp-knitted spacer fabric
   impregnated with shear thickening fluid and studied its impact behavior
   under low-velocity impact loading. The shear thickening fluids have been
   prepared by mechanically dispersing 12 nm silica particles with weight
   fraction of 10, 15, 20, and 25\% in various carriers (PEG200, PEG400,
   and PEG600). Rheological results indicate that shear thickening fluid
   experiences shear thickening transition at a specific shear rate. The
   critical shear rate reduces, and initial viscosity and maximum viscosity
   increase with the increase of silica weight fraction. The higher
   molecular weight of polyethylene glycols can lead to lower critical
   shear rate. The impact process of composite under impact loading can be
   divided into three stages. The warp-knitted spacer fabric with different
   negative Poisson's ratio has a significant effect on the impact
   behavior. The warp-knitted spacer fabric with better auxetic performance
   endows composite better impact resistance, the specific performance is
   the deformation depth, and energy absorption and peak load increase with
   the increase of auxetic effect of fabric. The silica weight fraction of
   shear thickening fluid can increase the energy absorption of composite
   due to the shear thickening transition of shear thickening fluid. Shear
   thickening fluid has a synergistic effect with the auxetic warp-knitted
   spacer fabric on impact resistance of composite. The various carriers
   have no obvious influence on the overall energy absorption and impact
   load of composites.}},

Abstract = {{This present research numerically investigates the energy absorption
   capability of auxetic foam-filled tubes when loaded statically.
   Accordingly, numerical simulations were performed to quantify the
   influence of tubes' parameters such as wall thickness, diameter and
   width on the energy absorption responses and deformation modes of
   auxetic foam-filled circular and square tubes using validated FE models.
   The results reveal that the progressive collapse and deformation mode of
   auxetic foam-filled circular tube are pronouncedly affected by varying
   the tube width, so that the number of lobes created decreases as the
   tube width increases. Moreover, it was found that the absorbed energy by
   auxetic foam-filled square tube shows more dependence on the tube wall
   thickness variations than on the tube width. Nonetheless, increasing the
   width of filled tube makes the structure heavier without considerably
   affecting the absorbed energy, which is undesirable in design of energy
   absorbing structures. The primary outcome of this research is a design
   guideline for the use of auxetic foam as a core for an energy absorber
   device where impact loading is expected.}},

Abstract = {{Negative hypergeometric distribution arises as a waiting time
   distribution when we sample without replacement from a finite
   population. It has applications in many areas such as inspection
   sampling and estimation of wildlife populations. However, as is well
   known, the negative hypergeometric distribution is over-dispersed in the
   sense that its variance is greater than the mean. To make it more
   flexible and versatile, we propose a modified version of negative
   hypergeometric distribution called COM-Negative Hypergeometric
   distribution (COM-NH) by introducing a shape parameter as in the
   COM-Poisson and COMP-Binomial distributions. It is shown that under some
   limiting conditions, COM-NH approaches to a distribution that we call
   the COM-Negative binomial (COMP-NB), which in turn, approaches to the
   COM Poisson distribution. For the proposed model, we investigate the
   dispersion characteristics and shape of the probability mass function
   for different combinations of parameters. We also develop statistical
   inference for this model including parameter estimation and hypothesis
   tests. In particular, we investigate some properties such as bias, MSE,
   and coverage probabilities of the maximum likelihood estimators for its
   parameters by Monte Carlo simulation and likelihood ratio test to assess
   shape parameter of the underlying model. We present illustrative data to
   provide discussion.}},

Abstract = {{Poisson's ratios of 2D crystals of hard, cyclic tetramers, further
   referred to as tetramers, are investigated by Monte Carlo (MC)
   simulations. The tetramers, very simple model molecules, which are
   composed of four identical hard disks of diameter sigma with centers
   forming a square of side d, are studied in the isobaric-isothermal
   ensemble. It is found that, at the same thermodynamical parameters, but
   depending on the anisotropy parameter alpha=d/sigma, the tetramers
   spontaneously form crystalline phases, representing each of the five
   Bravais lattices (BLs) which are possible in the 2D space. The following
   BLs are observed: 1) the oblique (monoclinic) one, 2) the rectangular
   (orthorhombic) one, 3) the centered rectangular (orthorhombic) one, 4)
   the hexagonal one, and 5) the square (tetragonal) one. Among them,
   structures showing auxetic, partially auxetic, and nonauxetic behaviour
   are found. This fact makes the tetramer an interesting example of a
   prototype ``molecule,{''} which, depending on its shape, assembles
   materials of all possible behaviors regarding Poisson's ratio. It is
   worth noting that tetramers with alpha=1.7 form a strongly auxetic phase
   that, at the considered thermodynamic conditions, reaches Poisson's
   ratios varying in the range between -0.589(3) and -0.162(4).}},

Abstract = {{Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) with oral anticoagulants may lead to
   under-anticoagulation and increased risk of thromboembolism. Although
   warfarin is susceptible to numerous DDIs, few studies have examined DDIs
   resulting in thromboembolism or those involving direct-acting oral
   anticoagulants (DOACs). We aimed to identify medications that increase
   the rate of hospitalization for thromboembolic events when taken
   concomitantly with oral anticoagulants. We conducted a high-throughput
   pharmacoepidemiologic screening study using Optum Clinformatics Data
   Mart, 2000-2016. We performed self-controlled case series studies among
   adult users of oral anticoagulants (warfarin, dabigatran, rivaroxaban,
   apixaban, and edoxaban) with at least one hospitalization for a
   thromboembolic event. Among eligible patients, we identified all oral
   medications frequently co-prescribed with oral anticoagulants as
   potential interacting precipitants. Conditional Poisson regression was
   used to estimate rate ratios comparing precipitant exposed vs. unexposed
   time for each anticoagulant-precipitant pair. To minimize within-person
   confounding by indication for the precipitant, we used pravastatin as a
   negative control object drug. Multiple estimation was adjusted using
   semi-Bayes shrinkage. We screened 1,622 oral anticoagulant-precipitant
   drug pairs and identified 226 (14\%) drug pairs associated with
   statistically significantly elevated risk of thromboembolism. Using
   pravastatin as the negative control object drug, this list was reduced
   to 69 potential DDI signals for thromboembolism, 33 (48\%) of which were
   not documented in the DDI knowledge databases Lexicomp and/or
   Micromedex. There were more DDI signals associated with warfarin than
   DOACs. This study reproduced several previously documented oral
   anticoagulant DDIs and identified potential DDI signals that deserve to
   be examined in future etiologic studies.}},

Title = {{Auxetic behavior of Beishan granite after thermal treatment: A
   microcracking perspective}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING FRACTURE MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{231}},
Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{Majority of minerals or rocks commonly display a positive Poisson's
   ratio between 0.05 and 0.45. However, granites that experience high
   temperature treatment can exhibit negative Poisson's ratio under low
   compressive stresses. The underlying mechanism responsible for the
   auxetic behavior of thermally-treated granites is poorly understood.
   Here we present experimental results of uniaxial compression tests on
   thermally-treated Beishan granite, which show auxetic behavior with
   increasing thermal treatment temperature and the Poisson's ratio is as
   low as -0.18 for a maximum thermal treatment temperature of 650 degrees
   C. To reveal the thermally-induced change in the microstructures of
   Beishan granite, particle discrete element models are built and
   calibrated using the experimental data. The numerical results show that
   intensively distributed microcracks appear in the Beishan granite
   specimens after high temperature treatments. The number and the widths
   of microcracks increase with increasing thermal treatment temperature. A
   number of isolated block clusters consisting of mineral grains form due
   to the connection of thermally-induced microcracks under high
   temperature thermal treatment. The deformation behavior of these block
   clusters is primarily responsible for the observed negative Poisson's
   ratio of the thermally-treated Beishan granite during compression.}},

   Energy Absorbency and Structural Isolation Performance}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{The energy absorption and structural isolation performance of
   axially-compressed sandwich structures constructed with stiff face
   plates separated with an auxetic lattice core metamaterial is studied.
   Advances in additive manufacturing increasingly allow bespoke, carefully
   designed, structures to be included within the core lattice to enhance
   mechanical performance. Currently, the internal structure of the lattice
   core is deliberately disrupted geometrically to engineer suitable
   post-buckling behavior under quasi-static loading. The desirable
   properties of a high fundamental stiffness and a practically zero
   underlying stiffness in the post-buckling range ensure that energy may
   be absorbed within a limited displacement and that any transfer of
   strain to an attached structure is minimized as far as is feasible. It
   is demonstrated that such disruptions can be arranged to enhance the
   panel performance. The concept may be extended to promote cellular
   buckling where the internal lattice buckles with densification occurring
   at defined locations and in sequence to absorb energy while maintaining
   a low underlying mechanical stiffness.}},

Abstract = {{Background. A hepatitis C (HCV) cure is associated with changes in
   lipids and inflammatory biomarkers, but its impact on clinical endpoints
   among treated human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/HCV coinfected persons
   is unclear.
   Methods. People living with HIV from EuroSIDA with a known HCV status
   after January 2001 were classified into strata based on time-updated HCV
   RNA measurements and HCV treatment, as either HCV antibody-negative;
   spontaneously resolved HCV; chronic, untreated HCV; cured HCV (HCV
   RNA-negative); or HCV treatment failures (HCV RNA-positive). Poisson
   regression was used to compare incidence rates between HCV groups for
   end-stage liver disease (ESLD; including hepatocellular carcinoma
   {[}HCC]), non-acquired immunodeficiency virus defining malignancy (NADM;
   excluding HCC), and cardiovascular disease (CVD).
   Results. There were 16 618 persons included (median follow-up 8.3 years,
   interquartile range 3.1-13.7). There were 887 CVD, 902 NADM, and 436
   ESLD events; crude incidence rates/1000 person-years follow-up were 6.4
   (95\% confidence interval {[}CI] 6.06.9) for CVD, 6.5 (95\% CI 6.1-6.9)
   for NADM, and 3.1 (95\% CI 2.8-3.4) for ESLD. After adjustment, there
   were no differences in incidence rates of NADM or CVD across the 5
   groups. HCV-negative individuals (adjusted incidence rate ratio {[}aIRR]
   0.22, 95\% CI 0.14-0.34) and those with spontaneous clearance (aIRR
   0.61, 95\% CI 0.36-1.02) had reduced rates of ESLD compared to cured
   individuals. Persons with chronic, untreated HCV infections (aIRR 1.47,
   95\% CI 1.02-2.13) or treatment failure (aIRR 1.80, 95\% CI 1.22-2.66)
   had significantly raised rates of ESLD, compared to those who were
   cured.
   Conclusions. Incidences of NADM or CVD were independent of HCV group,
   whereas those cured had substantially lower incidences of ESLD,
   underlining the importance of successful HCV treatment for reducing
   ESLD.}},

   are close to those obtained for the system with pure Yukawa

Abstract = {{Full-scale modeling and nonlinear FEA are presented for large amplitude
   vibration of sandwich plates with functionally graded (FG) auxetic 3D
   lattice core. For the first time, auxetic 3D lattice metamaterials with
   FG configurations along the out-of-plane direction are designed, of
   which the fundamental vibration frequencies are analyzed and verified by
   experiments using 3D printed specimens. Both results suggested that the
   effects of FG configurations and strut incline angles are significant,
   and the FG-X specimen possesses the highest fundamental frequency.
   Subsequently, by means of full-scale nonlinear FE simulations, the large
   amplitude vibration characteristics are investigated for the sandwich
   plates, in which the novel construction of auxetic 3D lattice core with
   three FG configurations along the thickness direction is proposed. And
   the constituent material properties are taken to be
   temperature-dependent. Results revealed that FG configurations have
   distinct effect on the natural frequencies, nonlinear-to-linear
   frequency ratios of sandwich plates, along with EPR-amplitude curves,
   which will become stable when the vibration amplitude is sufficiently
   large.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, through the use of Molecular Dynamics simulations, we show
   the capability of different mechanical metamaterials to induce their own
   global rotational motion as a result of an internal deformation. We also
   show that one of the considered structures, i.e. the hexachiral system,
   may manifest a superior extent of the global rotation in comparison to
   other systems. In addition to that, we discuss that the self-induced
   global rotation can be observed for mechanical metamaterials with a
   discrete mass distribution which allows to prove that this phenomenon is
   not limited to macroscopic systems and applications involving the
   control of the rotational motion of objects such as satellites or wind
   turbines where the continuous mass distribution of structural elements
   is normally required. In fact, this study serves as a blueprint to show
   that a similar effect may also be expected for various systems at very
   different scales. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The origami technique can provide inspiration for fabrication of novel
   three-dimensional (3D) structures with unique material properties from
   two-dimensional sheets. In particular, transformation of graphene sheets
   into complex 3D graphene structures is promising for functional
   nano-devices. However, practical realization of such structures is a
   great challenge. Here, we introduce a self-folding approach inspired by
   the origami technique to form complex 3D structures from graphene sheets
   using surface functionalization. A broad set of examples (Miura-ori,
   water-bomb, helix, flapping bird, dachshund dog, and saddle structure)
   is achieved via molecular dynamics simulations and density functional
   theory calculations. To illustrate the potential of the origami
   approach, we show that the graphene Miura-ori structure combines
   super-compliance, super-flexibility (both in tension and compression),
   and negative Poisson's ratio behavior.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we derive optimal designs for the Rasch Poisson counts

   counts model incorporating several binary predictors for the difficulty

   predictors, locally D-optimal designs are developed. After an
   introduction to the Rasch Poisson counts model and its extension, we
   will specify these models as particular generalized linear models. Based
   on this embedding, optimal designs for both models including several
   binary explanatory variables will be presented. Therefore, we will
   derive conditions on the effect sizes for certain designs to be locally
   D-optimal. Finally, it is pointed out that the results derived for the
   Rasch Poisson models can be applied for more general Poisson regression
   models which should receive more attention in future psychological

Title = {{The Push Drill Mechanism as a Novel Method to Create 3D Mechanical
   Metamaterial Structures}},
Journal = {{PHYSICA STATUS SOLIDI-RAPID RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Two of the most prominent 2D auxetic mechanisms, namely, the rotating
   rigid unit and the chiral systems, work, at least partly, by converting
   linear to rotational motion. This property can be harnessed by
   introducing a system that can convert back the rotational motion to a
   linear displacement so as to induce an expansion or a compression in the
   out-of-plane direction. The push drill mechanism offers an effective way
   of providing this capability. It is, hence, possible to couple 2D
   rotating rigid unit or chiral structures to the push drill mechanism to
   create novel 3D auxetic structures. The resultant Poisson's ratio in the
   out-of-plane direction can be both negative and positive depending on
   the connectivity. Herein, the concept is illustrated with the use of
   rotating squares. An analytical model is derived to determine the
   parameters on which Poisson's ratio and Young's moduli depend.
   Subsequently, the analytical results are compared with those obtained
   from experimental testing of different sample structures with the two
   showing good agreement. Further considerations indicate that it is
   possible to design 2D and 3D auxetic systems with the push drill as the
   only deformation mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{By 3D printing lattice structure with active materials, the structures
   can exhibit shape and functional changes under external stimulus.
   However, the programmable shape changes of the 3D printed lattice
   structures are limited due to the complex geometries, nonlinear
   behaviors of the active materials, and the diverse external stimuli. In
   this work, we propose a design framework combining experiments,
   theoretical modeling, and finite element simulations for the
   controllable shape changes of the 3D printed horseshoe under thermal
   stimulus. The theoretical model is based on a phase evolution model that
   combines the geometrical nonlinearity and the material nonlinearity.
   Results show that the shapes with positive or negative Poisson's ratio
   and bending intermediate shapes can be programmed by tuning the
   geometrical parameters and the temperature distribution. This work
   provides a method to aid the design of 3D printed functional lattice
   structures and have potential applications in soft robotics,
   biomedicine, and energy absorbing fields.}},

Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{MAY 8}},
Abstract = {{Negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) in auxetic materials is of great interest
   due to the typically enhanced mechanical properties, which enables
   plenty of novel applications. In this paper, by employing
   first-principles calculations, we report the emergence of NPR in a class
   of two-dimensional honeycomb structures (graphene, silicene, h-BN,
   h-GaN, h-SiC, and h-BAs), which are distinct from all other known
   auxetic materials. They share the same mechanism for the emerged NPR
   despite the different chemical composition, which lies in the increased
   bond angle (theta). However, the increase of theta is quite intriguing
   and anomalous, which cannot be explained in the traditional point of
   view of the geometry structure and mechanical response, for example, in
   the framework of classical molecular dynamics simulations based on
   empirical potential. We attribute the counterintuitive increase of theta
   and the emerged NPR fundamentally to the strain-modulated electronic
   orbital coupling and hybridization. It is proposed that the NPR
   phenomenon can also emerge in other nanostructures or nanomaterials with
   similar honeycomb structure. The physical origin as revealed in our
   study deepens the understanding on the NPR and would shed light on
   future design of modern nanoscale electromechanical devices with special
   functions based on auxetic nanomaterials and nanostructures.}},

   deformation behaviour and a 3-point bending test for out-of-plane have
   been conducted while maintaining the area fraction for the laser-treated
   area. Close-type laser patterns, e.g., 0 degrees, auxetic, and
   honeycomb, not only induce a substantial increase in strength but also
   enhance bending resistance without sacrificing the springback tendency
   of the initial sheet material.}},

Abstract = {{The porosity dependence of Poisson's ratio of materials with random
   microstructure is investigated via analytical and numerical modeling. It
   is shown that all analytical models predict porosity independence if the
   solid Poisson ratio is 0.2 and for low porosities a converging trend
   toward this value with increasing porosity. From all theory-based
   relations, only power-law and exponential relations allow for auxetic
   behavior. Numerical calculations on computer-generated digital
   microstructures (overlapping and isolated spherical pores, pores between
   overlapping spherical grains, wall-based cellular materials/closed-cell
   foams, and strut-based cellular materials/open-cell foams) confirm the
   general qualitative trends of the analytical models, although a closer
   look reveals significant quantitative differences. Cellular materials
   and foams exhibit similar features as porous materials in general, but
   lack their converging trend toward values around 0.2. Comparison of our
   results with the classical Roberts-Garboczi results shows good
   agreement, with subtle differences due to the different microstructures
   generated.}},

Abstract = {{Bulky sp(2)-carbon Schwarzites with negative Gaussian curvature are
   promising structures for practical applications due to their unique
   properties such as high surface area, large porosity, and stability
   against graphitization. Herein, a comprehensive study on the tension,
   compression and shear mechanical characteristics of seven triply
   periodic carbon Schwarzite foams with distinct topologies is performed
   using reactive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. All carbon
   Schwarzites exhibit unique thermal and mechanical properties that are
   markedly dictated by the topology. One of the structures presents a
   negative thermal expansion coefficient. Under uniaxial tension, the
   temperature is able to play a positive or negative role in the tensile
   stiffness, and there is no apparent positive relationship between
   tensile strength and mass density. Subjected to compression and shear
   loads, carbon Schwarzites can fail due to brittle fracture, and uniform
   and stepwise structural instabilities. Both compression- and
   tension-negative Poisson's ratios are revealed to originate from a
   curvature-flattening deformation mechanism. Analysis of the crush force
   efficiency, the stroke efficiency and the energy-absorption demonstrates
   that carbon Schwarzites are effective energy-absorbers. This study
   provides a fundamental understanding of the relationship between the
   topology and mechanical properties of carbon Schwarzites for designing
   3D graphitic nanostructures with good mechanical performances.}},

   rigidity threshold}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITES SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{191}},
Month = {{MAY 3}},
Abstract = {{The rigidity threshold in a two-phase soft-rigid material is linked to
   the formation of networks of the rigid phase, which supports a
   substantial fraction of overall load. Metal filled particulate polymer
   composites were used to characterize rigidity transition experimentally,
   as metals and polymers have contrasting mechanical properties enabling
   easy detection of the rigidity transition. A detailed analysis of the
   load transferring mechanisms was performed using in-situ synchrotron
   X-ray diffraction to directly verify the compressive loading of the
   rigid metal particles at a microscopic scale. Elastic buckling of the
   force chains was attributed to the non-affine deformation at the
   rigidity threshold at room temperature, using digital image correlation
   (DIC) technique at a mesoscopic length scale. However, beyond the glass
   transition temperature of the polymer, the deformation was homogeneous
   due to the low viscosity and high compressibility of the polymer and the
   absence of buckling of force chains. Macroscopically, an increasing
   Poisson ratio was observed as a function of elastic strains, which is
   quite unique for these composites. The criteria for having increasing
   Poisson ratio is discussed based on elastic buckling of force chains and
   polymer incompressibility, and a link is proposed between deformation at
   microscopic, mesoscopic and macroscopic scale for the composite.}},

   level and material functions are examined. General two-sided bound for
   its range is obtained. It is proved that the Rabotnov relation is able
   to simulate non-monotone behavior and sign changes of lateral strain and

Abstract = {{Purpose: To evaluate the prevalence of signs and symptoms of
   temporomandibular disorders (TMD) in children and the impact on their
   oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL).
   Methods: Data were collected by means of a questionnaire to evaluate the
   presence of TMD symptoms in eight to 10-year-old children. For those who
   answered at least one of the four questions in a positive manner, a
   clinical exam was done to confirm the diagnosis. The Child Perceptions
   Questionnaire (CPQ8-10) was applied to evaluate the OHRQoL. Poisson
   regression was used to associate the total scores and individual domains
   of the CPQ8-10 with sociodemographic factors and clinical conditions.
   Results: A total of 245 children participated in this cross-sectional
   study. One hundred and twenty-one (49.4 percent) were diagnosed with
   TMD; 57.9 percent were females and 42.1 percent were males. Children
   with a diagnosis of disc displacement with reduction had a negative
   impact on the domain of functional limitations (rate ratio=2.61, 95
   percent confidence interval=1.19 to 5.75, P=0.017).
   Conclusion: The prevalence of signs and symptoms of TMD was high in our
   sample, and signs and symptoms of TMD had a negative impact on
   children's OHRQoL in the domain of functional limitations.}},

Abstract = {{A physical model for the footwall slope of Nanfen open-pit mine, China
   was established using a selfdeveloped deep geological engineering
   disaster model test system. A thermosensitive similar material,
   paraffin, was selected to simulate a weak structural plane in the slope
   to reproduce the landslide process. From an experimental perspective,
   the variation trend of shear strength parameters of weak structural
   plane and the mechanical support characteristics of NPR (negative
   Poisson's ratio) anchor cable under the condition of a large landslide
   deformation and failure were examined. The results of this model test
   showed that slope failure has four distinct stages: (1) soil compaction
   stage, (2) crack generation stage, (3) crack propagation stage, and (4)
   sliding plane transfixion stage. According to the test results, the rock
   mechanics parameters of weak surface in the footwall slope of Nanfen
   open-pit mine were calculated. The cohesion is approximately 1.35 x
   10(5) Pa, and the internal friction angle is approximately 6.33 degrees.
   During slope failure, the NPR anchor cable experiences a large
   deformation but no damage occurs, indicating that the NPR anchor cable
   can be continuously monitored and reinforced during the deformation and
   failure of landslide. The stress characteristics of NPR anchor cables
   during the test are consistent with the monitoring results of Newtonian
   force at the landslide site, proving that NPR anchor cables are
   effective and reasonable in landslide monitoring and early warning. (C)

Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of measurements performed on
   alpha-quartz subjected to shear stress in dry conditions, to understand
   the relationship between the shear intensity and the resulting physical
   and chemical effects. If a shear stress of intensity higher than 100 MPa
   is applied continuously to alpha quartz crystals, they will tend to lose
   their crystallinity, progressively reduce their friction coefficient
   (Cof) and change into a low-order material, apparently amorphous under
   X-ray diffraction, but with a structure different from silica glass.
   Raman and Pair Distribution Function analyses suggested a structure like
   cristobalite, a silica polymorph well-known for its auxetic behavior,
   i.e., having a negative Poisson ratio. This elastic parameter
   pre-eminently controls the friction coefficient of the material and, if
   it is negative, the Cof lowering. As a result, the increase in low
   crystallinity cristobalite is sufficientto explain the lowering of the
   quartz friction coefficient up to values able to contribute, in
   principle, to the triggering processes of active faults. This allows
   hypothesizing a slip induction mechanism that does not include the need
   to have the interposition of layers of hydrated silica, as invoked by
   many authors, to justify the low friction coefficients that are achieved
   in shear stress tests on rocks abundant in quartz.}},

Title = {{Additive manufacturing assisted investment casting: A low-cost method to
   fabricate periodic metallic cellular lattices}},
Journal = {{ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{33}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Metallic cellular solids are a class of materials known for their high
   specific mechanical properties, being desirable in applications where a
   combination of high strength or stiffness and low density are important.
   These lightweight materials are often stochastic and manufactured by
   foaming or casting. If regular (periodic) lattice structures are
   desired, they may be manufactured by metallic additive manufacturing
   techniques. However, these have characteristic issues, such as un-melted
   powders, porosity and heterogeneous microstructures. This study reports
   a novel low-cost route for producing regular lattice structures by an
   additive manufacturing assisted investment casting technique. Fused
   filament fabrication is used to produce the lattice structure pattern
   which is infiltrated with plaster. The pattern is then burnt off and the
   aluminum is cast in vacuum. In this way we can manufacture
   non-stochastic metallic lattices having fine struts/ribs (0.6 mm
   cross-section using a 0.4 mm nozzle) and relative densities down to
   0.036. X-ray micro computed tomography (mu CT) showed that as-cast A356
   Aluminium alloy frameworks have high dimensional tolerances and fine
   detail control. Frameworks based on units of six connected struts
   ranging from intruding (auxetic) to protruding (hexagonal) strut angles
   are studied. Vertical struts are finer than expected, reducing their
   moment of area which could impact their compressive strength. This new,
   low cost, route for producing high precision metallic cellular lattices
   offers an attractive alternative to other additive manufacturing
   techniques (e.g. selective laser and electron beam melting).}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{15}},

Abstract = {{Identifying the factors that determine the spatial distribution of
   biodiversity is a major focus of ecological research. These factors vary
   with scale from interspecific interactions to global climatic cycles.
   Wetlands are important biodiversity hotspots and contributors of
   ecosystem services, but the association between proportional wetland
   cover and species richness has shown mixed results. It is not well known
   as to what extent there is a relationship between proportional wetland
   cover and species richness, especially at the sub-continental scale. We
   used the National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) to model wetland cover for
   the conterminous United States and the National Land Cover Database to
   estimate wetland change between 2001 and 2011. We used a Bayesian
   spatial Poisson model to estimate a spatially varying coefficient
   surface describing the effect of proportional wetland cover on the
   distribution of amphibians, birds, mammals, and reptiles and the
   cumulative distribution of terrestrial endemic species. Species richness
   and wetland cover were significantly correlated, and this relationship
   varied both spatially and by taxonomic group. Rather than a
   continental-scale association, however, we found that this relationship
   changed more closely among ecoregions. The species richness of each of
   the five groups was positively associated with wetland cover in some or
   all of the Great Plains; additionally, a positive association was found
   for mammals in the Southeastern Plains and Piedmont of the eastern U.S.
   Model results indicated negative association especially in the Cold
   Deserts and Northern Lakes \& Forests of Minnesota and Wisconsin, though
   these varied greatly between groups. Our results highlight the need for
   wetland conservation initiatives that focus efforts at the level II and
   III ecoregional scale rather than along political boundaries.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Perforated steel plates with regularly shaped holes are already widely
   employed as steel dampers, which dissipate seismic energy through
   plastic deformation of steel. As a typical auxetic structure,
   two-dimensional (2D) re-entrant honeycomb configurations have
   characteristics of large deformation and good energy absorption.
   However, research on the effects of these configurations on the
   mechanical performance of steel is limited. This paper investigated the
   auxetic properties of perforated steel plates with re-entrant hexagon
   holes. Repetitive units are controlled by three parameters, hole ratio,
   re-entrant angle, and chamfer radius. Elastoplastic behavior and damage
   under large deformation were studied via tension tests and finite
   element (FE) analysis based on a micromechanics-based ductile fracture
   model. The effects of different parameters on mechanical properties of
   configurations were analyzed and discussed. The static performance of
   the perforated steel plates obtained in this study provides a good basis
   for its further dynamic study under large deformation.}},

Title = {{Improving the Blast Resistance of Large Steel Gates-Numerical Study}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Blast resistant gates/doors are essential for sensitive infrastructure,
   such as embassies, ministries, or parliaments. Lightweight gates
   equipped with `energy absorbing systems' have better operational
   performance than the traditional costly and bulky design. Graded auxetic
   structures have not yet been used as potential passive damping systems
   in the supporting frame of blast resistant gates. Consequently, this
   study tries to test if a uniaxial graded auxetic damper (UGAD) proposed
   by the authors in a recent article, namely the development of a new
   shock absorbing UGAD, could maintain a 3000 mm x 4500 mm steel gate
   operable after high blast peak reflected overpressure of 6.6 MPa, from
   100 kg TNT at 5 m stand-off distance. The blast-induced response of the
   gate was assessed, with and without the proposed UGAD, using
   Abaqus/Explicit solver. Results showed that the attachment of the
   proposed UGAD to the gate led to a dramatic decrease in permanent
   deformations (a critical factor for gate operability after a blast
   event). Hence, a lighter, more economical gate (with 50\% reduction in
   mass) was required to satisfy the operability condition. In addition,
   49\% of peak reaction forces were diminished, that have a direct impact
   on the supporting frame. Moreover, the results revealed that, in the
   numerical model, 56\% of the achieved plastic dissipation energy was
   from the UGADs, and 44\% from the gate. The outcomes of this research
   may have a positive impact on other sectors beyond academia, such as
   industry, economy, and public safety.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, through the use of a theoretical model, we analyse the

   must be able to respond in a desired manner to a stimulus applied in
   multiple directions. As a result of our studies, we show that the
   analysed system is capable of exhibiting auxetic behaviour for a broad
   range of loading directions, with isotropic behaviour being shown in
   some planes. In addition to that, we show that there are also certain
   loading directions in which the system manifests negative linear
   compressibility. This enhances its versatility and suitability for a
   number of applications where materials exhibiting auxetic behaviour or
   negative linear compressibility are normally implemented.}},

Abstract = {{A microphysics-agnostic meta-model of rotational glitches in
   rotation-powered pulsars is developed, wherein the globally averaged
   internal stress accumulates as a Brownian process between glitches, and
   a glitch is triggered once a critical threshold is surmounted. Precise,
   falsifiable predictions are made regarding long-term event statistics in
   individual pulsars. For example, the Spearman cross-correlation
   coefficient between the size of a glitch and the waiting time until the
   next glitch should exceed 0.25 in all pulsars. Among the six pulsars
   with the most recorded glitches, PSR J0537-6910 and PSR J0835-4510 are
   consistent with the predictions of the meta-model, while PSR J1740-3015
   and PSR J0631+1036 are not. PSR J0534+2200 and PSR J1341-6220 are only
   consistent with the meta-model, if there exists an undetected population
   of small glitches with small waiting times, which we do not resolve. The
   results are compared with a state-dependent Poisson process, another
   microphysics-agnostic meta-model in the literature. The results are also
   applied briefly to recent pulse-to-pulse observations of PSRJ0835-4510,
   which appear to reveal evidence for a negative fluctuation in rotation
   frequency just prior to the 2016 glitch.}},

Abstract = {{This study examined the association between energy drink consumption and
   substance use among adolescents and tested whether sex and/or grade
   level (i.e., middle vs. high school) moderate the association. Data were
   derived from the 2017 Ontario Student Drug Use and Health Survey, a
   representative survey of students in 7th to 12th grade. Analyses
   included 10,662 students who self-reported information on energy drink
   consumption and substance use. Poisson regression models were used with
   adjustments for important covariates. Energy drink consumption was
   associated with tobacco cigarette smoking (incidence rate ratio (IRR):
   3.74; 95\% confidence interval (CI): 3.22-4.35), cannabis use (IRR:
   2.90; 95\% CI: 2.53-3.32), binge drinking (IRR: 2.46; 95\% CI:
   2.05-2.96), opioid use (IRR: 2.23; 95\% CI: 1.85-2.68), and alcohol use
   (IRR: 1.31; 95\% CI: 1.26-1.36). The associations of energy drink
   consumption with tobacco cigarette smoking, cannabis use, and alcohol
   consumption were modified by grade level (two-way interaction terms p <
   0.05). The association between energy drink consumption and substance
   use was generally much stronger among middle school students compared
   with high school students. The findings suggest that middle school
   students may be more vulnerable to the negative effects of energy drinks

Journal = {{EXTREME MECHANICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{37}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{A novel 3D compression-torsion cubic mechanical metamaterial (CTCMM)
   with double inclined rods is proposed converting axial compression into
   a torsion. The CTCMM under uniaxial compression is studied by
   theoretical analysis, experiments and numerical simulations. The
   relationships between relative densities and geometric parameters are
   analyzed to meet the needs of lightweight. Based on the derivation of
   the over-deformation mechanism, the torsion angle is derived by the
   Timoshenko beam theory. The arrangements of gradient models are designed
   and fabricated by 3D printing, as the specimens for static compression
   experiments. Results show that the torsion angles of the numerical and
   experimental results agree well with the theoretical solution. Moreover,
   the proposed CTCMM possesses a similar compression-torsion effect
   compared to previously reported 3D CTCMM. Meanwhile, the improved 3D
   CTCMM with the better compression-torsion effect is proposed, compared
   with the original structure, the different phenomenon wherein the
   torsion angle first increases and then declines. Finally, cell number,
   variable cross-section and perforated plates all affect the
   compression-torsion effects of 3D CTCMM. The above research provides a
   new idea for improving the performance of CTCMM, no longer limited to
   the deformation mode of a single inclined rod. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Crashworthiness design and development of lightweight structures have
   become important engineering challenges because of the high standards of
   energy consumption and safety regulations. Within this context, the use
   of honeycomb structures as crush absorber is continuously growing in
   automotive and aircraft industries, once honeycombs are known for their
   high strength-to-weight ratio and excellent energy absorbing capacity.
   Thus, this paper presents a method that combines radial basis functions
   with expected improvement to optimize the specific energy absorption of
   honeycomb cellular materials, while the peak crush force is constrained
   at low levels for safety reasons. Honeycomb's cell size, cell shape and
   thickness are the design variables. Concerning the cell shape, the
   results indicate the hexagonal configuration has a higher out-of-plane
   performance compared to auxetic and rectangular cells in terms of energy
   absorption capacity. Lastly, a multi-objective optimization using only
   the radial basis function predictor (without sequential sampling) is
   carried out to seek simultaneously for optimal solutions with minimum
   peak force and maximum specific energy absorption.}},

   Poisson regression to assess dose-related cancer risks for the period
   1960-2014. Exposure assessment comprises recently available dose
   register data for all cohort members and newly estimated retrospective
   cabin crew doses for 1960-2003.
   Results
   SMR for all-cause, specific cancer groups and most individual cancers
   were reduced in all aircrew groups. The only increases were seen for
   brain cancer in pilots (n=23, SMR 2.01, 95\% CI 1.15 to 3.28) and for
   malignant melanoma (n=10, SMR 1.88, 95\% CI 0.78 to 3.85). Breast cancer
   mortality among female cabin crew was similar to the general population
   (n=71, SMR 1.06, 95\% CI 0.77 to 1.44). Overall median cumulative
   effective dose was 34.2 mSv (max: 116 mSv) for 1960-2014. No
   dose-response associations were seen in any of the models. For brain
   cancer, relative risks were elevated across dose categories. An
   indicative negative trend with increasing dose category was seen for
   large intestine cancer in female cabin crew (n=23).
   Conclusions
   There was no evidence for significant dose-response patterns for the
   considered cancer types. Interpretation of results remains difficult as
   cumulative dose is closely related to age. Future work should focus on
   investigating radiation jointly with other risk factors that may
   contribute to risks for specific cancers among aircrew.}},

Title = {{Alcohol and drug use, partner PrEP use and STI prevalence among people

Abstract = {{Objectives
   People with HIV (PWH) have a high burden of bacterial sexually
   transmitted infections (STIs). We examined the relationship of alcohol
   and drug use and partner pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) use to STI
   prevalence in a cohort of PWH with a history of unhealthy alcohol use.
   Methods
   We analysed data from a primary care-based alcohol intervention study at
   Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC). Participants were
   recruited between April 2013 and May 2015 and were followed for up to 24
   months. We linked participant responses to questions from the 24 month
   follow-up interview, including alcohol and drug use and partner PrEP
   use, with STI test results (ie, syphilis, chlamydia, gonorrhoea) in the
   KPNC electronic health record. Prevalence ratios (PR) were estimated
   using Poisson models fitted with robust variance estimators to evaluate
   the association of substance use and partner use of PrEP with STIs.
   Results
   In the analytic sample (n=465), the median age was 52 years (IQR 45-59);
   67\% were white; 95\% were men who have sex with men. Thirty-two per
   cent of participants had HIV-positive partners only; 31\% had
   HIV-negative partners with at least one on PrEP in the previous year and
   37\% had HIV-negative partners without any on PrEP. Twenty-three per
   cent reported alcohol and drug use prior to sex in the last 6 months.
   Eight per cent of participants had an STI. Partner PrEP use (adjusted PR
   (aPR) 2.99 (95\% CI 1.11 to 8.08)) was independently associated with
   higher STI prevalence. Participants who reported use of alcohol (aPR
   1.53 (0.61 to 3.83)), drugs (aPR 1.97 (0.71 to 5.51)) or both (aPR 1.93
   (0.75 to 4.97)) prior to sex had a higher STI prevalence.
   Conclusions
   The higher prevalence of STIs among PWH with unhealthy alcohol use who
   have partners on PrEP suggests that this subgroup may be a high-yield
   focus for targeted outreach, STI screening and sexual health
   counselling.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES}},

Volume = {{173}},
Month = {{MAY 1}},
Abstract = {{The aim of this paper is to introduce dual-material auxetic
   meta-sandwiches by four-dimensional (4D) printing technology for
   reversible energy absorption applications. The meta-sandwiches are
   developed based on an understanding of hyper-elastic feature of soft
   polymers and elasto-plastic behaviors of shape memory polymers and cold
   programming derived from theory and experiments. Dual-material
   lattice-based meta-structures with different combinations of soft and
   hard components are fabricated by 4D printing fused deposition modelling
   technology. The feasibility and performance of reversible dual-material
   meta-structures are assessed experimentally and numerically.
   Computational models for the meta-structures are developed and verified
   by the experiments. Research trials show that the dual-material auxetic
   designs are capable of generating a range of non-linear stiffness as per
   the requirement of energy absorbing applications. It is found that the
   meta-structures with hyper-elastic and/or elasto-plastic features
   dissipate energy and exhibit mechanical hysteresis characterized by
   non-coincident compressive loading-unloading curves. Mechanical
   hysteresis can be achieved by leveraging elasto-plasticity and
   snap-through-like mechanical instability through compression.
   Experiments also reveal that the mechanically induced plastic
   deformation and dissipation processes are fully reversible by simply
   heating. The material-structural model, concepts and results provided in
   this paper are expected to be instrumental towards 4D printing tunable
   meta-sandwiches for reversible energy absorption applications.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{173}},
Month = {{MAY 1}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic structures with negative Poisson's ratio have been widely
   studied due to their unique mechanical properties. In this paper, a
   novel auxetic cylindrical double-arrowed honeycomb (DAH) is proposed.
   First, an analytical model to predict the elastic mechanical properties
   of DAH structure in the longitudinal and circumferential directions is
   developed utilizing the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory. Then, the finite
   element models are utilized to verify the analytical method. However,
   the results show that the analytical model cannot accurately predict the
   elastic mechanical properties when the radial width is large.
   Furthermore, the analytical model is revised to predict elastic
   properties considering the effect of the radial width. The effect of the
   geometric parameters on the elastic properties is also investigated. The
   quasi-static compression experiments of ABS auxetic DAH prototypes are
   conducted to validate the revised analytical models. It is observed that
   the revised analytical model can accurately predict the elastic
   mechanical properties of DAH structures.}},

   manufactured mechanical metamaterials}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{173}},
Month = {{MAY 1}},
Abstract = {{Triangle and honeycomb mechanical metamaterials possess exclusive
   characteristic of programmable Poisson's ratio. Up to now, the Poisson's
   ratio of these metamaterials in reported experiments is only within the
   range of {[}-4, 1], which is far narrow than the theoretical prediction.
   In this work, triangle and honeycomb metamaterials were exclusively
   designed and were fabricated by additive manufacturing. The large
   magnitude of Poisson's ratios including both positive and negative
   values was obtained in experimental measurements. Theoretical analysis
   and numerical simulation were also performed and discussed with the
   experiments. The results reveal that, under large loading strain, the
   metamaterials suffer plastic and large deformation, making their
   Poisson's ratios show significant loading strain dependence. Below the
   critical loading strain, the metamaterials generate elastic deformation,
   and the experimentally measured Poisson's ratios agree well with the
   theoretical perditions and numerical calculation. The as-fabricated
   triangle and honeycomb metamaterials present programmable positive
   Poisson's ratio in the ranges of {[}0.75, 10.92] and {[}2.80, 13.79],
   respectively. Besides, the reentrant triangle and honeycomb
   metamaterials show programmable negative Poisson's ratio in the ranges
   of {[}-0.87, -7.01] and {[}-2.13, -10.24], respectively. These
   experimentally obtained ranges of Poisson's ratios are far larger than
   the literature reported experimental results, and provide experimental
   basis of these mechanical metamaterials to the applications in such as
   aerospace, civil and transportation.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES}},

Abstract = {{Ballistic penetration is a serious threat to military vehicles.
   Honeycomb structure is one of the most focused solution to improve the
   ballistic performance due to its great lightweight design and high
   resistant against impact. There are lots of honeycomb structure
   topologies. However, no comprehensive comparison on out-of-plane
   ballistic performance between common honeycomb types had been conducted
   to our knowledge. Therefore, hexagonal, reentrant, square, triangle and
   two circular (CS and CH types) honeycomb structures with identical mass
   and thickness are developed and modelled in this paper. Their relative
   densities are firstly calculated. Their numerical models and the
   Lambert-Jonas ballistic model are established. The ballistic
   performances of these six cases impacted by a blunt nose cylinder
   projectile from out-of-plane direction are detailed compared through
   numerical method. Their dynamic response, elastic and plastic
   deformation, failure mechanism and energy absorption capability are
   researched. Relations between initial velocity and residual velocity of
   projectile and the ballistic limit velocities of all cases are also
   compared. The results indicated that reentrant, square and triangular
   cases perform worse than hexagonal honeycomb. The fascinating
   deformation mechanism of CS and CH cases results in a long elastic
   deformation time and high strength after elastic deformation, which
   leads to a large decrease in residual velocity. Compared with hexagonal
   honeycomb, ballistic limit velocities of CS and CH type are improved by
   15.2\% and 25.0\%, respectively. This comparison research provides a
   useful reference for sandwich honeycomb core design.}},

Abstract = {{Although intersections constitute a little space on the urban road
   network, they are the areas where traffic crashes are concentrated. In
   this study, the relationship between traffic volume, intersection
   geometry, traffic control characteristics and vehicular fatal/injury
   traffic crashes (without pedestrians) were examined for 39 four-legged
   signalized intersections in the city center of Mersin during 2014 to
   2016. For this purpose, Poisson regression and negative binomial (NB)
   regression models were used. The results showed that total number of
   approach lanes increases the intersection crashes. On the other hand,
   the increase in ratio of traffic volumes between primary and secondary
   intersection legs reduces the intersection crashes. The presence of
   median on primary intersection legs also reduces the number of crashes.}},

Title = {{Effect of negative Poisson's ratio on the fracture mechanics parameters
   due to mechanical and thermal loads}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{150}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The objective of the paper is to study the effect of negative Poisson's
   ratio on the crack tip field under the application of external
   mechanical load and temperature. Explicit and analytical expressions for
   the fracture mechanics parameters such as stress intensity factors and
   the energy release rate are obtained. The expressions for the thermal
   loads are derived in axisymmetric cylindrical coordinates under the
   framework of steady-state uncoupled linear thermoelasticity. Numerical
   results are presented graphically to demonstrate the effect of negative
   Poisson's ratio on the crack tip field. The results show that for the
   case of applied mechanical loads, materials with negative Poisson's
   ratio have higher energy release rate. However, if the applied are
   thermal loads, the crack tip fracture mechanics parameters are
   significantly decreased. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives The aim of the study was to investigate whether lamivudine
   (3TC) or emtricitabine (FTC) use following detection of M184V/I is
   associated with better virological outcomes.
   Methods We identified people with viruses harbouring the M184V/I
   mutation in UK multicentre data sets who had treatment change/initiation
   within 1 year. We analysed outcomes of viral suppression (< 200 HIV-1
   RNA copies/mL) and appearance of new major drug resistance mutations
   (DRMs) using Cox and Poisson models, with stratification by new drug
   regimen (excluding 3TC/FTC) and Bayesian implementation, and estimated
   the effect of 3TC/FTC adjusted for individual and viral characteristics.
   Results We included 2597 people with the M184V/I resistance mutation, of
   whom 665 (25.6\%) were on 3TC and 458 (17.6\%) on FTC. We found a
   negative adjusted association between 3TC/FTC use and viral suppression
   {[}hazard ratio (HR) 0.84; 95\% credibility interval (CrI) 0.71-0.98].
   On subgroup analysis of individual drugs, there was no evidence of an
   association with viral suppression for 3TC (n = 184; HR 0.94; 95\% CrI
   0.73-1.15) or FTC (n = 454; HR 0.99; 95\% CrI 0.80-1.19) amongst those
   on tenofovir-containing regimens, but we estimated a reduced rate of
   viral suppression for people on 3TC amongst those without tenofovir use
   (n = 481; HR 0.71; 95\% CrI 0.54-0.90). We found no association between
   3TC/FTC and detection of any new DRM (overall HR 0.92; 95\% CrI
   0.64-1.18), but found inconclusive evidence of a lower incidence rate of
   new DRMs (overall incidence rate ratio 0.69; 95\% CrI 0.34-1.11).
   Conclusions We did not find evidence that 3TC or FTC use is associated
   with an increase in viral suppression, but it may reduce the appearance
   of additional DRMs in people with M184V/I. 3TC was associated with
   reduced viral suppression amongst people on regimens without tenofovir.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the in-plane mechanical properties of auxetic structures
   subjected to dynamic compression have been investigated experimentally
   and numerically. The studied auxetic structures, which have negative
   Poisson's ratios, include a recently developed auxetic structure named
   re-entrant chiral auxetic (RCA) structure, re-entrant honeycomb,
   tetrachiral honeycomb and anti-tetrachiral honeycomb. All structures
   studied were fabricated from polyamide12 (PA12) powder using multi jet
   fusion. Compressive tests were conducted at a constant crushing velocity
   of 5 m s(-1) on an Instron VHS 8800 high speed testing machine. The
   experimental results showed that the RCA structure crushed in the Y
   direction offered better energy absorption capacity than the other three
   types of honeycomb. It was also found that loading direction had a
   significant influence on deformation modes and auxetic features of the
   RCA structure, while it had a moderate influence on the energy
   absorption capacity. Numerical models were developed using
   ABAQUS/explicit and verified by experimental results. Parametric study
   was conducted to investigate the effects of crushing velocity and

Abstract = {{In this paper, we proposed a new material design method by
   microstructure topology optimization. Novelty of the proposed method is
   to target the whole nonlinear volume-averaged effective stress-strain
   curve of microstructure representative volume element (RVE) rather than
   aiming specific values such as strength, stiffness or Poisson ratio. J2
   plasticity model with a linear isotropic hardening model was chosen for
   local residuals. Global residuals are computed within nonlinear finite
   element framework for the topology optimization. Sensitivities of the
   objective function augmented with the residuals and adjoint response
   vectors with respect to design variables are derived with details and
   their numerical computational procedures were also presented.
   Microstructure topologies showing two different targeted stress-strain
   curves under uniaxial and biaxial loadings were obtained by using the
   method of moving asymptotes (MMA) optimization algorithm. Accuracy of
   the sensitivity computations was verified and numerical examples

Title = {{Design of polymeric auxetic matrices for improved mechanical coupling in
   lead-free piezocomposites}},
Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{While lead-free piezocomposites offer an environmentally friendly
   solution to mechanical sensing and energy harvesting, they lag
   state-of-the-art lead-based materials in terms of performance. It is
   therefore important to develop new material designs to bridge this
   performance gap. Considering composites where rigid piezoelectric
   inclusions are embedded in soft matrices, a major cause of poor
   performance is weak coupling of applied strains to the inclusions. We
   show here that by designing matrices with negative Poisson's ratios
   (auxetic matrices) it is possible to considerably improve this coupling.
   We first demonstrate this concept using a matrix which is inherently
   auxetic where we show an improvement of 40\%-50\% in the piezoelectric
   response. Based on the observations made, we develop a scalable design
   for auxetic matrices using conventional non-auxetic polymeric materials.
   This is done by embedding rigid auxetic structures in softer matrices.
   We show that with such designed auxetic matrices, which are amenable to
   fabrication through 3D printing, it is possible to achieve considerably
   larger piezoelectric response with a significant retention of the matrix
   softness. Particularly, we show that auxetic designs can show
   piezoelectric enhancements exceeding 300\% compared to non-auxetic
   reference designs having similar a non-auxetic rigid backbone of similar
   volume as the auxetic backbone. Therefore, the use of matrices with
   negative Poisson's ratios is a promising design avenue to decouple
   mechanical coupling of strain to inclusions and matrix hardness. This
   strategy can pave way to design of softer piezocomposites with superior
   responses employing only structured polymeric materials without the use
   of expensive nanomaterials.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a method to optimize periodic microstructures for obtaining

   worst case design in order to minimize the Poisson ratio of the

   directions. We use a minimization algorithm for inequality constraints
   based on an active set strategy and on a new algorithm for solving
   minimization problems with equality constraints, belonging to the class
   of null-space gradient methods. It uses first order derivatives of both
   the objective function and the constraints. The step is computed as a
   sum between a steepest descent step (minimizing the objective
   functional) and a correction step related to the Newton method (aiming
   to solve the equality constraints). The linear combination between these
   two steps involves coefficients similar to Lagrange multipliers which
   are computed in a natural way based on the Newton method. The algorithm
   uses no projection and thus the iterates are not feasible; the
   constraints are only satisfied in the limit (after convergence). A local
   convergence result is proven for a general nonlinear setting, where both
   the objective functional and the constraints are not necessarily convex
   functions.}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{This work reports on the dynamic tensile behaviour of an auxetic
   structure, namely, honeycomb with representative re-entrant topology.
   Quasi-static and dynamic tensile tests were conducted by employing MTS
   and Instron VHS 8800 hydraulic testing machines, respectively. The
   re-entrant samples were printed using AlSi12 powder via the selective
   laser melting (SLM) process. The deformation and force - displacement
   curves were of interest A good agreement was observed between the
   numerical simulations and the experimental results. Subsequently,
   numerous finite element (FE) simulations were performed through
   ABAQUS/Explicit. Three deformation modes were classified, especially
   with a tensile shock wave observed within the Localised deformation
   mode. An analytical equation was obtained for the dynamic force of such
   materials under tension, which agrees well with the FE result. The
   effect of loading velocity and cell geometries was considered.}},

Title = {{Critical assessment of the interatomic potentials for the elastic

Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The present work deals with the assessment of Tersoff potential with
   different sets of empirical parameters for the two-dimensional noncarbon
   beta N (beta: B, Al, Ga and In) hexagonal monolayer lattice structures
   in the framework of Cauchy-Born rule. The deformations at atomistic and
   continuum scale are coupled thorough Cauchy-Born rule accounting for
   curvature effects. The interatomic potentials are assessed to
   demonstrate their accuracy for predicting the elastic properties,
   bending rigidity, cohesive energy and bond length when compared with
   those predicted from experimental studies and first-principle
   calculations. The elastic properties and bending rigidity predicted with
   different sets of empirical parameters for interatomic potentials are
   found to be scattered in a significant manner and best set of parameters
   is identified here and recommended for further use in multiscale
   simulations. Few of the parameter sets for the Tersoff potential
   predicted a negative value of the Poisson's ratio through multiscale
   simulation. Furthermore, the bending rigidity of the rest of the three
   nanomaterials, except boron nitride nanomaterial, is reported for the
   first time in the present study.}},

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{257}},

Abstract = {{The mechanical properties of the anti-tetrachiral structure having the
   thickness of the ligament changing symmetrically around the center are
   investigated using analytical and numerical methods. For the purpose of
   deriving a theoretical model, the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory is used to
   determine the relation among the acting moment, the angle of rotation of
   the nodes, and the bending energy stored. Analysis of the results
   indicates that a change in geometry has a minor effect on Poisson's
   ratio, if any at all; however, it can result in relatively large changes
   in Young's modulus. Hence, it is shown that the mechanical properties
   can be altered selectively by adjusting the geometric features of chiral
   structures. The indications of the analytical model are validated using
   numerical methods for different values of the geometric parameters and
   are found to be in good agreement. In the process, it is shown that
   there are regions of the parameter space where the mechanical properties
   of the anti-tetrachiral are insensitive to variations in certain
   geometric dimensions.}},

Title = {{Measuring aggregation in parasite populations}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY INTERFACE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{165}},
Month = {{APR 29}},
Abstract = {{Aggregation, a fundamental feature of parasite distributions, has been
   measured using a variety of indices. We use the definition that
   parasite-host system A is more aggregated than parasite-host system B if
   any given proportion of the parasite population is concentrated in a
   smaller proportion of the host population A than of host population B.
   This leads to indices based on the Lorenz curve such as the Gini index
   (Poulin's D), coefficient of variation and the Hoover index, all of
   which measure departure from a uniform distribution. The Hoover index is
   particularly useful because it can be interpreted directly in terms of
   parasites and hosts. An alternative view of aggregation is degree of
   departure from a Poisson (or random) distribution, as used in the index
   of dispersion and the negative binomial k. These and Lloyd's mean
   crowding index are reinterpreted and connected back to Lorenz curves.
   Aggregation has occasionally been defined as the slope from Taylor's
   law, although the slope appears unrelated to other indices. The Hoover
   index may be the method of choice when data points are available, and
   the coefficient of variation when only variance and mean are given.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we have introduced the auxetic effect in black phosphorus
   (BP) analog Sb and achieved auxetic modulations in monolayer As and Sb
   via first-principles calculations. Compared with monolayer As, the
   monolayer Sb is phonon unstable. By applying uniaxial strain along each
   direction, we discovered zigzag-vertical reversibility on out-of-plane
   auxeticity, and the negative Poisson's ratios for monolayer As and Sb
   were simulated to be -0.125/-0.172 and -0.036/-0.063, respectively, by
   applying the strain along zigzag/vertical directions. The negative
   Poisson's ratio could be significantly manipulated by applying a
   vertical electric field as it can be increased up to 70.3\% for
   monolayer As and decreased up to 55.6\% for monolayer Sb. Such an
   intrinsic negative Poisson's ratio and electric field modulation could
   endow these monolayers with potential applications in auxetic
   optoelectronic devices, electrodes and sensors, leading to novel
   multi-functionalities.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundRacial disparities in cardiovascular disease (CVD) have been
   attributed in part to negative psychosocial factors. Prior studies have
   demonstrated associations between individual psychosocial factors and
   CVD risk factors, but little is known about their cumulative
   effects.MethodsUsing the Jackson Heart Study, we examined the
   cross-sectional associations of cumulative psychosocial factors with CVD
   risk factors among 5306 African Americans. We utilized multivariable
   Poisson regression to estimate sex-stratified prevalence ratios (PR 95\%
   confidence interval-CI) of obesity, hypertension and diabetes prevalence
   and hypertension and diabetes control with negative affect (cynicism,
   anger-in, anger-out, depressive symptoms and cumulative negative affect)
   and stress (global stress, weekly stress, major life events-MLEs and
   cumulative stress), adjusting for demographics, socioeconomic status,
   and behaviors.ResultsAfter full adjustment, high (vs. low) cumulative
   negative affect was associated with prevalent obesity among men (PR 1.36
   95\% CI 1.16-1.60), while high (vs. low) cumulative stress was similarly
   associated with obesity among men and women (PR 1.24 95\% CI 1.01-1.52
   and PR 1.13 95\% CI 1.03-1.23, respectively). Psychosocial factors were
   more strongly associated with prevalent hypertension and diabetes among
   men than women. For example, men who reported high cynicism had a 12\%
   increased prevalence of hypertension (PR 1.12, 95\% CI 1.03-1.23).
   Psychosocial factors were more strongly associated with lower
   hypertension and diabetes control for women than men. Women who reported
   high (vs. low) cynicism had a 38\% lower prevalence of hypertension
   control (PR 0.62, 95\% CI 0.46-0.84).ConclusionsCumulative psychosocial
   factors were associated with CVD risk factors and disease management
   among African Americans. The joint accumulation of psychosocial factors
   was more associated with risk factors for men than women.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose
   This paper aims to examine the effect of outside chief executive officer
   (CEO) succession on firm innovation in Chinese companies and to explore
   the mechanism behind the process. By analyzing the motivation of CEO
   successors of different origins in the context of selection, this paper
   identifies the factors affecting outside CEO successors' decision-making
   on post-succession firm innovation.
   Design/methodology/approach
   A Poisson regression model is used on a sample of 1,084 firm-year
   observations taken from Chinese listed companies that endured CEO
   succession during the period of 2009-2016. Fixed-effect Poisson
   regression modeling was performed after likelihood ratio and Hausman
   testing to assess the robustness of the findings.
   Findings
   The results show that outside CEO successions are significantly and
   negatively associated with post-succession firm innovation. Moreover,
   the authors found a negative effect of outside CEO succession on
   post-succession firm innovation when the predecessor has a long tenure
   or the successor is older.
   Originality/value
   .This study contributes to the literature on CEO succession, CEO-board
   relationships and firm innovation by shedding light on how agency, human
   capital and career-concerning theories in the CEO selection context
   apply to corporate governance and strategy. Moreover, by exploring the
   factors influencing CEO successors' decision-making in terms of firm
   innovation in the Chinese social and cultural context, this paper
   identifies ways to promote firm innovation for Chinese companies from
   the concept of leadership succession.}},

   yarns in both warp and weft directions. Experiments show that the
   maximum NPR of helical auxetic yarns reaches a remarkable level of -5.6,
   and the auxetic fabrics display notable geometric changes compared with
   the nonauxetic fabrics with the same structural parameters. The

Title = {{Workload of pharmacists and the performance of pharmacy services}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 21}},
Abstract = {{Objective
   To evaluate the influence of pharmacists' dispensing workload (PDW) on
   pharmacy services as measured by prescription suggestion rate (PSR) and
   dispensing error rate (DER).
   Method
   This was an observational study in northern and southern Taiwan's two
   largest medical centers, from 2012 to 2018. We calculated monthly PDW as
   number of prescriptions divided by number of pharmacist working days. We
   used monthly PSR and DER as outcome indicators for pharmacists' review
   and dispensing services, respectively. We used Poisson regression model
   with generalized estimation equation methods to evaluate the influence
   of PDW on PSR and DER.
   Results
   The monthly mean of 463,587 (SD 32,898) prescriptions yielded mean PDW,
   PSR and DER of 52 (SD 3) prescriptions per pharmacist working days, 30
   (SD 7) and 8 (SD 2) per 10,000 prescriptions monthly, respectively.
   There was significant negative impact of PDW on PSR (adjusted rate
   ratio, aRR: 0.9786; 95\%CI: 0.9744-0.9829) and DER (aRR: 0.9567; 95\%CI:
   0.9477-0.9658). Stratified analyses by time periods (2012-2015 and
   2016-2018) revealed the impact of PDW on PSR to be similar in both
   periods; but with positive association between PDW and DER in the more
   recent one (aRR: 1.0086, 95\%CI: 1.0003-1.0169).
   Conclusions
   Reduced pharmacist workload was associated with re-allocation of
   pharmacy time to provide prescription suggestions and, more recently,
   decrease dispensing errors. Continuous efforts to maintain appropriate
   workload for pharmacists are recommended to ensure prescription quality.}},

Abstract = {{A number of biological tissues have been reported as behaving in an
   auxetic manner, defined by a negative Poisson's ratio. This describes
   the deformation of tissue which expands in the axial and the transverse
   directions simultaneously while under uniaxial tension; and contracts
   axially and transversely upon uniaxial compression. The discovery of
   auxetic behaviour within biological tissues has implications for the
   recreation of the auxetic loading environment within tissue engineering.
   Tissue engineers strive to recreate the natural properties of biological
   tissue and in order to recreate the unique loading environment of cells
   from auxetic tissue, an auxetic scaffold is required. A number of
   studies have used a variety of auxetic scaffolds within tissue
   engineering. Investigation into the effect of auxetic micro-environments
   created by auxetic scaffolds on cellular behaviour has demonstrated an
   increased cellular proliferation and enhanced differentiation. Here, we
   discuss studies which have identified auxetic behaviour within
   biological tissues, and where cells have been cultured within auxetic
   scaffolds, bringing together current knowledge of the potential use of
   auxetic materials in tissue engineering applications and biomedical
   devices.}},

Abstract = {{As one of the most important and versatile elements, carbon renders
   itself as one of the most fundamental and cutting-edge topics in
   chemistry, physics, and materials science. Many carbon-based chemical
   rules were established accordingly. While the tetrahedral predilection
   of tetracoordinate carbon has been a cornerstone of organic chemistry
   since 1874, almost a century later tetracoordinate carbon was found to
   be able to adopt planar structures known as planar tetracoordinate
   carbon (ptC), which are stabilized electronically by good pi-acceptor
   (delocalization of a lone electron pair of ptC) or sigma-donor
   (promoting electron transfer to electron-deficient bonding) substituents
   or mechanically by appropriate steric enforcement. The experimental and
   theoretical achievements for the rule-breaking ptC species totally
   refreshed our understanding of chemical bonding and triggered
   exploration of peculiar molecules featuring planar pentacoordinate
   carbon (ppC) and planar hexacoordinate carbon (phC) as well as other
   outlandish species such as planar hypercoordinate silicon.
   While the planar hypercoordinate carbon chemistry has been gradually
   established for molecules in the past five decades, there is growing
   interest in pursuing their extension systems, especially in
   two-dimensional (2D) space as a result of the recent extensive studies
   of graphene and its analogues. Though the natural 2D layered crystals do
   not contain any planar hypercoordinate carbon or silicon, several 2D
   nanosheets featuring planar or quasi-planar hypercoordinate ones have
   been theoretically suggested. Encouragingly, these unique planar
   configurations possess decent stabilities, and some of them are even the
   global minimum structure, exhibiting great potential for experimental
   realization. As the nature of a material is mainly determined by its
   structural characteristics (e.g., dimensionality, crystallography, and
   bonding), the combination of planar hypercoordinate chemistry and 2D
   nanoscience not only endows these rule-breaking systems with the merits
   of 2D materials but also may offer various promising properties and
   applications. For example, an unusual negative Poisson's ratio can be
   found in ppC-containing Be5C2 and planar pentacoordinate silicon
   (ppSi)-containing CaSi monolayers, of which the former has an
   anisotropic Dirac cone and the latter is a semiconductor with a
   desirable band gap for the semiconductor industry. Specially, shortly
   after the theoretical prediction, a planar hexacoordinate silicon
   (phSi)-containing Cu2Si monolayer was experimentally synthesized and
   characterized with the 2D Dirac nodal line fermion, which offers a
   platform to achieve high-speed, low-dissipation nanodevices.
   In this Account, we review the recent progress, mostly by density
   functional theory (DFT) computations, in designing 2D materials with
   planar hypercoordinate motifs. We describe the key achievements in this
   field, paying special attention to the ``bottom-up{''} and
   ``isoelectronic substitution{''} design strategies. In addition, the
   fundamental stabilization mechanisms of planar hypercoordinate motifs in
   an infinite layer are discussed. We hope that this Account will inspire
   more experimental and theoretical efforts to explore nanomaterials with
   such unconventional chemical bonding.}},

Abstract = {{Background
   Members of uniformed armed forces are considered to be at high risk for
   HIV infection and have been proposed as suitable candidates for
   participation in HIV intervention studies. We report on the feasibility
   of recruitment and follow up of individuals from the community of the
   Uganda Police Force (UPF) for an HIV vaccine preparedness study.
   Methods
   HIV-negative volunteers aged 18-49 years, were identified from UPF
   facilities situated in Kampala and Wakiso districts through community
   HIV counselling and testing. Potential volunteers were referred to the
   study clinic for screening, enrolment and quarterly visits for one year.
   HIV incidence, retention rates were estimated and expressed as cases per
   100 person years of observation (PYO). Rate ratios were used to
   determine factors associated with retention using Poisson regression
   models.
   Results
   We screened 560 to enroll 500 volunteers between November 2015 and May
   2016. One HIV seroconversion occurred among 431 PYO, for an incidence
   rate of 0.23/100 PYO (95\% confidence interval {[}CI]: 0.03-1.64).
   Overall, retention rate was 87\% at one year, and this was independently
   associated with residence duration (compared to <1 year, 1 to 5 years
   adjusted rate ratio (aRR) = 1.19, 95\%CI: 1.00-1.44); and >5 years aRR =
   1.34, 95\%CI: 0.95-1.37); absence of genital discharge in the last 3
   months (aRR = 1.97, 95\% CI: 1.38-2.83, absence of genital ulcers (aRR =
   1.90, 95\%CI: 1.26-2.87, reporting of new sexual partner in the last
   month (aRR = 0.57, 95\%CI: 0.45-0.71, being away from home for more than
   two nights (aRR = 1.27, 95\%CI: 1.04-1.56, compared to those who had not
   travelled) and absence of knowledge on HIV prevention (aRR = 2.67,
   95\%CI: 1.62-4.39).
   Conclusions
   While our study demonstrates the feasibility of recruiting and retaining
   individuals from the UPF for HIV research, we did observe lower than
   anticipated HIV incidence, perhaps because individuals at lower risk of
   HIV infection may have been the first to come forward to participate or
   participants followed HIV risk reduction measures. Our findings suggest
   lessons for recruitment of populations at high risk of HIV infection.}},

Title = {{Sexual behaviour, changes in sexual behaviour and associated factors
   among women at high risk of HIV participating in feasibility studies for
   prevention trials in Tanzania}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Abstract = {{Introduction
   Risk reduction towards safer behaviour is promoted after enrolment in
   HIV prevention trials. We evaluated sexual behaviour, changes in sexual
   behaviour and factors associated with risky behaviour after one-year of
   follow-up among women enrolled in HIV prevention trials in Northern
   Tanzania.
   Methods
   Self-reported information from 1378 HIV-negative women aged 18-44
   enrolled in microbicide and vaccine feasibility studies between
   2008-2010,was used to assess changes in behaviour during a 12-month
   follow-up period. Logistic regression with random intercepts was used to
   estimate odds ratios for trends in each behaviour over time. A
   behavioural risk score was derived from coefficients of three
   behavioural variables in a Poisson regression model for HIV incidence
   and thereafter, dichotomized to risky vs less-risky behaviour. Logistic
   regression was then used to identify factors associated with risky
   behaviour at 12 months.
   Results
   At baseline, 22\% reported multiple partners, 28\% were involved in
   transactional sex and only 22\% consistently used condoms with
   non-regular partners. The proportion of women reporting multiple
   partners, transactional sex and high-risk sex practices reduced at each
   3-monthly visit (33\%, 43\% and 47\% reduction in odds per visit
   respectively, p for linear trend < 0.001 for all), however, there was no
   evidence of a change in the proportion of women consistently using
   condoms with non-regular partners (p = 0.22). Having riskier behaviours
   at baseline, being younger than 16 years at sexual debut, having
   multiple partners, selling sex and excessive alcohol intake at baseline
   were strongly associated with increased odds of risky sexual behaviour
   after 12 months (p<0.005 for all).
   Conclusion
   An overall reduction in risky behaviours over time was observed in HIV
   prevention cohorts. Risk reduction counselling was associated with
   decreased risk behaviour but was insufficient to change behaviours of
   all those at highest risk. Biological HIV prevention interventions such
   as PrEP for individuals at highest risk, should complement risk
   reduction counselling so as to minimize HIV acquisition risk.}},

Abstract = {{Using evolutionary structure search combined with ab initio theory, we
   investigate the electronic, thermal, and mechanical properties of
   two-dimensional (2D) A(2)B (A = Cu, Ag, Au, and B = S, Se) auxetic
   semiconductors. Two types of structures are found to have low energy,
   namely, s(I/II)-A(2)B, which have direct bandgaps in the range 1.09-2.60
   eV and high electron mobilities. Among these semiconductors, Cu2B and
   Ag2B have light holes with 2 orders of magnitude larger mobility than
   the heavy holes, up to 9.51 X 10(4)cm(2) v(-1) s(-1) , giving the
   possibility of achieving highly anisotropic hole transport with the
   application of a uniaxial strain. Due to the ionic bonding nature,
   s-A(2)B structures have unusually low lattice thermal conductivities
   down to 1.5 W m(-1) K-1 at 300 K, which are quite promising for new
   generation thermoelectric devices. Besides, s-A(2)B structures show
   extraordinary flexibility with ultralow Young's moduli (down to 20 N/m),
   which are lower than most previously reported 2D materials. Moreover,
   under strain along the diagonal direction, five of the structures have
   in-plane negative Poisson's ratios.}},

Title = {{Extension twist deformation response of an auxetic cylindrical structure
   inspired by deformed cell ligaments}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{238}},
Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{Recent advances in artificial metamaterials have allowed unique
   structures to deform in distinct modes not previously found in
   traditional material form. Auxetic structures that induce twist through
   deformation have been a focus of recent research. In this paper a
   cell-based tubular structure with pre-deformed ligaments is proposed
   which exhibits efficient extension induced twist (EIT) without the
   limitations of buckling. An analytical model of the structure is
   proposed using cell parameters to characterize the non-linear
   twist-deformation relationship. Samples of the structure were fabricated
   using the Ultimaker 3 platform with elastomer based TPU 95a build
   material and PVA support material. The analytical model and FEM were
   validated by tensile experiments, where fabricated samples reached 60
   degrees of non-linear axial twist over 40 mm of deformation. In order to
   further characterize the structure's twist response, key design
   parameters of the lattice structure were varied and modelled. Actuation
   through tensile elastic deformation has key advantages in reliability
   and reduced complexity. Due to these advantages, this technology has
   potential applications in aerospace, biomedical and robotic fields.}},

   the auxetic chiral lattices}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{238}},
Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{In this study, the wave propagation properties in terms of the band gap
   and directions of wave propagation of the auxetic chiral structure are
   analyzed. The mechanism of generation of the band gap are carefully
   investigated. The auxetic chiral structure are assembled with the repeat
   unit cells and the unit cell contains a number of rigidly connected
   beams. The dynamic model of the unit cell are established by the
   principle of finite element method. The wave behaviors of the lattices
   are calculated by solving the dynamic model with the help of the Bloch's
   theorem. The band structure are obtained and the effects of the chiral
   angles on the width and position of the band gap distributions are
   carefully studied. Especially, the mechanism of formation of the band
   gap are also analyzed by investigating the vibrational mode calculated
   by the commercial finite element software. The group velocities are
   calculated to analyze the effects of the geometrical parameters on the
   directional frequency-dependent energy flows in the structures. We also
   use the commercial finite element software to simulate the directional
   wave behaviors in the structure. We find that the first mode of the
   elastic wave spread only along certain specific directions in the
   auxetic chiral structure. The speed of wave propagation will be reduced,
   and the direction of wave propagation rotates counterclockwise when the
   chiral angle increases.}},

Journal = {{SENSORS AND ACTUATORS A-PHYSICAL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{305}},
Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{An auxetic structure as a substrate material in sensor applications
   improves sensitivity performance due to lateral expansion under tensile
   loading. The presented stretchable, highly sensitive at-low-strain
   piezoresistive sensor was manufactured by mixing the silicone rubber and
   chopped carbon fibers in an auxetic re-entrant structure form. Auxetic
   re-entrant die was printed by using a 3D printing technique. The main
   feature of this sensor is the high sensitivity for strains lower than
   6\%, in which previous sensors could not recognize this range of strain
   well. In order to justify the excellent performance of the sensor, the
   deformation modes of the auxetic re-entrant structures were investigated
   and also connected to piezoresistive sensitivity. The shifting strain is
   defined as strain value, where the Poisson's ratio of structure shifts
   from negative to positive Poisson's ratio. Our study revealed that
   auxetic sensors have excellent sensitivity performance until the
   shifting strain due to having negative Poisson's ratio, and after that,
   their sensitivity performance is going to be weak due to having positive
   Poisson's ratio. In the present work, silicone rubber as the substrate
   material was used. This is a very soft material and made it possible to
   have low shifting strain resulting in perfect sensitivity performance
   for low-strain applications. The presented sensor has applications in
   many fields which are in low-strain conditions such as measuring the
   Vocal Cord Dysfunction (VCD), wrist pulse, or even earth vibration. (C)

Abstract = {{An increase in the daily rate of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) has
   been observed during days of geomagnetic storm (GS). However, the
   analysis of associations between the daily number of AMI and geomagnetic
   activity (GMA) over longer periods sometimes yields controversial
   results. The study aimed to detect the complex association between the
   daily numbers of AMI and weather, the Quasi-biennial Oscillation (QBO)
   phase, GMA, and solar wind variables. We used data of Kaunas
   population-based Ischemic Heart Disease Register of residents of Kaunas
   city (Lithuania) for 2000-2012. The associations between weather and
   space weather variables and the daily number of AMI were evaluated by
   applying the multivariate Poisson regression. A higher risk of AMI was
   positively associated with active-stormy local GMA (rate ratio (RR) =
   1.06 (95\% CI 1.01-1.10)), solar wind dynamic pressure with a lag of 4
   days (RR = 1.02 (1.01-1.04) per 1 nPa increase), and solar wind speed
   with a lag of 3-7 days (RR = 1.03 (1.01-1.05) per 100 km/s increase). A
   positive association was found between the west QBO phase and the risk
   of AMI during winter (RR = 1.08 (1.01-1.16)), and a negative association
   was observed between them during March-November (RR = 0.93 (0.90-0.97)).
   The risk of AMI positively associated with the GS due to stream
   interaction regions with a lag of 0-2 days during the east QBO phase (RR
   = 1.10, p = 0.046) and was negatively associated with them during the
   west QBO phase (RR = 0.82, p = 0.024). These results may help understand
   the population's sensitivity under different weather and space weather
   conditions. The QBO phase may modify the effect of GS.}},

Title = {{3d printed continuous fiber reinforced composite auxetic honeycomb
   structures}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITES PART B-ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{187}},
Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{Continuous fiber reinforced thermoplastic composite (CFRTPC) auxetic
   honeycomb structures were fabricated using the 3D printing technology
   with a specific printing path planning. For comparison, auxetic
   honeycombs were also fabricated with pure polylactic acid (PLA).
   In-plane compression tests were conducted, with corresponding damage
   types explored using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images. A
   printing path-based finite element (FE) method was developed to mimic
   both small and large deformations of CFRTPC auxetic honeycombs, while
   analytical model was proposed to predict their effective stiffness and
   Poisson ratio. Good agreement was achieved among analytical predictions,
   FE simulation results and experimental measurements. A systematic
   parametric study was subsequently carried out to quantify the dependence
   of in-plane mechanical properties on geometrical parameters. Compared
   with pure PLA structures, the presence of continuous fibers efficiently
   prohibited crack propagation in the matrix for each ligament of CFRTPC
   auxetic honeycombs. Adding continuous fibers increased the mass only by
   6\%, but led to dramatic increase in compressive stiffness and energy
   absorption by 86.3\% and 100\% respectively and smaller Poisson ratios.
   The proposed 3D printing technology has great potential in integrated
   fabrication of continuous fiber reinforced composite lightweight
   structures having complex shapes, attractive mechanical properties, and
   multifunctional attributes.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the validity and accuracy of three interatomic potentials
   and the continuum shell model of Ghaffari and Sauer {[}1] are
   investigated. The mechanical behavior of single-layered graphene sheets
   (SLGSs) under uniaxial stretching, biaxial stretching and pure bending
   is studied for this comparison. The validity of the molecular and
   continuum models is assessed by direct comparison with density
   functional theory (DFT) data available in the literature. The molecular
   simulations are carried out employing the MM3, Tersoff and REBO + LJ
   potentials. The continuum formulation uses an anisotropic hyperelastic
   material model in the framework of the geometrically exact
   Kirchhoff-Love shell theory and isogeometric finite elements. Results
   from the continuum model are in good agreement with those from DFT. The
   results from the MM3 potential agree well up to the point of material
   instability, whereas those from the REBO + LJ and Tersoff potentials
   agree only for small deformations. Only the Tersoff potential is found
   to yield auxetic response in SLGSs under uniaxial stretch. Additionally,
   the transverse vibration frequencies of a pre-stretched graphene sheet
   and a carbon nanocone are obtained using the continuum model and
   molecular simulations with the MM3 potential. The variations of the
   frequencies from these approaches agree within an error of approximate
   to 5\%. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic composites, a kind of rationally artificial materials, possess
   superior multifunctional properties due to a mixture of materials. In
   this paper, an Isogeometric Topology Optimization (ITO) method is
   proposed for computational design of both the re-entrant and chiral
   auxetic composites in both 2D and 3D. The homogenization is numerically
   implemented using isogeometric analysis (IGA) to predict macroscopic
   effective properties of microstructures, where the periodic boundary
   formulation is imposed. An effective Non-Uniform Rational B-splines
   (NURBS)-based Multi-Material Interpolation (N-MMI) model is applied to
   compute material properties of all points in composite microstructures,
   mainly including the Fields of Design Variables (DVFs), Fields of
   Topology Variables (TVFs), and multi-material interpolation. A unified
   ITO formulation is developed for 2D and 3D auxetic composites, where an
   appropriate objective function with a weight parameter is defined to
   control the generation of different deformation mechanisms. Finally,
   several numerical examples are performed to demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the proposed ITO method, and a series of 2D and 3D
   auxetic composites with the re-entrant and chiral deformation mechanisms
   are found. The optimized composite structures are simulated using ANSYS
   to show the auxetic behavior. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Background Tuberculosis (TB) disease is a common opportunistic infection
   among people living with HIV (PLHIV). WHO recommends at least 6 months
   of isoniazid Preventive Therapy (IPT) to reduce the risk of active TB.
   It is important to monitor the six-month IPT completion since a
   suboptimal dose may not protect PLHIV from TB infection. This study
   determined the six-month IPT completion and factors associated with
   six-month IPT completion among PLHIV aged 15 years or more in Dar es
   Salaam region, Tanzania. Methods Secondary analysis of routine data from
   PLHIV attending 58 care and treatment clinics in Dar es Salaam region
   was used. PLHIV, aged 15 years and above, who screened negative for TB
   symptoms and initiated IPT from January, 2013 to June, 2017 were
   recruited. Modified Poisson regression with robust standard errors was
   used to estimate prevalence ratios (PR) and 95\% confidence interval
   (CI) for factors associated with IPT completion. Multilevel analysis was
   used to account for health facility random effects in order to estimate
   adjusted PR (APR) for factors associated with IPT six-month completion.
   Results A total of 29,382 PLHIV were initiated IPT, with 21,808 (74\%)
   female. Overall 17,092 (58\%) six-month IPT completion, increasing from
   42\% (773/1857) in year 2013 to 76\% (2929/3856) in 2017. Multilevel
   multivariable model accounting for health facilities as clusters, showed
   PLHIV who were not on ART had 46\% lower IPT completion compared to
   those were on ART (APR: 0.54: 95\%CI: 0.45-0.64). There was 37\% lower
   IPT completion among PLHIV who transferred from another clinic (APR:
   0.63: 95\% CI (0.54-0.74) compared to those who did not transfer. PLHIV
   aged 25-34 years had a 6\% lower prevalence of IPT completion as
   compared to those aged 15 to 24 years (APR:0.94 95\%CI:0.89-0.98).
   Conclusion The IPT completion rate in PLHIV increased over time, but
   there was lower IPT completion in PLHIV who transferred from other
   clinics, who were aged 25 to 34 years and those not on ART.
   Interventions to support IPT in these groups are urgently needed.}},

Abstract = {{Auxeticity of materials improves several of their mechanical properties,
   especially shear, impact, and bending resistance. It also improves
   ability of materials to absorb impact energy as well as the overall
   stiffness of structures. In this research, authors examine synclastic
   panels made from novel wood-based composites. The aim is to determine
   the force-displacement characteristics during uniaxial compression and
   obtain the stiffness of the panels. These data allow one to predict the
   behavior of a panel during two-axial bending with different support
   scenarios. Finite element method (FEM) analysis is performed, with the
   use of model material, to determine the impact of varied facings
   thickness as well as different types of materials and core structures,
   on the stiffness of synclastic panels. It is demonstrated that proposed
   multilayer composites allow forming (technologically difficult)
   spherical shapes, without additional heat and pressure treatment. The
   type of an outer layer material strictly determines the usability and
   ease of two-axial bending process. Presented composites are interesting
   materials, that can be adopted into the wood industry as a replacement
   for traditional materials, e.g., bent plywood.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Depression in the elderly population has been identified as
   a significant public health problem associated with adverse outcomes
   such as decreased quality of life, cognitive decline, and increased
   rates of suicide. We aimed to determine the prevalence and factors
   associated with depressive symptoms among geriatric population in Moshi
   district council, northern Tanzania. Methods: This community-based
   cross-sectional study was conducted in Moshi rural district, northern
   Tanzania, between June and July 2019. A multi-stage sampling technique
   was used to recruit 304 elders aged 60 or more years. We used geriatric
   depression scale (GDS-15) to assess depression. Generalized linear model
   with Poisson family and log link function was used to estimate
   prevalence ratio (PR) and the corresponding 95\% confidence intervals
   for factors associated with geriatric depressive symptoms. Results: A
   total of 304 participants were enrolled, the median age (interquartile
   range) 67 (62-75.5 years), and about half (51\%) were females. The
   prevalence of geriatric depressive symptoms was 44.4\%. Elders with a
   self-reported history of cognitive impairment had higher prevalence of
   depressive symptoms (PR = 1.66, 95\%CI 1.16, 2.38) while elders with
   intermediate (PR = 0.56, 95\%CI 0.38, 0.82) and strong social support
   (PR = 0.27, 95\%CI 0.17, 0.44) were less likely to have depressive
   symptoms compared to those with no available social support.
   Conclusions: Nearly one in every two elders had geriatric depressive
   symptoms. Depressive symptoms were associated with self-reported history
   of cognitive impairment and availability of social support. We recommend
   community screening, awareness creation, and social support
   interventions for early identification and management of depressive
   symptoms in this population.}},

Abstract = {{Crash-box is a significant part of automotive passive safety system and
   serves as a main energy absorption device in frontal impact scenario. In
   this paper, a novel crash-box integrating an outer thin-walled tube and
   an inner auxetic cellular core has been designed and comprehensively
   investigated under axial load. The impact simulation of the auxetic
   crash-box has been carried out, and the results show that introduction
   of the auxetic core can improve its energy absorption capacity without
   increasing too much peak impact force. Based on the sensitivity
   analysis, the effects of its geometric parameters on the crashworthiness
   performance have been studied. Finally, collaborative optimization of
   the auxetic crash-box has been performed to simultaneously improve its
   crashworthiness under the low-speed (15 km/h) and high-speed (40 km/h)
   impact cases. In the optimization procedure, the least square support
   vector regression (LS-SVR) method and an improved particle swarm
   optimization (IPSO) algorithm with time-varying coefficients have been
   utilized. The results demonstrate that the optimized crash-box can
   comprehensively improve the energy absorption and impact force
   characteristics effectively. The auxetic crash-box and the collaborative
   optimization approach provide extensive references for the application
   of auxetic structure in vehicle crashworthiness design.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: To identify the frequency of perception and expectations to work in
   the area of primary health care(PHC) as well as their associated factors
   with personnel at five health facilities.
   Method: Cross-sectional study on five health facilities of PHC.
   Perception and expectations to work in PHC were measured, and their
   association with social-work variables was investigated. Simple and
   multiple regression analysis was performed to estimate prevalence ratios
   (PR), using the Poisson family, robust variance and having a health
   facility as a cluster.
   Results: Out of 94 participants, 64.9\% did not have an adequate
   perceptionabout working in the area of PHC. The 60.6\% had an
   expectation to work in PHC 10 years from now. A positive association was
   found between female gender and perception about working in the area of
   PHC (PR = 3.24). There was a negative association between being divorced
   and/or widowed and the expectation to work in PHC (PR: 0.51).
   Conclusions: Perception about working in PHC is low, but more than half
   of the sample expect to work in PHC10 years from now. Being a woman
   increases the prevalence job perception in PHC. Working time over 5
   years was positively associated with having expectations to work in PHC.
   On the contrary, divorced/widowed marital status was negatively

Title = {{Concrete behavior in steel-concrete-steel panels subjected to biaxial
   tension compression}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTIONAL STEEL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{167}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Steel-Concrete-Steel (SCS) composite wall is being used for different
   purposes for its improved performances. Some analytical and finite
   element models have been presented in the past to predict the behavior
   of such walls. In this paper, an attempt is made to develop an iterative
   membrane model to analyze SCS wall panels subjected to in-plane membrane
   forces in the principal directions. The model accounts for the
   post-cracking Poisson effects of concrete as the Zhu/Hsu ratio.
   Individual behaviors of concrete and steel plates in an SCS panel are
   studied in which confinement in principal tensile direction accompanied
   by negative uniaxial tensile strain in concrete is observed. To explain
   this behavior, a detailed perspective for uniaxial strain in principal
   tensile direction is proposed and the conventional stressstrain
   trajectory of concrete in tension is extended to incorporate any
   confinement developed in the concrete. Constitutive law of concrete in
   compression is also modified to incorporate the observed confining
   behavior of the concrete. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   with Negative Poisson's Ratio}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL STABILITY AND DYNAMICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Laminated beams made of nanocomposite materials have been used in many
   industrial sectors. This paper reports a study on the vibration behavior
   of laminated beams when experiencing the large amplitude vibration. The
   beams are made of perfectly bonded carbon nanotube-reinforced composite
   (CNTRC) layers. The novel constructions of CNTRC laminated beams with
   out-of-plane maximum negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) are proposed. The
   volume fraction of CNT may change across the beam thickness which
   results in a piece-wise pattern. The material properties of the CNTRC
   layers are temperature-dependent and can be estimated by the extended
   rule of mixture model. The beams are considered to rest on a
   two-parameter elastic foundation and under differential thermal
   environmental conditions. The higher order shear deformation beam theory
   is applied to derive the motion equations of the nonlinear vibration of
   FG-CNTRC laminated beams. These equations include the influencing
   factors such as the geometrical nonlinearity in the von Karman sense,
   the thermal effects and the beam-foundation interaction. The nonlinear
   vibration solutions can be obtained by employing a two-step perturbation
   approach. The nonlinear vibration characteristics of FG-CNTRC laminated
   beams under different sets of loading conditions and thermal
   environmental conditions are discussed in detail through a series of
   parametric studies. Numerical results show that the NPR has a
   significant effect on the large amplitude vibration characteristics of
   CNTRC laminated beams.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Children undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
   (HSCT) are at high risk for hospital-associated bloodstream infections
   (HA-BSIs). This study aimed to describe the incidence, microbiology, and
   risk factors for HA-BSI in pediatric HSCT recipients.
   Methods. We performed a single-center retrospective cohort study of
   children and adolescents (<18 years of age) who underwent HSCT over a
   20-year period (1997-2016). We determined the incidence and case
   fatality rate of HA-BSI by causative organism. We used multivariable
   Poisson regression to identify risk factors for HA-BSI.
   Results. Of 1294 patients, the majority (86\%) received an allogeneic
   HSCT, most commonly with umbilical cord blood (63\%). During the initial
   HSCT hospitalization, 334 HA-BSIs occurred among 261 (20\%) patients.
   These were classified as gram-positive bacterial (46\%), gram-negative
   bacterial (24\%), fungal (12\%), mycobacterial (<1\%), or polymicrobial
   (19\%). During the study period, there was a decline in the cumulative
   incidence of HA-BSI (P = .021) and, specifically, fungal HA-BSIs (P =
   .002). In multivariable analyses, older age (incidence rate ratio
   {[}IRR], 1.03; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI], 1.01-1.06), umbilical
   cord blood donor source (vs bone marrow; IRR, 1.69; 95\% CI, 1.19-2.40),
   and nonmyeloablative conditioning (vs myeloablative; IRR, 1.85; 95\% CI,
   1.21-2.82) were associated with a higher risk of HA-BSIs. The case
   fatality rate was higher for fungal HA-BSI than other HA-BSI categories
   (21\% vs 6\%; P = .002).
   Conclusions. Over the past 2 decades, the incidence of HA-BSIs has
   declined among pediatric HSCT recipients at our institution. Older age,
   umbilical cord blood donor source, and nonmyeloablative conditioning
   regimens are independent risk factors for HA-BSI among children
   undergoing HSCT.}},

   constants is determined against the various cell geometry parameters.
   Good agreement between the analytical and numerical simulations is
   observed. We show that the specific curved wall honeycomb configuration
   proposed in this paper possesses a high in-plane shear compliance,
   tailored anisotropy and the possibility of inducing a negative Poisson's
   ratio behaviour in baseline honeycomb configurations that would have
   otherwise positive in-plane Poisson's ratios.}},

Title = {{A novel star auxetic honeycomb with enhanced in-plane crushing strength}},
Journal = {{THIN-WALLED STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{149}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic honeycombs exhibit low weight, shear stiffness, and excellent
   energy absorption capacity and thus have great potential for achieving
   the requirements of crashworthiness and lightweight in automotive
   fields. This work presents a novel auxetic structure called the
   star-triangular honeycomb (STH), in which the horizontal and vertical
   ligaments of the star honeycombs (SH) are replaced with triangular
   structures. The dynamic crushing behaviors of the STH under three
   different crushing velocities were investigated using 1D shock theory.
   The results show that the STH has a more obvious negative Poisson's
   ratio effect than the SH and that transverse contraction mainly occurs
   in the first plateau stage. Theoretical models were deduced based on the
   collapse mechanism of the typical unit revealed by numerical simulation
   for STH crushing strength prediction. The theoretical predictions agreed
   well with the simulation results, and two different plateau stresses
   appeared under low-velocity crushing. In addition, the influences of the
   STH geometric parameters and crushing velocity on the energy-absorbing
   capacity and densification strain were systematically explored. The
   parameter analysis indicated that the effects of the cell-wall thickness
   and incline angle on the dynamic response and energy absorption capacity
   of the STH under low-and medium-velocity crushing are more significant
   than those under high-velocity crushing. Moreover, the STH showed better
   energy absorption capacity than the SH. Thus, this design is expected to
   provide a novel means of improving the mechanical properties of
   honeycombs.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES: Our goals for this study were to characterize the frequency
   of agitation in patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) admitted to
   an inpatient pediatric medical unit and to identify risk factors
   associated with agitation.
   METHODS: Through a retrospective chart review, we identified every
   patient between 8 and 19 years of age with a documented ASD diagnosis
   admitted to a pediatric medical unit over a 5-year period. We performed
   a detailed review of each admission, with a focus on factors
   hypothesized to be correlated with risk of agitation.
   RESULTS: One or more episode of agitation occurred during 37 (12.4\%) of
   the 299 admissions and for 31 (18.5\%) of the 168 patients who met
   inclusion criteria. History of agitation (risk ratio 21.9 {[}95\%
   confidence interval 5.4-88.3] for history of severe agitation; P < .001)
   and documented sensory sensitivities (risk ratio 2.3 {[}95\% confidence
   interval 1.3-3.8]; P < .001) were associated with a significantly
   increased risk of agitation during admission. History of past
   psychiatric admissions was associated with increased risk before, but
   not after, controlling for history of agitation and sensory
   sensitivities. Psychiatric comorbidity, intellectual disability, acute
   pain on admission, number of preadmission psychotropic medications,
   Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition
   ASD diagnosis, age, and sex were not significantly associated with
   increased risk.
   CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalization can be challenging for patients with ASD. A
   subset of these patients experience episodes of agitation during
   admission, posing a safety risk to patients and staff. Characterizing
   risk factors associated with these behaviors may allow for
   identification of at-risk patients and guide targeted intervention to
   prevent negative behavioral outcomes.}},

Journal = {{EXTREME MECHANICS LETTERS}},

Abstract = {{Implementation of multiple functions on the metamaterials can greatly
   broaden their potential application. Origami-based metamaterials, whose
   buck properties can be manipulated by tuning the specific folding angle,
   have currently become a supplemental method for conventional
   reconfigurable metadevices. Approaching kirigami with transformable
   features and idea of a functional metastructure, this paper numerically
   and experimentally investigates a multifunctional electromagnetic
   response with mechanically programmable characteristic based on an
   auxetic kirigami pattern in gigahertz frequency regime. The metamaterial
   unit cell has 2-dimensional (2D) five meta pixels. Each 2D meta-pixel
   can be transformed to the 3-dimensional (3D) meta-pixel and it is coded
   by ternary number (-1, 0, +1) for different folding levels. The kirigami
   pattern provides five transformable tessellations corresponding to five
   distinct functions of electromagnetic reflector, band-pass filter and
   polarization-selectable absorbers. The performance of the proposed
   programmable multifunctional metamaterial is numerically and
   experimentally demonstrated. This study can motivate the realization of
   kirigami computing, code-driven multifunctional metastructures. (c) 2020

Abstract = {{It has been few years since the preliminary translational research study
   on mechanics performance of autologous pulmonary tissue were published
   to circumvent complication relies to SVD. Several studies reported the
   modification of pulmonary native autograft root subjected to dynamic
   stress strain in long-term outcomes of aortic valve replacement. Our
   multidisciplinary research team firstly describe the weave relationship
   between stress-strain, growth and remodelling in an experimental model
   of Ross Operation. From a biomechanical point of view, the rapid
   absorption of polydioxanone constituting the internal part of the device
   may limit the potential negative effect of excessive stretching and
   improvement of steeper curve in the circumferential response.
   Improvement of longitudinal stretching of pulmonary autograft by
   external component of device are indicative of auxetic effect of e-PTFE.
   Successful reinforcement with semiresorbable device can also be
   favourable to pulmonary autograft function in growing patients needing
   to match somatic growth. The attendant decrease in PA expansion and the
   preserved features of the valve leaflets enhances durability of Ross
   operation. Strengthening of the distal pulmonary root anastomosis using
   external reinforcement, modifying the ascending phase of the
   circumferential stress curve, might be advisable as previously
   described. PA is an ideal substitute for aortic valve replacement not
   only in Mr. Ross's dreams but also from the biomechanical point of view.}},

Abstract = {{The electrical response of an electrolytic cell to an external ac
   excitation is analysed by solving the equations of the
   Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) continuum model for two ions (ambipolar) and
   one mobile ion diffusive systems. The theoretical predictions of the
   ambipolar system, formed by positive ions of mobility mu(p) and negative
   ions of mobility mu(m), are investigated in the limit in which one of
   the mobilities goes to zero. The analysis reveals that these predictions
   correspond to the ones arising from the one mobile ion diffusive system
   only in the frequency range omega >> omega(D)mu(m)/mu(p), in which
   omega(D) is the Debye's frequency. For very low frequencies, it shows
   that the physical system formed by two mobile ions, one of which has a
   very low mobility, is clearly distinct from the physical system in which
   just one of the ions is mobile. We argue that apparent deviations of the
   experimental spectra from the predictions of the PNP model in the low

   connected with the difference in the diffusion coefficients of cations

Abstract = {{The design and construction of 3D architectures enabled by
   stimuli-responsive soft materials can yield novel functionalities for
   next generation soft-bodied actuating devices. Apart from additive
   manufacturing processes, origami inspired technology offers an
   alternative approach to fabricate 3D actuators from planar materials.
   Here we report a class of near-infrared (NIR) responsive 3D active
   origamis that deploy, actuate and transform between multistable
   structural equilibria. By exploiting the nonlinear coefficient of
   thermal expansion (CTE) of graphene oxide (GO), graphene oxide/ethylene
   cellulose (GO/EC) bilayers are readily fabricated to deliver precise
   origami structure control, and rapid low-temperature-triggered
   photothermal actuation. Complexity in 3D shapes is produced through
   heterogeneously patterning GO domains on 2D EC thin films, which allows
   us to customize 3D architectures that adapt to various robotic
   functions. The strategy also enables the construction of material
   systems possessing naturally inaccessible properties, such as remotely
   controlled mechanical metamaterials with auxetic behavior and bionic
   flowers with a rapid blooming rate. Harnessing deformability with
   multiple degrees of freedom (DOF) upon light irradiation, this work
   leads to breakthroughs in the design and implementation of

Abstract = {{Our aim is to estimate regional mechanical properties of the annulus
   fibrosus (AF) using a multi-relaxation tensile test and to examine the
   relevance of using the transverse dilatations in the identification
   procedure. We collected twenty traction specimens from both outer (n =
   10) and inner (n = 10) sites of the anterior quadrant of the annulus
   fibmsus of one pig spine. A 1-h multi-relaxation tensile test in the
   circumferential direction allowed us to measure the force in the
   direction of traction and the dilatations in all three directions. We
   performed a specific-sample finite element inverse analysis to identify
   variations, along the radial position, of material and structural
   parameters of a hyperelastic compressible and anisotropic constitutive
   law. Our experimental results reveal that the outer sites are subjected
   to a significantly greater stress than the inner sites and that both
   sites exhibit an auxetic behavior. Our numerical results suggest that
   the inhomogeneous behavior arises from significant variations of the
   fiber angle taken into account within the hyperelastic constitutive law.
   In addition, we found that the use of the measured transverse
   dilatations in the identification procedure had a strong impact on the
   identified mechanical parameters. This pilot study suggests that, in
   quasi-static conditions, the annulus fibrosus may be modeled by a
   hyperelastic compressible and anisotropic law with a fiber angle
   gradient from inner to outer periphery.}},

Title = {{Mechanical performance of auxetic meta-biomaterials}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICAL BEHAVIOR OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS}},

Abstract = {{The innovative design of orthopedic implants could play an important
   role in the development of life-lasting implants, by improving both
   primary and secondary implant fixations. The concept of
   meta-biomaterials aims to achieve a unique combination of mechanical,
   mass transport, and biological properties through optimized topological
   design of additively manufactured (AM) porous biomaterials. In this
   study, we primarily focused on a specific class of meta-biomaterials,
   namely auxetic meta-biomaterials. Their extraordinary behavior of
   lateral expansion in response to axial tension could potentially improve
   implant-bone contact in certain orthopedic applications. In this work, a
   multitude of auxetic meta-biomaterials were rationally designed and
   printed from Ti-6Al-4V using a commercially available laser powder bed
   fusion process called selective laser melting. The reentrant hexagonal
   honeycomb unit cell was used as a starting point, which was then
   parametrically tuned to obtain a variety of mechanical and morphological
   properties. In this two-step study, the morphology and quasistatic
   properties of the developed meta-biomaterials were assessed using
   mechanical experiments accompanied with full-field strain measurements
   using digital image correlation. In addition, all our designs were
   computationally modelled using the finite element method. Our results
   showed the limits of the AM processes for the production of auxetic
   meta-biomaterials in terms of which values of the design parameters
   (e.g., re-entrant angle, relative density, and aspect ratio) could be
   successfully manufactured. We also found that the AM process itself
   imparts significant influence on the morphological and mechanical
   properties of the resulting auxetic metabiomaterials. This further
   highlights the importance of experimental studies to determine the
   actual mechanical properties of such metamaterials. The elastic modulus
   and strength of many of our designs fell within the range of those
   reported for both trabecular and cortical bone. Unprecedented properties
   like these could be used to simultaneously address the different
   challenges faced in the mechanical design of orthopedic implants.}},

Title = {{A two-part mixed-effects model for analyzing clustered time-to-event
   data with clumping at zero}},
Journal = {{COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{187}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Background and Objective: In longitudinal epidemiological studies
   consisting of a baseline stage and a follow-up stage, observations at
   the baseline stage may contain a countable proportion of negative
   responses. The time-to-event outcomes of those observations
   corresponding to negative responses at baseline can be denoted as zeros,
   which are excluded from standard survival analysis. Consequently, some
   important information on these subjects is therefore lost in the
   analysis. Furthermore, subjects are often clustered within hospitals,
   communities or health service centers, resulting in correlated
   observations. The framework of the two-part model has been developed and
   utilized widely to analyze semi-continuous data or count data with
   excess zeros, but its application to clustered time-to-event data with
   clumping at zero remains sparse.
   Methods: A two-part mixed-effects modeling approach was proposed. A
   logistic mixed-effects regression model was used in the first part to
   determine factors associated with the prevalence of the baseline event
   of interest. Parametric frailty models (including Weibull, exponential,
   log-logistic and log-normal) were used in the second part to assess
   associations between exposures and time-to-event outcomes. Correlated
   random effects were incorporated within the two regression models to
   accommodate the inherent correlation within each clustering unit and the
   correlation between the two parts. As an illustrative example, the
   method was applied to exclusive breastfeeding data from a
   community-based prospective cohort study in Nepal.
   Results: A significantly positive correlation between the baseline
   prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding and exclusive breastfeeding
   duration was confirmed (rho =0.67 , P < 0.001). The correlated two-part
   model outperformed the independent two-part model (likelihood ratio test
   statistic =8.6, df =1, P= 0.003).
   Conclusions: The proposed approach makes full use of all available
   information at baseline and during the follow-up, compared to the
   conventional survival analysis. In addition to breastfeeding studies,
   the method can be applied to other research areas where clustered
   time-to-event data with clumping at zero arise. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {{Enhanced hexa-missing rib auxetics for achieving targeted constant NPR
   and in-plane isotropy at finite deformation}},
Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The standard hexa-missing rib structure (i.e. missing rib structure with
   six zigzag ligaments) exhibits in-plane isotropy at small deformation,
   and has a relatively constant negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) over a
   finite deformation range. However, its auxeticity is relatively low, and
   the in-plane isotropy effect degrades rapidly with deformation. The
   present work aims to improve these two mechanical properties over a
   large deformation range, without significantly compromising the
   deformation range with constant NPR as well as the overall stiffness.
   First, the deformation mechanisms underlying a standard hexa-missing rib
   structure is elaborated. To enhance the auxeticity effect and to delay
   the loss of in-plane isotropy, an enhanced design with honeycomb
   reinforcement between the ligaments is proposed. By changing the size of
   the honeycomb reinforcement, the enhanced design is able to achieve
   tunable constant NPR ranging from -0.2 to -1.0 over a large deformation
   range, and yet maintaining its in-plane isotropy. Moreover, these
   enhanced properties are achieved without compromising the overall
   stiffness of the structure. Depending on the nature of engineering
   applications, the deformation range with a constant NPR can be further
   extended if desired, by having wavy connecting ligaments in the enhanced
   design. For the latter design, the structure is more compliant than the
   base design. It is shown that the target enhanced properties can be
   achieved over a large deformation range using linear elastic or
   nonlinear base materials.}},

Title = {{Mechanics of beams made from chiral metamaterials: Tuning deflections
   through normal-shear strain couplings}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{189}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{In the current work, we demonstrate the potential of structures made of
   chiral artificial materials to balance bending loads through tensile
   loads, exploiting their inner normal to shear strain coupling. To that
   scope, we employ beam structures which we architecture with tetrachiral
   unit-cells. For the latter, we quantify their inherently coupled normal
   to shear strain behavior, making use of homogenization analysis
   techniques. We subsequently derive the equations that characterize the
   bending mechanics of beams with an inner bending to normal loading
   coupling, starting from first principles. Thereupon, we compute the
   normal forces required to equilibrate the effect of bending loads on
   beam structures, providing relevant closed-form parametric expressions.
   Using the derived analytical formulas, we carry out both numerical
   simulations and experiments for the case of cantilever beams. Results
   suggest that the coupling of normal and shear deformations can be used
   as a primal load-balancing mechanism, providing new possibilities in the
   control of the artificial structure's kinematics and overall mechanics.

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel three-dimensional (3D) unit cell structure with
   butterfly-like perforations was designed, and negative Poisson's ratio
   and tunable stiffness were achieved in such a geometry. The Poisson's
   ratio and strain-stress relationship of structures with different
   geometric parameters were determined using the finite element method
   (FEM). Samples with identical geometric variables to those of finite
   element models were fabricated via 3D printing technique, and their
   Poisson's ratios and stress-strain relationships were experimentally
   determined and compared with the FEM results. Results showed that the
   proposed 3D cellular structures exhibit negative Poisson's ratios, and a
   minimal value of -0.7091 could be reached. The stress-strain curve of
   each structure exhibited three distinct stages (elastic response, rib
   buckling and self-contact), with different elastic moduli being observed
   at each stage, and demonstrated a tunable range of the compressive
   stiffness ratio between stages varying from 0.1866 to 1.4006(tunable
   stiffness), as determined by FEM analysis. Good agreement was found
   between the experimental results and FEM predictions. The design concept
   can be implemented and optimized for specific applications via geometric
   parameters manipulation.}},

Title = {{Auxetic graphene oxide-porous foam for acoustic wave and shock energy
   dissipation}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITES PART B-ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{186}},
Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic cellular structures have garnered huge research interest as a
   candidate for energy absorption due to their appealing features,
   including extremely high indentation resistance and fracture resistance.
   However, auxetic foams reported so far typically can only sustain a very
   limited loading force and impact with a counter-intuitive behavior.
   Here, we report a highly efficient sound and shock absorber based on
   three-dimensional (3D) auxetic foam with two-dimensional (2D) wrinkled
   graphene oxide. Compared with pure polyurethane foam, the auxetic
   heterostructured polyurethane foam interconnected with 2D corrugated
   graphene oxide shows a sound absorbing capacity of 99.7\% at a frequency
   of 2,236 Hz and a shock energy absorbing time of 189\% during the impact
   loading. The synergistic effects between 3D auxetic foam and 2D wrinkled
   graphene oxide result in stable compressive cycling performance, more
   indentation resistance, and more energy dissipation during local impact
   loads. This 3D engineered auxetic porous structure with 2D crumpled
   graphene oxide provides a new and cost-effective strategy to effectively
   absorb acoustic and shock energy.}},

Title = {{Electronically tunable auxetic behavior of shunted piezoelectric
   elements}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICS AND PHYSICS OF SOLIDS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{137}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{This work demonstrates auxetic behavior in a solid polycrystalline
   shunted piezoelectric cube. Piezoelectric elements are commonly bonded
   to structures to reduce vibrations by tuning an attached shunt circuit
   to resonate at the same frequency as the mechanical vibrations in the
   structure. Literature has provided an extensive analysis of vibration
   suppression in passively shunted piezoelectric systems, but in practice,
   the three-dimensional constitutive equations are almost always reduced
   to one-dimensional stresses and strains within the piezoelectric. In
   this work, resistive inductive shunt circuits are applied to the
   electrical terminals of a harmonically forced piezoelectric cube, and
   the directional displacements are determined in all three dimensions
   when it is loaded parallel and perpendicular to the poling direction, as
   well as dilatationally. By comparing these directional displacements,
   the effect of the shunt circuit on Poisson's ratio can be measured. It
   is demonstrated that an inductive shunt leads to a complex Poisson's
   ratio with a real part approaching positive and negative infinity over a
   discrete band of frequencies, implying that a polycrystalline
   piezoelectric cube can become auxetic through the application of a
   properly engineered shunt circuit. The auxetic behavior is explored
   through finite element modeling, and the derivation of analytical
   expressions for Poisson's ratio in shunted piezoelectric elements.

Abstract = {{Objective The present cross-sectional study evaluated the quality of
   life of patients treated with 3-D conformal radiotherapy for cancer of
   the mouth, oropharynx, hypopharynx, or larynx and investigated possible
   associations with clinical and sociodemographic variables using
   multivariate analysis. Methods The sample was composed of 90 patients
   who had completed treatment at least 3 months earlier. Data were
   collected from April 2016 to May 2017. The patients were clinically
   evaluated with regard to stimulated salivary flow, trismus, and
   radiation caries. Sociodemographic data and data related to the disease
   (stage, location of primary tumor, and radiation dose) were collected
   from the patient charts. Quality of life was assessed using the
   Brazilian version of the University of Washington Quality of Life
   (UW-QOL) questionnaire. Poisson logistic regression was performed to
   determine the mean ratio and test associations with the clinical and
   sociodemographic variables. Results The mean total of the UW-QOL was
   814.88 (+/- 224.58). Patient age, staging of cancer, hyposalivation, and
   trismus were associated with quality of life. Patients with tumors in
   the advanced stage, those with hyposalivation and those with trismus
   respectively had 11\% (CI 0.80-0.98), 12\% (CI 0.79-0.99), and 15\% (CI
   0.77-0.94) lower UW-QOL scores, indicating poorer quality of life.
   Conclusion Survivors of head and neck cancer experience a negative
   impact on quality of life associated with trismus, hyposalivation,
   advanced stage tumors, and a younger patient age. The present findings
   underscore the importance of a specific approach focused on these
   aspects to ensure better quality of life in the long term.}},

Volume = {{237}},
Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, an investigation on the postbuckling behavior of sandwich
   plates with functionally graded (FG) auxetic 3D lattice core is
   presented. Firstly, an auxetic 3D lattice metamaterial is designed and
   analyzed, of which all six effective Poisson's ratios (EPRs) are
   negative, and the in-plane negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) property can
   enhance the structural buckling capacity. For the first time, two
   symmetric FG configurations of the auxetic 3D lattice core through the
   plate thickness direction are proposed, and compared with the uniform
   distribution case. Two kinds of compressive postbuckling due to in-plane
   uni-axial or bi-axial compression, and thermal postbuckling under
   uniform temperature rise are taken into account. In the current study,
   full-scale FE modelling and nonlinear analysis are carried out, in which
   the constituent materials possess temperature-dependent properties. The
   results of comparison study show that the compressive buckling and
   thermal postbuckling loads of sandwich plates with NPR core are
   remarkably higher than those of their counterparts having the 3D lattice
   core with positive EPR. Parametric studies are further performed to
   demonstrate the effects of functionally graded configurations,
   temperature changes, load-proportional parameters and plate aspect
   ratios on the postbuckling load-deflection curves, along with the
   EPR-deflection curves in the large deflection region.}},

   homogenization method (EBHM) is applied to evaluate the material
   effective properties based on the topology of the material cell, where
   the effective elasticity property is evaluated by the average stress and
   strain theorems. Secondly, a parametric level set method (PLSM) is
   employed to optimize the microstructural topology until the specific
   mechanical properties can be achieved, including the maximum bulk
   modulus, the maximum shear modulus and their combinations, as well as
   the negative Poisson's ratio (NPR). The complicated topological shape
   optimization of the material microstructure has been equivalent to
   evolve the sizes of the expansion coefficients in the interpolation of
   the level set function. Finally, several numerical examples are fully
   discussed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed method. A
   series of new and interesting material cells with the specific
   mechanical properties can be found.}},

Abstract = {{Negative and near-zero Poisson's ratio materials are mechanical
   metamaterials that host an improved strain energy absorption property
   with respect to conventional materials. By using first-principles
   calculations, we report the negative and near-zero Poisson's ratios in
   van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures, such as graphene/hexagonal
   molybdenum disulfide (G/MoS2) and graphene/hexagonal boron nitride
   (G/h-BN), sharing distinct crystal structures from all other known
   negative and near-zero Poisson's ratio materials. However, the Poisson's
   ratios of the interfacial layer in bilayer MoS2 and h-BN are positive
   and near-zero along the out-of-plane direction, respectively, which are
   quite different from the Poisson's ratios of G/MoS2 and G/h-BN
   heterostructures. Therefore, these behaviors are unique to vdW
   heterostructures. We attribute these negative Poisson's ratio behaviors
   to the special interaction of p(z) orbitals between the interfacial
   layers. Furthermore, we observed among them high-order elastic constants
   in the out-of-plane direction, which exhibit nonlinear stress-strain
   responses. These results are significant for the preparation of G/h-BN
   and G/MoS2 heterostructures. The combinations of tunable
   negative/near-zero Poisson's ratios with the excellent
   electrical/optical properties of G/MoS2 and G/h-BN heterostructures will
   pave the way to a wide range of applications in novel auxetic molecular
   sieves and electrodes.}},

Abstract = {{After the breakthrough of the study on the two-dimensional (2D) layered
   phosphorus, group-V elemental ultrathin 2D layers have captured
   considerable attentions in recent years on account of their unique and
   promising electrical transport properties, including semiconductor
   features with direct and desirable energy band structures, outstanding
   carrier mobilities, controllable and tunable characteristics under
   applied strain, electric and magnetic fields, highly anisotropic
   phenomena along both in-plane and out-plane directions, topological
   transmission states, and negative Poisson's ratio. Accordingly, a number
   of investigations on this family of 2D materials have been conducting
   rapidly, while initiating great potential and new opportunities on the
   nanoscale science and applications in optoelectronic,
   magneto-electronics, thermo-electronic, ferroelectric, topological

   systematical summarizations and refinements on the recent advances of
   the electrical transport in group-V elemental ultrathin 2D layers from
   the blossoming field of research, while comprehensive discussion and
   some recommendations are put forward, with an expectation of broadening

Title = {{Auxetic Tetrahex Carbon with Ultrahigh Strength and a Direct Band Gap}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 26}},
Abstract = {{Tetrahex carbon is a recently predicted two-dimensional (2D) carbon
   allotrope that is composed of tetragonal and hexagonal rings. Unlike
   flat graphene, this new 2D carbon structure is buckled and possesses a
   direct band gap of approximately 2.6 eV and a high carrier mobility of
   approximately 10(4)cm(2)/(Vs) with anisotropic features. In this work,
   we employ first-principles density-functional theory calculations to
   explore the mechanical properties of tetrahex C under uniaxial tensile
   strain. We find that tetrahex C demonstrates ultrahigh ideal strength,
   outperforming both graphene and pentagraphene. It shows superior
   ductility and sustains uniaxial tensile strain up to 20\% (16\%) until
   phonon instability occurs and the corresponding maximal strength is 38.3
   N/m (37.8 N/m) in the zigzag (armchair) direction. It shows an
   intrinsically negative Poisson ratio. This exotic in-plane Poisson ratio
   takes place when the axial strain reaches a threshold value of 7\% (5\%)
   in the zigzag (armchair) direction. We also find that tetrahex C
   maintains a direct band gap of 2.64 eV at the center of the Brillouin
   zone. This direct-gap feature remains intact upon strain application,
   with no direct-indirect gap transition. The ultrahigh ideal strength,
   the negative Poisson ratio, and the integrity of the direct gap under
   strain in tetrahex C suggest that it may have potential applications in
   nanomechanics and nanoelectronics.}},

Abstract = {{The characterization of the mechanical properties of crystalline
   materials is nowadays considered a routine computational task in DFT
   calculations. However, its high computational cost still prevents it
   from being used in high-throughput screening methodologies, where a
   cheaper estimate of the elastic properties of a material is required. In
   this work, we have investigated the accuracy of force field calculations
   for the prediction of mechanical properties and, in particular, for the
   characterization of the directional Poisson's ratio. We analyze the
   behavior of about 600 000 hypothetical zeolitic structures at the
   classical level (a scale 3 orders of magnitude larger than previous
   studies), to highlight generic trends between mechanical properties and
   energetic stability. By comparing these results with DFT calculations on
   991 zeolitic frameworks, we highlight the limitations of force field
   predictions, in particular for predicting auxeticity. We then used this
   reference DFT data as a training set for a machine learning algorithm,
   showing that it offers a way to build fast and reliable predictive
   models for anisotropic properties. The accuracies obtained are, in
   particular, much better than the current ``cheap{''} approach for
   screening, which is the use of force fields. These results are a
   significant improvement over the previous work, due to the more
   difficult nature of the properties studied, namely, the anisotropic
   elastic response. It is also the first time such a large training data
   set is used for zeolitic materials.}},

Abstract = {{In structural design optimization involving transient responses, time
   integration scheme plays a crucial role in sensitivity analysis because
   it affects the accuracy and stability of transient analysis. In this
   work, the influence of time integration scheme is studied numerically
   for the adjoint shape sensitivity analysis of two benchmark transient
   heat conduction problems within the framework of isogeometric analysis.
   It is found that (i) the explicit approach (beta = 0) and semi-implicit
   approach with beta < 0.5 impose a strict stability condition of the
   transient analysis; (ii) the implicit approach (beta = 1) and
   semi-implicit approach with beta > 0.5 are generally preferred for their
   unconditional stability; and (iii) Crank-Nicolson type approach (beta=
   0.5) may induce a large error for large time-step sizes due to the
   oscillatory solutions. The numerical results also show that the
   time-step size does not have to be chosen to satisfy the critical
   conditions for all of the eigen-frequencies. It is recommended to use
   beta approximate to 0.75 for unconditional stability, such that the
   oscillation condition is much less critical than the Crank-Nicolson
   scheme, and the accuracy is higher than a fully implicit approach.}},

Journal = {{LANCET}},

Volume = {{395}},
Number = {{10228}},

Month = {{MAR 21}},
Abstract = {{Background Tens of millions of children are exposed to Mycobacterium
   tuberculosis globally every year; however, there are no contemporary
   estimates of the risk of developing tuberculosis in exposed children.
   The effectiveness of contact investigations and preventive therapy
   remains poorly understood.
   Methods In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we investigated the
   development of tuberculosis in children closely exposed to a
   tuberculosis case and followed for incident disease. We restricted our
   search to cohort studies published between Jan 1, 1998, and April 6,
   2018, in MEDLINE, Web of Science, BIOSIS, and Embase electronic
   databases. Individual-participant data and a pre-specified list of
   variables were requested from authors of all eligible studies. These
   included characteristics of the exposed child, the index case, and
   environmental characteristics. To be eligible for inclusion in the final
   analysis, a dataset needed to include: (1) individuals below 19 years of
   age; (2) follow-up for tuberculosis for a minimum of 6 months; (3)
   individuals with household or close exposure to an individual with
   tuberculosis; (4) information on the age and sex of the child; and (5)
   start and end follow-up dates. Studies assessing incident tuberculosis
   but without dates or time of follow-up were excluded. Our analysis had
   two primary aims: (1) estimating the risk of developing tuberculosis by
   time-period of follow-up, demographics (age, region), and clinical
   attributes (HIV, tuberculosis infection status, previous tuberculosis);
   and (2) estimating the effectiveness of preventive therapy and BCG
   vaccination on the risk of developing tuberculosis. We estimated the
   odds of prevalent tuberculosis with mixed-effects logistic models and
   estimated adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for incident tuberculosis with
   mixed-effects Poisson regression models. The effectiveness of preventive
   therapy against incident tuberculosis was estimated through propensity
   score matching. The study protocol is registered with PROSPERO
   (CRD42018087022).
   Findings In total, study groups from 46 cohort studies in 34
   countries-29 (63\%) prospective studies and 17 (37\%)
   retrospective-agreed to share their data and were included in the final
   analysis. 137 647 tuberculosis-exposed children were evaluated at
   baseline and 130 512 children were followed for 429 538 person-years,
   during which 1299 prevalent and 999 incident tuberculosis cases were
   diagnosed. Children not receiving preventive therapy with a positive
   result for tuberculosis infection had significantly higher 2-year
   cumulative tuberculosis incidence than children with a negative result
   for tuberculosis infection, and this incidence was greatest among
   children below 5 years of age (19.0\% {[}95\% CI 8.4-37.4]). The
   effectiveness of preventive therapy was 63\% (adjusted HR 0.37 {[}95\%
   CI 0.30-0.47]) among all exposed children, and 91\% (adjusted HR 0.09
   {[}0.05-0.15]) among those with a positive result for tuberculosis
   infection. Among all children <5 years of age who developed
   tuberculosis, 83\% were diagnosed within 90 days of the baseline visit.
   Interpretation The risk of developing tuberculosis among exposed infants
   and young children is very high. Most cases occurred within weeks of
   contact investigation initiation and might not be preventable through
   prophylaxis. This suggests that alternative strategies for prevention
   are needed, such as earlier initiation of preventive therapy through
   rapid diagnosis of adult cases or community-wide screening approaches.

Abstract = {{Orthopedic bone plates are most commonly used for bone fracture fixation
   for more than 100 years. The bone plate design had evolved over time
   overcoming many challenges such as insufficient strength and excessive
   plate-bone contact affecting the blood circulation. However, it is only
   made of two materials, either stainless steel (AISI 316L) or titanium
   (Ti-6Al-4V). There are two main limitations of metallic bone implants,
   namely stress shielding and the problem of malocclusion caused by the
   displacement of the fracture site during healing. To overcome the two
   problems, a new bone plate design with the incorporation of auxetic
   structures is proposed in this work. This study aims to use auxetic
   structure section in the bone plate that would decrease the stiffness of
   the region, thereby mitigating the stress-shielding effect and at the
   same time act as a deformable section to enable intra-operative bending
   for effective alignment while having enough bending strength and
   stiffness. Two different auxetic structures namely re-entrant honeycomb
   and missing rib structures were considered. The auxetic structure
   incorporated bone plates were designed, finite element analysis was
   done, fabricated using direct metal laser sintering technique, and
   tested. The results indicate that the re-entrant honeycomb structure
   incorporated bone plates serve as an effective bone design compared to
   the conventional bone plate design, in terms of stress shielding and
   intra-operative bending while offering similar mechanical and bending
   strength.}},

Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, a theoretical model is proposed to predict the initial
   failure location and the failure progression of the lattice structures
   made from the elastic-brittle bulk materials. The effects of size and
   topology on the tensile failure behavior of multiple representative
   lattice structures (2D auxetic, 2D diamond, 2D triangularl and 2D
   triangular2), under various geometry design conditions (including cell
   topology, cell size and number of unit cells), are systematically
   investigated through the proposed analytical model. From the results, it
   was shown that the 2D bending-dominated structures with lower nodal
   connectivity (number of struts that meet in joints) (2D auxetic and 2D
   diamond) exhibited a relatively progressive crack propagation pattern,
   while the 2D stretching-dominated structures with higher nodal
   connectivity (2D triangularl and 2D triangular2) appear to exhibit
   rather catastrophic brittle fracture failure. During the failure
   fracture propagation, the energy absorption of the 2D
   stretching-dominated structures were significantly higher than that of
   the 2D bending-dominated structures. Moreover, for all lattice designs,
   the tensile failure behaviors tend to converge to more consistent
   patterns when the unit cell numbers increase beyond certain limitations.}},

   beams with negative Poisson's ratio resting on the Pasternak foundation}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{207}},
Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{Nanocomposite materials, such as carbon nanotube-reinforced composites
   (CNTRCs), have emerged as a novel engineering material. They have
   received growing attentions in various engineering sectors. The
   fabrication process has also offered the possibility to design and make
   this type of material to have desired features, such as being
   functionally graded (FG) or/and having negative Poison's ratio. This
   paper reports an investigation on the nonlinear flexural behavior of
   auxetic laminated beams with each layer is made of CNTRC. Each layer may
   have different CNT volume fractions and the functional grading occurs in
   the thickness direction of the beam in the piece-wise pattern. The
   extended rule of mixture model is used to evaluate the
   temperature-dependent material properties of CNTRCs. The governing
   equations for the nonlinear bending of FG-CNTRC laminated beams are
   derived based on the high order shear deformation beam theory. These
   equations include the geometrical nonlinearity in the von Karman sense
   and take into account the thermal effect and the beam-foundation
   interaction. The nonlinear bending solutions can be obtained by
   employing a two-step perturbation approach. The nonlinear flexural
   responses of FG-CNTRC laminated beams under a uniform pressure in
   thermal environments are revealed and examined in details through a
   parametric study. Results showed that the negative Poisson's ratio has a
   significant impact on the nonlinear flexural behavior of CNTRC laminated
   beams.}},

   negative Poisson's ratios: Mechanisms and design}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{236}},
Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{This study investigates the compressive responses and mechanisms of
   perforated structures made of pure nylon polymer (NP) and short carbon
   fibre reinforced nylon polymer (SCF/NP) with negative Poisson's ratio
   (NPR), and proposes an improved lightweight auxetic structure. A
   theoretical analysis is performed for predicting the Poisson's ratios of
   perforated auxetic structures, and validated experimentally. A
   comparison between conventional and auxetic perforated structures under
   compression shows that the SCF/NP specimens have higher stiffness than
   the NP structures and the auxetic structure can reach a NPR of about -1.
   The effects of perforation geometry and material type on the mechanical
   properties are investigated. Results depict a decrease in nominal stress
   with an increase in the perforation gap, but the perforation gap
   increase leads to enhancement of relative density, effective strain and
   average Poisson's ratio. Further, SCF/NP structures have advantages over
   NP structures due to their higher effective strain, effective specific
   energy absorption (SEA) and relative Young's modulus. Subsequently, an
   improved auxetic structure is designed, and a comparative study between
   the designed structure and two common auxetic structures (with the same
   relative density of 0.32) shows that the designed auxetic structures
   have the highest SEA and relative Young's modulus with the strongest
   auxetic effect (smallest average Poisson's ratio).}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, as the development of additive manufacturing

   adopted to study the mechanical properties of the proposed novel 3D NPR

Abstract = {{The effectiveness of sandwich structure with auxetic 3D re-entrant
   lattice core and semi-auxetic braided composite face sheets subjected to
   high-velocity impact have been investigated. Braided carbon fiber
   composite used in face sheets of sandwich structure with a
   through-thickness negative Poisson's ratio significantly improves the
   impact performance. A semi-analytical Mori-Tanaka asymptotic
   homogenization, mechanics of structure genome, and multiscale finite
   element scheme have been applied to study the mechanical properties and
   auxeticity of the braided composite. The properties obtained at the
   lower scales are used in a macroscale progressive damage analysis and
   impact simulations of semi-auxetic braided composite. The results
   obtained have been compared with experimental data from the literature
   for validation. The sandwich core holds further scope for tailoring its
   architecture that can enhance the sandwich performance. The
   high-velocity steel ball impact response of the sandwich structure with
   two types of auxetic 3D re-entrant lattice core have been simulated and
   compared with a non-auxetic core. Parametric studies have been performed
   at the mesoscale to study the influence of lattice angle on homogenized
   effective properties of the core. Compared to non-auxetic foam, proposed
   auxetic sandwich structures are lightweight, have better energy
   absorption and high stiffness values in the in plane along with
   out-of-plane directions. A case study of trauma plate for the
   application of proposed auxetic lattice reinforced polyethylene

   strains is denoted by the ratio of any two normal strains. Nowadays,
   some design methods have been proposed to tailor the ratios of strains
   by changing Poisson's ratio in materials. However, the ranges of the
   ratios of strains by available methods are too narrow, the technology
   can provide materials with tailorable ratios of strains over an
   extremely wide range is rarely studied. To this end, we propose that the
   ratios of strains in piezoelectric composites can be active-controlled
   by simultaneously tailoring force and electric fields. The analytical
   solutions for different ratios of strains in piezoelectric composites
   subjected to force and electric fields are presented. It is demonstrated
   that the range of tunable ratios of strains can be from giant negative
   to giant positive. Moreover, the ratios of strains in any location of FG
   piezoelectric composites can be greatly affected by force field,
   electric field, polarization direction, volume fraction of piezoelectric
   phase. The present study may open up a new routine to design materials
   possessing extraordinary and programmable mechanical behaviors.}},

Abstract = {{The structural, mechanical and electronic properties of the MoSSe/WSSe
   van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure under various degrees of horizontal
   and vertical strain are systematically investigated based on
   first-principles methods. It is found that the MoSSe/WSSe vdW
   heterostructure of the most stable AB stacking is a direct band gap
   semiconductor and exhibits a type-II band alignment, which demonstrates
   an effective separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs and
   increases their lifetime accordingly. The high angle-dependent Young's
   modulus and normal Poisson's ratios show the mechanical stability and
   anisotropy. It is found that the band gap of the heterostructure can be
   modulated effectively by applying strain, exhibiting a decreasing trend
   with increasing strain, and even lead to an intriguing
   semiconductor-metal transition under a certain large tensile strain. In
   particular, a negative correlation between the band gap and structure
   pressure provides a theoretical basis for experimentally regulating the
   electronic properties. Moreover, different strains can induce two
   different conditions of direct-indirect transition or can maintain the
   characteristics of the direct-band-gap. All these interesting results
   provide a detailed understanding of the MoSSe/WSSe vdW heterostructure
   under strain and indicate that it is a good candidate for
   low-dimensional electronic, nano-electronic and optoelectronic devices.}},

Abstract = {{Mechanical metamaterials are uniquely engineered form of periodically
   arranged unit cells that exhibit interesting frequency-dependent
   physical properties like negative effective mass, Young's modulus and
   Poisson's ratio. These extreme engineering properties are beyond the
   natural properties of a material, which can modulate the propagation of
   wave. In this article, a mechanical realization of one of these uncommon
   properties called negative stiffness is emulated through analytical
   simulation. Wave propagation in metamaterials is contingent on
   frequency, which in turn results in transmission and attenuation bands.
   Simultaneous vibration control and energy harvesting can be executed by
   embedding energy harvesting smart material within the resonating units
   of the metamaterial. However, this needs careful design studies to
   outline the range of parameters. In this work, first, the band structure
   of a piezo-embedded negative stiffness metamaterial is studied using
   generalized Bloch's theorem. Subsequently, harvested power along with
   the transmissibility is computed for a chain of finite number of
   metamaterial units by using backward substitution method. The results of
   the parametric studies elucidate that piezo-embedded negative stiffness
   metamaterial can enhance the performance in terms of vibration
   attenuation and harvested energy.}},

Abstract = {{Aim To assess whether incidence of maternal and neonatal outcomes for
   women with or without gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) have changed
   over time. Methods Population-based cohort study in Sweden including all
   singleton pregnancies over the period 1998-2012. GDM was diagnosed
   following Diabetic Pregnancy Study Group 1991 criteria. Poisson
   regression or negative binomial regression was used to model yearly
   relative change in numbers of cases and incidence of the outcomes with
   95\% confidence intervals (CI), and yearly absolute change in
   birthweightz-score. Results The study included 1 455 667 pregnancies.
   The number of pregnancies increased over time and the overall prevalence
   of GDM was 1\%. For women with GDM there was a significantly decreasing
   trend in incidence per year for large for gestational age (LGA) (0.986,
   95\% CI 0.975 to 0.996), birthweightz-score (-0.012, 95\% CI -0.017 to
   -0.007) and birth trauma (0.937, 95\% CI 0.907 to 0.968). The trend for
   small for gestational age (SGA) among women with GDM increased by an
   odds ratio per year (1.016, 95\% CI 1.002 to 1.029). No significant
   interaction tests for maternal characteristics were found. Trends in
   outcomes for women without diabetes were similar to those for women with
   GDM. Conclusions This study shows that there were improvements in
   pregnancy outcomes for women with GDM between 1998 and 2012, although
   the incidence of SGA increased. Improvements followed similar trends in
   the background population. Inequalities in obstetric outcomes between
   women with GDM and those without have continued unchanged over 15 years,
   suggesting that new management strategies are required to reduce this
   gap.}},

   A population-based self-controlled risk interval study}},
Journal = {{VACCINE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{38}},

Pages = {{2495-2502}},
Month = {{MAR 4}},
Abstract = {{Background: Clinical trials and spontaneous reporting systems have
   revealed rare but biologically plausible adverse events following
   varicella immunization. Few post-marketing controlled studies have been
   conducted to assess the relationship between the varicella vaccine and
   these outcomes.
   Objectives: To evaluate the risk of pneumonia, idiopathic
   thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), meningitis, encephalitis and ischemic
   stroke following varicella immunization.
   Materials and methods: This nationwide observational study was based on
   Taiwan National Health Insurance data and National Immunization
   Information System from 2004 through 2014. Primary analysis included
   children aged 12-35 months who received the single varicella vaccine on
   the date of administration. The self-controlled risk interval design
   compared the incidence of pre-specified outcomes during a risk interval
   of 1-42 days post-vaccination and a control interval of 43-84 days. The
   outcomes of interest were defined as admitted pneumonia, ITP,
   meningitis, encephalitis, and ischemic stroke, as well as fracture as a
   negative control. Conditional Poisson regression was used to assess the
   incidence rate ratio (aIRR) with adjustments for age and seasonal
   effects.
   Results: Among 1,194,189 children, who receiving the varicella vaccine,
   there was no observed increase in the risk for ITP (aIRR 1.00; 95\% CI,
   0.76-1.33), meningitis (aIRR 1.21; 95\% CI, 0.49-2.95), encephalitis
   (aIRR 1.00; 95\% CI, 0.62-1.60), or ischemic stroke (aIRR 1.24; 95\% CI,
   0.31-4.95). A clustering feature with pneumonia occurred during days
   36-42 post-vaccination (aIRR 1.10; 95\% CI, 1.02-1.18). An increase in
   the risk for ITP was observed in children receiving the varicella and
   MMR vaccines concomitantly (aIRR 1.70; 95\% CI, 1.19-2.43), but not
   among those receiving the varicella vaccine only.
   Conclusions: We detected a small risk of incidental pneumonia associated
   with varicella vaccine in the 6th week after immunization. There was no
   increase in the risk of other pre-specified adverse events. (C) 2020

Abstract = {{Kirigami, the creative art of paper cutting, is a promising paradigm for
   mechanical metamaterials. However, to make kirigami-inspired structures
   a reality requires controlling the topology of kirigami to achieve
   connectivity and rigidity. We address this question by deriving the
   maximum number of cuts (minimum number of links) that still allow us to
   preserve global rigidity and connectivity of the kirigami. A
   deterministic hierarchical construction method yields an efficient
   topological way to control both the number of connected pieces and the
   total degrees of freedom. A statistical approach to the control of
   rigidity and connectivity in kirigami with random cuts complements the
   deterministic pathway, and shows that both the number of connected
   pieces and the degrees of freedom show percolation transitions as a
   function of the density of cuts (links). Together, this provides a
   general framework for the control of rigidity and connectivity in planar
   kirigami.}},

Abstract = {{Herein, two kinds of 3D hexagonal honeycomb equivalent models are
   proposed, enlightened by the octahedron model constructed by the
   wine-rack mechanism. They differ in their unit-cell arrangement forms,
   which are array and homogeneous arrangements, respectively. Referring to
   the analysis of the octahedron model, the expressions of compressibility
   properties of the two new models are given and the conditions for
   obtaining negative compressibility are analyzed. Comparing these two
   models with the octahedron model, it is found that although the three
   models are quite different in externality, they have similar mechanical
   properties (Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, and compressibility), and
   all have image symmetry in both horizontal directions. Further analysis
   shows that these three models are so unified that they can be expressed
   by a more general model, from which another model with negative
   compressibility can be deduced. Finally, a new method to improve
   negative compressibility property is concluded from comparing the three
   models, that is, increasing the number or length of rods without
   deformation in vertical direction can effectively improve negative
   compressibility property in this direction and weaken negative
   compressibility property in the other two directions.}},

Abstract = {{The design space of mechanical metamaterials can be drastically enriched
   by the employment of non-mechanical interactions between unit cells.
   Here, the mechanical behavior of planar metamaterials consisting of
   rotating squares is controlled through the periodic embedment of
   modified elementary cells with attractive and repulsive configurations
   of the magnets. The proposed design of mechanical metamaterials produced
   by three-dimensional printing enables the efficient and quick
   reprogramming of their mechanical properties through the insertion of
   the magnets into various locations within the metamaterial. Experimental
   and numerical studies reveal that under equibiaxial compression various
   mechanical characteristics, such as buckling strain and post-buckling
   stiffness, can be finely tuned through the rational placement of the
   magnets. Moreover, this strategy is shown to be efficient in introducing
   bistability into the metamaterial with an initially single equilibrium
   state.}},

Title = {{The variation and visualisation of elastic anisotropy in rock-forming
   minerals}},
Journal = {{SOLID EARTH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{259-286}},

Abstract = {{All minerals behave elastically; elasticity is a rheological property
   that controls their ability to support stress, strain, and pressure;
   controls the nature of acoustic wave propagation; and influences
   subsequent plastic (i.e. permanent non-reversible) deformation. All
   minerals are intrinsically anisotropic in their elastic properties -
   that is, they have directional variations that are related to the
   configuration of the crystal lattice. This means that the commonly used
   mechanical elastic properties that relate elastic stress to elastic
   strain, including Young's modulus (E), Poisson's ratio (nu), shear
   modulus (G) and linear compressibility (beta), are dependent on
   crystallographic direction. In this paper, we explore the ranges of
   anisotropy of E, nu, G and beta in 86 rock-forming minerals, using
   previously published data, and show that the range is much wider than
   commonly assumed. We also explore how these variations (the
   directionality and the magnitude) are important for fundamental
   processes in the solid earth, including deformation (mechanical)
   twinning, coherent phase transformations and brittle failure. We present
   a new open-source software package (AnisoVis, written in MATLAB), which
   we use to calculate and visualise directional variations in elastic
   properties of rock-forming minerals. Following previous work in the
   fields of chemistry and materials science, we demonstrate that by
   visualising the variations in elasticity, we discover previously
   unreported properties of rock-forming minerals. For example, we show
   previously unreported directions of negative Poisson's ratio and
   negative linear compressibility, and we show that the existence of these
   features is more widespread (i.e. present in many more minerals) than
   previously thought. We illustrate the consequences of intrinsic elastic
   anisotropy for the elastic normal and shear strains within alpha-quartz
   single crystal under different applied stress fields; the role of
   elastic anisotropy on Dauphine twinning and the alpha-beta phase
   transformations in quartz; and stress distributions around voids of
   different shapes in talc, lizardite, albite, and sanidine. In addition
   to our specific examples, elastic anisotropy in rock-forming minerals,
   to the degree that we describe, has significant consequences for seismic
   (acoustic) anisotropy, for the focal mechanisms of earthquakes in
   anisotropic source regions (e.g. subducting slabs), for a range of
   brittle and ductile deformation mechanisms in minerals, and for
   geobarometry using mineral inclusions.}},

Abstract = {{A passive solid cannot do work on its surroundings through any
   quasistatic cycle of deformations. This property places strong
   constraints on the allowed elastic moduli. In this Article, we show that
   static elastic moduli altogether absent in passive elasticity can arise
   from active, non-conservative microscopic interactions. These active
   moduli enter the antisymmetric (or odd) part of the static elastic
   modulus tensor and quantify the amount of work extracted along
   quasistatic strain cycles. In two-dimensional isotropic media, two
   chiral odd-elastic moduli emerge in addition to the bulk and shear
   moduli. We discuss microscopic realizations that include networks of
   Hookean springs augmented with active transverse forces and
   non-reciprocal active hinges. Using coarse-grained microscopic models,
   numerical simulations and continuum equations, we uncover phenomena
   ranging from auxetic behaviour induced by odd moduli to elastic wave
   propagation in overdamped media enabled by self-sustained active strain
   cycles. Our work sheds light on the non-Hermitian mechanics of two- and
   three-dimensional active solids that conserve linear momentum but
   exhibit a non-reciprocal linear response.
   Active, non-conservative interactions can give rise to elastic moduli
   that are forbidden in equilibrium and enter the antisymmetric part of
   the stiffness tensor. The resulting solids function as distributed
   elastic engines that can perform work on their surroundings through
   quasistatic strain cycles.}},

Title = {{An empirical comparison of methods for analyzing over-dispersed

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Background: The assessment of methods for analyzing over-dispersed zero
   inflated count outcome has received very little or no attention in
   stratified cluster randomized trials. In this study, we performed
   sensitivity analyses to empirically compare eight methods for analyzing
   zero inflated over-dispersed count outcome from the Vitamin D and
   Osteoporosis Study (ViDOS) - originally designed to assess the
   feasibility of a knowledge translation intervention in long-term care
   home setting.
   Method: Forty long-term care (LTC) homes were stratified and then
   randomized into knowledge trans lation (KT) intervention (19 homes) and
   control (21 homes) groups. The homes/clusters were stratified by home
   size (< 250/> = 250) and profit status (profit/non-profit). The outcome
   of this study was number of falls measured at 6-month post-intervention.
   The following methods were used to assess the effect of KT intervention
   on number of falls: i) standard Poisson and negative binomial
   regression; ii) mixed-effects method with Poisson and negative binomial
   distribution; iii) generalized estimating equation (GEE) with Poisson
   and negative binomial; iv) zero inflated Poisson and negative binomial -
   with the latter used as a primary approach. All these methods were
   compared with or without adjusting for stratification.
   Results: A total of 5,478 older people from 40 LTC homes were included
   in this study. The mean (=1) of the number of falls was smaller than the
   variance (=6). Also 72\% and 46\% of the number of falls were zero in
   the control and intervention groups, respectively. The direction of the
   estimated incidence rate ratios (IRRs) was similar for all methods. The
   zero inflated negative binomial yielded the lowest IRRs and narrowest
   95\% confidence intervals when adjusted for stratification compared to
   GEE and mixed-effect methods. Further, the widths of the 95\% confidence
   intervals were narrower when the methods adjusted for stratification
   compared to the same method not adjusted for stratification.
   Conclusion: The overall conclusion from the GEE, mixed-effect and zero
   inflated methods were similar. However, these methods differ in terms of
   effect estimate and widths of the confidence interval.}},

   quaternary Heusler: A DFT study}},
Journal = {{SOLID STATE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{308}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The study of half-metallic behavior, thermoelectric properties and
   thermodynamic stability of the new quaternary PdZrTiAl Heusler were
   carried out based on the Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations.
   The generalized gradient approximation with Tran-Blaha potential (GGA +
   mbJ) was utilized to treat the exchangecorrelation energy for the
   calculations of electronic structures. More accurate results of the
   dynamic stability investigation of the intended Heusler compound were
   obtained by using and Quantum Molecular Dynamic (QMD) simulation.
   Calculation of the electronic structure indicates that the PdZrTiAl
   compound has an indirect band gap 0.69eV (from GGA + mbJ) in the down
   spin and therefore is a ferromagnetic half-metal with 3.00 mu B magnetic
   moment. The investigation of the thermodynamic phase diagram showed that
   this material is stable in all thermodynamic conditions. Furthermore,
   the phonon positive frequencies and the results of QMD, confirms the
   sustainability of this structure in XX.YZ stoichiometric compound. The
   elastic constants reveal that the PdZrTiAl are mechanically stable and
   the Poisson's ratio confirmed that the alloys considered are ductile.
   Also, thermoelectric properties of this compound were studied using
   transport quasi-classical theory. It was observed that in two majority
   and minority spin states, this combination shows an utterly distinct
   thermoelectric behavior. This compound has a good merit coefficient at
   dn spin at all temperature ranges, especially at low temperatures and
   the negative sign of the Seebeck coefficient indicates that electrons
   are charge carriers.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports a study on the large amplitude nonlinear vibration of
   carbon nanotube-reinforced composite (CNTRC) laminated plates with
   negative Poisson's ratios in thermal environments. The constituent
   materials of CNTRCs are temperature-dependent and the plate is
   functionally graded (FG) in a piece-wise pattern in the thickness
   direction of plate. An extended Voigt (rule of mixture) model is adopted
   to quantify the CNTRC material properties of the laminated plate. The
   governing motion equations for the large amplitude vibration of FG-CNTRC
   laminated plates are based on the Reddy's third order shear deformation
   theory and the von Karman-type kinematic nonlinearity framework, and the
   thermal effects and the reaction from elastic foundation are taken into
   account. The nonlinear solution of the motion equation can be obtained
   by applying a two-step perturbation approach. The effects of material
   property gradient, the temperature variation, stacking sequence as well
   as the foundation stiffness on the vibration characteristics of CNTRC
   laminated plates are examined and discussed in depth through a
   parametric study. The results show that negative Poisson's ratio has a
   significant effect on the linear and nonlinear vibration characteristics

Abstract = {{To improve the anti-explosion performance of blast wall in offshore
   platforms, an auxetic re-entrant blast wall (ARBW) was proposed and
   designed based on the indentation resistance effect of an auxetic
   structure. Based on the numerical nonlinear dynamic analysis method
   verified by the explosion experiment of a conventional steel corrugated
   blast wall (CBW), the failure mechanisms of ARBW, steel honeycomb
   sandwich blast wall (HSBW) and CBW were investigated under distributed
   impulse loads. Computational results demonstrated the excellent
   anti-explosion performance of the proposed ARBW design. Concerning the
   minimal deformation at the mid-point of the proposed protective
   structures, the ARBW performed best. As regards the minimal deformation
   at the connection, both ARBW and HSBW worked well. The stress
   distribution of the connection illustrated the different energy
   absorption and transmission modes of the three blast walls.}},

Title = {{Delayed Graft Function in Simultaneous Liver Kidney Transplantation}},
Journal = {{TRANSPLANTATION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{104}},

Abstract = {{Background.
   Delayed graft function (DGF) is associated with inferior posttransplant
   outcomes in kidney transplantation. Given these adverse outcomes, we
   sought to determine the incidence, unique risk factors, and
   posttransplant outcomes for simultaneous liver kidney (SLK) transplant
   recipients developing DGF.
   Methods.
   We studied 6214 adult SLK recipients from March 2002 to February 2017
   using the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients. We determined
   associations between risk factors and DGF using Poisson multivariate
   regression and between DGF and graft failure and mortality using Cox
   proportional hazard analysis.
   Results.
   The overall rate of DGF was 21.8\%. Risk factors for DGF in the
   hepatitis C virus (HCV)-negative recipient population included
   pretransplant dialysis (adjusted incident rate ratio {[}aIRR] 3.26, P =
   0.004), donor body mass index (aIRR 1.25 per 5 kg/m(2), P = 0.01), and
   transplantation with a donation after circulatory death (aIRR 5.38, P =
   0.001) or imported donor organ (regional share aIRR 1.69, P = 0.03;
   national share aIRR 4.82, P < 0.001). DGF was associated with a 2.6-fold
   increase in kidney graft failure (adjusted hazard ratio {[}aHR] 2.63, P
   < 0.001), 1.6-fold increase in liver graft failure (aHR 1.62, P <
   0.001), and 1.6-fold increase in mortality (aHR 1.62, P < 0.001).
   Conclusions.
   In HCV-negative SLK recipients, recipient pretransplant dialysis and
   components of kidney graft quality comprise significant risk factors for
   DGF. Regardless of HCV status, DGF is associated with inferior
   posttransplant outcomes. Understanding these risk factors during
   clinical decision-making may improve prevention of DGF and may represent
   an opportunity to improve posttransplant outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, material symmetries in homogenized composites are
   analyzed. Composite materials are described as materials made of rigid
   particles and elastic interfaces. Rigid particles of arbitrary hexagonal
   shape are considered and their geometry described by a limited set of
   parameters. The purpose of this study is to analyze different
   geometrical configurations of the assemblies corresponding to various
   material symmetries such as orthotetragonal, auxetic and chiral. The
   problem is investigated through a homogenization technique which is able
   to carry out constitutive parameters using a principle of energetic
   equivalence. The constitutive law of the homogenized continuum has been
   derived within the framework of Cosserat elasticity, wherein the
   continuum has additional degrees of freedom with respect to classical
   elasticity. A panel composed of material with various symmetries,
   corresponding to some particular hexagonal geometries defined, is
   analyzed under the effect of localized loads. The results obtained show
   the difference of the micropolar response for the considered material
   symmetries, which depends on the non-symmetries of the strain and stress
   tensor as well as on the additional kinematical and work-conjugated
   statical descriptors. This work underlines the importance of resorting
   to the Cosserat theory when analyzing anisotropic materials.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether abnormal plasma placental growth factor
   (PlGF) level is associated with adverse neonatal and maternal outcomes.
   METHODS: This was a secondary analysis of the Preeclampsia Triage by
   Rapid Assay Trial (PETRA), a prospective, multicenter, observational
   study that enrolled women with suspected preeclampsia. Our analysis
   included women age 18-45 years with a singleton pregnancy between 20 and
   41 weeks of gestation. Plasma collected at enrollment was used for PlGF
   measurement. Abnormal PlGF was defined as low (100 pg/mL or less) or
   very low (less than 12 pg/mL). The primary outcomes were composite
   adverse neonatal and maternal outcomes. We used multivariable Poisson
   regression models to examine the association between PlGF and outcomes.
   RESULTS: Of 1,112 women who met the inclusion criteria, plasma PlGF was
   low in 742 (67\%) and very low in 353 (32\%). In the cohort, the overall
   rates of the composite adverse neonatal and maternal outcomes were 6.4\%
   and 4.8\%, respectively. Compared with normal PlGF (more than 100
   pg/mL), low PlGF was significantly associated with an increased risk of
   the composite neonatal outcome (9.2\% vs 0.8\%; adjusted relative risk
   {[}aRR] 17.2, 95\% CI 5.2-56.3), and the composite maternal outcome
   (6.2\% vs 1.9\%; aRR 3.6, 95\% CI 1.7-8.0). Very low PlGF was also
   significantly associated with both neonatal and maternal outcomes. The
   sensitivity and specificity of low PlGF were 95.8\% and 35.3\%,
   respectively, for the composite neonatal outcome, and 86.8\% and 34.3\%
   for the composite maternal outcome. Although the positive predictive
   values were low (9.2\% and 6.2\%, respectively), the negative predictive
   value of low PlGF for neonatal and maternal outcomes was 99.2\% and
   98.1\%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Among women being evaluated for
   preeclampsia, those with abnormal PlGF are significantly more likely to
   experience adverse neonatal and maternal outcomes. These outcomes occur
   infrequently when the PlGF is normal. These findings suggest that PlGF
   may be useful for risk stratification of women with suspected
   preeclampsia. FUNDING SOURCE: No funding was received for this study.

Abstract = {{Multi-stable mechanical metamaterials with unprecedented
   mechanical/physical properties have attracted great interests due to
   their functional applications for advanced materials and devices.
   However, the original curved/tilted bistable snapping segments in most
   of those existing multi-stable mechanical metamaterials cause unequal
   bistability/multi-stability. The relative thicker supporting segments
   can't provide complete constraints at the end of snapping segments using
   single parent material. To achieve completely symmetric
   bistable/multi-stable mechanism, an innovative design strategy is
   proposed based on interlocking assembly method with multimaterials and
   compressed buckled snapping segments for bistable units. Theoretical
   analysis, numerical simulations and experimental verifications are used
   to show completely symmetric bistability/multi-stability with negative
   stiffness. The multi-stable mechanical metamaterials have robust
   shape-reconfigurability and zero Poisson's ratio with large recoverable
   deformation. Geometric and material gradients design are carried out to
   control deterministic deformation sequence with rich programmability.
   Theoretical and numerical results reveal that tunable ID to 3D large
   positive/zero/negative isotropic or anisotropic thermal expansions of
   single 1D to 3D multi-stable metamaterials can be achieved,
   respectively. This work suggests the rational designed metamaterials

   characterization and pullout fixation strength evaluation}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{188}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{It was supposed that auxetic structure with negative Poisson's ratio
   (NPR) expands under stretch and could enhance the screw-bone fixation.
   In this study, the novel auxetic structure based bone screws were
   designed, and mechanical properties and fixation strength were
   evaluated. Auxetic unit cells (A1-A6) were introduced into the design of
   screw bodies after a mechanical evaluation. Tubular auxetic structures
   (TA1-TA6), auxetic screws (AS1-AS6) and one non-auxetic screw (NS) were
   manufactured using 3D-printing. The fabrication process well reproduced
   the original designs despite the some mismatch in the macro and micro
   morphologies. Tensile tests on specimens were conducted experimentally
   and computationally. The relationship between NPR and fixation strength
   of the screws was investigated by computationally bone-pullout test.
   Among all screw designs, AS2 generated the largest stiffness and
   strength, and better NPR, AS5 produced the highest NPR, and smallest
   stiffness and strength. Maximal pullout force within low-, mid- and
   high-density bone was shown in AS5 (399.39 N), AS6 (561.07 N) and AS2
   (1185.93 N) respectively. It was concluded that varying auxetic
   structures altered the screw's mechanical properties especially its
   functional properties. The bone-screw fixation could be improved by
   auxelic structures while other design factors should also be taken in
   account. (C) 2019 BeiHang University School of Biological Science and

Abstract = {{Introduction Although HIV prevalence is exceptionally high in South
   Africa, HIV testing rates remain below targeted guidelines. Older adults
   living with HIV are substantially more likely to remain undiagnosed than
   younger people. Cognitive function and literacy could play key roles in
   HIV status knowledge due to the decision-making processes required
   around weighing the costs and benefits of testing, navigating testing
   logistics and processing results. We aimed to assess the independent
   relationships among each of cognitive function, literacy and education
   with HIV status knowledge in a population-based sample of older adults
   living in a rural South African community with high HIV prevalence.
   Methods We analyzed data from a population-based study of 5059 men and
   women aged 40 years and older in rural South Africa (Health and Aging in
   Africa: A Longitudinal Study of an INDEPTH community (HAALSI)). HAALSI
   surveys, conducted between 2014 and 2015, queried self-reported
   literacy, educational attainment and HIV status knowledge. Laboratory
   tests were conducted to assess true HIV sero-status. Cognitive function
   was assessed with a battery of cognitive tests measuring time
   orientation, immediate and delayed recall, and numeracy and coded using
   confirmatory factor analysis as a z-standardized latent variable. We
   estimated the relationship between the outcome of HIV status knowledge
   and each of three exposures: (1) latent cognitive z-score, (2) literacy
   and (3) education, using confounder-adjusted modified Poisson regression
   models in the study population overall and stratified by HIV
   sero-status.
   Results We found that HIV status knowledge was higher among those with
   higher cognitive z-scores (adjusted Prevalence Ratio (aPR) (95\% CI):
   1.18 (1.14, 1.21) per standard deviation unit), and among literate
   participants (aPR (95\% CI): 1.24 (1.16, 1.32) vs. non-literate
   participants). Taken together, the associations with literacy and
   cognitive function completely attenuated the otherwise positive
   association between educational attainment and HIV status knowledge. The
   magnitudes of effect were generally similar among laboratory-confirmed
   HIV-negative and HIV-positive participants.
   Conclusions Campaigns that target older adults in rural South Africa
   with HIV testing messages should carefully consider the cognitive and
   literacy levels of the intended audience. Innovations to ease the
   cognitive load associated with HIV testing could prove fruitful to
   increase HIV status knowledge.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic structures with negative Poisson's ratio have been widely
   studied due to their unique mechanical properties, especially the
   dynamic properties under low-velocity impact. In this paper, the dynamic
   properties of an excellent candidate for engineering application, double
   arrowed honeycomb (DAH), are analyzed thoroughly. The deformation
   patterns of the DAH under high and low velocity impact are compared,
   which shows there is a great difference between them. Analytical models
   for predicting the dynamic strength at the crushing/supporting end of
   DAH are developed based on cellular collapse mechanism. It shows that
   the crushing strength rises with the increase of the relative density
   and impact velocity. Numerical simulations are also performed to verify
   the accuracy of the analytical models. It is found that there is good
   agreement between the analytical and numerical predictions for the
   dynamic characteristics. Also, the energy absorptions of the DAH are
   also thoroughly studied based on the analytical models. (C) 2020

Journal = {{AEROSPACE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{98}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic lattice cylindrical shell consisting of re-entrant lattice cell
   has superior mechanics performance due to negative Poisson's ratio
   (NPR). In this work, finite element models were established and finite
   element method (FEM) was adopted to explore the deformation behaviors
   and energy absorption of re-entrant auxetic lattice cylindrical shells
   and the SILICOMB lattice cylindrical shell in different crushing
   velocity. Result indicated that the deformation behaviors of auxetic
   lattice cylindrical shells are expressed as NPR mode, and different
   deformation behaviors ('Z' mode, ring mode, diamond mode and mixed mode)
   of lattice sandwich cylindrical shells are mainly determined by the
   ratio of the core wall thickness to the skin. The SILICOMB lattice
   cylindrical shell has better performance than the conventional hexagon
   honeycomb lattice cylindrical shell when crushing under high velocity.
   Meanwhile, the SILICOMB sandwich cylindrical shell has the best
   performance on the specific energy absorption among these four
   configurations and the maximum increment is 20.77\%. The design of the
   auxetic and the SILICOMB cylindrical shells may provide a new idea which
   can be applied in practical application as impact resistance structures

Abstract = {{The use of antiretroviral drugs has increased the survival of HIV
   patients, but may have side effects, such as lipodystrophic syndrome.
   This article aims to identify the frequency of the lipodystrophic
   syndrome and its associated factors in patients with HIV using
   antiretroviral therapy. It involved a cross-sectional study with HIV
   patients, monitored on an outpatient basis. The syndrome was evaluated
   by the association of two parameters: peripheral weight loss through the
   lipodystrophy severity scale and central fat accumulation, measured by
   the hip waist ratio. Poisson regression analysis was performed to
   identify the associated variables. Of the 104 patients evaluated, 27.9\%
   presented the syndrome. After adjustment, the female sex (PRadjusted =
   2.16 CI95\% 1.43-3.39), being overweight (PRadjusted = 2.23 CI95\%
   1.35-2.65) and a longer period of use of antiretrovirals (PRadjusted =
   1.64 CI95\% 1.16-2.78), us remained positively associated with the
   syndrome. On the other hand, a negative association with CD4 count 
   pound 350 (PRadjusted = 0.39 CI95\% 0.10-0.97) was observed The high
   prevalence of the syndrome and its association with specific groups
   reinforce the need for adequate follow-up and early identification to

Abstract = {{In recent years, auxetic metallic cellular material such as auxetic
   reentrant honeycomb is one of the research hotspot in metallic cellular
   materials due to its attractively negative Poisson's ratio. In this
   manuscript, the dynamic response of the end-clamped shallow sandwich
   arch with aluminum face sheets and auxetic reentrant hexagonal aluminum
   honeycomb core subjected to foam projectile with high-velocity impact
   was experimentally and numerically investigated. The reentrant honeycomb
   cores with different cell-wall thicknesses were fabricated by selective
   laser melting (SLM). The deformation processes of honeycomb core were
   captured by a high-speed camera. And deflection history of back face
   sheet was obtained using three-dimensional digital imaging correlation
   method (DIC) analysis system. Failure modes and deformation mechanisms
   of the sandwich arch were investigated. According to experiment results,
   the local negative Poisson's ratio deformation was found in honeycomb
   core. Then, a finite element (FE) model was established to study the
   dynamic deformation evolution of two face sheets and auxetic reentrant
   honeycomb core. The results showed that the honeycomb cells were not
   always undergoing shrinkage deformation and flowing into the loading
   center, while the local expand deformations of honeycomb core were also
   found.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Maternal mortality rates in the United States appear to be
   increasing. One potential reason may be increased identification of
   maternal deaths after the addition of a pregnancy checkbox to the death
   certificate. In 2016, 4 state health departments (Georgia, Louisiana,
   Michigan, and Ohio) implemented a pregnancy checkbox quality assurance
   pilot, with technical assistance provided by the Centers for Disease
   Control and Prevention. The pilot aimed to improve accuracy of the
   pregnancy checkbox on death certificates and resultant state maternal
   mortality estimates.
   OBJECTIVE: To estimate the validity of the pregnancy checkbox on the
   death certificate, and to describe characteristics associated with
   errors using 2016 data from a 4-state quality assurance pilot.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Potential pregnancy-associated deaths were
   identified by linking death certificates with birth or fetal death
   certificates from within 1 year preceding death or by pregnancy checkbox
   status. Death certificates that indicated that the decedent was pregnant
   within 1 year of death via the pregnancy checkbox, but that did not link
   to a birth or fetal death certificate, were referred for active
   follow-up to confirm pregnancy status by either death certifier
   confirmation or medical record review. Descriptive statistics and 95\%
   confidence intervals were used to examine the distributions of
   demographic characteristics by pregnancy confirmation category
   (confirmed pregnant, confirmed not pregnant, and unable to confirm). We
   compared the proportion confirmed pregnant and confirmed not pregnant
   within age, race/ethnicity, pregnancy checkbox category, and certifier
   type categories using a Wald test of proportions. Binomial and Poisson
   regression models were used to estimate prevalence ratios for having an
   incorrect pregnancy checkbox (false positive, false negative) by age
   group, race/ethnicity, pregnancy checkbox category, and certifier type.
   RESULTS: Among 467 potential pregnancy-associated deaths, 335 (72\%)
   were confirmed pregnant via linkage to a birth or fetal death
   certificate, certifier confirmation, or review of medical records. A
   total of 97 women (21\%) were confirmed not pregnant (false positives)
   and 35 (7\%) were unable to be confirmed. Women confirmed pregnant were
   significantly younger than women confirmed not pregnant (P < .001).
   Deaths certified by coroners and medical examiners were more likely to
   be confirmed pregnant than confirmed not pregnant (P = .04). The
   association between decedent age category and false-positive status
   followed a dose-response relationship (P < .001), with increasing
   prevalence ratios for each increase in age category. Death certificates
   of non-Hispanic black women were more likely to be false positive,
   compared with non-Hispanic white women (prevalence ratio, 1.41; 95\%
   confidence interval, 1.01, 1.96). The sensitivity of the pregnancy
   checkbox among these 4 states in 2016 was 62\% and the positive
   predictive value was 68\%.
   CONCLUSION: We provide a multi-state analysis of the validity of the
   pregnancy checkbox and highlight a need for more accurate reporting of
   pregnancy status on death certificates. States and other jurisdictions
   may increase the accuracy of their data used to calculate maternal
   mortality rates by implementing quality assurance processes.}},

Abstract = {{Background. South Africa (SA) has the highest burden of HIV in the
   world. This study sought to evaluate the impact of high HIV prevalence
   on the burden of disease in an emergency department (ED).
   Objectives. To determine the burden of comorbidities in HIV-positive
   emergency care patients, their demographic profiles and severity of
   illness were compared with the general ED population in order to make
   recommendations for resource allocation and training in EDs in SA.
   Methods. A prospective cross-sectional observational study was conducted
   from June 2017 to July 2018 in three EDs in Eastern Cape Province. All
   eligible patients (aged >= 18 years, fully conscious and clinically
   stable) presenting to the ED during the 6-week study period were
   approached and asked to give consent for a point-of-care HIV test and
   collection of demographic information. Simple descriptive statistics
   were used to analyse data. Log binomial and Poisson models were fitted
   to estimate prevalence ratios (PRs).
   Results. Over the total study period, 8 000 patients presented to the ED
   for care across all sites and 3 537 patients were enrolled. The HIV
   status of 2 901 individuals (82.0\%) was determined. Of those who were
   screened, 811 (28.0\%) were identified as HIV-positive. Medical
   complaints were more common in HIV-positive patients (n=586, 72.3\%)
   than in trauma patients (n=225, 27.7\%). In comparison, HIV-negative
   patients reported fewer medical complaints (n=1 137, 54.4\%) and more
   trauma (n=953, 45.6\%) (p<0.001). HIV-positive patients were more likely
   to have a life-threatening emergency (n=192, 23.7\%) (p=0.004), to be
   critically ill by triage score (p<0.001) and to be admitted to the
   hospital (p<0.001) than those who were HIV-negative. Despite high acuity
   overall, people living with HIV/AIDS were significantly less likely to
   be deemed critically ill according to vital signs (adjusted PR 0.94;
   p=0.046).
   Conclusions. While EDs in SA provide care to high volumes of patients
   with trauma-related injuries, in areas where HIV prevalence is highest,
   patients are more likely to present with acute medical emergencies.
   Providers of emergency care in SA need to be well versed in the
   management of HIV and associated complications.}},

Abstract = {{A novel mechanism is identified leading to negative linear
   compressibility (NLC) in boron arsenate which is shown to arise from
   deformations in the framework tetrahedra rather than more conspicuous
   tetrahedral rotations. Instead, such rotations, which manifest as
   ``rotating squares{''} when viewed down the c direction, are found to
   result in negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) in the (001) plane, which in
   turn augments the compressibility, a phenomenon that should be
   applicable to other auxetic materials. It is hypothesized that the
   generic NLC and NPR mechanisms identified here, as well as the augmented
   compressibility due to auxeticity should also feature in materials and
   metamaterials with similar characteristics.}},

   microstructures with negative Poisson's ratio}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MECHANICS A-SOLIDS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{80}},
Month = {{MAR-APR}},
Abstract = {{Double-V microstructure (DVM) is a type of auxetic cellular material
   with negative Poisson's ratio (NPR). Accurate predictions of the
   mechanical properties of these microstructures at large strains are
   critical for many engineering applications. In this paper, nonlinear
   theoretical models of two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D)
   DVM based on a large beam deflection model are established to predict
   the normalized Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio in the principal
   directions. The theoretical solutions are compared to solutions obtained
   from numerical finite element analyses and quasi-static compression
   experiments of a 2D prototype manufactured using additive printing
   technique. It is found that there is good agreement between these
   results, validating the accuracy of the proposed theoretical model.
   Effects of geometry parameters on the mechanical properties of the DVM
   are also investigated to understand the mechanical behavior at large
   strains. This study provides validated models for predicting the
   behavior of these microstructures at large strains, useful for
   engineering designs.}},

   micro-architectured materials with a prescribed effective elasticity
   tensor and Poisson's ratio. The space of admissible micro-architectural
   shapes that carries orthotropic material symmetry allows to attain
   shapes with an effective Poisson's ratio below - 1. Moreover, the
   specimens were manufactured using a commercial stereolithography Ember

Abstract = {{In this study, 2D triangular anti-trichiral structures and auxetic
   stents, under compression, were introduced. The cores of the
   anti-trichiral structures were the equilateral triangles. The
   deformation mechanisms in 2D structures were based on the rotation of
   the triangles and bending of the ligaments. A parametric study was
   carried out to investigate the dependence of the Poisson's ratio to the
   triangle edge lengths. The most auxeticity, with the values of v(yz )= -
   0.55 and v(zy) = - 1.6, was obtained in the structure in which the
   triangle edge lengths were considered 13 mm. Next, the auxetic stents
   with the aims of uniform shrinkage behaviors as well as high energy
   absorption were introduced. For this purpose, the equilateral triangles
   were distributed on the cylindrical surfaces along with the peripheral
   and longitudinal directions. Under compression, the stent with 15mm
   triangle edge lengths possessed uniform shrinkage behavior, and the
   values of Poisson's ratio were measured v(zx) = - 2.2 and v(zy) = -
   2.19. Finally, the comparisons between triangular and conventional
   anti-trichiral stents were performed. It was observed that the lateral
   displacements, as well as energy absorption of the triangular stents
   were twice and three times as high as the conventional anti-trichiral
   stents respectively.}},

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{185}},

Abstract = {{The performance of balloon expandable stents during deployment is
   usually assessed computationally. Most stents have a generic feature
   that entails wavy rings known as ``crowns{''} which are interconnected
   via structures known as ``bridges{''}. A mathematically exact analyses
   of such wavy rings would provide a benchmark to such computations and
   offer a clear insight into the deformation of stents. In the present
   work, an analytical model is developed to estimate the elasto-plastic
   response of a cylindrical periodic structure made of sinusoidal crowns
   interconnected by bridges. Two different interconnections are considered
   that give rise to two distinctive behaviours one of which is auxetic.
   Elastic-perfectly plastic material is considered. The apparent
   elasto-plastic response of the cylindrical structure is obtained in a
   closed-form by exploiting the periodicity along its longitudinal and the
   circumferential direction. A scaling ansatz is proposed that collapses
   nonlinear response data for different geometries into a family of
   master-curves. Such relationship suggests that the most efficient way to
   increase the apparent stiffness of the structure is to decrease the
   amplitude of the wavy crowns. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Second-order solutions for the pure bending of a beam under finite
   deformation are obtained in this paper. The equilibrium equations are
   solved analytically for the second-order displacements, from which the
   first Piola-Kirchhoff stresses, the curvatures and a bending-stretching
   parameter are calculated for a cross section with a transverse axis of
   symmetry. The displacements are dependent on the square of the inverse
   of elastic constant, whereas the stresses on the inverse of elastic
   constant. The curvatures and anticlastic curvatures are gradated in the
   transverse direction. The longitudinal stress is nonlinearly distributed
   across the section, and exhibits anomalous characteristics in materials
   with a negative Poisson's ratio. The shear stresses have vanishing force
   and moment resultants, and bending-twisting coupling does not occur. The
   normal stresses give rise to force-couple resultants. The longitudinal
   force resultant representing the bending-stretching effect is dependent
   on a reduced elastic parameter xi. This effect is present as long as
   there is finite deformation, even if the material is linearly elastic. A
   small shear modulus mu and/or a large third-order elastic constant l, m
   or n will result in a large xi. This study may be applicable to the
   elasticity design of soft medical and wearable robots, where elastic
   compatibility with tissues is a primary consideration. (C) 2019 Elsevier

Title = {{Metallic stacked origami cellular materials: Additive manufacturing,

Abstract = {{Stacking layers of Miura-folded origami sheets has been shown to create
   a cellular material with attractive properties. It has a rich array of
   geometric parameters that allow its elastic properties and compressive
   collapse response to be varied over a wide range, at fixed relative
   density. It displays tunable anisotropy and auxetic behaviour, and can
   also be easily conformed to curved surfaces. Because of these
   attributes, metallic stacked origami materials have shown promise for
   applications such as impact energy absorption and blast mitigation.
   However, to date, manufacturability challenges have yet to be adequately
   solved. Sensitivity to dimensional tolerance, and challenges of layer
   interfaces, make the material difficult to manufacture via sheet metal
   forming routes. However, additive manufacturing (AM) techniques offer a
   route to overcoming these challenges. In this investigation, we use a
   selective laser melting (SLM) process to allow metallic stacked origami
   materials to be assessed experimentally for the first time. The
   as-manufactured characteristics of these cellular materials were
   investigated via X-ray tomography and microstructural inspection. For
   comparison, tensile coupons were also fabricated in different
   orientations with respect to the build plane, in order to investigate
   material anisotropy resulting from the AM process. Scaling effects, both
   in terms of manufacturability and mechanical response, were investigated
   with cellular specimens fabricated with different cell sizes and cell
   wall thicknesses. The origami specimens were tested under quasi-static
   compression to provide an assessment of their as-manufactured energy
   absorbing properties. Finally, a finite element analysis is carried out,
   in order to assess its predictive accuracy and sensitivity to key
   modelling decisions. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Volume = {{185}},
Pages = {{485-499}},
Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{The unique nonlinear mechanical properties including auxeticity of a
   class of orthotropic polyhedral structures are presented. These
   structures result from a three-dimensional coordinate rotation of the
   components. We establish an over-constrained periodic framework composed
   of edge-shared tetrahedra pivotally connected with each other. In the
   initial configuration, the unit cell is a stellated octahedron and has
   two conformational mechanisms both subject to uniform transformations.
   Modeling the tetrahedral unit with linear spring interactions, the
   effective on-axis Poisson's ratios and stress-strain curves are
   analyzed. In the restricted unimode model with a single degree of
   freedom under a uniaxial tension, the out-of-plane Poisson's ratio is a
   negative constant determined only by the initial height ratio, whereas
   the in-plane Poisson's ratio begins with -1 and slightly increases with
   increasing tension. The bimode model with additional geometric
   parameters exhibits a rich range of elastic behaviors, e.g., for any
   internal stiffness, an identical point exists through which pass the
   equilibrium trajectories. The bimode model also displays similar auxetic
   characteristics to the unimode model. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   negative Poisson's ratio}},
Journal = {{COMPUTER METHODS IN APPLIED MECHANICS AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{360}},
Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents an investigation on the nonlinear flexural
   vibrations of carbon nanotube-reinforced composite (CNTRC) laminated
   cylindrical shells with negative Poisson's ratios in thermal
   environments. The material properties of the CNTRCs are
   temperature-dependent and the functionally graded (FG) in a piece-wise
   pattern in the thickness direction of the shell. An extended Voigt (rule
   of mixture) model is employed to estimate the CNTRC material properties.
   The motion equations for the nonlinear flexural vibration of FG-CNTRC
   laminated cylindrical shells are based on the Reddy's third order shear
   deformation theory and the von Karman-type kinematic nonlinearity, and
   the effects of thermal environmental conditions are included. The
   nonlinear vibration solutions for the FG-CNTRC laminated cylindrical
   shells can be obtained by applying a singular perturbation technique
   along with a two-step perturbation approach. The effects of material
   property gradient, the temperature variation, shell geometric parameter,
   stacking sequence as well as the end conditions on the vibration
   characteristics of CNTRC laminated cylindrical shells are discussed in
   detail through a parametric study. The results show that negative
   Poisson's ratio has a significant effect on the linear and nonlinear
   vibration characteristics of CNTRC laminated cylindrical shells. (C)

Abstract = {{Four-dimensional (4D) printing, integrates transformation information

   via 4D printing. The genetic algorithm is used to optimize the
   structure. Axial compression tests, radial compression tests and
   three-point bending tests are carried out to study the mechanical
   properties of the stents. In addition, fluid-structure interaction and
   stress distribution during the shape recovery process are investigated
   based on finite element method. The shape memory behaviors of the stents
   are excellent and in vitro feasibility tests demonstrate that the stents
   can expand the simulated narrow blood vessel rapidly. Therefore, 4D
   printed shape memory stents with negative Poisson's ratio structure are
   highly promising for the treatment of vascular stenosis.}},

Title = {{Unusual anisotropic thermal expansion in multilayer SnSe leads to
   positive-to-negative crossover of Poisson's ratio}},
Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{116}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{FEB 24}},
Abstract = {{Monolayer SnSe has been predicted to exhibit an unusual anisotropic
   thermal expansion-when heated, the long lattice parameter contracts,
   while the short one expands, resulting in a
   rectangular-to-square-lattice phase transformation at a critical
   temperature (T-c). Here, we employ density-functional-theory
   calculations to demonstrate an even more notable thermal-expansion
   behavior of SnSe from monolayer to bulk. We find that the unusual
   thermal expansion persists in multilayers, while the coefficients of
   thermal expansion of different numbers of layers are almost identical.
   This behavior results from a delicate interplay between the elastic
   stiffness coefficient and Gruneisen parameters. Finally, we find that
   the Poisson's ratio of multilayer SnSe, which is positive at T=0 K, gets
   smaller with increasing temperature and even turns negative, signaling a
   zero Poisson's ratio at a particular temperature. Overall, the present
   results provide another perspective in understanding the unusual thermal
   properties of monochalcogenides.}},

Abstract = {{Hyperelastic auxetic cellular materials are negative Poisson's ratio
   (NPR) and show transverse expansion when stretched and lateral
   contraction when compressed. The influence of the direction of force on
   the auxetic property, effect of cell angle on Poisson's ratio, buckling
   property of RH structures has been discussed in this article. The
   results show that: re-entrant hexagon (RH) structure never shows
   non-auxetic behaivour when it is subjected to load vertical force while
   it shows non-auxetic performance when the force reach a certain value
   when it is subjected to load transverse force. When stretched in the
   vertical direction and within a certain displacement, RH structures with
   smaller angle requires smaller force. Meanwhile, RH structure with
   smaller angle has more obvious auxetic property. When the RH model was
   stretched, its Poisson's ratio first decreases and then increases.
   Buckling occurs when RH is subjected to load longitudinally, and as the
   total width of the simple increases, the number of buckling curves
   increases.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials behave unconventionally under deformation, which
   enhances material properties such as resistance to indentation and
   energy absorption. Auxetics, therefore, have the potential to enhance
   sporting protective equipment. Herein, finite element modeling, additive
   manufacturing and impact testing of three auxetic lattices, and a
   conventional equivalent, with a view to advance auxetic implementation
   within sports equipment, are explored. The lattices are modeled and
   impacts are simulated between 1 and 5 J, for flat and hemispherical drop
   hammers. Simulation outputs including peak impact force, impact
   duration, maximum axial strain, and Poisson's ratio are compared with
   experimental results from equivalent impact energies on additively
   manufactured lattices, using an instrumented drop tower and a high-speed
   camera. The simulation and experimental results show broad agreement for
   all lattices and scenarios, demonstrated by comparative force versus
   time plots and maximum compression images. The benefits of developing
   and validating finite element models of three auxetic lattices (and the
   conventional honeycomb lattice) under various impact scenarios, as a
   process, are discussed, including material characterization of an
   exemplar thermoplastic polyurethane. Future work can use the models to
   further investigate auxetic lattices, selecting and tailoring candidates
   to further explore their potential application to specific personal
   protective equipment in sport.}},

Journal = {{ADVANCED ENGINEERING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Mechanical metamaterials with multi-nonpositive indexes, especially for
   a negative Poisson's ratio (NPR)/zero Poisson's ratio (ZPR), negative
   stiffness (NS)/zero stiffness (ZS), and negative thermal expansion
   (NTE)/zero thermal expansion (ZTE), have garnered significant interest
   due to their unprecedented mechanical properties and functional
   applications for advanced materials and devices. Architected materials
   with one abnormal index, such as auxetic materials, have been widely
   studied based on mature and diverse underlying mechanisms. However,
   metastructures with double or multiple abnormal indexes are rarely
   reported due to the possible coupling effects between the indexes.
   Herein, triple-negative-index (NPR, NS, and NTE) structural bistability
   is achieved using assembled composite materials with hexagonal auxetic
   frameworks and compressed buckled bistable snapping segments.
   Double-negative-one-zero-index (NS, NTE, and ZPR) or
   double-zero-one-negative-index (ZPR, ZTE, and NS) structural
   multistability is achieved using assembled composites with rectangular
   frameworks and compressed buckled bistable snapping segments.
   Particularly, angle-dependent transitions between robust structural
   bistability and multistability are achieved with controllable isotropic
   or anisotropic thermal expansion. This study demonstrates rationally
   designed metastructures with multiple abnormal indexes and the potential
   applications of multifunctional metamaterials.}},

Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{234}},
Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{Hybrid metamaterial with auxetic cellular structure and silicon filler
   was manufactured and mechanically tested for the first time with aim to
   study its enhanced mechanical properties. The uniform and graded base
   specimens with auxetic chiral cellular structure were fabricated from
   copper alloy using the Selective Electron Beam Melting (SEBM) method.
   The fabricated specimens were then fully infiltrated with silicone
   filler under vacuum conditions to avoid any voids (air gaps) and to
   achieve a high degree of homogeneity in the composite structure. The
   mechanical behaviour of hybrid specimens under quasi-static and dynamic
   compressive loading conditions was investigated experimentally. The
   results show that hybrid specimens with auxetic cellular structure and
   silicon filler exhibit much better mechanical response with increased
   stiffness and smooth response in comparison to specimens with
   conventional (non-hybrid) auxetic cellular structure. They also have a
   higher plateau stress but lower densification strain and possess much
   higher energy absorption capacity in comparison to the base specimens
   with chiral auxetic structure. This is attributed to the interaction
   between the filler and the structure, which results in the improvement
   of the macroscopic mechanical properties.}},

   Anisotropy of Human Myocardium}},
Journal = {{ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{44, SI}},
Month = {{OCT 28}},
Abstract = {{Cardiac patches represent a promising strategy for the treatment of
   myocardial infarction (MI). Here, an electroconductive cardiac patch
   that conforms to the mechanics of human myocardium is fabricated. By
   melt electrospinning writing (MEW), it is possible to fabricate an
   auxetic patch that can overcome the limited range of elasticity seen in
   conventional square patch designs. The auxetic patches can accommodate
   the strains and stresses exhibited by the human myocardium during
   diastole and systole. It is shown that the geometry of the auxetic
   patches can be fine-tuned to reflect anisotropic mechanical properties.
   The anisotropic ratio of effective stiffness (E-1/E-2) of the auxetic
   patches agrees with the directionally-dependent mechanics of the heart.
   Furthermore, in situ polymerization of doped-polypyrrole (PPy) on the
   auxetic patches confers electroconductive properties close to those
   reported of human myocardium. This approach demonstrates the potential
   use of a rational design of PPy-coated patches for their use as cardiac
   patches.}},

Abstract = {{We consider in this paper a risk reserve process where the claims and
   gains arrive according to two independent Poisson processes. While the
   gain sizes are phase-type distributed, we assume instead that the claim
   sizes are phase-type perturbed by a heavy-tailed component; that is, the
   claim size distribution is formally chosen to be phase-type with large
   probability and heavy-tailed with small probability We analyze the
   seminal Gerber-Shiu function coding the joint distribution of the time
   to ruin, the surplus immediately before ruin, and the deficit at ruin.
   We derive its value as an expansion with respect to powers of with known
   coefficients and we construct approximations from the first two terms of
   the aforementioned series. The main idea is based on the so-called fluid
   embedding that allows to put the considered risk process into the
   framework of spectrally negative Markov-additive processes and use its
   fluctuation theory developed in Ivanovs and Palmowski 2012.}},

Abstract = {{Current designs of artificial metamaterials with giant Poisson's ratios
   proposed microlattices that secrete the transverse displacement
   nonlinearly varies with the longitudinal displacement, and the Poisson's
   ratio depends on the applied strain (i.e., tailorable Poisson's ratio).
   Whereas metamaterials with tailorable Poisson's ratios would find many
   important applications, the design of a metamaterial with a giant
   Poisson's ratio that is constant over all the material deformation range
   has been a major challenge. Here, we develop a new class of
   bimaterial-3D-metamaterials with giant and strain-independent Poisson's
   ratios (i.e., Poisson's ratio is constant over the entire deformation
   range). The unit cell is 3D assembled of hinged-struts. Specially
   designed spherical hinges were utilized to give constant Poisson's
   ratios. This new class of metamaterials has been demonstrated by means
   of experimental and numerical mechanics. 15 material samples were 3D
   printed by Stereolithography (SLA) and tested. We revealed a robust
   anisotropy dependence of the Poisson's ratio. A giant negative Poisson's
   ratio of -16 was obtained utilizing a highly anisotropic unit cell of
   dissimilar materials and stiffnesses. Materials with giant and
   strain-independent Poisson's ratios provide a new class of artificial
   metamaterials, which would be used to optimize the performance of many
   existing devices, e.g., strain amplifiers and gauges.}},

Title = {{Overcome of bed-joint imperfections and improvement of actual contact in
   dry-stacked masonry}},
Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{233}},
Month = {{FEB 10}},
Abstract = {{Several researchers studied dry-stacked masonry walls (DSM) and inferred
   that the actual contact surface between the different block rows and the
   compressive strength in such walls are reduced by bed-joint
   imperfections as well as by height differences between different masonry
   blocks leading both to high stress concentration. This paper
   concentrates on the first type on imperfections. Through experimental
   tests, it analyses the influence of bed-joint roughness on the load
   bearing capacity and investigates a strategy to improve the load-bearing
   capacity of DSM by placing an additional horizontal layer on the top
   face of raw masonry blocks. First, different contact layers using
   conventional and auxetic materials were applied. Then 20 dry-stacked
   masonry prisms built with raw and improved masonry blocks were tested
   under axial compressive load until failure. Prescale Fujifilm strips
   were used to measure the actual contact in the bed-joints. Experimental
   tests show that the use of a contact layer with well-defined material
   properties enables firstly to increase the actual contact area in the
   bed-joints from 23\% to 98\% of the nominal contact area and secondly to
   increase the load-bearing capacity by 14-97\%. In addition, the contact
   layer with an auxetic material shows a significant capacity in altering
   the lateral expansion in the block units. The outcomes show that
   although the bed joint roughness influences the stress distribution in a
   dry-stacked masonry block, a contact layer with well-defined material
   properties enables to overcome the roughness induced by the bed-joint
   imperfections. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{With the development of the times, the demand for rapid detection of
   trace toxic and harmful components and circulating tumor cells is
   increasing and it is urgent to develop portable specialized detection
   instruments. Since it is difficult to directly measure the sample
   material in the trace amount detection, the method of high-enrichment of
   the trace substance based on the ion concentration polarization
   principle can make the trace substance easy to be determined. In this
   paper, a novel micro-nanofuidic preconcentrator with Koch fractal
   nanochannel surface is proposed. By coupling the Poisson-Nernst-Planck
   equation and the Navier-Stokes equation, the influence of Koch fractal
   parameters on ion enrichment was studied by numerical simulation. The
   results show that increasing the unit length L, increasing fractal time
   n, using the unstraggered structure and increasing the fractal angle
   theta can significantly increase the ion enrichment ratio. In addition,
   we found that the above means can reduce the fluid flow velocity in the
   nanochannel and thus reduce the negative influence of electroosmotic
   flow on ion enrichment. This work provides a theoretical basis for the
   design of trace detection instruments based on micro-nanofluidic
   platform.}},

Title = {{Outcomes of a Heart Failure Telemonitoring Program Implemented as the
   Standard of Care in an Outpatient Heart Function Clinic:
   Pretest-Posttest Pragmatic Study}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB 6}},
Abstract = {{Background: Telemonitoring (TM) can improve heart failure (HF) outcomes
   by facilitating patient self-care and clinical decisions. The Medly
   program enables patients to use a mobile phone to record daily HF
   readings and receive personalized self-care messages generated by a
   clinically validated algorithm. The TM system also generates alerts,
   which are immediately acted upon by the patients' existing care team.
   This program has been operating for 3 years as part of the standard of
   care in an outpatient heart function clinic in Toronto, Canada.
   Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the 6-month impact of this TM
   program on health service utilization, clinical outcomes, quality of
   life (QoL), and patient self-care.
   Methods: This pragmatic quality improvement study employed a
   pretest-posttest design to compare 6-month outcome measures with those
   at program enrollment. The primary outcome was the number of HF-related
   hospitalizations. Secondary outcomes included all-cause
   hospitalizations, emergency department visits (HF related and all
   cause), length of stay (HF related and all cause), and visits to the
   outpatient clinic. Clinical outcomes included bloodwork (B-type
   natriuretic peptide {[}BNP], creatinine, and sodium), left ventricular
   ejection fraction, and predicted survival score using the Seattle Heart
   Failure Model. QoL was measured using the Minnesota Living with Heart
   Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ) and the 5-level EuroQol 5-dimensional
   questionnaire Self-care was measured using the Self-Care of Heart
   Failure Index (SCHFI). The difference in outcome scores was analyzed
   using negative binomial distribution and Poisson regressions for the
   health service utilization outcomes and linear regressions for all other
   outcomes to control for key demographic and clinical variables.
   Results: Available data for 315 patients enrolled in the TM program
   between August 2016 and January 2019 were analyzed. A 50\% decrease in
   HF-related hospitalizations (incidence rate ratio {[}IRR]=0.50; P<.001)
   and a 24\% decrease in the number of all-cause hospitalizations
   (IRR=0.76; P=.02) were found when comparing the number of events 6
   months after program enrollment with the number of events 6 months
   before enrollment. With regard to clinical outcomes at 6 months, a 59\%
   decrease in BNP values was found after adjusting for control variables.
   Moreover, 6-month MLHFQ total scores were 9.8 points lower than baseline
   scores (P<.001), representing a clinically meaningful improvement in
   HF-related QoL. Similarly, the MLHFQ physical and emotional subscales
   showed a decrease of 5.4 points (P<.001) and 1.5 points (P=.04),
   respectively. Finally, patient self-care after 6 months improved as
   demonstrated by a 7.8-point (P<.001) and 8.5-point (P=.01) increase in
   the SCHFI maintenance and management scores, respectively. No
   significant changes were observed in the remaining secondary outcomes.
   Conclusions: This study suggests that an HF TM program, which provides
   patients with self-care support and active monitoring by their existing
   care team, can reduce health service utilization and improve clinical,
   QoL, and patient self-care outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Negative Poisson's ratio (NPR), also known as ``auxetic{''}, is a highly

   is used to describe the interaction of copper atoms. An aligned graphene
   sheet is selected as reinforcement, and a hybrid potential, namely, the
   Erhart-Albe potential, is used for the interaction between a pair of
   carbon atoms. The interaction between the carbon atom and copper atom is
   approximated by the Lennard-Jones (L-J) potential. The simulation
   results showed that both graphene and copper matrix possess in-plane

Month = {{FEB 3}},
Abstract = {{An exciting paradigm in the ongoing development of materials is the
   development of auxetic mechanical metamaterials, which can be flexibly
   designed to exhibit a unique range of physical and mechanical
   properties. Inspired by nonuniform or nonhomogeneous metamaterials and

   metamaterials with graded negative Poisson's ratios (NPRs) are studied,
   and the considered models are divided into two types of configurations:
   models with graded decreasing NPRs and models with graded increasing
   NPRs along the radial direction. The spectral element method (SEM) is
   applied to accurately predict the structural dynamic responses with a
   limited number of elements and the system scale for arbitrary
   frequencies. The static stiffness and vibro-acoustic performance of the

   results show that the bending stiffness, vibrating mode shapes and
   deformations, and sound transmission loss (STL) of the considered
   cellular structures are strongly affected by the arbitrarily patterned
   graded auxetic metamaterials. Within the studied STL frequency range
   from 1 to 1500 Hz, optimal designs of the conventional and graded
   configurations for the maximum STL are obtained for specified tonal and
   frequency band cases under cylindrical incident sound waves. The results
   show that the graded configurations have more potential than the
   conventional ones for optimal acoustic performance and that compared
   with the graded decreasing NPR models, the graded increasing NPR models
   exhibit STL increases of 6.73 dB, 1.22 dB, and 2.06 dB for the studied
   cases. Both the STL and optimal design results indicate the advantages
   of the graded increasing NPR models for use in acoustic attenuation
   applications. Thus, graded auxetic metamaterials offer a great
   opportunity for achieving unusual vibro-acoustic performance and
   extending the route to obtain an optimized set of physical properties
   for cellular metamaterials and structures. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In order to enhance the mechanical property of auxetic lattice
   structures, a new enhanced auxetic lattice structure was designed by
   embedding narrow struts into a three-dimensional (3D) re-entrant lattice
   structure. A series of enhanced lattice structures with varied
   parameters were fabricated by 3D printing combined with the molten metal
   infiltration technique. Based on the method, parameter studies were
   performed. The enhanced auxetic lattice structure was found to exhibit
   superior mechanical behaviors compared to the 3D re-entrant lattice
   structure. An interesting phenomenon showed that increasing the diameter
   of connecting struts led to less auxetic and non-auxetic structures.
   Moreover, the compressive property of the enhanced structure also
   exhibited obvious dependence on the base material and compression
   directions. The present study can provide useful information for the
   design, fabrication and application of new auxetic structures with
   enhanced properties.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a new concept to enhance the efficiency of the
   vibration energy harvesting via an intermediate booster. The boosters
   have auxetic structures and exert extra stretching strain in two
   perpendicular directions. The concept is tested on a conventional
   cantilever beam under the base excitation. The problem consists of a
   cantilever beam subjected to a body load at low frequencies. An auxetic
   substrate is bonded to the beam with a thin epoxy layer, and the
   piezoelectric (PZT) element is attached on top of it. Two different
   auxetic structures are investigated in this study. It is shown that
   employing these kinds of boosters can remarkably enhance the performance
   of the energy harvesting system. The harvesting efficiency is
   numerically evaluated in different load amplitudes and frequencies. A
   parametric study is then carried out, and effects of different
   geometrical design parameters of the auxetic boosters on the performance
   of the energy harvesting system are investigated. Comparing with the
   case in which the PZT is straightly attached to the cantilever, it is
   shown that adding such intermediate boosters at low -frequency range can
   increase the extracted power by factors of 3.9 and 7.0 for the two
   proposed geometries.}},

Abstract = {{Caching popular contents in advance is an important technique to achieve
   low latency and reduce the backhaul costs in future wireless
   communications. Considering a network with base stations distributed as
   a Poisson point process, optimal content placement caching probabilities
   are obtained to maximize the average success probability (ASP) for a
   known content popularity (CP) profile, which in practice is time-varying
   and unknown in advance. In this paper, we first propose two online
   prediction (OP) methods for forecasting CP viz., popularity prediction
   model (PPM) and Grassmannian prediction model (GPM), where the
   unconstrained coefficients for linear prediction are obtained by solving
   constrained non-negative least squares. To reduce the higher
   computational complexity per online round, two online learning (OL)
   approaches viz., weighted-follow-the-leader and
   weighted-follow-the-regularized-leader are proposed, inspired by the OP
   models. In OP, ASP difference (i.e, the gap between the ASP achieved by
   prediction and that by known content popularity) is bounded, while in
   OL, sub-linear MSE regret and linear ASP regret bounds are obtained.
   With MovieLens dataset, simulations verify that OP methods are better
   for MSE and ASP difference minimization, while the OL approaches perform
   well for the minimization of the MSE and ASP regrets.}},

Title = {{Phase contrast mediated switch of auxetic mechanism in composites of
   infilled re-entrant honeycomb microstructures}},
Journal = {{EXTREME MECHANICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{35}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Metamaterials are man-made, usually periodically microstructured
   materials with at least one uncommon property, e.g., auxeticity. Often,
   their properties are due to their specific microstructural layouts in
   addition to their constituent materials. In this work, we explore the
   influence of constituent materials on the effective elasticity of a
   two-phase composite consisting of a infilled re-entrant honeycomb
   microstructure. We show that the composite with non-auxetic constituent
   materials becomes auxetic if the Young's modulus contrast between the
   two phases exceeds a certain critical value. We reveal the existence of
   a phase contrast mediated switch of auxetic mechanism - a finding
   reported for the first time in this paper. If the re-entrant honeycomb
   phase is stiffer than the filling phase, the auxeticity stems from the
   conventional re-entrant mechanism, similar to re-entrant honeycomb
   structures. However, if the re-entrant honeycomb phase is softer than
   the filling phase, the auxeticity originates from the relative
   microscopic sliding between adjacent fillings under macroscopic axial
   loading. Our results provide guidelines on tuning the effective
   elasticity and the auxeticity of such composites by educated choices of
   the constituent materials and the underlying microstructural geometry.

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{167}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{The design and production of multifunctional materials possessing
   tailored mechanical properties and specialized characteristics is a
   major theme in modern materials science, particularly for implementation
   in high-end applications in the biomedical and electronics industry. In
   this work, a number of metamaterials with perforated architectures
   possessing the ability to exhibit a plethora of 2D auxetic responses
   with negative Poisson's ratios ranging from quasi-zero to large negative
   values (lower than -3.5), stiffnesses, stretchability and surface
   coverage properties were manufactured. These systems were produced
   through the introduction of microstructural cuts in a rubber sheet using
   direct laser cutting, and analysed using a dual approach involving
   experimental tests and Finite Element Analysis. In addition to examining
   the mechanical properties of the perforated metamaterials, the influence
   of edge effects and material thickness on the deformation behaviour of
   these systems were investigated, with re-entrant systems shown to
   possess anomalous deformation profiles which are heavily dominated by
   the boundary regions. These findings highlight the effectiveness of this
   method for the fabrication of auxetic meta-material sheets as well as
   the large variety of mechanical properties, deformation mechanisms and
   load responses which may be obtained through what may be effectively
   described as simply the introduction of patterned cuts in a thin sheet.}},

   with tunable and programmable Poisson's ratio}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{167}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{Tensegrities consisting of axially loaded strings and bars have various
   technologically important applications. In this paper, we design a
   mechanical metamaterial with tunable and programmable Poisson's ratio on
   the basis of truncated regular octahedral tensegrity (TROT). A
   theoretical model for evaluating the deformation behaviors of TROT is
   established by involving the principle of virtual work. Our experimental
   data obtained from the tests of 3D printed TROT sculptures agree well
   with theoretical predictions. By systemically investigating the
   mechanical properties of the TROT metamaterial, it is found that the
   Poisson's ratio can be programmed to a desired value in a wide
   positive/negative range through the structural prestress, initial twist
   angle, and the stiffnesses of strings/bars. This mechanical metamaterial
   can be utilized not only as elementary cells to assemble other larger
   scale of metamaterials, and also as prototypes with tunable properties
   in designing advanced machineries for applications such as robotics and
   aerospace engineering.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To determine whether higher frequency of GP visits among
   insulin-dependent patients with type 2 diabetes is associated with
   reduced hospitalizations.
   Design Nationally representative study using data from the 2013-2014
   cycle of the Canadian Community Health Survey.
   Setting Canada.
   Participants A study sample comprising 2203 insulin-dependent Canadians
   with type 2 diabetes.
   Main outcome measures The relationship between GP visits (no visits, 1-5
   visits, >= 6 visits) in the past year and the number of nights spent
   in-hospital. Zero-inflated negative binomial Poisson regression models
   were used to account for overdispersion and excess zeros.
   Results Higher numbers of GP visits were associated with spending fewer
   nights in-hospital. Patients with 1 to 5 GP visits had a significantly
   lower number of nights spent in-hospital (rate ratio of 0.38, 95\% CI
   0.25 to 0.56), as did those with 6 or more GP visits (rate ratio of
   0.57, 95\% CI 0.38 to 0.84) despite having reduced odds of not being
   hospitalized (odds ratio of 0.62, 95\% CI 0.39 to 0.95), compared with
   those who did not see a GP in the past year, after adjusting for
   confounders.
   Conclusion We found that insulin-dependent patients with diabetes who
   saw GPs more frequently were hospitalized less commonly compared with
   those who did not see a GP in the past year. Further research is needed
   to examine relationships with other types of follow-up, ideally using a
   longitudinal design.}},

Title = {{Novel Modification to the Timoshenko-Ehrenfest Theory for Inhomogeneous
   and Nonuniform Beams}},
Journal = {{AIAA JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{58}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{939-948}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Elishakoff et al. once proposed a novel physics-based, low-frequency
   correction to the Timoshenko-Ehrenfest beam theory. The corrected beam
   theory is simpler than the classical one because it leads to a single
   frequency series in the vibrating analysis, without loss of the effect
   of shear deformation and rotary inertia. In this paper, a further
   modification is proposed based on Elishakoff's correction such that the
   resulting single frequency series fits quite well with the first branch
   of the Timoshenko-Ehrenfest beam theory up to a relatively high
   frequency (i.e., the cutoff frequency of Timoshenko-Ehrenfest beams).
   Most strikingly, the present modification is found to be suitable not
   only for homogeneous and uniform beams but also for a wide class of beam
   structures with axial inhomogeneity and/or variable cross section. An
   inhomogeneous and nonuniform beam with two sharp ends is analytically
   studied in detail using several different engineering beam models, which
   fully verifies the necessity and high accuracy of the present
   modification, particularly for beam structures composed of materials
   with negative Poisson's ratio.}},

Title = {{The association between HIV infection and cervical cancer presentation

Journal = {{GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY REPORTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{31}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Our objective was to determine how HIV infection impacts cervical cancer
   stage at presentation and overall survival (OS) among Ugandan women.
   This was a prospective study of 149 women diagnosed with cervical cancer
   from 2013 to 2015 at the Uganda Cancer Institute. Poisson regression
   models were fit to calculate prevalence ratios (PR) for the association
   between HIV infection and late stage at cancer diagnosis. The
   association between HIV infection and OS after cervical cancer diagnosis
   was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards models. The cohort included
   53 HIV-positive and 96 HIV-negative participants. Median age at
   diagnosis was 44 years for HIV-positive and 54 years for HIV-negative
   participants. Seventy-seven percent of HIV-positive participants
   received antiretroviral therapy. Median baseline CD4 count was 373
   cells/mm3 for HIV-positive participants versus 926 cells/mm3 for
   HIV-negative participants. Thirty-two percent of HIV-positive
   participants were diagnosed with late stage cervical cancer (III-IV)
   versus 39\% of HIV-negative participants. No association was found
   between late stage at cancer diagnosis and HIV infection (PR adjusted
   for age, parity and transport cost 1.0, 95\%CI 0.6-1.8). Most women
   presenting for care received cancer treatment, though almost half who
   received radiotherapy did not complete treatment. The median OS was 13.7
   months for HIV-positive participants and 24.3 months for HIV-negative
   participants. After adjusting for age and stage, HIV infection was
   weakly associated with OS (HR 1.3, 95\%CI 0.8-2.2). In Uganda, cervical
   cancer is often incompletely treated and survival remains poor. HIV
   infection was not associated with cervical cancer stage at diagnosis,
   but may be weakly associated with shorter survival.}},

Abstract = {{Strain engineering can be served as an efficient tool for tuning
   physical properties of two-dimentional (2D) materials. However, the
   quantifying strain and characterizing its spatially inhomogeneous
   distribution are always challenging. Here, we report the strain-induced
   lattice vibration mode variations in monolayer black phosphorus (BP) and
   clarify the underlying mechanism resorting to the bond relaxation theory
   based on the combination of mass-spring model and Lagrangian dynamics.
   We reveal that the Ag2 and B-2g modes exhibit blue (red) shifts while
   the Ag1 mode shows a red (blue) shift through applying an armchair
   (zigzag) strain, which can be ascribed to the orientation-dependent
   lattice vibration mode variations resulting from the different responses
   of force constants. Moreover, it is found that a negative Poisson's
   ratio along the out-of-plane direction emerges when the strain is
   applied in the zigzag direction. Our results offer intriguing insights
   into the underlying physics of vibration mode variations in strained
   BP-like 2D layered materials.}},

Title = {{On the design of three-dimensional mechanical metamaterials using load
   flow visualization}},
Journal = {{MECHANICS BASED DESIGN OF STRUCTURES AND MACHINES}},
Abstract = {{Mechanical metamaterials have generated considerable interest due to
   their unique attributes such as light weight, high strength, enhanced
   energy absorption, high impact, and fracture resistance. However, most
   of the design methodologies in literature are predominantly
   computational and provide limited user-insight (especially for
   three-dimensional designs). This paper presents an alternative two-phase
   design methodology for the conceptual synthesis of three-dimensional
   tunable mechanical metamaterials. In the first phase, we obtain a
   kinematically feasible conceptual topology using a building block-based
   design approach. In the second phase, the conceptual topology is refined
   using shape/size optimization to meet specific elastic properties and
   conform to manufacturing requirements. The building block-based approach
   uses a unique visualization formulation that represents the deformation
   behavior as `load flow' in the constituent members. An immersive virtual
   reality tool is developed to mitigate the visual difficulty in the
   design of three-dimensional microstructures. Furthermore, the load flow
   formulation is used to propose a qualitative classification scheme for
   negative Poisson's ratio elastic metamaterials based on relative values
   of shear moduli and bi-axial elastic stiffnesses. The efficacy of the
   framework is illustrated through the design of microstructures with
   negative Poisson's ratios in spatial directions and the ability to
   achieve isotropic microstructures from a qualitative understanding of
   the conceptual designs. Such a framework can lead to the design of
   synthetic materials that have potential applications in multifunctional
   structures, shape morphing structures, and soft robotics.}},

   corrugated tubes under quasi-static axial loading}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{204}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{This paper proposes a bio-inspired multi-cell corrugated tube for use in
   energy absorption. The proposed structure consists of two parts: an
   inner rib and a corrugated tube into which the inner rib is inserted.
   The structure of the corrugated tube is specified using a cosine
   expression based on two parameters, that is, the number of cosine wave
   crests and their amplitude. Two inner ribs with different sections
   (X-shaped and Y-shaped) were designed and the crashworthiness of the
   resulting tubes was analyzed. The crashworthiness was determined using
   the finite-element program LS-DYNA. The numerical results show that the
   modes of collapse of the multi-cell corrugated tubes can be classified
   into four types: unstable, diamond, ring, and mixed modes. Each mode is
   strongly affected by the number of cosine wave crests and their
   amplitude. By analyzing the force-displacement performance and
   crashworthiness indicators, it was found that tubes with appropriate
   number of wave crests and amplitudes, and inner rib shape experience
   lower initial peak forces and increase energy absorption and specific
   energy absorption (compared with a traditional straight tube with the
   same inner rib). The undulation in the load-carrying capacity is also
   decreased. Thus, the multi-cell corrugated tubes have good
   crashworthiness.}},

   mechanisms within the underlying unit cell. The standard first-order
   Computational Homogenization (CH) approach is inadequate in capturing
   this coupling effect. Moreover, a size effect arising from the
   interactions between micro and macro length scales cannot be accounted
   for. In this contribution, the micromorphic CH framework developed in
   Biswas and Poh (2017), Biswas et al. (2019), is reformulated for 2D
   tetra-chiral solids to address these limitations. Together with the
   standard macro-distortion tensor, an additional kinematic variable is
   introduced to characterize the deformation and rotation of the central
   ring. These two kinematic fields, each characterizing a particular
   aspect of the unit cell deformation, enable the micromorphic framework
   to adequately characterize the underlying dominant deformation modes.
   The predictive capability of the micromorphic CH framework is
   demonstrated through three benchmark problems in plane strain condition.
   Considering an axial loading problem, it is shown that the proposed
   micromorphic framework accurately captures the coupling between internal
   ring rotation and stretching of tangential ligaments. The predictive
   capability of the micromorphic approach is next demonstrated with a flat
   punch indentation problem in a regime without a clear separation of
   length scales. The homogenized micromorphic model predicts the correct
   global force-displacement response, as well as the underlying
   deformation mechanisms. Finally, the capability of the micromorphic
   framework in capturing both distortional and rotational modes of the
   central ring is demonstrated through the axial loading of a tapering
   plate. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{3D composite metamaterial with magnetic inclusions exhibiting negative
   stiffness and auxetic behaviour}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},

Volume = {{187}},

Abstract = {{In this work, through the use of a theoretical model and experimental
   testing, we investigate a novel three-dimensional mechanical
   metamaterial composed of structural units consisting of two
   arrowhead-like elements with magnetic inclusions. We show that such
   system has a capability to exhibit negative Poisson's ratio and negative
   incremental stiffness at the same time. We also show that both the type
   of the stiffness exhibited by the system and its magnitude can be solely
   controlled via the orientation of magnetic inclusions within the
   structure and the magnitude of the magnetic moment associated with
   magnetic inclusions respectively. More specifically, for a particular
   example of magnetic inclusions used in the experiment, the stiffness
   could assume an arbitrary value from the range approximately between -5
   kN/m and 5 kN/m depending on the stage of the mechanical deformation and
   aforementioned factors. This range can be also conveniently adjusted
   depending on the size and properties of magnetic inclusions. This in
   turn allows to adjust mechanical response of the considered structure in
   accordance to a particular application without a need of reconstructing
   the system which would not normally be possible for conventional
   nonmagnetic systems attributing negative stiffness to their elastic
   properties. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Title = {{Numerical technique for the 3D microarchitecture design of elastic
   composites inspired by crystal symmetries}},
Journal = {{COMPUTER METHODS IN APPLIED MECHANICS AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{359}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{A numerical methodology developed for the microarchitecture design of 3D
   elastic two-phase periodic composites with effective isotropic
   properties close to the theoretical bounds is here presented and
   analyzed. This methodology is formulated as a topology optimization
   problem and is implemented using a level-set approach jointly with
   topological derivative.
   The most salient characteristic of this methodology is the imposition of
   preestablished crystal symmetries to the designed topologies; we
   integrate a topological optimization formulation with crystal symmetries
   to design mechanical metamaterials.
   The computational homogenization of the composite elastic properties is
   determined using a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) technique. Due to the
   design domains are the primitive cells of Bravais lattices compatible
   with the space group imposed to the material layout, we have adapted the
   FFT technique to compute the effective properties in 3D parallelepiped
   domains.
   In this work, to find the topologies satisfying the proposed targets, we
   test four space groups of the cubic crystal system. Thus, the
   achievement of composites with effective elasticity tensor having cubic
   symmetry is guaranteed, and the isotropic response is then enforced by
   adding only one scalar constraint to the topology optimization problem.
   To assess the methodology, the following microarchitectures are designed
   and reported: two auxetic composites, three pentamode materials, and one
   maximum stiffness composite. With only one exception, all the remaining
   topologies display effective elastic properties with Zener coefficients
   approximating to 1. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},
