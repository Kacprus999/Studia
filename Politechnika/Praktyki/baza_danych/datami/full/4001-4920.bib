Abstract = {{Background: Injection drug users (IDUs) have estimated mortality rates
   over 10 times higher than the general population; much of this excess
   mortality is HIV-associated. Few mortality estimates among IDUs from
   developing countries, including India, exist.
   Methods: IDUs (1158) were recruited in Chennai from April 2005 to May
   2006; 293 were HIV positive. Information on deaths and causes was
   obtained through outreach workers and family/network members. Mortality
   rates and standardized mortality ratios were calculated; multivariate
   Poisson regression was used to identify predictors of mortality.
   Results: We observed 85 deaths over 1998 person-years (p-y) of follow-up
   {[}mortality rate (MR) 4.25 per 100 p-y; 95\%. confidence interval (CI)
   = 3.41-5.23]. The overall standardized mortality ratio was 11.1; for
   HIV-positive IDUs, the standardized mortality ratio was 23.9. Mortality
   risk among HIV-positive IDUs (MR: 8.88 per 100 p-y) was nearly three
   times that of negative IDUs (MR: 3.03 per 100 p-y) and increased with
   declining immune status (CD4 cells > 350: 5.44 per 100 p-y vs. CD4 cells
   <= 200: 34.5 per 100 p-y). This association persisted after adjustment
   for confounders. The leading causes of mortality in both HIV negative
   and positive IDUs were overdose (n = 22), AIDS (n = 14), tuberculosis (n
   = 8) and accident/trauma (n = 9).
   Conclusion: Substantial mortality was observed in this cohort with the
   highest rates among HIV-positive IDUs with CD4 counts of less than 350
   cells/mu l. Although, in these 2 years, non-AIDS deaths outnumbered
   AIDS-related deaths, the relative contribution of AIDS-associated
   mortality is likely to increase with advancing HIV disease progression.
   These data reinforce the need for interventions to reduce the harms
   associated with drug use and increase HAART access among IDUs in
   Chennai. (C) 2009 Wolters Kluwer Health vertical bar Lippincott Williams

Abstract = {{The influence of temperature and Freeze-Thaw (FT) processes on the
   mechanical properties of frozen soils were investigated in the
   laboratory in order to give a better understanding of changes in
   engineering properties of frozen soils. The experimental data revealed a
   dependence of compressional and shear wave velocity of frozen soils on
   temperature, soil type and FT cycles. Compressional wave velocity showed
   a strong correlation to the unfrozen water content dependent on soil
   type, while shear wave velocity was mainly influenced by the ice content
   and the soil matrix. Compressional and shear wave velocity changed for
   samples subject to FT cycling, which appears to be caused by alterations
   in the soil structure. Elastic constants were calculated based on the
   wave propagation theory and compared to results from uniaxial
   compression tests. The dynamic elastic modulus, dynamic shear modulus
   and compressive strength increased with descending temperature. FT
   cycles reduced the compressive strength, and influenced the dynamic
   elastic constants. Poisson's ratios of all tested soils not subject to
   FT cycling decreased upon a change in negative temperature; while the
   opposite trend was observed for soils influenced by FT cycles.}},

Abstract = {{A strain k center dot p model is used to investigate lattice temperature

Abstract = {{The theory of elasticity predicts a variety of phenomena associated with
   solids that possess a negative Poisson's ratio. The fabrication of
   metamaterials with a `designed' microstructure that exhibit a Poisson's
   ratio approaching the thermodynamic limits of 1/2 and -1 increases the
   likelihood of realising these phenomena for applications. In this work,
   we investigate the properties of a layered composite, with alternating
   layers of materials with negative and positive Poisson's ratio
   approaching the thermodynamic limits. Using the finite element method to
   simulate uniaxial loading and indentation of a free standing composite,
   we observed an increase in the resistance to mechanical deformation
   above the average value of the two materials. Even though the greatest
   increase in stiffness is gained as the thermodynamic limits are
   approached, a significant amount of added stiffness can be attained,
   provided that the Young's modulus of the negative Poisson's ratio
   material is not less than that of the positive Poisson's ratio material.

Abstract = {{Background: Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) is the leading cause of
   genital ulcer disease in developing countries, including Brazil, and is
   especially prevalent among men who have sex with men (MSM). HSV-2
   infection represents a risk factor for the acquisition and transmission
   of other sexually transmitted diseases. The goal of the present
   cross-sectional study was to estimate HSV-2 seroprevalence and to
   determine the factors associated with HSV-2 seropositivity in
   HIV-negative high-risk MSM from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
   Methods: Stored sera were tested to estimate HSV-2 seroprevalence, while
   socio-demographic and sexual behavior data were used to measure
   associations between risk factors and HSV-2 seropositivity. Using the
   Poisson regression model with robust variance, prevalence ratios (PR)
   were used to estimate de degree of association between risk factors and
   HSV-2 seropositivity in bivariate and multivariate analyses.
   Results: Seroprevalence of HSV-2 was of 45.7\% (184 out of 403). Factors
   independently associated with HSV-2 seroprevalence in the multivariate
   model were: older age (>= 26 years, PR: 1.41 95\% Confidence Interval:
   1.11-1.78), non- white race (PR: 1.32 95\% CI: 1.06-1.64), positive
   serology for syphilis (PR: 1.65 95\% CI: 1.33-2.05), positive serology
   for hepatitis B (PR: 1.25 95\% CI: 0.99-1.57), stable male partner in
   the past 6 months (PR: 1.42 95\% CI: 1.12-1.79), and unprotected anal
   sex with a stable female partner (PR: 1.46 95\% CI: 1.05-2.04) in the 6
   months preceding the cross-sectional assessment.
   Conclusion: The present study made evident a high prevalence of HSV-2
   infection in a sample of HIV-negative high-risk MSM from Rio de Janeiro.
   This finding indicates the need and urgency for implementing integrated
   programs for the prevention of HSV-2 and other sexually transmitted
   diseases, and, in particular, programs targeting high-risk MSM.}},

Abstract = {{Improved electrically powered artificial muscles are needed for
   generating force, moving objects, and accomplishing work. Carbon
   nanotube aerogel sheets are the sole component of new artificial muscles
   that provide giant elongations and elongation rates of 220\% and (3.7 x
   10(4))\% per second, respectively, at operating temperatures from 80 to
   1900 kelvin. These solid-state-fabricated sheets are enthalpic rubbers
   having gaslike density and specific strength in one direction higher
   than those of steel plate. Actuation decreases nanotube aerogel density
   and can be permanently frozen for such device applications as
   transparent electrodes. Poisson's ratios reach 15, a factor of 30 higher
   than for conventional rubbers. These giant Poisson's ratios explain the
   observed opposite sign of width and length actuation and result in rare
   properties: negative linear compressibility and stretch densification.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanisms behind the load building capabilities of a hyperbranched
   polymer (HBP) in polyurethane (PU) foams have been investigated, using
   microscopy techniques and mechanical analyses. By broadening the
   traditional uniaxial compression characterization of PU foams to include
   combined shear deformations and compression behavior, an apparent
   Poisson ratio of the foam could be obtained in situ. The Poisson ratio
   as function of uniaxial compression ratio of the foam was thus studied
   for foams filled with Styrene Acrylonitrile (SAN) and foams containing
   HBP. Generally a window of deformation ratios could be defined in which
   the Poisson ratio was negative. The width of this window varied
   systematically with the SAN loading, where an increase in SAN particle
   loading resulted in a broadening of the negative Poisson ratio window.

Abstract = {{Prismanes have been shown to exhibit negative Poisson's ratio (auxetic

   studied by using quantum mechanical ab initio calculations. The unusual
   mechanical behavior of prismanes upon stretching was traced to the
   relaxation of geometrical distortion existing in the ground state. The
   increase of the Poissonic effect on the ring size correlates well with
   the Thorpe-Ingold effect. In biprismanes where the CH units in the
   external rings are replaced by nitrogen, the effect is accentuated.
   Substitution of the hydrogens by fluorine atoms markedly reduces the
   effect, this being an interesting example of substituent effect on

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a comparative analysis between the cyclic
   loading tensile behaviour of conventional and auxetic thermoplastic PU
   foams. While the two types of foam share the same base material (open
   cell PU-PE), one batch is transformed into an auxetic one (i.e.,
   negative Poisson's ratio) using a special manufacturing process
   involving moulding and exposure to particular temperature profiles to
   stabilise the transformation of the microstructure. The effect of the
   stiffness degradation and accumulation of energy dissipation versus the
   number of cycles are discussed for different loading levels r. The
   results show that the fatigue behaviour until failure, subjected to
   cyclic loading depends on the loading levels and occur in three stages.
   The results obtained shows also that the auxetic foam have enhanced
   characteristics under static loading and tensile fatigue compared to the
   conventional parent phase form. Crown Copyright (C) 2008 Published by

Abstract = {{Properties of fully nonlinear ion-acoustic solitary waves in a plasma
   with positive-negative ions and nonthermal electrons are investigated.
   For this purpose, the hydrodynamic equations for the positive-negative
   ions, nonthermal electron density distribution, and the Poisson equation
   are used to derive the energy integral equation with a new Sagdeev
   potential. The latter is analyzed to examine the existence regions of
   the solitary pulses. It is found that the solitary excitations strongly
   depend on the mass and density ratios of the positive and negative ions
   as well as the nonthermal electron parameter. Numerical solution of the
   energy integral equation clears that both positive and negative
   potentials exist together. It is found that faster solitary pulses are
   taller and narrower. Furthermore, increasing the electron nonthermality
   parameter (negative-to-positive ions density ratio) decreases
   (increases) the localized excitation amplitude but increases (decreases)
   the pulse width. The present model is used to investigate the solitary
   excitations in the (H+,O-2(-)) and (H+,H-) plasmas, where they are
   presented in the D- and F-regions of the Earth's ionosphere. This
   investigation should be helpful in understanding the salient features of
   the fully nonlinear ion-acoustic solitary waves in space and in
   laboratory plasmas where two distinct groups of ions and non-Boltzmann
   distributed electrons are present.}},

Title = {{Effective elastic mechanical properties of single layer graphene sheets}},
Journal = {{NANOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{FEB 11}},
Abstract = {{The elastic moduli of single layer graphene sheet (SLGS) have been a
   subject of intensive research in recent years. Calculations of these
   effective properties range from molecular dynamic simulations to use of
   structural mechanical models. On the basis of mathematical models and
   calculation methods, several different results have been obtained and
   these are available in the literature. Existing mechanical models employ
   Euler-Bernoulli beams rigidly jointed to the lattice atoms. In this
   paper we propose truss-type analytical models and an approach based on
   cellular material mechanics theory to describe the in-plane linear
   elastic properties of the single layer graphene sheets. In the cellular
   material model, the C-C bonds are represented by equivalent mechanical
   beams having full stretching, hinging, bending and deep shear beam
   deformation mechanisms. Closed form expressions for Young's modulus, the
   shear modulus and Poisson's ratio for the graphene sheets are derived in
   terms of the equivalent mechanical C-C bond properties. The models
   presented provide not only quantitative information about the mechanical
   properties of SLGS, but also insight into the equivalent mechanical
   deformation mechanisms when the SLGS undergoes small strain uniaxial and
   pure shear loading. The analytical and numerical results from finite
   element simulations show good agreement with existing numerical values
   in the open literature. A peculiar marked auxetic behaviour for the C-C
   bonds is identified for single graphene sheets under pure shear loading.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{To date, microstructural modelling of auxetic materials has relied
   mainly on the assumption of both a regular and a homogeneous
   microstructure present throughout the bulk material. The disorder within
   a material is seen as something undesirable, with the expectation that
   disorder or heterogeneity will tend to reduce the range of properties
   available. In this work the presence of short-range variations in the
   elastic Moduli are considered together with the resulting effect on a
   material's Poisson's ratio. It is shown that such variations alone can
   Cause a Material with a mean positive Poisson's ratio to become negative
   (auxetic). In addition, anisotropic variations can enhance the magnitude
   of a negative Poisson's ratio. (C) 2008 Acta Materialia Inc. Published

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to investigate factors associated with
   negative self-rated oral health. Elderly subjects from the Brazilian
   Ministry of Health's oral health survey (2002-2003) who rated their own
   oral health as bad or very bad were compared to those who rated their
   oral health as excellent, good, or fair, using prevalence ratios based
   on Poisson regression. The minority (870; 17\%) gave their own oral
   health a negative rating. Negative self-rated oral health was less
   prevalent among those with 1-9 teeth and the edentulous, and more
   prevalent among blacks, mixed-race, and indigenous, those who had never
   used dental service, with soft tissue alterations, who reported little
   pain or medium to intense pain, rated their own appearance and chewing
   as fair or bad or very bad, reported that their oral health limited
   their social interaction a little or considerably, and reported needing
   dental treatment (PR = 1,47; 95\% CI: 1.20-1.79). Despite their
   precarious oral conditions, the majority gave their oral health a
   positive rating. Subjective conditions were more heavily associated with
   self-rated oral health than were objective conditions. The findings
   suggest unequal oral health conditions and allow orienting public
   policies aimed at oral health and quality of life.}},

Abstract = {{This paper aims to investigate the fresh and hardened properties of
   lightweight aggregate concretes that are prepared with the use of
   recycled plastic waste sourced from scraped PVC pipes to replace river
   sand as fine aggregates. A number of laboratory prepared concrete mixes
   were tested, in which river sand was partially replaced by PVC plastic
   waste granules in percentages of 0\%, 5\%, 15\%, 30\% and 45\% by
   volume. Two major findings are identified. The positive side shows that
   the concrete prepared with a partial replacement by PVC was lighter
   (lower density), was more ductile (greater Poisson's ratios and reduced
   modulus of elasticity), and had lower drying shrinkage and higher
   resistance to chloride ion penetration. The negative side reveals that
   the workability, compressive strength and tensile splitting strength of
   the concretes were reduced. The results gathered would form a part of
   useful information for recycling PVC plastic waste in lightweight

Abstract = {{The longitudinal and transverse strains were measured as a function of

   was observed in the electric-field-induced ferroelectric phase after the
   antiferroelectric-to-ferroelectric phase transition. Therefore, an
   auxetic behavior was established in monolithic ferroelectric
   polycrystalline ceramics under electrical loads. The behavior is
   characterized by a negative strain ratio that is analogous to the
   Poisson's ratio. The transverse expansion leads to a large hydrostatic

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{JAN 14}},
Abstract = {{Analytical expressions have been developed in which the elastic
   behaviour of the alpha-quartz and alpha-cristobalite molecular
   tetrahedral frameworks of both silica and germania are modelled by
   rotation, or dilation or concurrent rotation and dilation of the
   tetrahedra. Rotation and dilation of the tetrahedra both produce
   negative Poisson's ratios (auxetic behaviour), whereas both positive and
   negative values are possible when these mechanisms act concurrently.
   Concurrent rotation and dilation of the tetrahedra reproduces with
   remarkable accuracy both the positive and negative nu(31) Poisson's
   ratios observed for silica alpha-quartz and alpha-cristobalite,
   respectively, when loaded in the x(3) direction. A parametric fit of the
   concurrent model to the germania alpha-quartz experimental nu(31)
   Poisson's ratio is used to predict nu(31) for germania
   alpha-cristobalite, for which no experimental value exists. This is
   predicted to be +0.007. Strain-dependent nu(31) trends, due to
   concurrent rotation and dilation in the silica structures, are in broad
   agreement with those predicted from pair-potential calculations,
   although significant differences do occur in the absolute values. With
   the model of concurrent dilation and rotation of the tetrahedra we
   predict that an alternative uniaxial stress (sigma(3))-induced phase
   exists for both silica, alpha-quartz and alpha-cristobalite, and
   germania, alpha-cristobalite, having geometries in reasonable agreement
   with beta-quartz and idealized beta-cristobalite, respectively.}},

Title = {{Structural factors associated with an increased risk of HIV and sexually
   transmitted infection transmission among street-involved youth}},
Journal = {{BMC PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{JAN 9}},
Abstract = {{Background: The prevalence of HIV and sexually transmitted infections
   (STIs) among street-involved youth greatly exceed that of the general
   adolescent population; however, little is known regarding the structural
   factors that influence disease transmission risk among this population.
   Methods: Between September 2005 and October 2006, 529 street-involved
   youth were enroled in a prospective cohort known as the At Risk Youth
   Study (ARYS). We examined structural factors associated with number of
   sex partners using quasi-Poisson regression and consistent condom use
   using logistic regression.
   Results: At baseline, 415 (78.4\%) were sexually active, of whom 253
   (61.0\%) reported multiple sex partners and 288 (69.4\%) reported
   inconsistent condom use in the past six months. In multivariate
   analysis, self-reported barriers to health services were inversely
   associated with consistent condom use (adjusted odds ratio {[}aOR] =
   0.52, 95\% CI: 0.25-1.07). Structural factors that were associated with
   greater numbers of sex partners included homelessness (adjusted
   incidence rate ratio {[}aIRR] = 1.54, 95\% CI: 1.11-2.14) and having an
   area restriction that affects access to services (aIRR = 2.32, 95\% CI:
   1.28-4.18). Being searched or detained by the police was significant for
   males (aIRR = 1.36, 95\% CI: 1.02-1.81).
   Conclusion: Although limited by its cross-sectional design, our study
   found several structural factors amenable to policy-level interventions
   independently associated with sexual risk behaviours. These findings
   imply that the criminalization and displacement of street-involved youth
   may increase the likelihood that youth will engage in sexual risk
   behaviours and exacerbate the negative impact of resultant health
   outcomes. Moreover, our findings indicate that environmental-structural
   interventions may help to reduce the burden of these diseases among
   street youth in urban settings.}},

Abstract = {{Poisson's ratio (PR), the relation between lateral contraction of an
   elastic rod when subjected to a longitudinal extension, has a long and
   interesting history. For isotropic bodies, it can theoretically range
   from + 1/2 to - 1; the experimental gamut for anisotropic materials is
   even larger. For the vast majority of materials the PR is positive for
   all combinations of directions. But as far back as the 1800s, Voigt and
   others found that for some materials negative values were encountered.
   Negative PR (nPR) values remained for man), years merely a curiosity,
   but more recently some of the interesting technological consequences
   have come to he recognized {[}1-3]. Some of the counterintuitive
   acoustic possibilities of nPRs are analogous, in a certain fashion, to
   those arising with negative refraction electromagnetic materials {[}4].
   Even when a material does not have nPR properties, if it is
   piezoelectric, then the PR can be altered, sometimes by, appreciable
   amounts, by changing the electrical boundary conditions {[}5-6]. We
   review Poisson's ratio in crystals, describing technologically important
   materials that have small, or negative PRs. Potential applications of
   the nPR property are also mentioned.}},

Abstract = {{Classical elasticity theory indicates that the existence of negative
   Poisson's ratios (NPRs), i.e. auxetic behavior in materials, will result
   in an increase in shear stiffness. Motivated by the assumption of
   gaining potential structural benefits, this study undertook to examine
   two main issues: (i) the feasibility of inducing auxetic behavior into
   thin-walled structures; and (ii) in cases where it is possible, whether
   it leads to shear stiffness enhancement. In the present study, the
   geometry of a membrane was chosen as a geometric model to address these
   issues. The results obtained in this study reveal that on the one hand
   the model effective elastic properties, E{*} and G{*}, are lower than
   those of the material the Surface is fabricated from, E{*} similar to
   1\% of the material elastic modulus and G{*} similar to 80\% of its
   shear modulus. On the other hand, the obtained properties are much
   higher than those observed for other available auxetics like honeycombs,

Abstract = {{The paper discusses the behavior of beams with external damping patches
   made of auxetic materials. The damping force is modeled by using the
   nonlocal theory. Unlike the local models, the nonlocal damping force is
   modeled as a weighted average of the velocity field over the spatial
   domain, determined by a kernel function based on distance measures. The
   performance with respect to the eigenvalues is discussed next, in order
   to avoid resonance. The optimization is performed by determining the

Abstract = {{Objective: Chinese cancer registration data provide information on the
   national cancer burden but how representative they are of the real
   situation is uncertain. Mortality data from cancer registration and the
   third national death survey were therefore compared to determine the

   Registration Annual Report, 2004, China and the third National Death
   Survey, 2004-205. Negative binomial regression was used to estimate
   site-specific cancer mortality rate ratios between the two. Results: The
   estimated cancer mortality for all sites from national cancer
   registration was representative for China, especially in urban areas,
   but mortality was over-estimated for rural areas, with large differences
   in some cancer site-specific mortalities. Conclusion: Although cancer
   registration data are representative at the country level and for urban
   areas, they may not reflect real cancer burden in rural areas,
   particularly with some cancer types. Setting up new cancer registries in
   non-high risk areas in rural areas should be enhanced in further cancer
   surveillance plans.}},

Title = {{HER-2 positive breast cancer: decreasing proportion but stable incidence
   in Finnish population from 1982 to 2005}},
Journal = {{BREAST CANCER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{3}},
Abstract = {{Introduction Classification of breast cancers according to the HER-2
   oncogene status is of central importance in the selection of
   post-surgical therapies. A decrease in the proportion of HER2-positive
   breast cancer has been suspected, but no data on the incidence trends at
   population level have been reported.
   Methods We studied the proportion of HER-2-positive breast cancers by
   chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) in three cohorts ( years 1982
   to 1986 (n = 310), 1989 to 1992 ( n = 108), and 2004 to 2005 ( n = 713))
   in the population of the Pirkanmaa hospital district ( approximately
   220,000 women). Cancer incidence rates were age-adjusted to the world
   standard population.
   Results The proportion of HER-2-positive breast cancer declined from
   21.6\% ( average in 1982 to 1986) to 13.6\% ( average in 2004 to 2005).
   However, during the same time period the age-adjusted incidence of all
   invasive breast cancers had increased by 40\%. These opposite trends
   balanced each other and indicated that the incidence of HER-2-positive
   breast cancer has remained unchanged (Poisson regression coefficient for
   time trend 1.000; 95\% CI = 0.989 to 1.012). In contrast, the incidence
   of HER-2-negative cancer showed 2\% annual increase (Poisson regression
   coefficient 1.021, 95\% CI = 1.016 to 1.026). Although HER-2-negative
   cancers were more likely to be diagnosed by mammography screening, the
   changes were more likely to be explained by etiological risk factors
   favoring HER-2-negative (and hormone receptorpositive) disease such as
   menopausal hormone therapy.
   Conclusions These results document a significant decrease in the
   proportion of HER-2-positive breast cancer. However, the incidence of
   HER-2-positive cancer at the population level was found to be unchanged.}},

   mesh was applied to solve the continuity equations and Poisson's
   equation in a fluid model to calculate the negative streamer pulse
   waveforms. The values of the various coefficients for humid air,
   considered as a mixture of air and water vapor, were estimated by linear
   interpolation from the values for the separate `gases'. The simulation
   results agreed with the trends in the experimental results of our
   previous study: the average amplitudes of the negative streamers
   decreased with a rise of pressure or humidity. The decrease of current
   amplitude with the rise of pressure was mainly due to the decrease in
   the electron density and hence the conductivity of the streamer channel
   as a result of the increase of attachment rate.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction. No study has focused on the nationwide epidemiology of
   severe and fatal rattlesnake bites during the last 25 years. We examined
   rates and temporal trends of severe and fatal rattlesnake bites across
   the United States. Our hypothesis was that nationwide annual rates of
   both severe and fatal outcomes from rattlesnake bites have remained
   unchanged over time. Methods. This study retrospectively analyzed all
   human rattlesnake bites published in the Annual Reports of the American
   Association of Poison Control Centers from 1983 through 2007. Annual
   rates of severe (major) and fatal rattlesnake bites were calculated
   using the annual number of major outcomes and fatalities as respective
   numerators and the total annual number of single rattlesnake bites
   (exposures) as denominators. Negative binomial and Poisson regressions
   were used to examine trends of severe and fatal rattlesnake bites over
   time. Results. Annually, from 1985 to 2007, the incidence rate of major
   outcomes decreased by 2\% per year (incidence rate ratio = 0.980; CI =
   0.967-0.993), corresponding to an absolute annual rate decrease of two
   major outcomes per 1,000 bites per year. Annual rates of fatalities
   showed no statistically significant change from 1983 through 2007.
   Conclusion. This is the first study to examine rates and trends of
   published severe and fatal rattlesnake bites across the United States
   over the past 25 years. Annual rates of severe rattlesnake bites,
   derived from the published Annual Reports of the American Association of
   Poison Control Centers, have significantly decreased over time, whereas
   rates of fatal rattlesnake bites have remained unchanged.}},

Abstract = {{At the present, coal bump research aims mostly at coal adjoining the
   laneway free surface but neglects the dynamic condition of laneway deep
   coal. It is based on the traditional static or dynamic theory in
   modelling with invariable boundaries systems. Actually, the stress state
   surrounding deep coal is dynamically changed with the excavation of
   working face or laneway, which may result in coal bump. This topic is
   rarely studied now. According to the representative characteristics of
   coal bump, the time-variation structure mechanics theory is applied to
   clarify the initiation mechanism of coal bump. Inherent parameters of
   coal self-sustaining bearing structures, such as load conditions,
   physics characteristics and boundaries, etc.,are time-varying. The
   time-varying structure model is established and it can be further
   simplified to a mechanics model. The time-varying mechanics model
   indicates that the mass-decreased-with-time coal structure can give
   negative damping which can cause dynamic instability and lead to coal
   bump. By using the finite element analysis in the software ANSYS, coal
   bump occurrence can be well simulated when coal is softened by
   decreasing its elastic modulus E and poisson ratio mu. The results can
   be helpful in explaining the mechanism of coal bump.}},

Abstract = {{This paper analyzes the stability, margin, and performance of
   Ultra-Thin-Body (UTB) SOI 6T/8T SRAM cells operating in subthreshold
   region. An analytical SNM model for UTB SOI 6T/8T SRAM cells operating
   in the subthreshold region is presented to investigate the Read SNM
   (RSNM) and Write SNM (WSNM). Our results indicate that back-gating
   technique is more effective in the subthreshold region than in the
   superthreshold region for improving RSNM and WSNM. The UTB SOI 6T SRAM
   cell with back-gating technique to increase the strength of the pull-up
   transistors and decrease the strength of the pass-gate transistors shows
   comparable RSNM in the subthreshold region with the 10T bulk
   subthreshold SRAM cell and an improvement in RSNM variation. Due to
   better electrostatic integrity, back-gating technique (pull-up PFET with
   positive back-gate bias, pull-down/pass-gate NFET's with negative
   back-gate bias) mitigates the 6T UTB SOI SRAM RSNM variation
   significantly with some improvement in RSNM. Increasing cell beta-ratio
   shows limited improvement on RSNM and has no benefit on SNM variability
   for subthreshold operation. The UTB SOI 8T SRAM cell exhibits RSNM 2X
   larger than the 6T SRAM cell in the subthreshold region. Mixed-mode
   device/circuit simulations show that 6T/8T UTB SOI SRAMs operating in
   the subthreshold region can meet/support the stability, leakage/density,
   and frequency requirements for intended application space of
   subthreshold SRAMs.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, technologies for the production of cellular materials have
   been proposed that allow for a seamless change of the geometries of such
   materials from being similar to sintered hollow sphere structures to
   resembling comparatively regular polyhedra. In order to investigate, how
   the linear elastic properties Of Such materials are effected by this
   change in geometry, analyses of the expansion process are carried out by
   the finite element method for obtaining cell wall thickness
   distributions. These material distributions are then transferred to
   finite element unit cell models that are suitable for predicting the
   effective, macroscopic elastic properties. It is found that Young's
   modulus, as well as the shear modulus increase monotonically with
   increasing degree of expansion. Furthermore, negative Poisson's ratios
   are predicted for configurations that are comparable to sintered hollow
   sphere structures, while positive Poisson's ratios are observed for
   highly expanded configurations.}},

Abstract = {{Negative Poisson's ratio, while thermodynamically permitted, is only
   observed in some natural crystals in certain directions. All other known
   cases of negative Poisson's ratio are the man-made structures which
   exhibit this property macroscopically. One class of these structures
   includes re-entrant foams and special structures with springs and
   hinges. Another class is constituted by materials consisting of a matrix
   with positive Poisson's ratio with embedded microstructural elements
   producing macroscopic negative Poisson's ratio. In the first class, we
   propose structures made of balls bonded by links with high shear to
   normal stiffness ratio. In the second class, we introduce materials
   filled with cracks with suppressed relative shearing of the faces. In
   the latter case we determine the effective moduli for multiscale crack
   distributions using the differential self-consistent method and show
   that the minimum value of Poisson's ratio achievable in this way is
   -1/3. Materials with positive and negative Poisson's ratio can be
   combined into hybrid materials. For multiscale distribution of
   inclusions (wide distribution of sizes with the same concentration at
   each scale) we show that negative Poisson's ratio spherical inclusions
   in a positive Poisson's ratio elastic isotropic matrix considerably
   increase the effective Young's modulus even when the Young's moduli of
   the matrix and inclusions are the same.}},

Abstract = {{An effective anisotropic continuum formulation for auxetic cellular
   materials is the objective of this paper. A skeleton is modelled as a
   plane beam elastic structure with stiff joints. The skeleton topology,
   forming concave polygons, is responsible for negative Poisson's ratio
   effect. The essential macroscopic features of mechanical behaviour are
   inferred from the deformation response of a representative volume
   element using the framework of micromechanical analysis. The strain
   energy of a unit cell is calculated by adding the tensile, shearing and
   bending strain energy of individual members. The equivalent continuum is
   based on averaging this energy, thus formulating the basis for computing
   the anisotropic stiffness matrix. The structural mechanics methodology
   and ANSYS finite element code are applied to solve the beam model of the
   skeleton. Graphical representation of certain material constants such as
   Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, shear modulus and generalized bulk
   modulus is given. The results of included parametric study may be used
   for proper choice of geometric and material data of the skeleton for a

Abstract = {{Water and hydrous minerals play a key part in geodynamic processes at
   subduction zones(1-3) by weakening the plate boundary, aiding slip and
   permitting subduction - and indeed plate tectonics - to occur(4). The
   seismological signature of water within the forearc mantle wedge is
   evident in anomalies with low seismic shear velocity marking
   serpentinization(5-7). However, seismological observations bearing on
   the presence of water within the subducting plate itself are less well
   documented. Here we use converted teleseismic waves to obtain
   observations of anomalously high Poisson's ratios within the subducted
   oceanic crust from the Cascadia continental margin to its intersection
   with forearc mantle. On the basis of pressure, temperature and
   compositional considerations, the elevated Poisson's ratios indicate
   that water is pervasively present in fluid format pore pressures near
   lithostatic values. Combined with observations of a strong negative
   velocity contrast at the top of the oceanic crust, our results imply
   that the megathrust is a low- permeability boundary. The transition from
   a low- to high- permeability plate interface down dip into the mantle
   wedge is explained by hydrofracturing of the seal by volume changes
   across the interface caused by the onset of crustal eclogitization and
   mantle serpentinization. These results may have important implications
   for our understanding of seismogenesis, subduction zone structure and
   the mechanism of episodic tremor and slip.}},

Abstract = {{Since the global financial crisis broke out, the plunge of stock prices,
   shrinkage of asset value, and downgrading of credit ratings for
   companies and corporate bonds, have greatly challenged the
   long-established mathematical models based on Black-Scholes option
   pricing formula in Finance. Evidences show that the important assumption
   that the returns dynamics of the underlying stock have a continuous
   sample path which can be described by the stochastic process deviates
   from the real world situation. In this paper, I took the pattern of
   stock price movement as a process driven by the combination of the
   geometric Brownian motion and Poisson Process, and study the important
   factors affecting the default probability of corporate debt using MATLAB
   to do numerical simulation. It is found that: (a) in the occurrence of
   the ``rare event{''}, the adoption of the model only based on pure
   geometric Brownian motion will lead to underestimation of bankruptcy
   risk. (b) the degree of asset value shrinkage following each ``negative
   jump{''} is positively correlated with the default risk of corporate
   debt, and this default probability is a convex function of the
   corresponding jumping probability per unit time. (c) the marginal
   default probability is a non-negative random variable that varies as the
   times of asset ``jumps{''} before the maturity of the corporate debt are
   different. Moreover, it will reach the maximum value when jumping
   probability and the degree of asset value shrinkage both approach to
   100\%. (d) when the degree of asset value shrinkage maintains unchanged,
   the greater the initial leverage ratio d, the higher default risk the
   company will face. Consequently, the agency problem between shareholders
   and creditors is likely to take place.}},

Abstract = {{Laminates that exhibit high and negative Poisson's ratios can be used as
   solid-state actuators, passive and active vibration dampers, and for
   morphing aircraft structures. Recently, fiber-re in forced elastomer
   (FRE) laminates have been fabricated that exhibit extreme (high and
   negative) Poisson's ratios {[}1]. The current research explores twisted
   fiber bundle elastomeric laminates (both single and double helix) which
   are being investigated using experimentation, linear and non-linear
   finite element analysis (FEA). Twisted fiber bundles can be made from
   carbon fibers, fiberglass, etc, but for simplicity the current work uses
   twisted cotton string. It is observed that uniaxial fiber-reinforced
   elastomer laminates, where the fibers are twisted as shown in Figure 1,
   exhibit stress stiffening. Negative Poisson's ratios may be produced if
   the fiber bundles have a double helical path as simulated by a series of
   laminated tubes. Future auxetic FRE laminates may be developed that do
   experience extreme shear.

Abstract = {{Morphing wings are desired for their ability to reduce drag, change
   flight characteristics, and perhaps reduce weight by eliminating
   flap/aileron mechanisms. Development of two generations of a student
   morphing wing project is documented. The second wing was further
   developed by Peel. The work shows how a relatively low cost but
   realistic morphing wing test-bed can be fabricated. Wing skin, actuator,
   and actuator attachment development are discussed, as well as possible
   auxetic skin behavior. Aerodynamic characterization of the wing will be
   discussed in another paper.
   A very simple morphing wing was fabricated in phase one. The nose was
   able to elastically camber down similar to 25 degrees and the tail 20
   degrees. Actuation was provided by three pneumatic ``Rubber Muscle
   Actuators{''} (RMA) that produce high contractive forces. Upper and
   lower wing skins were fabricated from carbon fiber/polyurethane
   elastomer laminates. Lower skin buckling, actuator air leaks and
   actuator attachment problems were resolved in the second phase. A finite
   element model of the generation II 45ng was developed and is being used
   to refine/explore the morphing wing test-bed. The second generation wing
   fabrication methodology shows smooth elastic cambering and no buckling
   or waviness in the skins. The nose cambered down 23 degrees and the tail
   cambered down to 15 degrees. Improved leak-free biomimetic actuators and
   attach points now include no metal parts, have higher actuation forces
   due to new braided sheaths and functionally gradient matrix properties.}},

Abstract = {{Clay-polymer nanocomposites are a new range of particle-filled
   composites possessing enhanced mechanical properties. Transmission
   electron microscopy studies reveal that many single and double clay
   sheets are bent when immersed in the polymer matrix. To understand the
   elastic properties of the sheets we investigate their behaviour under
   compression through molecular dynamics simulations in both aqueous and
   poly(ethylene oxide) environments. We examine the sheets before and
   after buckling and find that the elastic properties of the clay sheets
   are much reduced when buckled in each case. Buckling occurs with only
   small out-of-plane displacement and we ascertain that any observably
   bent sheet will have reduced elastic properties. The sheets possess a
   negative Poisson ratio during buckling, which allows the clay sheet to
   regain its uncompressed area. We present a simple analytical model which
   explains the buckling through the competition between in-plane strain
   energy and out-of-plane displacements. Knowledge of how the elastic
   properties of the clay sheets change with shape is important for the

Title = {{Multifractal Analysis for Images: The wavelet Leaders contribution}},
Journal = {{TRAITEMENT DU SIGNAL}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{47-65}},
Abstract = {{1. Motivation
   Scale invariance has been observed in numerous applications involving
   data of various and very different natures. It can be operationally
   defined as the power law behavior with respect to scale of the structure
   functions, which are given by the empirical moments of the absolute
   value of the multiresolution coefficients of the data at a given scale
   (cf. Eq. (1)). The estimation of the exponents characterizing these
   power laws - termed scaling exponents - constitutes the ultimate goal of
   the practical analysis of scale invariance (also called scaling
   analysis). These scaling exponents are then commonly involved in
   standard signal processing tasks, such as detection, identification, or
   classification. In practice, scaling analysis is often conducted within
   the theoretical framework of multifractal analysis.
   In a nutshell, multifractal analysis aims at characterizing the
   fluctuation (in time or space) of the local regularity of the process
   under analysis through analysis of the (power law) behavior of the
   structure functions in the limit of fine scales, Though multifractal
   analysis can theoretically be extended to dimensions higher than 1
   without technical difficulties, most practical implementations remain
   restricted to one dimensional signals. This is mainly due to the fact
   that multifractal analysis requires the use of a range of both positive
   and negative empirical moments, hence demanding for multiresolution
   quantities with adequate properties. To date, the only practically
   available procedure for the multifractal analysis of 2D signals, hence
   images, is the so called Wavelet Transform Modulus Maxima (WTMM)
   procedure (based on the skeleton of a continuous wavelet transform
   (CWT)). Yet, the WTMM procedure suffers from a number of theoretical and
   practical drawbacks: It has a high computational cost; The calculation
   of the 2D CWT skeleton requires involved theoretical definitions as well
   as a cumbersome practical procedure; It is still lacking a theoretical
   support. Therefore, in numerous applications where the data are
   naturally images, multifractal analysis remains restricted to 1D slices
   of the data and hence incomplete.
   In the present contribution, elaborating on previous results obtained
   for (1D) signals, we propose a practical multifractal analysis method
   for (2D) images based on two key features: The use of a 2D Discrete
   Wavelet Transform (DWT) (instead of a 2D CWT); The replacement of
   wavelet coefficients with wavelet Leaders. This yields two major
   benefits:
   The computation cost is very low; Wavelet Leaders have been shown to
   yield a complete and rigorous analysis of the multifractal analysis of
   bounded functions. This is because wavelet Leaders consist of monotonous
   increasing quantities that finely account for the irregularities of the
   analyzed function. The aims of the present contribution are twofold:
   First, studying the necessary theoretical elements, validity and
   limitations of a wavelet Leader based multifractal analysis of images,
   and second, the evaluation of its practical statistical performance.
   2. Multifractal Analysis: Theory
   Multifractal analysis of a bounded function consists of describing the
   fluctuation of its local regularity with respect to space.
   The local regularity is measured by the Holder exponent. The variability
   of the Holder exponents with respect to space is characterized by the
   multifractal spectrum. It is defined as the Hausdorff dimension of the
   ensemble of points at which the function has the same Holder exponent.
   Practical multifractal analysis essentially aims at obtaining the
   multifractal spectrum from a single finite size image. The corresponding
   theoretical elements are given in Section 2.1. Since the multifractal
   spectrum is numerically not directly accessible, so-called multifractal
   formalisms have to be used: They recast the estimation to quantities
   that can actually be numerically calculated in practice and allow -
   under certain mathematical hypotheses - the estimation of the
   multifractal spectrum, For functions that are uniform Holder (i.e.,
   functions whose minimal regularity exponent, as defined in Eqs. (3) and
   (4), is positive), it has been shown that the wavelet Leaders locally
   reproduce the Holder exponent through a power law behavior in the limit
   of fine scales. They should hence constitute the key ingredient for the
   wavelet Leader multifractal formalism for images. Wavelet Leaders are
   defined as the supremum of the coefficients of a discrete wavelet
   transform in a small (time or space) neighborhood over all finer scales.
   First, the wavelet Leader structure functions are calculated from the
   image, both for positive and negative moments, and the corresponding
   scaling exponents are estimated. By taking their Legendre transform, one
   obtains the Legendre spectrum. The multifractal formalism consists now
   of stating that the Legendre spectrum is identical with the multifractal
   spectrum. This is described in Section 2.2. A practical procedure to
   measure the minimal regularity exponent is given in Eq. (5).
   This interpretation of the Legendre spectrum as the multifractal
   spectrum of the image is however not of general validity. Yet, it has
   been proven to be valid for self-similar finite variance stationary
   increments processes, and is conjectured for multiplicative martingale
   based processes. Also, it has be shown that the Legendre spectrum is
   independent of the choice of the mother wavelet, and hence provides an
   intrinsic characterization of the data, regardless of its
   interpretation. It is shown in Section 2.3 that the multifractal
   formalism holds without further hypothesis only for monofractal
   processes, i.e., when both the Legendre and multifractal spectra reduce
   to a point. Also, it is shown that one can always construct a process
   with any admissible Legendre spectrum, whose multifractal and Legendre
   spectra do not coincide.
   3. Positive measures and tractional integration
   Numerical images can naturally be modeled with positive measures. This
   violates the uniform Holder assumptions, and the wavelet Leader
   multifractal formalism can not be directly applied: Theoretically,
   wavelet Leaders become infinite; In practice, they are always finite,
   yet their use would yield meaningless results.
   This difficulty can be related to the existence of negative Holder
   exponents in the data (explicit definition detailed in Section 3.1). It
   is shown that performing a fractional integration of the data, with an
   order larger than the opposite of the minimal regularity exponent,
   guarantees uniform Holder regularity, and hence that the wavelet Leader
   based multifractal formalism can be applied, It is also explained in
   Section 3.1 how fractional integration and wavelet Leaders can be merged
   into a single computationally inexpensive and numerically unproblematic
   operation, referred to as pseudo-fractional integration. The question
   that arises naturally, though, is in how far the Legendre spectrum
   obtained by this practical solution can be related to the original
   image. It is argued here that even when the multifractal formalism holds
   for the integrated image, the common heuristic association with a
   translated (by the order of integration) version of the Legendre
   spectrum can not, in general be interpreted as the spectrum of the
   image, since the image is not uniform Holder, Yet, if the image contains
   only cusp-type singularities, the Legendre spectrum is nevertheless
   intrinsically related to the original image, thus characterizes it
   precisely, and can be used as such.
   However, it is shown and discussed in Sections 3.2 and 3.3 that if the
   image contains oscillating singularities, this reasoning is not valid:
   fractionally integrating with different orders and translating the
   Legendre spectra does not define one unique function. It is argued here
   that this fact can potentially be exploited for detecting the presence
   of oscillating singularities in data.
   4. Empirical Multifractal Analysis
   In practice, scaling analysis amounts to estimating scaling exponents.
   However, their estimation is often advantageously replaced by the
   estimation of a smaller set of specific parameters, termed the
   log-cumulants. Section 4.1 states how these log-cumulants can be used to
   approximate the Legendre spectrum with only a small number of
   parameters, and without having to calculate the Legendre transform
   numerically.
   In Sections 4.2 and 4.3, explicit forms of the wavelet coefficient and
   Leader based estimation procedures for multifractal analysis of images
   are given.
   In Section 4.4, the use of wavelet coefficients and wavelet Leaders for
   multifractal analysis are compared.
   5. Numerical Simulations
   Finally, the performance of the practical wavelet Leader based
   multifractal attribute estimation procedures for images are studied
   numerically, by means of Monte Carlo simulations conducted on two
   reference stochastic processes, whose multifractal properties are
   theoretically known: 2D fractional Brownian motions, Gaussian
   self-similar hence monofractal processes; Mandelbrot's multiplicative
   cascades (or martingales), celebrated examples of multifractal processes
   (with both log-normal and log Poisson multipliers). These processes are
   defined in Section 5.1.
   Simulation parameters are chosen to match realistic values observed in a
   number of real world data and situations (cf. Section 5.2),
   6. Estimation Performance
   From a large number (1000) of 2D realizations of fractional Brownian
   motion, and of Mandelbrot's multiplicative cascades, the estimation
   performance of the wavelet coefficient and wavelet Leader based
   multifractal formalisms are measured in terms of biases, variances and
   mean squared error. The results demonstrate that the proposed wavelet
   Leader based procedures outperform those based on wavelet coefficients,
   while obtained at the same computational cost, in estimation
   performance: Whereas the former enable the relevant estimation of
   scaling exponents for both positive and negative statistical orders, and
   hence of the entire spectrum, that latter fail for negative statistical
   orders and hence the right part of the spectrum (cf. Section 6.1).
   Also, the former have significantly better performance for the
   estimation of the log-cumulants, in particular for cumulants of order
   larger than 1, i.e., for cumulants that enable practitioners to
   discriminate between finite variance self similar processes and
   multiplicative cascades (cf, Section 6.2).
   Yet, there is a price to pay for such improvements: First, the scales
   that can be involved in the estimations are slightly restricted when
   using wavelet Leaders (cf. Section 6.3), and second, the variance of
   Leader based estimates of the self-similarity parameter of Gaussian self
   similar processes is not independent of the parameter, as is the case
   for coefficient based estimates (cf. Section 6.4).
   Section 6.5 illustrates the behavior of the wavelet Leader based
   multifractal analysis procedure on a real-world image, consisting of
   natural fern, chosen in reference to the classical simulated fern
   example used as a paradigm fractal object.
   7. Conclusion and discussion
   This contribution proposes the definition of a wavelet Leader
   multifractal analysis procedure for 2D signals, i.e., for Images, It is
   shown to have estimation performance that significantly outperform those
   obtained form wavelet coefficients and to have both a low computational
   cost and a low level in implementation difficulty. No other procedure
   combining this high performance level and low computational and
   conceptual difficulty levels has been proposed so far. Multifractal
   analysis consists of a conceptually involved characterization of an
   image: It relates, via the so-called multifractal formalism, the scale
   invariance properties of the data to their sample path regularity
   properties. The exact use of this theoretical framework may turn
   practically difficult. However, this does not prevent practitioners from
   using a set of estimated multifractal attributes as relevant image
   features. This contribution hence opens the route towards a systematic
   use of multifractal analysis for image detection and classification
   tasks, as is tentatively experimented in various applications (e.g.,
   computer vision).}},

Title = {{Flamingo detection using Marked Point Processes for estimating the size
   of populations}},
Journal = {{TRAITEMENT DU SIGNAL}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{26}},

Pages = {{95-108}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a new technique to automatically detect and
   count breeding Greater flamingos (Phoenicopterus roseus) on aerial
   photographs of their colonies. We consider a stochastic approach based
   on marked point processes also called object processes. Here, the
   objects represent flamingos which are defined as ellipses. The Gibbs
   density associated with the marked point process of ellipses is defined
   w.r.t the Poisson measure. Thus, the issue is reduced to an energy
   minimization, where the energy is composed of a regularization term
   (prior density), which introduces some constraints on the objects and
   their interactions, and a data term, which links the objects to the
   features to be extracted in the image. The prior energy is defined as a
   sum of local energies for each object. For a given object o, we consider
   the set S(o) of objects in the current configuration which overlap o. An
   overlapping coefficient between two objects is defined by the
   intersection area normalised by the minimum size between the two
   objects. The local energy, associated to o, is then proportional to the
   maximum overlapping coefficient between o and any element of S(o). The
   data term is also defined by a sum local energies over each object in
   the configuration. The local energy is obtained from the computation of
   a radiometric distance between pixels in the ellipse, modeling the
   flamingo, and pixels in the neighborhood of this ellipse.
   The key parameter to perform the detection is a threshold embedded in
   the data term. The distance computed between pixels in an ellipse and
   pixels in the ellipse neighbordood is mapped to {[}-1,1]. When negative
   (resp. positive) this local energy favours (resp. penalizes) the object
   to belong to the final detection. The sign of this local energy depends
   on a pre-defined threshold. We propose an heuristic to locally estimate
   this threshold. We first estimate a gaussian law to approximate the
   flamingo radiometry in the color space. We compute a weighted color
   histogram of the image. The weight associated to each pixel is
   proportional to a distance computed between pixels in a disk centered on
   the considered pixel and its neighbors. Therefore, the contribution of
   the flamingos in the color histogram is enlarged. We then assume that
   the main mode in the histogram corresponds to flamingos. We estimate the
   distribution of this mode, assuming a gaussian property. The threshold
   is then deduced from the covariance matrix of this mode. We apply this
   procedure locally, on different windows and the threshold map is
   obtained by interpolation. This algorithm provide a locally adaptive
   estimation of the threshold parameter. As a result, the only parameters
   required from the user are some bounding boxes for the ellipse axis.
   These boxes can be deduced from the usual size of flamingos and the data
   resolution.
   Then, we sample the process to extract the configuration of objects,
   minimizing the energy, by a new and fast birth-and-death dynamics,
   leading to the total number of birds. This sampling algorithm is embeded
   into a simulated annealing scheme to optimize the proposed model. A
   birth rate and the temperature of the simulated annealing are
   initialized. After each iteration, these two parameters are decreased
   using a geometrical law.
   Each iteration is divided into three steps. The birth step consists in
   adding a new object on each pixel with a given probability. This
   probability depends on the birth rate but also on a pre-computed birth
   map. To compute this birth map, the data term is evaluated on each pixel
   for a given disk. The probability of adding a new object then depends on
   the data. The choice of the birth map, uniform or depending on the data,
   does not affect the convergence properties. Therefore, the final result
   is the same. But the speed of convergence is increased by using the data
   in the birth process. The goal of the second step is also to speed up
   the convergence. It consists in sorting the objects in the configuration
   with respect to the value of the corresponding data term. In the last
   step, consisting in removing, or killing, some objects in the current
   configuration, we first propose to kill objects having a high value for
   data term. For each object, taken in the data term decreasing order, we
   compute a death probability depending on the energy difference between
   the configuration and the configuration minus the considered object, and
   on the temperature. Note that the birth rate does not depend on the
   temperature, nor the configuration energy. The convergence of this
   algorithm has been proven in a previous work.
   This approach gives counts with good precision compared to manual
   counts. Additionally, this approach does not need any image
   pre-processing or supervision w.r.t. the extraction, thus considerably
   reducing the overall processing time required to get the estimate. Some
   results are shown and compared to the results obtained by an expert.
   Besides, we compare the proposed approach with standard algorithm based
   on template matching and mathematical morphology.}},

Abstract = {{Optimisation of seat construction cushions is associated with the need
   to investigate their softness employing, for this purpose, various kinds
   of sensors. However, it is by no means apparent whether the widespread
   use of hard sensors instead of soft ones modelled to the shape and
   anatomically resembling parts of human body is justified.
   The aim of the performed investigations was: to determine seat cushion
   stiffness of a chair derived from a set of dining-room furniture, to
   determine values and distributions of contact strains on the seat
   surface caused by sensors of different hardness, numerical calculation
   of contact strains between the seat cushion and the sensor and to verify
   the results of these calculations with the results of laboratory
   experiments.
   The performed trials showed that the seat cushion stiffness assessment
   and evaluation of contact stresses on their surface should be carried
   out employing an equally stiff sensor. In numerical calculations,
   polyurethane foams should be modelled as hyperfoam bodies of
   sigma=f(epsilon) characteristics determined in an axial compression
   test. Contact stresses between the seat cushion and the user's body
   should be reduced as a result of application of a frictionless
   connection of thin layers of polyurethane foams with foam forming the
   proper elastic layer of the seat.}},

Abstract = {{Traps for monitoring of flying insect pests constitute a critical part
   of integrated pest management strategies. However, interpretation of
   trap captures is hampered by 1) factors associated with the performance
   of traps (i.e., lure, trap design, placement); 2) an often poorly
   defined relationship between trap captures and population density; and
   3) interpretation approaches being highly specific to a certain insect
   species, trapping method, or trapping environment. The main purpose of
   this study was to identify a trap capture interpretation approach with
   little sensitivity to characteristics specific to a given data set,
   which would allow easier comparison of trapping data sets and make it
   easier to standardize sampling plans across insect pests and trapping
   environments. Based on fits of trapping data sets to standard
   distributions (normal, Poisson, and negative binomial), evaluations of
   the index of aggregation, k, and linear regression coefficients from
   Taylor's power law, we concluded that these characteristics varied
   considerably among data sets, which means that enumerative sampling
   plans may not be appropriate. Across 13 trapping data sets of six insect
   species, we showed a consistent nonlinear relationship between average
   trap captures and number of traps with zero captures and that the k can
   be stabilized by converting trapping data into binomial data. A trap
   interpretation approach based on number of zero captures is both easy to
   use, was found to be species-independent, and means that it may be
   possible to establish meaningful and reliable action thresholds based on
   trap captures of flying insects. Although developed using trapping data
   from food facilities, this approach may have application to trapping
   data from other environments as well.}},

   Methods: Cross-sectional analysis of a convenience sample of 912 IDUs
   recruited between March 2004 and April 2005. Specimens were tested for
   HIV, HBV, and HCV Adjusted prevalence ratios (PRs) were estimated using
   Poisson regression with robust variance estimates.
   Results: The prevalence of HIV, hepatitis B surface antigen, and
   anti-HCV were 29.8\%, 11.1\%, and 62.1\%, respectively. Among
   HIV-infected IDUs, prevalence of coinfection with anti-HCV and hepatitis
   B surface antigen/anti-HCV were 86\% and 9.2\%, respectively. In
   multivariate analysis, injecting at a dealer's place (PR: 1.57) and

   Conclusions: There is a high burden of HIV HCV and HBV among IDUs that
   needs to be addressed by improving access to therapies for these

Abstract = {{Objective: We evaluated the relation between overweight and calcium
   intake in adults living in the municipality of Sao Paulo, Brazil.
   Methods: This was a cross-sectional population-based Study on a sample
   of 1459 adults that was obtained by multistage cluster sampling. Dietary
   intake was measured by the 24-h recall method. Poisson's and linear
   regression analyses were performed to evaluate the relation between
   overweight and quartiles of calcium intake adjusted for energy.
   Results: The prevalence of overweight was 43.1\% and the average
   adjusted calcium intake was 448.6 mg. In the linear regression.
   analyses, the regression coefficient for adjusted calcium was
   significant and negative (P = 0.019, beta(1) = -0.0001). Although
   evaluated by quartiles, the prevalence ratio for overweight in the first
   quartile of calcium intake was 1.24 (95\% confidence interval 1.00-1.54)
   and that in the second quartile was 1.24 (95\% confidence interval
   1.03-1.49).
   Conclusion: In the present study, calcium intake showed a significant
   negative association with body mass index. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Fully generalised analytical expressions for longitudinal Poisson's
   ratio are developed for armchair and zigzag Single-Walled Nanotubes
   (SWNTs) using an energy equivalent approach. Deformation is assumed due
   to simultaneous bond stretching and bond angle variation in response to
   an applied axial load. A parametric study is then performed to explore
   under what circumstances SWNTs may exhibit auxetic (negative Poisson's
   ratio) response. In principle, auxetic behaviour can be achieved by
   modifying the hexagonal cell shape to adopt a re-entrant geometry for
   the case of bond angle variation being the dominant deformation
   mechanism. Alternatively, altering the length of the characteristic bond
   oriented in an off-axis direction to below a critical. value or
   modifying the force constants governing the deformation modes so that
   bond stretching dominates for the conventional hexagonal cell shape can
   also lead to auxetic behaviour. (C) 2008 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co.

Abstract = {{Measuring strain in foam presents a number of challanges. In the case of
   polymeric foam, the material is so soft that a conventional strain gage
   is not applicable because the rigidity of gage and its associated glue
   is stronger than the foam itself Transducers such as clip gage, etc. may
   not be suitable either because the strain field may not be uniform
   within the gage length. Thus it is desirable that a non-contact and full
   field strain measurement technique be available. In this paper we
   introduce a speckle photography technique that is non-contact and can
   measure the full field deformation of a foam specimen. We use the
   natural texture of the pattern. Digitized images of the foam specimen
   under different loads are ``compared{''} using a special algorithm
   called CASI, to yield deformation maps of the specimen. Examples of
   applying this technique to testing PVC foam composites are presented in
   the paper. (C) 2008 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA, Weinheim}},

Abstract = {{Auxeticity (i.e. negative Poisson's ratios) is associated with
   particular geometrical features and deformation mechanisms of a system.
   Among the potential systems that may exhibit such behaviour are rotating
   rigid units. Here we discuss how rigid rhombi of the same shape and size
   can be connected in two different ways to give rise to two distinct
   systems: the Type alpha and Type beta rotating rhombi. We derive the
   mechanical properties, for the Type beta system and compare it to those
   of the Type alpha to highlight the differences between the two systems
   namely that Type alpha systems are highly anisotropic and can exhibit
   both negative and positive Poisson's ratios which depend on the shape of
   the rhombi and the angle between them whereas Type beta systems are
   isotropic with a constant in-plane Poisson's ratio of -1. Furthermore we
   show that by constructing the rhombi from five truss-type elements,
   where the one forming the diagonal has a different thermal expansion
   than the other four identical trusses, the Poisson's ratios for the Type
   alpha systems can also be made temperature dependent, in contrast with
   Type beta systems which remain unaffected by temperature changes. (C)

Abstract = {{We discuss the stability criteria of Fisher and Ruelle {[}J. Math. Phys.
   7, 260 (1966)] which can be used to establish if a given pair potential
   satisfies the requirements for thermodynamic stability. The mechanical
   and thermodynamic stability are considered for systems composed of
   particles interacting with a bounded potential, which could be used to
   model a mesostructured material at a coarse-grained level. The elastic
   moduli of fee and bee solids at zero temperature are calculated as a
   function of density for an assembly of particles interacting via the
   following (at r = 0) bounded potentials: (a) a Gaussian Core Model, GCM,
   potential, phi(r) = exp (-r(2)), and (b) the separation-shifted
   Lennard-Jones, SSLJ, bounded potential, phi(r)=4{[}1(alpha(2)+r(2))(6) -
   1/(alpha(2) + r(2))3], with alpha > 0, where in both cases the
   characteristic energy and lengthscale are set to unity, and r is the
   separation between the particles. For both potential forms, at low
   densities, the static fee structure is the thermodynamically stable
   structural form but from above a certain density the bee lattice becomes
   the stable structure. It is shown that for the SSLJ potential this
   transition density varies roughly as similar to alpha(-3). In the T -> 0
   limit, auxetic behaviour is demonstrated to occur for both fee and bee
   structures, but at high pressure and for the bee structural form its
   response to external strain can be entirely nonauxetic. A significant
   role of the attractive part of the interparticle interaction in
   enhancing auxetic behaviour is observed. The ranges of the mechanical
   stability are determined for both systems. At zero temperature, the
   lattice becomes mechanically unstable for alpha > alpha(c), which
   appears to coincide with the value alpha(c) = (7/32)(1/6) = 0.7762
   proved previously to lead to thermodynamically unstable fluid states for
   this potential. (C) 2008 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA, Weinheim}},

Abstract = {{Characterization of pure polycrystalline BaTiO3 was carried out by means
   of Broadband Viscoelastic Spectroscopy (BVS) and Differential Scanning
   Calorimetry (DSC) above ambient temperature. A peak in mechanical loss
   has been observed near the Curie point 130 degrees C. The magnitude of
   the peak increases with thermal rate and decreases with frequency.
   Expressions for the peak magnitude have been derived based upon
   available models describing the first order phase transition. Mechanical
   anomalies were observed outside the vicinity of the phase transition.
   Transition temperature measured by BVS differed from that via DSC; the
   effect of stress on the ferroelastic transformation is a possible cause.
   Isothermal frequency scans revealed a hump in mechanical loss in the
   vicinity of the transition temperature below 1 Hz and a modulus decrease
   with decreasing frequency. Quasi-isothermal studies revealed a
   significant softening in bulk modulus and a transient negative Poisson's
   ratio during the tetragonal-to-cubic phase transition. (C) 2008

   compression-driven self-assembly as a means to create auxetic porous
   structures on a nanoscale. To predict the deformation behaviour of

Title = {{Ab initio elastic properties of talc from 0 to 12 GPa: Interpretation of
   seismic velocities at mantle pressures and prediction of auxetic
   behaviour at low pressure}},

Abstract = {{Talc is a hydrous magnesium rich layered silicate that is widely
   disseminated in the Earth from the seafloor to over 100 kin depth, in
   ultra-high pressure metamorphism of oceanic crust. In this paper we
   determine the single crystal elastic constants at pressures from 0 to 12
   GPa of talc triclinic(C (1) over bar) and monoclinic(C2/c) polytypes
   using ab initio methods. We find that talc has an extraordinarily high
   elastic anisotropy at zero pressure that reduces with increasing
   pressure. The exceptional anisotropy is complemented by a negative
   Poisson's ratio for many directions in crystal space. Calculations show
   that talc is not only one of very few common minerals to exhibit auxetic
   behaviour, but the magnitude of this effect may be the largest reported
   so far for a mineral. The compression (Vp) and shear (Vs) wave velocity
   anisotropy is 80\% and 85\% for the triclinic polytype. At pressures
   where talc is known be stable in the Earth (up to 5 GPa) the Vp and Vs
   anisotropy is reduced to about 40\% for both velocities, which is still
   a very high value. Vp is slow parallel to the c-axis and fast
   perpendicular to it. This remains unchanged with increasing pressure and
   is observed in both polytypes. The shear wave splitting (difference
   between fast and slow S-wave velocities) at low pressure has high values
   in the plane normal to the c-axis, with a maximum near the a{*}-axis in
   the triclinic and the b-axis in the monoclinic polytype. The c-axis is
   the direction of minimum splitting. The pattern of shear wave splitting
   does not change significantly with pressure. The volume fraction of talc
   varies between 11 and 41\% for hydrated mantle rocks, but the lack of
   data on the crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO) precludes a
   detailed analysis of the impact of talc on seismic anisotropy in
   subduction zones. However, it is highly likely that CPO can easily
   develop in zones of deformation due to the platy habit of talc crystals.
   For random aggregates of talc, the isotropic Vp, Vs and Vp/Vs ratio have
   significantly lower values than those of antigorite and may explain
   low-velocity regions in the mantle wedge. Vp/Vs ratios are more complex
   in anisatropic media because there are fast and slow S-waves, resulting
   in Vp/Vs1 and Vp/Vs2 ratios for every propagation direction, making
   interpretation difficult in deformed polycrystalline talc with a CPO.
   Talc on the subduction plate boundary can strongly influence guided wave
   velocity as CPO would develop in this region of intense shearing. The
   very low coefficient of friction (<0.1) of talc above 100 degrees C
   could also explain silent earthquakes at shallow depths (ca 30 km) along
   the subduction plate boundaries, frequently responsible for tsunami. (C)

Abstract = {{The objective of this paper was to assess sex and socioeconomic
   inequalities in lung cancer mortality in two major cities of Europe and
   South America. Official information on mortality and population allowed
   the estimation of sex- and age-specific death rates for Barcelona, Spain
   and Sao Paulo, Brazil (1995-2003). Mortality trends and levels were
   independently assessed for each city and subsequently compared. Rate
   ratios assessed by Poisson regression analysis addressed hypotheses of
   association between the outcome and socioeconomic covariates (human
   development index, unemployment and schooling) at the inner-city area
   level. Barcelona had a higher mortality in men (76.9/100000 inhabitants)
   than Sao Paulo (38.2/100 000 inhabitants); although rates were
   decreasing for the former (-2\%/year) and levelled-off for the {[}after.
   Mortality in women ranked similarly (9.1 for Barcelona, 11.5 for Sao
   Paulo); with an increasing trend for women aged 35-64 years (+
   7.7\%/year in Barcelona and + 2.4\%/year in Sao Paulo). The
   socioeconomic gradient of mortality in men was negative for Barcelona
   and positive for Sao Paulo; for women, the socioeconomic gradient was
   positive in both cities. Negative gradients indicate that deprived areas
   suffer a higher burden of disease; positive gradients suggest that
   prosmoking lifestyles may have been more prevalent in more affluent
   areas during the last decades. Sex and socioeconomic inequalities of
   lung cancer mortality reinforce the hypothesis that the epidemiologic
   profile of cancer can be improved by an expanded access to existing
   technology of healthcare and prevention. The continuous monitoring of
   inequalities in health may contribute to the concurrent promotion of
   well-being and social justice.}},

Abstract = {{Systems with negative Poisson's ratios (auxetic) exhibit the unexpected
   feature of expanding laterally when uniaxially stretched and becoming
   narrower when compressed. Here, we examine the role of the tetrahedra
   found in the frameworks of the predicted auxetic zeolites natrolite
   (NAT), thomsonite (THO) and edingtonite (EDI) for generating negative
   Poisson's ratios in an attempt to relate the auxeticity in the (0 0 1)
   plane to rotations of the tetrahedra in the zeolite framework. The
   behavior of the tetrahedra is then examined in terms of their 2D
   projections in the (0 0 1) plane and we show that in the extreme
   scenario, where the three-dimensional tetrahedra in the zeolite
   framework are perfectly rigid and simply rotate relative to each other,
   then their 2D projected behavior in the (0 0 1) plane becomes equivalent
   to the idealized two-dimensional `rotating squares model' with a
   Poisson's ratio of -1. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Mechanical properties of a thin magnetic film subjected to an external,
   rotating magnetic field have been studied by computer simulations. The
   film is modeled by a two-dimensional bead-spring model of a nonmagnetic
   polymer matrix with inclusions of magnetic nanoparticles (nanograins) of
   uniaxial anisotropy, The isotropic polymer matrix is represented as a
   hexagonal structure with sites decorated with small hexagonal particles
   containing magnetic nanograins. The beads correspond to polymer segments
   and the springs between them imitate chemical bonds, approximated by
   harmonic interactions. The beads also interact by the Lennalcl-Jones
   potential whose role is to mimic the core of non-bonded polymer
   segments.
   The Poisson ratio of the constructed polymer matrix is negative, i.e.
   the system expands laterally under longitudinal stretching force. It is
   shown that the magneto-elastic coupling can be used to control the
   expansion and contraction of the polymer matrix. Depending on the
   applied magnetic field, the Poisson ratio of the magnetic film may
   assume positive or negative Values. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   narrow intervals, despite small numbers of arrivals. However, the
   uniform and scores intervals, defined in the text, come very close to
   providing coverage while providing substantially narrower intervals.
   These intervals might have practical applications. In a sensitivity

Title = {{Time series count data models: An empirical application to traffic

Journal = {{ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{40}},

Abstract = {{Count data are primarily categorised as cross-sectional, time series,
   and panel. Over the past decade, Poisson and Negative Binomial (NB)
   models have been used widely to analyse cross-sectional and time series
   count data, and random effect and fixed effect Poisson and NB models
   have been used to analyse panel count data. However, recent literature
   suggests that although the underlying distributional assumptions of
   these models are appropriate for cross-sectional count data, they are
   not capable of taking into account the effect of serial correlation
   often found in pure time series count data. Real-valued time series
   models, such as the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA)
   model, introduced by Box and Jenkins have been used in many applications
   over the last few decades. However, when modelling non-negative
   integer-valued data such as traffic accidents at a junction over time,
   Box and Jenkins models may be inappropriate. This is mainly due to the
   normality assumption of errors in the ARIMA model. Over the last few
   years, a new class of time series models known as integer-valued
   autoregressive (INAR) Poisson models, has been studied by many authors.
   This class of models is particularly applicable to the analysis of time
   series count data as these models hold the properties of Poisson
   regression and able to deal with serial correlation, and therefore
   offers an alternative to the real-valued time series models.
   The primary objective of this paper is to introduce the class of INAR
   models for the time series analysis of traffic accidents in Great
   Britain. Different types of time series count data are considered:
   aggregated time series data where both the spatial and temporal units of
   observation are relatively large (e.g., Great Britain and years) and
   disaggregated time series data where both the spatial and temporal units
   are relatively small (e.g., congestion charging zone and months). The
   performance of the INAR models is compared with the class of Box and
   Jenkins real-valued models. The results suggest that the performance of
   these two classes of models is quite similar in terms of coefficient
   estimates and goodness of fit for the case of aggregated time series
   traffic accident data. This is because the mean of the counts is high in
   which case the normal approximations and the ARIMA model may be
   satisfactory. However, the performance of INAR Poisson models is found
   to be much better than that of the ARIMA model for the case of the
   disaggregated time series traffic accident data where the counts is
   relatively low. The paper ends with a discussion on the limitations of
   INAR models to deal with the seasonality and unobserved heterogeneity.

Title = {{Application of the Tweedie distribution to zero-catch data in CPUE
   analysis}},

Abstract = {{We focus on the zero-catch problem of CPUE (catch per unit effort)
   standardization. Because the traditional CPUE model with a log-normal
   error structure cannot be applied in this case, three methods have often
   been utilized as follows:
   (1) Ad hoc method adds a small constant value to all response variables,
   (2) Catch model with a Poisson or negative-binomial (NB) error
   structure.
   (3) Delta-type two-step method such as the delta-normal model (after
   estimating the ratio of zero-catch using
   a logit or probit model, a model Such as CPUE log-normal or
   Catch-Poisson is applied to CPUE Without zero-data).
   However, there are some statistical problems with each of these methods.
   In this paper, we carried ou the CPUE standardization mainly using the
   Tweedie distribution model based on the actual by-catch data (silky
   shark, Carcharhimus falciformis, in the North Pacific Ocean caught by
   Japanese training vessels) including many observations with zero-catch
   (> 2/3rd) and tuna fishery data as a target (yellowfin tuna, Thunnus
   albacares, in the Indian Ocean caught by Japanese commercial vessels)
   where the ratio of zero-catch is not so high (< 1/3rd). The Tweedie
   model is an extension of compound Poisson model derived from the
   stochastic process where the weight of the counted objects (i.e., number
   of fish) has a gamma distribution and has an advantage of handling the
   zero-catch data in a unified way.
   We also compared four candidate models, the Catch-NB model, ad hoc
   method, Delta-lognormal model (delta-type two-step method) and Tweedie
   distribution, through CPUE analyses of actual fishery data in terms of
   the statistical performance. Square error and Pearson's correlation
   coefficient were calculated based oil the observed CPUE and the
   corresponding predicted CPUE using the n-fold cross-validation.
   As a result, the differences in the trend of CPUE between years and
   model performance between the ad hoc method and Tweedie model were found
   to be not so large in the example of yellowfin tuna (target species).
   However, the statistical performance of Tweedie distribution is rather
   better than Delta-lognormal model, the Catch-NB distribution and ad hoc
   method in the example of silky shark (by-catch species). Standardized
   CPUE year trend of ad hoc method was found to be quite different from
   that of the Tweedie distribution and other two models. Model performance
   of the Tweedie distribution is good judging from the 5-fold
   cross-validation using the fishery data if including many zero-catch
   data such as by-catch species. C 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic open cell polyurethane (PU) foams have been manufactured and
   mechanically characterised under cyclic tensile loading. The classical
   manufacturing process for auxetic PU foams involves multiaxial
   compression of the conventional parent foam, and heating of the
   compressed specimens above the T-m of the foam polymer. Eighty
   cylindrical specimens were fabricated using manufacturing routes
   modified from those in the open literature, with different temperatures
   (135 degrees C, 150 degrees C), compression ratios and different cooling
   methods (water or room temperature exposure). Compressive tensile cyclic
   loading has been applied to measure tangent modulus, Poisson's ratios
   and energy dissipated per unit volume. The results are used to obtain
   relations between manufacturing parameters, mechanical and hysteresis
   properties of the foams. Compression, both radial and axial, was found
   to be the most significant manufacturing parameter for the auxetic foams
   in this work.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Systems with negative Poisson's ratio (auxetic) exhibit the unusual
   characteristic of getting fatter when stretched and thinner when
   compressed. Such behaviour is a scale-independent property and is the
   result of a cooperation between the internal geometry of the system and
   the way this deforms when uniaxially stretched. Here, we analyse the
   anisotropic mechanical properties for a system constructed from
   connected squares which can deform through changes in length of the
   sides of the squares (idealised `ystretching squares' model). In
   particular, we show that this system may exhibit a negative Poisson's
   ratio which depends on the angle between the squares and the direction
   of loading but is independent of the size of the squares which suggests
   that this model may be implemented at any scale of structure including
   the micro- and nano-level. We also show how this model compares and
   complements the existing `rotating squares' model which also works on a
   system with the same geometric characteristics and which has been shown
   to lead to auxeticity in various classes of materials.}},

Abstract = {{First-principles calculations were performed to study structural,
   elastic and electronic properties of typical face-centered cubic (fcc)
   precipitates of Mg-based alloys (Mg3Gd, Mg3Gd0.5Y0.5 and Mg3Zn3Y2)
   within the generalized gradient approximation. The calculated results
   show that the substitution of part of the Gd with Y in Mg3Gd leads to a
   slight decrease in the cell volume (0.35\%). and the lattice parameters
   obtained after full relaxation of crystalline cells are in good
   agreement with the experimental data. The calculated negative formation
   enthalpies and the cohesive energies show that these typical fee
   precipitates of Mg-based alloys have good alloying ability and
   structural stability. According to the calculated density of states of
   these phases, it is found that the highest structural stability of
   Mg3Zn3Y2 is attributed to an increase in the bonding electron numbers
   below the Fermi level. In addition, the elastic constants C-y of these
   phases were also calculated, and the bulk modulus B. shear modulus G,
   Young's modulus E, Poisson's ratio v and anisotropy value A of

Abstract = {{Distance sampling of events in natural or seminatural populations often
   indicates a larger variance in the distance to the kth nearest event
   than expected for events distributed completely at random.
   Overdispersion contributes to the well-known bias problem of distance
   sampling density estimators. Distance distribution models that
   accommodate overdispersion in the data should lead to more robust
   estimators of density. To this end we propose a gamma-Poisson
   distribution model for distances from a point to k nearest events. The
   model assumes a gamma distribution of local densities of randomly
   distributed events. Properties of the distribution and estimation of the
   parameters and event density are detailed for both constrained and
   unconstrained sampling. Four examples, one with simulated data from a
   known negative binomial distribution and three with simulated distance
   sampling in natural and seminatural stem-mapped tree stands, illustrate
   the promising performance of this new distribution, both as a model for
   distances and for density estimation. The modeling approach extends to
   other mixing distributions.}},

Abstract = {{Being one of new generation of composites, functionally graded materials
   (FGMs) possess gradually changed physical properties due to their
   compositional and/or microstructural gradients. In literature,
   exhaustive studies have been carried out in compositional modeling and
   design, while limited reports are available for microstructural
   optimization. This article presents an inverse homogenization method for
   the design of two-phase (solid/void) FGM microstructures, whose periodic
   base cells (PBCs) vary in a direction parallel to the property gradient
   but periodically repeat themselves in the perpendicular direction. The
   effective elasticity tensor at each PBC is estimated in terms of the
   homogenization theory. The overall difference between the effective
   tensor and their target is minimized by seeking for an optimal PBC
   material topology. To preserve the connectivity between adjacent PBCs,
   three methods, namely connective constraint, pseudo load, and unified
   formulation with nonlinear diffusion are proposed herein. A number of
   two-dimensional examples possessing graded volume fraction and Young's
   modulus but constant positive or negative Poisson's ratios are presented
   to demonstrate this computational design procedure.}},

Abstract = {{Pedigree records of 72,808 animals (45,668 females and 27,140 males)
   from the genetic evaluation program of the Argentine Brangus Association
   were used to estimate effective number of founders (N(f)), effective
   number of ancestors (N(a)), and effective population size under random
   mating (N(e)) or selection (N(eS)), in order to assess genetic
   variability. The average level of completeness of the pedigree was low
   (0.17) and the average level of inbreeding (F) calculated from the
   pedigree was equal to 0.24\%. Animals in the reference population were
   21,662 calves born from 2001 to 2005. The estimated measures of
   variability were N(f)=765.7 and N(a)=387.5. The numbers of ancestors
   responsible for 100\%, 50\%, or 20\% of the genes in the reference
   group, were equal to 12,471, 273, and 22, respectively. Direct estimates
   of N(e) and N(eS) were calculated using the variances and covariances of
   family sizes, i.e. male and female progeny numbers for bulls and cows.
   Estimates of the dispersion parameters were from the Bivariate Poisson
   model for the cows, and from the Generalized Bivariate Negative Binomial
   (GBIVARNB) distribution for the bulls. The latter probability mass
   function accounted for overdispersion, a characteristic present in the
   sampling distribution of family size of bulls. The estimated variances
   of male and female progeny and the covariance between them for the bulls
   were 5.70, 271.28, and 30.15, respectively, and 1.15, 2.10, and 1.06 for
   the cows. Generation intervals (in years) were: sires of bulls-5.0,
   sires of cows=5.7, darns of bulls=4.4, and dams of cows=5.2. The
   estimated N(e) was 274, which corresponds to a rate of inbreeding (F) of
   0.18\%, whereas N(eS)=125 and F=0.40\%. As a check of the proposed
   methodology, all analyses were also performed using the pedigree records
   of 10,483 Angus animals from a herd with an average level of
   completeness of 0.68. Using the GBIVARNB model for both bulls and cows
   the estimated N(e)=95.4, thus F=0.5\% in perfect agreement with the
   calculated average inbreeding from pedigree records. Under selection,
   N(eS)=79.3 and F=0.6\%. The larger difference between estimated N(e) and
   N(eS) in the Brangus was related to the smaller bull to cow ratio in the
   breed. Therefore, it seems desirable to continue monitoring the
   effective size of the Argentine Brangus to prevent problems of
   inbreeding and lack of variability in the future. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Simple models of molecular evolution assume that sequences evolve by a
   Poisson process in which nucleotide or amino acid substitutions occur as
   rare independent events. In these models, the expected ratio of the
   variance to the mean of substitution counts equals 1, and substitution
   processes with a ratio greater than 1 are called overdispersed.
   Comparing the genomes of 10 closely related species of Drosophila, we
   extend earlier evidence for overdispersion in amino acid replacements as
   well as in four-fold synonymous substitutions. The observed deviation
   from the Poisson expectation can be described as a linear function of
   the rate at which substitutions occur on a phylogeny, which implies that
   deviations from the Poisson expectation arise from gene-specific
   temporal variation in substitution rates. Amino acid sequences show
   greater temporal variation in substitution rates than do four-fold
   synonymous sequences. Our findings provide a general phenomenological
   framework for understanding overdispersion in the molecular clock. Also,
   the presence of substantial variation in gene-specific substitution
   rates has broad implications for work in phylogeny reconstruction and
   evolutionary rate estimation.}},

   the other case, the deformations were allowed in directions
   perpendicular to the strained one. The higher strength of crystalline
   silica as compared to amorphous silica resulted from a different
   distribution of ring sizes. The results obtained for the inert failure
   strains and intrinsic strength of the silica glass were in good
   agreement with the experimental data, and the nonlinear elastic behavior
   of the glass was reproduced along with the effects of strain rate and

Abstract = {{In this work, the mechanical in-plane and thermal conductivity
   properties of a novel cellular configuration for multifunctional
   applications are described using analytical and finite element models.
   The hexagonal-rectangular honeycomb proposed allows one more geometric
   parameter in the unit cell compared to the classical hexagonal honeycomb
   configurations. The added geometric entity provides enhanced in-plane
   flexibility and tailoring of properties, such as the in-plane Poisson's
   ratio, which can become negative under specific geometry configurations.
   The thermal conductivities are modeled using the electric-thermal
   analogy, allowing closed-form solutions for the thermal properties of
   the honeycomb. Comparison between analytical models and finite element
   simulations provides good convergence of results. Crown Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{A heterogeneous material with a certain periodic microstructure may have

   such components, a hybrid-layered manufacturing process has been
   developed and applies spraying, engraving, and refinishing technologies,
   among which the engraving is the key technology for generating the voids
   of periodic microstructures with their required dimensions and
   accuracies. To implement such an accurate engraving, it is important to
   study its engraving behavior. This paper establishes a behavior model of
   the engraving operation and performs its behavior simulation, thus
   providing a reliable basis for future practical manufacturing.}},

Abstract = {{Elastic plates or cylinders can support guided modes with zero group
   velocity (ZGV) at a nonzero value of the wave number. Using laser-based
   ultrasonic techniques, we experimentally investigate some fascinating
   properties of these ZGV modes: resonance and ringing effects, backward
   wave propagation, interference between backward and forward modes. Then,
   the conditions required for the existence of ZGV Lamb modes in isotropic
   plates are discussed. It is shown that these modes appear in a range of
   Poisson's ratio about the value for which the cutoff frequency curves of
   modes belonging to the same family intercept, i.e., for a bulk wave
   velocity ratio equal to a rational number. An interpretation of this
   phenomenon in terms of a strong repulsion between a pair of modes having
   a different parity in the vicinity of the cutoff frequencies is given.
   Experiments performed with materials of various Poisson's ratio
   demonstrate that the resonance spectrum of an unloaded elastic plate,
   locally excited by a laser pulse, is dominated by the ZGV Lamb modes.

Abstract = {{Shape memory alloy (SMA) honeycombs are promising new smart materials
   which may be used for light-weight structures, biomedical implants,
   actuators and active structures. In this study, the behavior of several
   SMA honeycomb structures is investigated by means of a continuum-based
   thermomechanically coupled micromechanical analysis. To this end,
   macroscopic inelastic stress strain responses of several topologies are
   investigated, both for pseudoelasticity and for shape memory effect. It
   was found that the triangular topology exhibits the best performance. In
   addition, the initial transformation surfaces are presented for all
   possible combinations of applied in-plane stresses. A special two-phase
   microstructure that is capable of producing an overall negative
   coefficient of thermal expansion is suggested and studied. In this
   configuration, in which one of the phases is a SMA, residual strains are
   being generated upon recovery. Here, the negative coefficient of thermal
   expansion appears to be associated with a larger amount of residual
   strain upon recovery. Furthermore, a two-dimensional SMA re-entrant
   topology that generates a negative inplane Poisson's ratio is analyzed,
   and the effect of the full thermomechanical coupling is examined.
   Finally, the response of a particular three-dimensional microstructure
   is studied.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To establish whether multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, who
   have lost the therapeutic effect of interferon-beta (IFN-beta) owing to
   neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) and subsequently revert from a
   NAb-positive to a NAb-negative state under continued IFN-beta-1b
   therapy, regain clinical effect after reversion.
   Background Several studies have shown that a significant proportion of
   patients treated with IFN-beta develop NAbs that hamper or abolish the
   therapeutic effect of IFN-beta. However, some patients, who become
   NAb-positive under treatment with IFN-beta-1b, may revert to a
   NAb-negative state under continuous treatment.
   Methods We identified 40 patients from the Danish IFN protocol, who
   fulfilled the criteria: NAb-positive status for at least 12 months
   followed by reversion to NAb-negative state for at least 12 months. For
   comparison, we included 64 matching cases that had remained NAb-negative
   during an observation time of at least 36 months. The two groups were
   clinically and demographically alike. We measured NAb-neutralizing
   capacity using a clinically validated cytopathic effect assay. A blood
   sample with a neutralizing capacity of 20\% or more was considered as
   NAb-positive. A patient was defined as NAb-positive after two
   consecutive blood tests separated by at least 6 months. Reversion to a
   NAb-negative state required at least two consecutive negative tests. To
   allow for the confounding effect of time we employed a mixed Poisson
   model.
   Results Patients who had been NAb-positive and reverted to a
   NAb-negative state regained treatment effect with the relapse rate as
   before the NAb-positive period adjusting for the effect of time, and the
   relapse rate was the same as in the permanently NAb-negative patients in
   corresponding time periods. The relapse rate ratio comparing the
   NAb-positive with the NAb-negative periods was 1.98 (95\% confidence
   interval: 1.32 -2.97).
   Conclusion Under NAb-positive periods, the clinical effect of IFN-beta
   was abolished. When NAbs disappeared spontaneously under continued
   treatment, patients regained the full effect of INF-beta-1b therapy with
   no negative carry-over effect from the previous NAb-positive period.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) has been
   fabricated by omitting the extrusion stage usually required to form the
   characteristic nodule-fibril microstructure of this material. This new
   route consists of compaction followed by multiple sintering treatments,
   with the best results using two successive sintering treatments. This
   article examines the mechanical properties of cylindrical compacts
   subjected to between one and four successive sintering treatments. The
   indentation resistance of the double-sintered material was found to be
   2.5 times that of conventionally processed UHMWPE and similar to that
   found in the extruded form of auxetic polyethylene. The flexural
   strength and strain to failure increase dramatically with the first
   sintering treatment and then remain almost constant. This processing
   route has potential for the production of more complex, useful shapes
   than can currently be produced since it removes the limitations imposed
   by the geometry of the barrel required for the extrusion stage.}},

Abstract = {{The High-Resolution Research Tomograph (HRRT) is a dedicated human brain
   positron emission tomography ( PET) scanner. Recently, a 3D filtered
   backprojection (3D-FBP) reconstruction method has been implemented to
   reduce bias in short duration frames, currently observed in 3D ordinary
   Poisson OSEM (3D-OP-OSEM) reconstructions. Further improvements might be
   expected using a new method of variance reduction on randoms (VRR) based
   on coincidence histograms instead of using the delayed window technique
   (DW) to estimate randoms. The goal of this study was to evaluate VRR in
   combination with 3D-OP-OSEM and 3D-FBP reconstruction techniques. To
   this end, several phantom studies and a human brain study were
   performed. For most phantom studies, 3D-OP-OSEM showed higher accuracy
   of observed activity concentrations with VRR than with DW. However, both
   positive and negative deviations in reconstructed activity
   concentrations and large biases of grey to white matter contrast ratio
   (up to 88\%) were still observed as a function of scan statistics.
   Moreover 3D-OP-OSEM+VRR also showed bias up to 64\% in clinical data,
   i.e. in some pharmacokinetic parameters as compared with those obtained
   with 3D-FBP+VRR. In the case of 3D-FBP, VRR showed similar results as DW
   for both phantom and clinical data, except that VRR showed a better
   standard deviation of 6 -10\%. Therefore, VRR should be used to correct
   for randoms in HRRT PET studies.}},

Abstract = {{Primary objective: To quantify the 10 year health service use (HSU) and
   mortality outcomes for people with a traumatic brain injury (TBI).
   Research design: A population-based matched cohort study using linked
   administrative data from Manitoba, Canada (Manitoba Injury Outcome
   Study).
   Methods and procedures: An inception cohort (1988-1991) of hospitalized
   cases with TBI aged 18-64 years (n = 1290) was identified and matched to
   a non-injured comparison group (n = 1290). Survival analysis, Negative
   binomial and Poisson regression were used to quantify associations
   between injury and HSU/mortality outcomes for 10 years following the TBI
   event.
   Main outcome and results: The majority of deaths (47.2\%) occurred in
   the first 60 days following injury. Excluding the first 60 days, the
   adjusted 10 year mortality remained elevated (mortality rate ratio =
   1.48, 95\% CI = 1.02-2.15). After adjusting for demographic
   characteristics and pre-existing health status, the TBI cohort had more
   post-injury hospitalizations (rate ratio (RR) = 1.54, 95\% CI =
   1.39-1.71), greater cumulative lengths of stay (RR= 5.14, 95\% CI =
   3.29-8.02) and a greater post-injury physician claims rate (RR = 1.44,
   95\% CI = 1.35-1.53) than the non-injured cohort.
   Conclusions: People who sustain a TBI and survive the initial acute
   phase of care experience substantially increased long-term morbidity

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Although animal experiments have shown that cadmium exposure
   results in severe dental caries, limited epidemiologic data are
   available on this issue.
   OBJECTIVES: We aimed to examine the relationship between environmental
   cadmium exposure and dental caries in children 6-12 years of age.
   METHODS: We analyzed cross-sectional data, including urine cadmium
   concentrations and counts of decayed or filled tooth surfaces, from the
   Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. We used logistic
   and zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) regression to estimate the
   association between urine cadmium concentrations and caries experience,
   adjusting these analyses for potential confounders including
   environmental tobacco smoke (ETS).
   RESULTS: Urine cadmium concentrations ranged from 0.01 to 3.38 ng/mL.
   Approximately 56\% of children had experienced caries in their deciduous
   teeth, and almost 30\% had been affected by caries in their permanent
   dentition. An interquartile range (IQR) increase in creatinine-corrected
   cadmium concentrations (0.21 mu g/g creatinine) corresponded to a 16\%
   increase in the odds of having experienced caries in deciduous teeth
   {[}prevalence odds ratio (OR) = 1.16; 95\% confidence interval (CI),
   0.96-1.40]. This association was statistically significant in children
   with low ETS exposure (prevalence OR = 1.30; 95\% CI, 1.01-1.67). The
   results from the ZINB regression indicated that, among children with any
   caries history in their deciduous teeth, an IQR increase in cadmium was
   associated with 17\% increase in the number of decayed or filled
   surfaces. We observed no association between cadmium and caries
   experience in permanent teeth.
   CONCLUSIONS: Environmental cadmium exposure may be associated with
   increased risk of dental caries in deciduous teeth of children.}},

Abstract = {{An auxetic (or negative Poisson's ratio) material expands in all
   directions when pulled in only one, behaving in an opposite way compared
   with ``classical{''} materials. A structure not super-imposable with its
   mirror image is defined as chiral. A chiral structural honeycomb
   (noncentresymmetric) features auxeticity, i.e., a negative Poisson's
   ratio behaviour in the plane. Although chirality is common in nature and
   organic chemistry, it is an unusual characteristic in structural
   materials and components. We have manufactured truss assemblies based on
   cells of chiral honeycomb topology using shape memory alloy (SMA)
   ribbons as core material. The main objective of this work is to obtain a
   new functional structure combining the chiral honeycomb topology and
   shape memory alloys as a new concept of smart cellular solid. The chiral
   SMA honeycomb can be used in new types of deployable antenna reflectors,
   allowing the compression of the structure in a small volume of space for
   subsequent deployment. The new honeycomb concept could also be used in
   packaging applications to store strain energy during an impact loading
   and as a core for a sandwich structure for damping or for
   crashworthiness. (c) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Control charts based on the Poisson and negative binomial distribution
   for monitoring time series of counts typically arising in the
   surveillance of infectious diseases are presented. The in-control mean
   is assumed to be time-varying and linear on the log-scale with intercept
   and seasonal components. If a shift in the intercept occurs the system
   goes out-of-control. Using the generalized likelihood ratio (GLR)
   statistic a monitoring scheme is formulated to detect on-line whether a
   shift in the intercept occurred. In the case of Poisson the necessary
   quantities of the GLR detector can be efficiently computed by recursive
   formulas. Extensions to more general alternatives e.g. containing an
   auto-regressive epidemic component are discussed. Using Monte Carlo
   simulations run-length properties of the proposed schemes are
   investigated and the Poisson scheme is compared to existing methods. The
   practicability of the charts is demonstrated by applying them to the
   observed number of salmonella hadar cases in Germany 2001-2006. (c) 2008

Abstract = {{The equivalent in-plane properties for hexagonal and re-entrant
   (auxetic) lattices are investigated through the analysis of partial
   differential equations associated with their homogenized continuum
   models. The adopted homogenization technique interprets the discrete
   lattice equations according to a finite differences formalism, and it is
   applied in conjunction with the finite element description of the
   lattice unit cell. It therefore allows handling of structures with
   different levels of complexity and internal geometry within a general
   and compact framework, which can be easily implemented. The estimation
   of the mechanical properties is carried out through a comparison between
   the derived differential equations and appropriate elasticity models.
   Equivalent Young's moduli, Poisson's ratios and relative density are
   estimated and compared with analytical formulae available in the
   literature. In-plane wave propagation characteristics of honeycombs are
   also investigated to evaluate phase velocity variation in terms of
   frequency and direction of propagation. Comparisons are performed with
   the values obtained through the application of Bloch theorem for
   two-dimensional periodic structures, to show the accuracy of the
   technique and highlight limitations introduced by the long wavelength
   approximation associated with the homogenization technique. (c) 2008

Abstract = {{We considered the negative group velocity of plate-mode waves. Lamb
   waves are a typical example of existence of negative group velocity.
   However, if we try to apply the negative group velocity of Lamb waves to
   some applications such as acoustical flat lenses, there is a problem
   about the existence of negative group velocity of Lamb waves. Its
   existence depends only on Poisson's ratio. That is, the negative group
   velocities of Lamb waves depend only physical parameters of materials.
   Consequently, we considered to control a negative group velocity. The
   negative group velocity of Lamb-type waves in a solid/liquid/solid
   structure can be controlled by changing the thickness of a liquid layer.
   In this research, we considered the relationships between the existence
   of negative group velocities and the parameters of each layer material
   with respect to Lamb-type waves in a solid/liquid/solid structure by
   numerical calculation. As a result, it was confirmed that the negative
   group velocity of Lamb-type waves depended not only on Poisson's ratio
   but also on the density of each layer and the longitudinal wave velocity
   of the liquid layer. This result is useful when the negative group
   velocity of Lamb-type waves is applied to acoustical flat lenses, which
   require the negative group velocity.}},

Abstract = {{A micromechanical model that is based on the homogenization technique
   for periodic composites is developed for the prediction of the response
   of multiphase materials undergoing large deformations. Every one of the
   constituents is supposed to be either a rate-independent
   thermoelastoplastic material or a thermoelastic one, both of which are
   formulated in the framework of finite strains. Hyperelastic constituents
   are obtained as a special case. The resulting macroscopic ( global)
   constitutive equations of the composite involve the instantaneous
   mechanical and thermal tangent tensors. The reliability of the
   prediction is examined by comparisons with the composite cylinder
   assemblage model, which is formulated for a finite strain
   rate-independent thermoplasticity and is valid under axisymmetric
   loading. Applications are given for a system of a rubber-like matrix
   reinforced by metallic fibers. In addition, the behavior of
   rate-independent elastoplastic laminated materials undergoing large
   deformations and subjected to in-plane loading is investigated. Finally,
   the response of an elastoplastic auxetic metallic material, which is
   capable of generating a negative Poisson's ratio at any stage of a
   finite strain loading is examined by employing the proposed
   micromechanical model.}},

Abstract = {{Most materials shrink laterally like a rubber band when stretched, so
   their Poisson's ratios are positive. Likewise, most materials contract
   in all directions when hydrostatically compressed and decrease density
   when stretched, so they have positive linear compressibilities. We found
   that the in- plane Poisson's ratio of carbon nanotube sheets (
   buckypaper) can be tuned from positive to negative by mixing single-
   walled and multiwalled nanotubes. Density- normalized sheet toughness,
   strength, and modulus were substantially increased by this mixing. A
   simple model predicts the sign and magnitude of Poisson's ratio for
   buckypaper from the relative ease of nanofiber bending and stretch, and
   explains why the Poisson's ratios of ordinary writing paper are positive
   and much larger. Theory also explains why the negative in- plane
   Poisson's ratio is associated with a large positive Poisson's ratio for
   the sheet thickness, and predicts that hydrostatic compression can
   produce biaxial sheet expansion. This tunability of Poisson's ratio can
   be exploited in the design of sheet- derived composites, artificial
   muscles, gaskets, and chemical and mechanical sensors.}},

   Theorem 1 extends in several directions previous results and says that

Title = {{Thermal shifts and intermittent linear response of aging systems}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{77}},
Number = {{4, 1}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{At time t after an initial quench, an aging system responds to a
   perturbation turned on at time t(w)< t in a way mainly depending on the
   number of intermittent energy fluctuations, so-called quakes, which fall
   within the observation interval (t(w),t] {[}P. Sibani, G. F. Rodriguez,
   and G. G. Kenning, Phys. Rev. B 74, 224407 (2006); P. Sibani, Eur. J.
   Phys. B 58, 483 (2007)]. The temporal distribution of the quakes implies
   a functional dependence of the average response on the ratio t/t(w).
   Further insight is obtained imposing small temperature steps, so-called
   T shifts. The average response as a function of t/t(w,eff), where
   t(w,eff) is the effective age, is similar to the response of a system
   aged isothermally at the final temperature. Using an Ising model with
   plaquette interactions, the applicability of analytic formulas for the
   average isothermal magnetization is confirmed. The T-shifted aging
   behavior of the model is approximately described using effective ages.
   Large positive shifts nearly reset the effective age. Negative T shifts
   offer a more detailed probe of the dynamics. Assuming the marginal
   stability of the ``current{''} attractor against thermal noise
   fluctuations, the scaling form t(w,eff)=t(w)(x) and the dependence of
   the exponent x on the aging temperatures before and after the shift are
   theoretically available. The predicted form of x has no adjustable
   parameters. Both the algebraic scaling of the effective age and the form
   of the exponent reasonably agree with the data. The present simulations
   thus confirm the crucial role of marginal stability in glassy
   relaxation.}},

Abstract = {{Results of systematic numerical studies are presented which suggest that
   suitable alternative wall constructions may lead to elastic
   load-carrying capacities of light-weight structures which significantly
   exceed those of conventional monocoque constructions, and that in
   certain cases this improvement may also be accompanied by a decrease in
   imperfection-sensitivity. Two kinds of wall modifications are
   considered: a hybrid wall construction where the skin of a light-weight
   structure is coated with a low-density material, and nonhomogeneous - in
   particular lattice and biaxially corrugated - wall constructions. The
   paper focuses on the elastic load-carrying behavior of shell- and
   plate-like structures, and structural efficiency is assessed on the
   basis of their bifurcation buckling resistance while other design
   criteria, such as e.g. stiffness and plasticity, are not taken into

Abstract = {{Background. Klebsiella pneumoniae causes serious, life-threatening
   infections in humans in endemic and epidemic settings. The objective of
   this study was to determine whether the incidence of K. pneumoniae
   bloodstream infection (BSI) was higher during warm months.
   Methods. We analyzed surveillance data from 2001-2006 at 4 hospitals
   located on 4 continents. Incidence rates (IRs) and IR ratios (IRRs) were
   determined using multivariable Poisson regression.
   Results. In total, 1189 cases of K. pneumonia BSIs occurred during
   6,671,337 patient-days. The IR of K. pneumoniae BSI during the 4 warmest
   months of the year was 2.23/10,000 patient-days, whereas the IR of K.
   pneumoniae BSI for the other 8 months was 1.55/10,000 patient-days (IRR,
   1.46 {[}95\% confidence interval, 1.04-2.06]; P = .03). In contrast, no
   seasonal variation was identified in rates of BSI due to Enterobacter or
   Serratia species. Using Poisson regression, we showed that temperature
   (P < .0001) and dew point (a marker for relative humidity; P < .0001)
   were both linearly predictive of increasing rates of K. pneumoniae BSI.
   Conclusions. Environmental pressures may lead to an increase in the IR
   of K. pneumoniae BSI during the warmest months of the year.}},

Abstract = {{In the task to accurately model auxetic foams, a number of details must
   be correctly accounted for. Firstly, the micro-structure is not simple
   and can only be qualitatively described by traditional, regular,
   cellular models. Computed tomography (CT) data has been used to begin to
   describe the details of the complex geometry of the foams'
   microstructure and to describe it in a manner suitable for advanced
   models. Using these modelling techniques that are able to capture
   difficult geometries, values of the local and global mechanical
   properties are calculated. These mechanical calculations are based on a
   linear elastic core and global properties are a mean strain estimate.
   The latter is shown to be inadequate, highlighting the need for a
   heterogeneous basis for accurate modelling. The significant mechanical
   anisotropy of the material is reported and mechanical results are recast
   according to axis of major and minor principal stiffness demonstrating
   the elastic symmetry of the foam and a requirement of an objective
   methodology in modelling an inherently anisotropic material. (c) 2008

Abstract = {{Auxetics (i.e. systems with negative Poisson's ratios) exhibit the
   unexpected feature of becoming fatter when stretched and narrower when
   compressed. A particular class of materials which has attracted
   significant attention in recent years in view of its potential for
   auxeticity is that of zeolites, in particular, the zeolite NAT where
   auxeticity has now been experimentally measured. Here we use molecular
   modelling to accurately reproduce through force-field based simulations
   the experimentally measured negative Poisson's ratios in NAT. We also
   simulate and measure the atomic level deformations that result when NAT
   is mechanically deformed and use these to evaluate whether existing
   models can be used to explain the negative Poisson's ratios in
   natrolite. In particular we show that existing 2D models involving
   `rotating semirigid quadrilaterals' can explain some aspects of the
   behaviour of NAT and make, suggestions how such models can be improved
   so as to provide a better description of NAT in the auxetic (001) plane.}},

   compressed i.e. they exhibit a negative Poisson's ratio. Here, we
   present an analysis of a novel class of structures (referred to as
   `mata-chiral') which belong to the class of auxetics constructed using

Abstract = {{Auxetics exhibit the unusual property of expanding when uniaxially
   stretched (negative Poisson's ratio), a property that is usually linked
   to particular geometric features and deformation mechanisms. One of the
   mechanisms which results in auxetic behavious is the one involving
   rotating rigid units, for which, systems made from triangles, squares or
   rectangles have already been considered. In this work we extend this
   study by considering systems which can be constructed from either
   connected rhombi or connected parallelograms. We show that various types
   of such systems can exist and we discuss in detail the properties of one
   type of `rotating rhombi' and one type of `rotating parallelograms'. We
   also show that the Poisson's ratio of these systems, while can be
   positive or negative, is anisotropic and dependent on the shape of the
   parallelograms/rhombi and the degree of openness of the system. (c) 2008

Abstract = {{A Molecular Dynamics simulation study has been carried out of the
   Lennard-Jones fluid in the stable liquid and metastable liquid-vapour
   co-existence regions. The interest has been mainly in states for which
   the pressure of the fluid is negative, and how they compare with those
   at positive pressure. The behaviour of the LJ fluid shows parallels with
   that of water, with the maximum tensile strength near the triple point
   being approximately seven times the critical pressure. The maximum
   tensile strength increases with cooling. Many of the properties, such as
   elastic moduli, show a smooth transition across the liquid-vapour
   boundary, on the liquid side, and a monotonic variation in the
   metastable region of the phase diagram. There is however a similarity in
   behaviour of combinations of the mechanical properties and the equation
   of state; for example, the pressure and infinite frequency Poissons
   ratio have minima at approximately the same densities. Insights into the
   heterogeneity of the assembly of particles are provided by probability
   distributions of the net force on a molecule and that of a definition
   for the local pressure experienced by a molecule, or `pressurelet'. The
   maximum negative pressure coincides with the maximum fraction of
   molecules individually experiencing a negative pressure.}},

Abstract = {{In this work the concept of using a chiral honeycomb as the internal
   structure for a passively morphing wing is explored. The use of a chiral
   honeycomb, which features an in-plane negative Poisson's ratio,
   potentially offers high deformability whilst maintaining structural
   integrity of the wing box. A finite element simulation was carried out,
   coupling a complete two-dimensional model of the wing and internal
   structure to a panel code flow solver. An iterative process was then
   used in order to predict the wing camber change with respect to
   air-flow. The concept was validated experimentally through the
   construction of a prototype wing for wind-tunnel testing. The measured
   response was non-linear with respect to aerodynamic loading, but the
   final deflected shape at the design case compared well with the finite
   element prediction. The concept was proven to work for small camber
   changes, with larger deflections predicted by tailoring the mechanical
   properties of the hexachiral core.}},

   infers that the bearing capacity of the joint raises with increasing
   shearing load. The stress state parameters were determined for normal
   indentation and compression with shear contract interaction. The contact
   interactions were analyzed by the finite element method for various
   contact profiles. Poisson's ration was varied within the theoretically
   acceptable for the isotropic elastic medium values. The analogous
   calculations were performed for a joint with a deformed element made of
   anisotropic auxetic composite whose reinforcement angle was varied as a
   factor of elastic constants. The nonlinear dependencies of the maximum
   pressure, tangential stress and slippage were obtained as a function of

Abstract = {{Following the successful batch production of auxetic ultra high
   molecular weight polyethylene, polypropylene and nylon, in the form of
   10 mm diameter cylinders, a continuous melt extrusion route was adapted
   from conventional melt extrusion routes to produce fibres. Previous
   studies have shown that, once drawing has occurred, the auxetic effect
   is lost and, consequently, the mechanical properties of these fibres
   have been restricting their otherwise great potential in a wide range of
   applications. Research has therefore been undertaken into improving this
   matter by subjecting the auxetic fibres to a range of different thermal
   post-production processing conditions. The fibres then underwent
   mechanical testing, Differential Scanning Calorimetry and Video
   Extensometry. Results suggest that annealing enhances the mechanical
   properties of these fibres and may provide a further route to enhancing
   auxeticity in improving homogeneity by over 40\%.}},

Abstract = {{We study the lateral deformations of randomly folded elastoplastic and
   predominantly plastic thin sheets under the uniaxial and radial
   compressions. We found that the lateral deformations of cylinders folded
   from elastoplastic sheets of paper obey a power law behavior with the
   universal Poisson's index nu = 0.17 +/- 0.01, which does not depend
   neither the paper kind and sheet sizes (thickness, edge length) nor the
   folding confinement ratio. In contrast to this, the lateral deformations
   of randomly folded predominantly plastic aluminum foils display the
   linear dependence on the axial compression with the universal Poisson's
   ratio nu(e) = 0.33 +/- 0.01. This difference is consistent with the
   difference in fractal topology of randomly folded elastoplastic and
   predominantly plastic sheets, which is found to belong to different
   universality classes. The general form of constitutive
   stress-deformation relations for randomly folded elastoplastic sheets is
   suggested.}},

Abstract = {{The Hyuganada region, a forearc region of Southwest Japan, is
   characterized by several interesting geological and geophysical
   features, i.e., significant aseismic crustal uplift of similar to 120m
   during the past similar to 120 thousand years at the Miyazaki Plain,
   negative free-air gravity anomalies with the maximum magnitude of - 130
   mgal, and relatively less cohesive interplate coupling compared with
   that for off the Shikoku and Kii Peninsula. In order to examine the
   causes of these observations, we determined a detailed three-dimensional
   seismic velocity structure based on the seismic data observed by ocean
   bottom seismometers (OBS) and land stations. P- and S-wave tomographic
   velocity structures clearly indicate the subducting slab and also the
   zones of high Poisson's ratio at 25-35 km depth along the coastline of
   the northeastern part of the Hyuganada. The region with high Poisson's
   ratio may correspond to the serpentinized mantle wedge as suggested for
   other mantle wedges, and appears to be coincident with the zone for
   observed aseismic slips such as the slow-slip and after-slip events.
   Also, the detection may be related to a relatively weak interplate
   coupling in the Hyuganada region. The tomographic structures also
   indicate low velocity zones with a horizontal scale comparable to the
   Kyushu-Palau Ridge in and around the subducting slab. If we assume that
   the low velocity zones correspond to the subducted Kyushu-Palau Ridge,
   then the predicted gravity anomaly due to the density contrast between
   the low velocity zones and the surrounding region can explain about 60\%
   of the gravity anomaly in the Hyuganada region. The buoyancy is probably
   an important factor for the crustal uplift observed in the Miyazaki
   Plain, the steep bending of the subducting slab and the normal
   fault-type earthquakes around the Hyuganada region. (C) 2008 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In the present paper, it is analyzed the problem of a crack approaching
   a plastically graded microstructure along its path. The problem regards
   a nanocrystalline electrodeposited material in which the plastic
   properties (yield stress, hardness, UTS) vary much more than the elastic
   ones (Young modulus and Poisson ratio).
   In the present paper, the analysis has been conducted by employing
   ABAQUS simulations on nanocrystalline Ni-W alloys with 20 and 100 nm
   constant grain size; the results were compared with those of the
   plastically graded sheets with negative graded configuration in which
   the grain size varies between 20 and 100 nm from the surface to the
   bottom in a linear way and with positive graded configuration in which
   the grain size varies between 100 and 20 nm from the surface to the
   bottom in a linear way.
   The finite element study has conducted to the conclusion that the grade
   in the microstructure and consequent plastic mechanical properties of
   nanocrystalline Ni-W alloys leads to several changes in the driving
   force for fracture demonstrated by the different behavior of the
   effective J-integral at the crack tip in the different studied
   configurations. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The small-strain stress-strain properties of expanded polystyrene (EPS)
   geofoam with densities of about 20 kg/m(3) and 30 kg/m(3) were evaluated
   by laboratory unconfined compression tests on specimens of 75 mm in
   diameter and 150 mm in height. Two series of tests were conducted, which
   were continuous monotonic loading (ML) tests and ML tests intervened by
   sustained creep loading and minute cycles of unload and reload.
   Relatively small vertical and horizontal strains were locally measured
   by means of a pair of local deformation transducers (LDTs) and a set of
   three clip gauges, respectively. The paramount importance of measuring
   local strains in compression tests on EPS to reliably evaluate its
   stress-strain properties, in particular those at relatively small
   strains, is demonstrated. The initial modulus, E-0, and Poisson's ratio,
   v(0), were evaluated from initial stress-strain relations at small
   strains obtained by these ML tests. The tangent parameters, E-tan and
   V-tan, were also evaluated from the ML stress-strain behaviour. The
   equivalent parameters, E-eq and v(eq), were evaluated from the
   stress-strain behaviour during minute cycles of unload and reload. The
   stress-strain behaviour is essentially linear only at small strains, and
   it becomes highly non-linear and a significant drop of stiffness occurs
   as observed in the overall stress-strain behaviour. The Poisson's ratio
   for inelastic deformation is found to be negative.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with the design of a non-negative matrix
   factorization algorithm for image analysis. This can be used in the
   context of blind source separation, where each observed image is a
   linear combination of a few basis functions, and that both the
   coefficients for the linear combination and the bases are unknown. In
   addition, the observed images are commonly corrupted by noise. While
   algorithms have been developed when the noise obeys Gaussian or Poisson
   statistics, here we take it to be Laplacian, which is more
   representative for other leptokurtic distributions. It is applicable for
   cases such as transform coefficient distributions and when there are
   insufficient noise sources for the Central Limit Theorem to apply. We
   formulate the problem as an L-1 minimization and solve it via linear
   programming.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanical behavior of electromagneic materials is usually sensitive
   to the electric, magnetic as well as temperature field. It is found by
   the experiments in this paper that the grads of the non-uniform electric
   field can increase or decrease the speed of the heat conduction in
   conductors, and the environment temperature and the varying-time
   excitation magnetic field have obvious influence on the strain of the
   giant magnetostrictive materials. Our theoretical prediction on the
   induced body and boundary forces in ferromagnetic materials and on the
   constitutive behavior of the giant magnetostrictive materials also
   exhibited a strong effect of multi-field coupling, which makes the
   mechanical responses of electromagnetic materials are very different
   from the uncoupling ones. Furthermore, our theoretical investigations
   show that the effect of the multi-field coupling is not only in
   macroscales but also in microscales. For the elastic properties of
   nanowires, it is found in this paper that the negative pressure on the
   surfaces stemmed from the transverse electric field modifies the Young's
   modulus and Poisson's ratio of nanowires significantly. The relative
   change of elastic properties is also strongly dependent on the diameter
   of nanowires.}},

Abstract = {{Studies of citrus leafminer in a coastal orchard in NSW, Australia
   indicated that an increase in abundance to about one mine per flush was
   followed during the midseason flush by a rapid increase in population
   that was related to an increase in the percentage of leaves infested
   within flushes and the number of mines per leaf. The fits of frequency
   distributions and Iwao's patchiness regression indicated that
   populations were highly contagious initially, and as the exponent k of
   the negative binomial distribution increased with increasing population
   density, the distribution approached random. Concurrently, the
   coefficient of variation of mines per flush (which was strongly related
   to the proportion of un-infested flushes) decreased to about unity as
   the proportion of un-infested flushes reached zero and fell further as
   the number of mines per flush increased. Both numerative and binomial
   sequential sampling plans were developed using a decision threshold
   based on 1.2 mines per flush. The binomial sampling plan was based on a
   closely fitting model of the functional relationship between mean
   density and proportion of infested flushes. Functional relationships
   using the parameters determined from Iwao's patchiness regression and
   Taylor's power law were equally satisfactory, and one based on the
   negative binomial model also fitted well, but the Poisson model did not.
   The three best fitting models indicated that a decision threshold of 1.2
   mines per flush was equivalent to 50\% of flushes infested. From a
   practical point of view, the transition from 25\% infestation of flushes
   through 50\% is so rapid that it may be prudent to take action when the
   25\% level is reached; otherwise, the 50\% may be passed before the crop
   is checked again. For valuable nursery stock should infestation be
   detected in spring, it may be advisable to apply prophylactic treatment
   as the midseason flush starts.}},

Abstract = {{The Hinde-Demtrio (HD) family of distributions, which are discrete
   exponential dispersion models with an additional real index parameter p,
   have been recently characterized from the unit variance function
   mu+mu(p). For p equals to 2, 3,..., the corresponding distributions are
   concentrated on non negative integers, overdispersed and zero-inflated
   with respect to a Poisson distribution having the same mean. The
   negative binomial (p=2) and strict arcsine (p=3) distributions are HD
   families; the limit case (p ->infinity) is associated to a suitable
   Poisson distribution. Apart from these count distributions, none of the
   HD distributions has explicit probability mass functions p(k). This
   article shows that the ratios r(k)=kp(k)/p(k-1), k=1,..., p-1, are equal
   and different from r(p). This new property allows, for a given count
   data set, to determine the integer p by some tests. The extreme
   situation of p=2 is of general interest for count data. Some examples
   are used for illustrations and discussions.}},

Abstract = {{For the geomembrane around circular structures, a simplified model is
   presented to analyze its tensions and strains subjected to a
   differential settlement based on the conventional membrane theory. It is
   found that wrinkles will be induced in the geomembrane due to the
   negative in-plane compressive stress. Further, an improved analysis
   model was given based on the wrinkled membrane theory by introducing the
   concept of ``variable Poisson's ratio{''}. Calculated results using the
   simplified model and the improved model are compared. Parametric studies
   show that minimizing the differential settlement and using flexible
   geomembranes in the landfill, can limit the maximum tension in the
   geomembrane to allowable levels and reduce its behaved degree of
   wrinkles.}},

Abstract = {{Micro/nano positioning stages play an essential role in micro/nano
   precision technology, so the design and development of a new six-axis
   micro positioning stage are presented in this research. Based on
   Steward's theory, the stage adopts negative Poisson's ratio with flexure
   hinges. Since each of the axes is a planar mechanism structure, the
   stage is fabricated out of aluminum with the micro machining - a simple
   and well - developed fabrication technique for cost down and batch
   production. The stage consists of a top plate and a base plate, two
   hexagons of which the diameters are respectively 22 mm and 95.2 mm with
   a distance of 21.6 mm in between, and six trapezoid amplifiers, each of
   which is connected to the base plate at an angle of 30 degrees. Each
   amplifier consists of three layers two inner layers of symmetrical
   flexure hinges and one outer layer of non-symmetrical flexure hinge.
   In this research, the stress, strain and amplification are calculated
   with the software of SolidWorks Ansys@. In experiment, each amplifier is
   driven by a piezoelectric transducer (PZT), and the displacements are
   measure wit a laser displacement sensor and recorded for comparison of
   the single-axis amplifier with the six-axis stage. The results show that
   the amplification of the displacement of a single-axis amplifier is 15
   times, that the horizon translation, the vertical translation, the tilt
   angle and the rotational angle are 50 Pm, 50 pm, 0.5 degrees and 0.5
   degrees respectively, and that the displacement resolution and the
   rotational resolution are 15.6 nm and 2.7 mu rad respectively. It is
   obvious that the six-axis stage of this research, indeed, retains the
   features of high amplification and minimization, and is a novel and
   low-cost six-axis micro positioning stage.

Abstract = {{A field study was carried out during 2003-04 at Ladakh at to study the
   spatial distribution of onion thrips (Thrips tabaci Lindeman) in `Brown

   variance mean ratio, exponent k and common k (Kc), Lloyd's indices of
   mean crowding (x{*}) and patchiness index (x{*}root x) and Taylor's
   power law revealed that the onion thrips exhibited aggregated or
   contagious pattern of distribution in the field. The value of Taylor's
   aggregation index (b) was 1.3778 and 1.4186 during 2003 and 2004
   respectively. In study of Iwao's m{*} - m relationship it was found that
   contagiousness coefficient value (a = 1.002 and 1.038 respectively) was
   > 1. This also indicated that thrips population followed negative
   binomial distribution pattern as an alternative of poisson or random
   distribution. The intercept also justified that the distribution of
   thrips was contagion in nature.}},

   Both unit lateral extension and unit normal compression values were

   levels of 8 to 28.7\%, respectively. Effects of loading rates were also
   investigated and results show that Poisson's ratio increased from 0.136

   modulus was observed to decrease as moisture increased. Average values
   of 201.5 to 41.30 N mm(-2) were noted for moisture levels of 8 to

   Staphylococcus epidermidis under in vitro flow conditions on intraocular
   lenses (IOLs) made of 4 biomaterials: poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA),
   silicone, hydrophilic acrylic, and hydrophobic acrylic.
   SETTING: Department of Ophthalmology, Croix-Rousse University Hospital
   and University Research Laboratory, Lyon, France.
   METHODS: Intraocular lenses were placed in a bioreactor designed to
   replicate intraocular conditions. The model consisted of Tygon tubing
   connected to a vial. Three septa allowed the entry and elimination of
   the artificial aqueous humor and inoculation of the bacterial
   suspension. The first of 2 pumps moved the aqueous humor along the
   circuit; the second pump regulated the flow at which the nutritive
   environment was regenerated. At various times (12, 16, 24, 40, 48, 60,
   and 72 hours), IOLs were taken from this environment and the bound
   bacteria were removed and counted. The distribution of bacterial
   adhesion on the IOLs was modeled using polynomial Poisson regression. To
   test the effect of the IOL biomaterial on bacterial adhesion, likelihood
   ratio tests were performed.
   RESULTS: The model provided the kinetics of S epidermidis biofilm growth
   on IOLs. The biofilm growth on each of the 4 biomaterials occurred in 3
   phases: latent, dynamic or accelerated growth, and linear growth. The
   extent of bacterial binding to IOLs increased from hydrophilic acrylic
   polymer to PMMA, hydrophobic acrylic, and silicone. The differences were
   statistically significant.
   CONCLUSION: Bacterial adhesion to and biofilm development on the IOL
   surface depended on the characteristics of the biomaterial.}},

Abstract = {{Neonates are among the most vulnerable patient groups for healthcare

   Interpretation of neonatal bloodstream infection (BSI) rates requires
   stratification for case-mix. We assessed 1367 consecutive admissions to
   a single neonatal unit over a 34-month period. Four intrinsic and seven
   extrinsic risks were evaluated using Poisson regression analyses both
   individually and in combination. Nine of the 11 evaluated risk factors
   were significantly associated with BSI on univariate analyses. The only
   significant independent risks were parenteral nutrition, whether
   administered centrally or peripherally {[}incidence rate ratio (IRR):
   14.2; 95\% confidence interval (CI): 8.8-22.9; P < 0.001], and
   gestational age <26 weeks (IRR: 2.5; 95\% CI: 1.7-3.8; P < 0.001). The
   rate of BSI per 1000 patient-days was 40 times higher in infants with
   both of these than in infants with neither. If validated in other
   settings, stratification of neonatal BSI rate by two unambiguous risk
   factors, parenteral nutrition and birth gestational age <26 weeks,
   offers a simple method meaningful intra- and inter-hospital comparisons.

Abstract = {{In this article, convection driven by combined thermal and solutal
   concentration buoyancy effects in a lid-driven square cavity is examined
   using velocity-vorticity form of Navier-Stokes equations. The governing
   equations consist of vorticity transport equation, velocity Poisson
   equations, energy equation, and concentration equation. Validation
   results are discussed for convection due to heat and mass transfer in a
   lid-driven square cavity at Re=500, Le=2, and GRT=GRS=100. These results
   indicate that the present velocity-vorticity formulation could predict
   the characteristic parameters of flow, temperature, and solutal
   concentration fields using a much coarser mesh compared to the mesh used
   in a stream function-vorticity formulation. The capability of the
   proposed algorithm to handle complex geometry is demonstrated by
   application to mixed convection in a lid-driven square cavity with a
   square blockage. The effect of buoyancy ratio on the convection
   phenomenon is discussed for buoyancy ratio varying from-100 to 100 at
   Re=100. Under opposing temperature and concentration gradients along the
   vertical direction, the negative buoyancy ratios give rise to aiding
   flows.}},

Abstract = {{Confined expansion of polymer spheres coated with a metal slurry is a
   way of producing cellular microstructures that range from sintered
   hollow spheres in the unexpanded case to sintered polyhedra with nearly
   flat cell walls in the fully expanded case. In this paper, the expansion
   process is simulated by the finite element method for a face-centered
   cubic arrangement of spheres. Unit cell models for structural analysis
   are obtained from different stages of the expansion simulation. On the
   basis of these models, Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio along the
   axes of cubic symmetry are predicted for different relative densities
   and different degrees of expansion. It is shown that the elastic
   stiffness is increasing monotonically with increasing confined expansion
   of the spheres. Poisson's ratio is predicted as being negative for low
   degrees of expansion and positive for high degrees of expansion.}},

Abstract = {{An engineered Negative Poisson's Ratio (NPR) material is investigated in
   this paper for its design variations based on two design variables. The
   investigated material properties include effective Young's modulus,
   Poisson's ratio, material density, and load-bearing efficiency in terms
   of rigidity/weight ratio of the material. Nonlinear behaviors of the
   design variations are also investigated for large deformation
   applications. it is seen that by varying the two design variables, the
   NPR can reach as low as minus sixty in a special design. Any NPR number
   between a positive number and minus sixty can be obtained within the
   design domain through the design process. The nonlinear analysis results
   show that the effective material properties vary depending on the load
   amplitude, and the NPR material becomes stiffer and stiffer when the
   compression load is increased.
   The finite element method is utilized with a multi-step linearization
   method to predict the nonlinear behaviors of NPR materials. This will
   allow the effective material properties to be calculated for any given
   load amplitude. The new capability can be then used to design desired
   NPR material in a function-oriented material design (FOMD) environment
   for advanced application development. Both linear and nonlinear analysis
   results are presented and compared in this paper in order to demonstrate
   the necessity of accounting for geometric nonlinearity in the NPR
   material design process. An NPR material simulation and design system,
   called FOMD-NPR, has also been developed at MKP Structural Design
   Associates, Inc. for designing innovative NPR materials for various
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{The investigation of equivalent in-plane properties for hexagonal and

   the partial differential equations associated with their homogenized
   continuum models. A homogenization technique is adopted based on the
   approximation of the discrete lattice equations according to the finite
   differences formalism. The technique can be used in conjunction with a
   finite element (FE) description of the lattice unit cell and therefore
   allows handling structures with different levels of complexity and
   various internal geometries within a general and compact framework that
   can be easily implemented in a numerical code. The in-plane wave
   propagation characteristics of honeycombs can be investigated with the
   proposed approach: approximate phase velocities can be calculated from
   the equations of motion for the low-frequency modes and compared with
   the exact values obtained through a Fourier analysis of the unit cell.}},

Abstract = {{Blackman's diagram of two dimensionless ratios of elastic constants is
   frequently used to correlate elastic properties of cubic crystals with
   interatomic bondings. Every's diagram of a different set of two
   dimensionless variables was used by us for classification of various
   properties of such crystals. We compare these two ways of
   characterization of elastic properties of cubic materials and consider
   the description of various groups of materials, e.g. simple metals,
   oxides, and alkali halides. With exception of intermediate valent
   compounds, the correlation coefficients for Every's diagrams of various
   groups of materials are greater than for Blackaman's diagrams, revealing
   the existence of a linear relationship between two dimensionless Every's
   variables. Alignment of elements and compounds along lines of constant
   Poisson's ratio nu((100), m), (m arbitrary perpendicular to < 100 >) is
   observed. Division of the stability region in Blackman's diagram into
   region of complete auxetics, auxetics and non-auxetics is introduced.
   Correlations of a scaling and an acoustic anisotropy parameter are
   considered.}},

Abstract = {{Southeastern Tibet marks the site of presumed clockwise rotation of the
   crust due to the India-Eurasian collision and abutment against the
   stable Sichuan basin and South China block. Knowing the structure of the
   crust is a key to better understanding of crustal deformation and
   seismicity in this region. Here, we analyze recordings of teleseismic
   earthquakes from 25 temporary broadband seismic stations and one
   permanent station using the receiver function method. We find that the
   crustal thickness decreases gradually from the Tibetan Plateau proper to
   the Sichuan basin and Yangtze platform but that significant
   (intra-)crustal heterogeneity exists on shorter lateral scales (<1000
   km). Most receiver functions reveal a time shift of similar to 0.2s in
   the direct P arrival and negative phases between 0 and 5 s after the
   first arrival. Inversion of the receiver functions yields S-velocity
   profiles marked by near-surface and intra-crustal low-velocity zones
   (IC-LVZs). The shallow low-velocity zones are consistent with the wide
   distribution of thick surface sedimentary layers. The IC-LVZ varies
   laterally in depth and strength; it becomes thinner toward the east and
   southeast and is absent in the Sichuan basin and the southern part of
   the Yangtze platform. Results from slant-stacking analysis show a
   concomitant decrease in crust thickness from similar to 60 km in the
   Songpan-Ganze fold system to similar to 46 km in the Sichuan basin and
   similar to 40 km in the Yangtze platform. High Poisson's ratios (>0.30)
   are detected beneath the southeastern margin of Tibet but in the Sichuan
   basin and southeastern Yangtze platform the values are close to the
   global average. Combined with high regional heat flow and independent
   evidence for mid-crustal layers of high (electric) conductivity, the
   large intra-crustal S-wave velocity reduction (12-19\%) and the
   intermediate-to-high average crustal Poisson's ratios are consistent
   with partial melt in the crust beneath parts of southeastern Tibet.
   These results could be used in support of deformation models involving
   intra-crustal flow, with the caveat that significant lateral variation
   in location and strength of this flow may occur. Published by Elsevier
   B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Although some studies suggest that conformity with consensus
   recommendations for breast cancer therapy is associated with increased
   survival, the data are not clear. We identified patients in four
   hospital-based breast cancer registries in Korea who had undergone
   primary curative surgery (stage 0-III) from 1993 through 2002 (n =
   8,407). We collected demographic and clinical characteristics such as
   age, stage, treatment, and hormone receptor status. We gathered
   1993-2004 mortality data by linkage to the National Statistical Office.
   During the follow-up period of 43,145 person-years (mean, 5.13 years),
   we identified 899 deceased cases. We used the standard Poisson
   regression model to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) for survival in
   relation to conformity with guidelines for chemo-, hormone, and
   locoregional therapy. Guideline compliance for systemic therapy
   increased from 24.0\% in 1993 to 83.8\% in 2002. Among mastectomy
   patients with < 4 positive lymph nodes and tumors < 5 cm,
   post-mastectomy radiotherapy was associated with poor survival (HR 2.07;
   95\% CI: 1.53-2.81). Tamoxifen use was associated with better survival
   among patients with hormone receptor-positive tumors (HR 0.57; 95\% CI:
   0.45-0.73) and with poorer survival among hormone receptor-negative
   patients who had affected nodes (HR 1.58; 95\% CI: 1.01-2.44). Relative
   to conformity, non-conformity with both chemo- and hormone therapy
   guidelines was associated with a 76\% higher risk of death. Compliance
   with consensus recommendations for chemo- and hormone therapy is
   significantly associated with better survival. Overuse of
   post-mastectomy radiotherapy and tamoxifen beyond the consensus
   recommendations may be harmful.}},

Volume = {{83}},
Number = {{7}},

Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: To assess HIV prevalence and risk factors for HIV infection,
   to investigate condom use among registered female commercial sex workers
   (CSWs) in Senegal, West Africa, and to examine the association between
   previous HIV testing, knowledge of HIV serostatus and condom use with
   both regular sex partners and clients within this population.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted at three sexually
   transmitted disease clinics among 1052 Senegalese registered CSWs
   between 2000 and 2004. Inperson interviews soliciting information
   concerning demographic characteristics, medical history, sexual
   behaviour with clients and regular partners, and previous HIV testing
   history were performed. Blood samples were collected for determination
   of HIV-1 and/ or HIV-2 serostatus. Multivariable, Poisson and
   log-binomial models were used to calculate prevalence ratios.
   Results: The overall HIV prevalence was 19.8\%. Over 95\% of CSWs
   reported always using a condom with clients, but only 18\% reported
   always using a condom with their regular partners. A history of previous
   HIV testing was not associated with condom use with clients (adjusted
   prevalence ratio (APR) = 0.98, 95\% confidence intervals, CI: 0.90 to
   1.06). However, prior HIV testing was associated with decreased condom
   use with their regular partners (APR = 0.44, 95\% CI: 0.28 to 0.69),
   especially in women who tested HIV negative (APR = 0.17, 95\% CI: 0.08
   to 0.36).
   Conclusions: CSWs in Senegal have a high HIV prevalence; therefore
   preventing HIV transmission from this population to the general
   population is important. Condom use with regular partners is low among
   registered CSWs in Senegal, and a prior HIV negative test is associated
   with even less condom use with regular partners. Intervention efforts to
   increase condom use with regular sexual partners are needed.}},

Abstract = {{In this article we investigate aspects of turgor- driven plant cell
   growth within the framework of a model derived from the Eulerian concept
   of instability. In particular we explore the relationship between cell
   geometry and cell turgor pressure by extending loss of stability theory
   to encompass cylindrical cells. Beginning with an analysis of the three-
   dimensional stress and strain of a cylindrical pressure vessel, we
   demonstrate that loss of stability is the inevitable result of gradually
   increasing internal pressure in a cylindrical cell. The turgor pressure
   predictions based on this model differ from the more traditional
   viscoelastic or creep- based models in that they incorporate both cell
   geometry and wall mechanical properties in a single term. To confirm our
   predicted working turgor pressures, we obtained wall dimensions, elastic
   moduli, and turgor pressures of sequential internodal cells of intact
   Chara corallina plants by direct measurement. The results show that
   turgor pressure predictions based on loss of stability theory fall
   within the expected physiological range of turgor pressures for this
   plant. We also studied the effect of varying wall Poisson's ratio v on
   extension growth in living cells, showing that while increasing elastic
   modulus has an understandably negative effect on wall expansion,
   increasing Poisson's ratio would be expected to accelerate wall
   expansion.}},

Abstract = {{Superhard titanium diboride (TiB2) coatings (H-v > 40 GPa) were
   deposited in Ar atmosphere from stoichiometric TiB2 target using an
   unbalanced direct current (d. c.) magnetron. Polished Si (001),
   stainless steel, high-speed steel (HSS) and tungsten carbide (WC)
   substrates were used for deposition. The influence of negative substrate
   bias, U-s, and substrate temperature, T-s, on mechanical properties of
   TiB2 coatings was studied. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis showed
   hexagonal TiB2 structure with (0 0 0 1) preferred orientation. The
   texture of TiB2 coatings was dependent upon the ion bombardment (U-s
   increased from 0 to -300V) and the substrate heating (T-s increased from
   room temperature (RT) to 700 degrees C). All TiB2 coatings were measured
   using microhardness tester Fischerscope H100 equipped with Vickers and
   Berkovich diamond indenters and exhibited high values of hardness H-v up
   to 34GPa, effective Young's modulus E{*} = E/(1-v) ranging from 450 to
   600 GPa; here E and v are the Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio,
   respectively, and elastic recovery W-e approximate to 80\%. TiB2 coating
   with a maximum hardness H-v approximate to 73 GPa and E{*} approximate
   to 580 GPa was sputtered at U-s = -200 V and T-s = RT. Macrostresses of
   coatings a were measured by an optical wafer curvature technique and
   evaluated by Stoney equation. All TiB2 coatings exhibited compressive
   macrostresses. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A two-dimensional model involving rotation and distortion of
   corner-linked parallelogram units is presented and investigated as a
   means of producing negative Poisson's ratios. It is then shown how the
   model can represent the behaviour of certain zeolite materials: by
   introducing structural parameters from the crystal structures of five
   zeolites with the NAT-type structure, it is shown that the model
   replicates their elastic behaviour well and depends on a balance between
   the rotation of the parallelogram units and their distortion (by change
   of edge lengths and internal angle), which is dictated by the direction
   of applied stress. In the case of one of the materials, natrolite, the
   predicted values of Poisson's ratios agree well with those derived from
   experiment, and it is suggested that the model might be used to search
   for negative Poisson's ratios in other inorganic structures. (C) 2007

Abstract = {{Poisson's ratio is defined as the negative of the ratio of the
   transverse strain to the longitudinal strain in response to a
   longitudinal uniaxial stress. In the presence of anisotropy, this means
   that the ratio depends on two directions. With a view to assessing
   crystals that exhibit directions for which the ratio is negative, we
   resort to a transverse average to eliminate one directional variable and
   at the same time to arrive at a measure that poses a challenge to
   achieving significant negative values. The areal Poisson ratio coincides
   with the Poisson ratio for an isotropic material. We determine the
   stationary directions of the areal Poisson ratio for all crystal
   symmetry classes. The directions represented by invariant stationary
   points-those that hold independently of the material-we identify and
   explain class-by-class in terms of the axes of symmetry for the class.
   It is shown that for cubic crystals, positive definiteness of the strain
   energy requires that the areal Poisson ratio lie between -1 and 1/2, as
   it does for isotropy. We conclude that the areal Poisson ratio for the
   classes of lower symmetry are not restricted.}},

Volume = {{12}},

Abstract = {{An incremental (or tangent) bulk modulus for finite isotropic elasticity
   is defined which compares an increment in hydrostatic pressure with the
   corresponding increment in relative volume. Its positivity provides a
   stringent criterion for physically reasonable response involving the
   second derivatives of the strain energy function. Also, an average (or
   secant) bulk modulus is defined by comparing the current stress with the
   relative volume change. The positivity of this bulk modulus provides a
   physically reasonable response criterion less stringent than the former.
   The concept of incremental bulk modulus is extended to anisotropic
   elasticity. For states of uniaxial tension an incremental Poisson's
   ratio and an incremental Young's modulus are similarly defined for
   nonlinear isotropic elasticity and have properties similar to those of
   the incremental bulk modulus. The incremental Poisson's ratios for the
   isotropic constraints of incompressibility, Bell, Ericksen, and constant
   area are considered. The incremental moduli are all evaluated for a
   specific example of the compressible neo-Hookean solid. Bounds on the
   ground state Lame elastic moduli, assumed positive, are given which are
   sufficient to guarantee the positivity of the incremental bulk and
   Young's moduli for all strains. However, although the ground state
   Poisson's ratio is positive we find that the incremental Poisson's ratio
   becomes negative for large enough axial extensions.}},

Abstract = {{The modes of vibrations of conventional and auxetic honeycomb structures
   are studied by means of models where lattices are represented by planar
   networks, in which rodlike particles are linked by strings. In these
   structures, the translational and rotational degrees of freedom are
   strongly coupled. The auxetic network is obtained by modifying a model
   proposed by Evans in 1991 {[}Nature (London) 353, 124 (1991)], and is
   used to explain the negative Poisson's ratio of auxetic materials.
   Auxetics are materials with a negative Poisson elastic parameter,
   meaning that they have a lateral extension, instead of shrinking, when
   they are stretched. The phonon dispersions obtained in the case of the
   auxetic model are compared with those of a conventional honeycomb
   network, where rigid rodlike particles are inserted. The behavior of the
   rotational dispersions can explain some experimental observations on the

Abstract = {{Elastic properties of metal nanowires in a transverse electric field
   have been investigated using molecular dynamics simulations and
   classical electrostatics theory. The negative pressure on the surfaces
   stemming from the transverse electric field modifies the Young's modulus
   and Poisson's ratio of nanowires significantly. The simulation results
   reveal the decrease in Young's modulus and the increase in Poisson's
   ratio as a result of the negative pressure. With the increase of the
   applied voltage and decreasing the distance between the nanowire and the
   ground plane, the electromechanical coupling effect on elastic
   properties of nanowires becomes more remarkable. The relative change of
   elastic properties is also strongly dependent on the diameter of
   nanowires. The present results are useful in the design of

   A second type of rotating geometry, whose Poisson's ratio shifts from

Abstract = {{A high-fidelity generalized method of cells (HFGMC) model for the
   micromechanical behavior of porous and composite microstructures has
   been previously developed. Based on this model, a newapproach has been
   developed to optimize porous microstructures for `porous materials by
   design'. This approach uses a combination of genetic algorithms (GA)
   (stochastic), coarse ( periodic) and Newton-Raphson ( gradient)
   optimization methods. In order to parametrize the unit cell of the
   microstructure for optimization and satisfy continuity conditions for
   the method of cells, lines of mass are used in each direction of the
   unit cell. Due to the nature of the optimization problem for porous
   microstructures, there can be multiple choices of mechanical and
   microstructural characteristics ( e. g. axial stress, transverse strain,
   and mass) for the objective function (i.e. multi-objective) implying a
   Pareto optimality problem. For the porous materials by design problem
   based on mechanical characteristics, a predescribed mechanical response
   was chosen for a random distribution of mass to fit via a least squares
   objective function. The effects of implementing the combination of
   optimization methods on their convergence rate and optimized solutions
   were then studied, as well as variations in the weighting of the
   objective functions. A hyperelastic material behavior, Mooney-Rivlin,
   typically associated with natural and synthetic rubbers, is chosen to
   demonstrate the ability to optimize an engineered microstructure for a
   new class of super-lightweight energy-absorbing materials. These results
   indicate that the combination of the GA, coarse search and
   Newton-Raphson optimization techniques can substantially accelerate the
   convergence rate. Also, there is significant variability in the
   optimized microstructure depending on the choice of the weights for the
   associated Pareto optimality, as well as the choice of terms for the
   objective function. Parametrizing the porous microstructure using
   multiple lines of mass can create a more complex microstructure, but
   commoncenters of mass should be employed to minimize mass while
   improving convergence rates and optimal constitutive behavior. This new
   approach was applied to identify microstructures for three new porous
   materials by design: ( a) a superelastic polymer, (b) an incompressible
   material and ( c) an auxetic material.}},

Abstract = {{A nearly 160-km long Wollaston Lake Reflector (WLR) observed in seismic
   reflection profile S2b of the 1994 Lithoprobe Trans-Hudson Orogen
   transect (THOT) in northern Saskatchewan (Canada) is among the most
   spectacular and well-recorded features imaged within the crystalline
   crust. Based on modeling of its normal-incidence reflectivity, the
   observed bright spot reflector was originally interpreted as a series of
   tabular diabase intrusions. In order to further elucidate its structure,
   we reprocessed line S2b and analysed the WLR for the Amplitude
   Variations with Offset (AVO). By contrast to conventional (approximate)
   AVO analysis, we used the exact Zoeppritz equations and considered a
   thin-layer (mixed positive and negative polarities) reflectivity. The
   results suggest two possible interpretations of the WLR: 1) the
   reflector caused by a massive mafic intrusion as suggested earlier, in
   which case the intruded rocks should have anomalous Poisson's ratios of
   sigma >= 0.33, and 2) the VvLR represents a silicified shear zone, with
   only moderate (e.g., similar to 5-10\%) alteration of the host rock and
   (sigma approximate to 0.2. Although both of these models may to some
   extent co-exist within the WLR, its brightness, sharpness, great lateral
   extent and smooth shape favour the second interpretation. In both
   models, a fractured fluid-filled zone within a major crustal detachment
   should have played a key role in the formation of the WLR. The
   association of the reflector with laterally-and depth-migrating fluids
   is also supported by magneto-tellulic measurements of crustal
   conductivity beneath the WLR. Analogies from the studies of the Kola
   Superdeep Borehole (Russia), where free or metamorphic fluids were found
   at comparable depths, also suggest that fluids may contribute to WLR
   structure and formation. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Testing approaches for overdispersion in Poisson regression versus the
   generalized Poisson model}},
Journal = {{BIOMETRICAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{565-584}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Overdispersion is a common phenomenon in Poisson modeling, and the
   negative binomial (NB) model is frequently used to account for
   overdispersion. Testing approaches (Wald test, likelihood ratio test
   (LRT), and score test) for overdispersion in the Poisson regression
   versus the NB model are available. Because the generalized Poisson (GP)
   model is similar to the NB model, we consider the former as an alternate
   model for overdispersed count data. The score test has an advantage over
   the LRT and the Wald test in that the score test only requires that the
   parameter of interest be estimated under the null hypothesis. This paper
   proposes a score test for overdispersion based on the GP model and
   compares the power of the test with the LRT and Wald tests. A simulation
   study indicates the score test based on asymptotic standard Normal
   distribution is more appropriate in practical application for higher
   empirical power, however, it underestimates the nominal significance
   level, especially in small sample situations, and examples illustrate
   the results of comparing the candidate tests between the Poisson and GP
   models. A bootstrap test is also proposed to adjust the underestimation
   of nominal level in the score statistic when the sample size is small.
   The simulation study indicates the bootstrap test has significance level
   closer to nominal size and has uniformly greater power than the score
   test based on asymptotic standard Normal distribution. From a practical
   perspective, we suggest that, if the score test gives even a weak
   indication that the Poisson model is inappropriate, say at the 0.10
   significance level, we advise the more accurate bootstrap procedure as a
   better test for comparing whether the GP model is more appropriate than
   Poisson model. Finally, the Vuong test is illustrated to choose between
   GP and NB2 models for the same dataset.}},

Abstract = {{The interaction between glucose oxidase (GOx) and phospholipid
   monolayers is studied at the 1, 2-dichloroethane/water interface by
   electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Electrochemical experiments show
   that the presence of GOx induces changes in the capacitance curves at
   both negative and positive potentials, which are successfully explained
   by a theoretical model based on the solution of the Poisson-Boltzmann
   equation. These changes ore ascribed to a reduced partition coefficient
   of GOx and on increase of the permittivity of the lipid hydrocarbon
   domain. Our results show that the presence of lipid molecules enhances
   the adsorption of GOx molecules at the liquid/liquid interface. At low
   lipid concentrations, the adsorption of GOx is probably the first step
   preceding its penetration into the lipid monolayer. The experimental
   results indicate that GOx penetrates better and forms more stable
   monolayers for lipids with longer hydrophobic toils. At high GOx
   concentrations, the formation of multilayers is observed. The phenomenon
   described here is strongly dependent on 1) the GOx and lipid
   concentrations, 2) the nature of the lipid, and 3) the potential drop
   across the interface.}},

Title = {{A crash-prediction model for multilane roads}},
Journal = {{ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{657-670}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Considerable research has been carried out in recent years to establish
   relationships between crashes and traffic flow, geometric infrastructure
   characteristics and environmental factors for two-lane rural roads.
   Crash-prediction models focused on multilane rural roads, however, have
   rarely been investigated. In addition, most research has paid but little
   attention to the safety effects of variables such as stopping sight
   distance and pavement surface characteristics. Moreover, the statistical
   approaches have generally included Poisson and Negative Binomial
   regression models, whilst Negative Multinomial regression model has been
   used to a lesser extent. Finally, as far as the authors are aware,
   prediction models involving all the above-mentioned factors have still
   not been developed in Italy for multilane roads, such as motorways.
   Thus, in this paper crash-prediction models for a four-lane
   median-divided Italian motorway were set up on the basis of accident
   data observed during a 5-year monitoring period extending between 1999
   and 2003. The Poisson, Negative Binomial and Negative Multinomial
   regression models, applied separately to tangents and curves, were used
   to model the frequency of accident occurrence. Model parameters were
   estimated by the Maximum Likelihood Method, and the Generalized
   Likelihood Ratio Test was applied to detect the significant variables to
   be included in the model equation. Goodness-of-fit was measured by means
   of both the explained fraction of total variation and the explained
   fraction of systematic variation. The Cumulative Residuals Method was
   also used to test the adequacy of a regression model throughout the
   range of each variable. The candidate set of explanatory variables was:
   length (L). curvature (1/R), annual average daily traffic (AADT), sight
   distance (SD), side friction coefficient (SFC), longitudinal slope (LS)
   and the presence of a junction (J). Separate prediction models for total
   crashes and for fatal and injury crashes only were considered. For
   curves it is shown that significant variables are L, 1/R and AADT,
   whereas for tangents they are L, AADT and junctions. The effect of rain
   precipitation was analysed on the basis of hourly rainfall data and
   assumptions about drying time. It is shown that a wet pavement
   significantly increases the number of crashes.
   The models developed in this paper for Italian motorways appear to be
   useful for many applications such as the detection of critical factors,
   the estimation of accident reduction due to infrastructure and pavement
   improvement, and the predictions of accidents counts when comparing
   different design options. Thus this research may represent a point of
   reference for engineers in adjusting or designing multilane roads. (c)

Abstract = {{This study was based on the discrete fracture model to investigate the

   cases, the centers of fractures, fracture lengths and apertures were

   distribution and lognormal distribution, respectively. With the above
   assumptions, constructing the discrete fracture model became
   practicable. Using the mass-balance equation with specified boundary
   conditions, the flow field in the rock was solved. Then particles were
   released under the flow field. Monte Carlo method was used assuming that
   the amount of particles was proportional to the flow rates to get the
   particle accumulated percentage breakthrough curve and to estimate the
   dispersion coefficient. On the basis of the discrete fracture model, it
   was possible to evaluate the property of dispersion behavior of andesite
   in Lan-Yu Island with flow and transport mechanism. Properties of the
   dispersion behavior such as the relation between distance and
   traveling-time (ln < r(2)> and ln < t >), anisotropic behavior, and the
   overall dispersion coefficient in a fracture network were characterized:
   the slope value of ln < r(2)> and ln < t > was 1.64 an indication of
   non-Fickian dispersion, the particles dispersion along the flow (D11)
   was bigger than that perpendicular to the flow (D22), and the dispersion
   coefficient by this study was 0.91 m comparing the value 1 m from
   Sauty's method.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we described the characteristics of negative group
   velocities of Lamb-type waves in a glass/water/glass structure
   controlled by the thickness of the water layer. Lamb waves in an elastic
   plate have negative group velocities. It is known that the range of
   existence of negative group velocities depends on the Poisson's ratio of
   the elastic plate. However, in the case of Lamb waves, their negative
   group velocities depend on the physical parameters of each material;
   therefore, we fabricated a structure such that the negative group
   velocities of Lamb waves are controllable without the limitation of the
   parameters of each material. The waves in such a structure are referred
   to as the Lamb-type waves. Using numerical calculations, we determined
   that the negative group velocities of the Lamb-type waves can be varied
   by changing the geometric parameters, and the negative group velocities
   are changed although the frequencies are fixed. Additionally, we found
   that the Lamb-type waves have various characteristics corresponding to
   the propagation modes.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this investigation was to adopt an analytical approach to
   analyse stresses at the restoration-dentine interface caused by
   polymerization shrinkage, occlusal and thermal loading with the primary
   focus on evaluating the effect of the material properties of the
   composite restoration on the strength of the interface. Some essential
   simplifications were employed to derive an explicit analytical solution.
   The results confirm previous findings that interfacial stresses due to
   polymerization shrinkage are increased with the higher modulus of
   elasticity of the restoration, while Poisson's ratio of the restorative
   material has a very small influence on these stresses. Occlusal loading
   resulted in much lower interfacial stresses when compared to shrinkage
   and thermal loads. The obtained results were in a good agreement with
   other numerical and clinical studies. From the modelling analysis it was
   found that the majority of commercially available composite restorative
   materials are expected to create significant interfacial stresses when
   subjected to cold temperatures. In addition, it was shown that there is
   a considerable potential for interfacial stresses to be minimised by an
   appropriate selection of thermo-mechanical properties of the restorative
   material especially with the new finding on the negative temperature
   variation effect. (c) 2006 IPEM. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Assume that the surplus of an insurer follows a compound Poisson surplus
   process. When the surplus is below zero or the insurer is on deficit,
   the insurer could borrow money at a debit interest rate to pay claims.
   Meanwhile, the insurer will repay the debts from her premium income. The
   negative surplus may return to a positive level. However, when the
   negative surplus is below a certain critical level, the surplus is no
   longer able to be positive. Absolute ruin occurs at this moment. In this
   paper, we study absolute ruin questions by defining an expected
   discounted penalty function at absolute ruin. The function includes the
   absolute ruin probability, the Laplace transform of the time to absolute
   ruin, the deficit at absolute ruin, the surplus just before absolute
   ruin, and many other quantities related to absolute ruin. First, we
   derive a system of integro-differential equations satisfied by the
   function and obtain a defective renewal equation that links the
   integro-differential equations in the system. Second, we show that when
   the initial surplus goes to infinity, the absolute ruin probability and
   the classical ruin probability are asymptotically equal for heavy-tailed
   claims while the ratio of the absolute ruin probability to the classical
   ruin probability goes to a positive constant that is less than one for
   light-tailed claims. Finally, we give explicit expressions for the
   function for exponential claims.}},

Abstract = {{Simulations of the atomic structure and elastic constants of five
   zeolites with the NAT-type structure, namely, natrolite, mesolite,
   scolecite, metanatrolite, and ammonium-exchanged natrolite, using the
   CVFF force field implemented within Cerius(2), are presented. The
   validity of the simulation method is shown by the excellent agreement
   between simulated and experimental crystal data, including location of
   extraframework ions and water molecules, and for natrolite, the only
   zeolite studied here for which experimental studies of elasticity have
   been reported, the good agreement between the simulated and experimental
   elastic constants. For all materials, an off-axis analysis of the
   elastic constants reveals that the Poisson's ratios nu(xy) and nu(yx)
   become negative when stress is applied at 45 degrees to the
   crystallographic axes. Further simulations of the elastic behavior of
   the materials under stress, using the molecular dynamics method of
   Parrinello and Rahman, reveal that the elastic behavior may be described
   by a ``modified rotating squares{''} model. Here three-dimensional
   structural distortions are reduced to a two-dimensional model where
   square cross-section units of structure both rotate about their hinges
   and undergo change of dimension: the balance of these competing
   processes dictates the resulting Poisson's ratio and is highly dependent
   upon the direction along which stress is applied. We discuss the effect
   that various concentrations of extraframework cations and water have on
   the elastic properties of the NAT-type zeolites.}},

Abstract = {{This work presents a comparative analysis between the cyclic loading
   compressive behaviour of conventional, iso-density non-auxetic and
   auxetic (negative Poisson's ratio) thermoplastic polyurethane foams.
   While the three types of foam share the same base material (open cell
   rigid PU), one batch is transformed into auxetic, (i.e., negative
   Poisson's ratio) using a special manufacturing process involving
   moulding and exposure to particular temperature profiles to stabilize
   the microstructure transformation. The specimens have been loaded in
   cyclic compression with a sinusoidal waveform in displacement control.
   The static tests show the specific stress-strain compressive mechanical
   behaviour of these auxetic thermoplastic foams, opposite to conventional
   ones and other similar data on auxetics available in open literature.
   The effect of the load loss, stiffness degradation, the evolution of
   dynamic rigidity and accumulation of energy dissipation versus the
   number of cycles are discussed for different loading levels. The
   analysis of the results shows that the fatigue behaviour until failure
   occurs in two stages, subjected to cyclic loading, depends on the
   loading level. The hysteresis loop tends to close itself as function as
   the number of cycles N, while the slope of the dynamic stiffness
   decreases with increasing N, therefore with decrease of dissipated
   energy. The energy dissipated by the auxetic foams is significantly
   higher than the one from conventional parent phase and the iso-density
   foams at every number of cycles and loading level. (c) 2006 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The influence of potential softness on the elastic properties of soft
   disks, interacting through n-inverse-power potentials, r(n), has been
   investigated in a Monte Carlo simulation. Two mechanisms influencing
   Poisson's ratio have been revealed: (i) particle motions decrease the
   ratio at high densities with respect to the static (zero temperature)
   case and (h) the ratio can be also decreased at fixed temperatures and
   pressures by increasing n. Simulations have shown that the hard disk's
   elastic constants can be obtained in the limit n ->infinity. When T ->
   0, the elastic constants of soft disks tend to those of the static
   model.}},

Abstract = {{A ferrogel model based on a polymer network with single-domain magnetic
   particles is constructed. The non-magnetic matrix is represented by a
   two-dimensional bead-spring model where beads interacting via
   Lennard-Jones potential are connected by harmonic springs. It is assumed
   that in each polymer chain of beads some bonds include magnetic grains.
   In the considered model, a conformation of polymer chains is analyzed in
   terms of bead positions and magnetic grains are introduced into the
   model via magnetic torque acting on the bond connecting neighboring
   beads. The magnetic torque is absent if the external magnetic field is
   set to zero. We examine the case when the polymer matrix under
   consideration exhibits unusual auxetic behavior, i.e., it expands under
   a stretching force applied to the ends of the chain. The analysis of the
   ferrogel model presented in this paper is a result of molecular
   simulations in which the motion of grain magnetization is described by
   the Landau-Lifshits-Gilbert equation.}},

Abstract = {{This study describes hospitalized injuries among workers in British
   Columbia lumber industry. Between April 1989 and December 1997, from the
   hospital records of 5,745 male sawmill workers were analyzed for the
   present study. Work relatedness was determined using either ICD-9
   external cause of injury codes, which have a digit-indicating place of
   occurrence, or a payment field, which can identify workers compensation
   agency. Poisson regression models were used to analyze differences in
   hospitalization rates across race, job category, age group, and calendar
   year. The crude and adjusted rate ratios were calculated along with the
   95\% confidence intervals (CIs). During the follow-up period, there were
   164 work related hospitalization resulting in a rate for work-related
   hospitalization of 5.38 per 1,000 person years. The higher rates by
   nature of injury were for dislocation, sprains \& strains, open wounds,
   and fracture of upper limbs. During the study period, the higher rates
   of injury by causes were machinery related, falls, and struck against.
   In the multivariate models, there were no statistically significant
   relationship of injury risk with age and race. In respect to occupation,
   compared to foremen/supervisor, other sawmills' workers did not have
   significantly elevated risk of injury. The trend analyses found a
   significant negative trend (P = 0.004) of injury risk over the whole
   study period. Knowing the causes and nature of injury and their related
   risk factors are helpful to employers, compensation officials, and other
   stakeholders to target preventive measures.}},

Abstract = {{The zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) regression model with
   smoothing is introduced for modeling count data with many zero-valued
   observations, and its use is illustrated with shark bycatch data from
   the eastern Pacific Ocean tuna purse-seine fishery for 1994-2004. Based
   on the generalized information criterion, the ZINB regression model
   provided a better fit to the data than either Poisson, negative binomial
   or zero-inflated Poisson regression models. To demonstrate the utility
   of the ZINB regression model for the standardization of catch data,
   standardized temporal trends in bycatch rates estimated with the ZINB
   regression model are computed and compared to those obtained from fits
   of the other three types of models to the same data. With the exception
   of the negative binomial, estimated temporal trends were more similar
   among models than would have been inferred from an analysis of model
   fit. Comparison of trends among models suggests that the negative
   binomial regression model may overestimate model coefficients when
   fitted to data with many zero-valued observations. (c) 2006 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Recurrent events in clinical trials have typically been analysed using
   either a multiple time-to-event method or a direct approach based on the
   distribution of the number of events. An area of application for these
   methods is exacerbation data from respiratory clinical trials. The
   different approaches to the analysis and the issues involved are
   illustrated for a large trial (n = 1465) in chronic obstructive
   pulmonary disease (COPD). For exacerbation rates, clinical interest
   centres on a direct comparison of rates for each treatment which favours
   the distribution-based analysis, rather than a time-to-event approach.
   Poisson regression has often been employed and has recently been
   recommended as the appropriate method of analysis for COPD exacerbations
   but the key assumptions often appear unreasonable for this analysis. By
   contrast use of a negative binomial model which corresponds to assuming
   a separate Poisson parameter for each subject offers a more appealing
   approach. Nonparametric methods avoid some of the assumptions required
   by these models, but do not provide appropriate estimates of treatment
   effects because of the discrete and bounded nature of the data.

Abstract = {{We investigate the formation and dynamics of ion thermal double layers

   fraction of stationary charged (positive or negative) dust impurities.
   By using the hydrodynamic and Poisson equations for the two ion species,
   a modified Korteweg-de Vries equation (mKdV) has been derived. The mKdV
   equation admits double layer solution. It is found that ITDLs profile is
   significantly affected by the presence of positively/negatively charged
   dust impurities. Also, the temperature ratio between the
   negative-to-positive ions plays an important role in deciding the
   polarity of the ITDLs. In the dust free case, the system supports only
   rarefactive double layers for any possible values of the temperature
   ratio. This investigation can be useful for future research on pair-ion

Abstract = {{Macroscopic elastic properties of sintered, randomly packed balloons are

   those of thinner balloons are very sensitive to the ratio. The elastic
   moduli rapidly decline with decreasing wall thickness. They are larger
   in the direction of gravity than in the horizontal one, corresponding to
   gravity-affected packing structures. Specific elastic moduli have a peak
   against porosity. Poisson's ratios are negative in some cases of very
   thin balloon walls and very low sintering degree. Comparison of the
   present random packing with the regular simple cubic packing reveals
   that there is a significant difference between them in their elastic

Abstract = {{An auxetic foam structure is described which has the property of
   widening when stretched (negative Poisson's ratio behaviour), in
   contrast to the situation with most materials which narrow when
   stretched. The fabrication of this material involves a combination of
   heat and compressive treatments of a conventional commercial
   air-filtration foam. The resulting microstructure is examined by
   scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The pertinent mechanical properties
   are described in terms of the changes in specimen dimensions and
   associated strains. From these quantities, Poisson's ratios are
   determined for the large strain regime involved. The property of being
   able to open pores by stretching the material is a useful feature in
   various types of filtration application. In particular, where the
   long-term efficiency of the process is hindered by ingress of particles
   into the system which block the active pore structure, the marriage of
   permeability and mechanical deformation via a negative Poisson's ratio
   offers an alternative to other methods of clearance. This notion is
   illustrated by the use of some very simple tests in which the foam is
   challenged by glass beads of uniform diameter. Simple air pressure-drop
   tests are also performed on auxetic and conventional foams to
   demonstrate that the change in permeability due to mechanical
   deformation enables a means of varying the pressure-drop acting across
   an auxetic foam to a far greater degree than is possible for the
   conventional foams. (C) 2007 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA,

Abstract = {{Microstructural formation in auxetic microporous UHMWPE has been studied
   in detail using extensive mapping of the microstructure during its
   processing. To ease sectioning for microstructural examination, a
   sintering and extrusion route was used. The fibrillar microstructure was
   found to occur in both the radial and longitudinal directions. Fibril
   generation was also seen to occur prior to extrusion with enough fibrils
   of sufficient size to lead to auxetic behaviour. A mechanism for fibril
   generation is proposed which is based on surface melting of the
   particles and drawing out of the interparticle contact points by
   particle movement, which is not necessarily the result of extrusion
   through a die. These findings will aid in the understanding of
   processing of auxetic microporous polymers and in the drive to extending
   the range available to include other polymeric materials and different

Abstract = {{We have presented some practical consequences on the molecular-dynamics
   simulations arising from the numerical algorithm published recently in
   paper {[}1]. The algorithm is not a finite-difference method and
   therefore it could be complementary to the traditional numerical
   integrating of the motion equations. It consists of two steps. First, an
   analytic form of polynomials in some formal parameter lambda (we put
   lambda = 1 after all) is derived, which approximate the solution of the
   system of differential equations under consideration. Next, the
   numerical values of the derived polynomials in the interval, in which
   the difference between them and their truncated part of smaller degree
   does not exceed a given accuracy epsilon, become the numerical solution.
   The particular examples, which we have considered, represent the forced
   linear and nonlinear oscillator and the 2D Lennard-Jones fluid. In the
   latter case we have restricted to the polynomials of the first degree in
   formal parameter lambda.
   The computer simulations play very important role in modeling materials
   with unusual properties being contradictictory to our intuition. The
   particular example could be the auxetic materials. In this case, the
   accuracy of the applied numerical algorithms as well as various
   side-effects, which might change the physical reality, could become
   important for the properties of the simulated material. (C) 2007

Abstract = {{Temperature dependence of the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) spectra of
   magnetic nanoparticles or agglomerates of gamma-Fe2O3 in nonmagnetic
   matrixes has been studied. Samples with two types of magnetic
   nanofillers have been studied: a solid powder and a suspension. Magnetic
   anisotropy present in the samples allowed analysis of the observed FMR
   spectrum in terms of two lines arising from the perpendicular (the more
   intense) and parallel (the weaker) components of the resulting dipolar
   field. It was observed that the temperature changes of the resonance
   lines have been effected by the presence of critical phenomena in
   polymer matrix, especially the freezing processes connected with the
   arrested movements of certain matrix fragments. A simple model has been
   put forward to explain partially the shift of the resonance field with
   the temperature change. It is proposed that an essential part (50\%) of
   the temperature shift of the position of FMR resonance could be caused
   by change of an effective magnetic moment due to thermal expansion of
   the matrix. Application of low concentration of magnetic nanoparticles
   in the polymeric systems, especially possessing extraordinary physical
   properties, would allow studying them by the FMR method. This might be
   very helpful for understanding of the critical or exotic phenomena

Abstract = {{Auxetics (i.e. systems with negative Poisson's ratios) exhibit the
   unexpected feature of becoming fatter when stretched and narrower when
   compressed. This property is highly desirable as it imparts many
   beneficial effects on the material's macroscopic properties. Recent
   research suggests that in an idealised scenario, systems composed of
   connected `rigid squares' can. exhibit auxetic behaviour (Poisson's
   ratio = - 1) due to a mechanism involving relative rotation of the
   squares. This paper shows through force-field based molecular modelling
   simulations that although `rotating squares' are responsible for
   negative Poisson's ratios in various zeolite frameworks, in these real
   materials, the squares are not rigid and the auxeticity is not as
   pronounced as in the `idealised' model. In view of this, a new model
   system made from connected,semi-rigid' squares is proposed and
   analytical equations for the mechanical properties of this new model
   system are derived and discussed. It will be shown that the Poisson's
   ratios in this new model are highly dependent on the extent of rigidity
   of the squares and the direction of loading. It will also be shown that
   this new model provides a better description for the behaviour of
   auxetic zeolite frameworks than the original `rotating rigid squares'
   model. (C) 2007 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA, Weinheim.}},

Abstract = {{The structural and elastic changes with volume expansion in alpha-quartz
   and alpha-cristobalite, the typical polymorphs of silicon dioxide
   (SiO2), have been studied through first-principles calculations using
   the projector-augmented-wave (PAW) method, with particular emphasis on
   their negative Poisson's ratio behavior under negative pressure. The
   dominant mechanism of expansion is the increase of the Si-O-Si angles
   within their crystalline structures, whereas the SiO4 tetrahedron
   undergoes only a slight distortion. We provide theoretical ab initio
   results for a complete set of independent elastic constants of quartz
   and cristobalite with volume expansion. The present simulations confirm
   that the negative Poisson's ratio behavior is enhanced in the expansive
   phases of both polyrnorphs under negative pressures, with retaining
   strong elastic anisotropy. (C) 2007 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA,

Abstract = {{Studies on the mechanical behavior of materials are often performed on
   the assumption of positive Poisson's ratio except for auxetic materials.
   Auxetic materials and structures are intriguing systems that exhibit
   negative Poisson's ratio. Recently some investigation were made on
   semi-auxetic materials in terms of their directional and positional
   auxeticity. In this paper we furnish a simple example of a 3-ply
   laminate consisting of isotropic plies whereby the sign of its effective
   Poisson's ratio changes when the loading mode changes between pure axial
   loading and pure bending. In addition, both positive and negative
   Poisson ratio behaviors do not cancel one another, but are
   simultaneously manifested when the above-mentioned loading modes are
   combined. (C) 2007 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA, Weinheim.}},

Abstract = {{Magnetic flux can penetrate a type-II superconductor in the form of
   Abrikosov vortices (also called flux lines, flux tubes, or fluxons),
   each carrying a quantum of magnetic flux. These tiny vortices of
   supercurrent tend to arrange themselves in a triangular and/or quadratic
   flux-line lattice, which is more or less perturbed by material
   inhomogeneities that pin the flux lines. Pinning is caused by
   imperfections of the crystal lattice, such as dislocations, point
   defects, grain boundaries, etc. Hence, a honeycomb-like pattern of the
   vortex array presents some mechanical properties. If the Lorentz force
   of interactions between the vortices is much bigger than the pinning
   force, the vortex lattice behaves elastically. So we assume that the
   pinning force is negligible in the sequel and we deal with soft
   vortices. The vortex motion in the vortex lattice and/or creep of the
   vortices in the vortex fluid is accompanied by energy dissipation.
   Hence, except for the elastic properties, the vortex field is also of a
   viscous character. The main aim of the paper is a formulation of a
   thermoviscoelastic stress-strain constitutive law consisted of
   coexistence of the ordered and disordered states of the vortex field.
   Its form describes an auxetic-like thermomechanical (anomalous) property
   of the vortex field. (C) 2007 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA,

Abstract = {{Structure and swelling dynamics of ultrathin films of CdS-polyacrylamide
   nanocomposite material were studied using gravimetric techniques and
   X-ray reflectivity. Ultrathin films of the polymer and the nanocomposite
   were coated on hydrophilic Si(100) substrate using spin coating. The
   thickness of the composite films vary non-monotonically with spinning
   speed and were found to lie in discrete ``bands{''} of thicknesses
   separated by ``forbidden regions{''} unlike pure polymer films. Modified
   internal structure of the coils due to polymer-particle interaction was
   found to play a significant role in describing the novel features of the
   nanocomposite films. To study the mass uptake, the films were exposed to
   the H2O vapour and the weights of the films were recorded as functions
   of exposure time. The observed non-Fickian transport was explained in
   terms of alignment of free volume due to confinement of restricted
   polymer chains. To study swelling dynamics, the films were exposed to
   the H2O vapour and X-ray reflectivity scans were collected as functions
   of exposure time. The swelling dynamics of the nanocomposite films were
   explained in terms of a model which takes into account the
   polymer-particle interaction. A fraction of polymer segments that are in
   direct contact with the nanoparticles observed slower dynamics as
   compared to the free chain swelling. Larger values of excluded volume
   parameters corresponding to restricted segments as compared to the free

Abstract = {{Elastomer-matrix composites show promise for high Poisson's ratio and
   negative Poisson's ratio (auxetic) applications due to high orthotropy.
   There are approximately five orders of magnitude between the axial
   stiffness of high modulus graphite fibres and the stiffness of low
   durometer elastomers. Although the maximum Poisson's ratio for isotropic
   elastomers is 0.5, it is easily shown that inplane Poisson's ratios
   twice unity can be obtained with a graphite/epoxy angle-ply laminate at
   25 degrees. Chou and others have predicted inplane Poisson's ratios
   greater than 7 for certain cord-rubber combinations. Peel previously
   predicted inplane Poisson's ratios higher than 32 and less than -60.
   Preliminary experimental results have produced inplane Poisson's ratios
   as high as 14. Certain combinations of un-balanced highly orthotropic
   laminates may also produce inplane negative Poisson's ratios. Inplane
   Poisson's ratios, experimentally obtained from two laminate
   configurations with approximately the same axial stiffness are compared.
   A symmetric, balanced laminate produced an inplane Poisson's ratio of
   3.7; while an unbalanced laminate with an equivalent axial stiffness
   produced an average inplane Poisson's ratio of - 1.5. Certain high and
   negative Poisson's ratio elastomer-matrix laminates appear to have quasi
   anti-symmetric relationships about 0 degrees, although laminate
   designers may consider dual angle-ply laminates to be the more likely
   counterpart to the unbalanced dual angle auxetic laminates. Unbalanced
   symmetric laminates experience significantly more inplane shear
   deformation when axially loaded than their balanced counterparts. The
   high shear may be desirable for damping applications, but less desirable
   otherwise. (C) 2007 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA, Weinheim.}},

Abstract = {{It is known that auxetic properties (for example, negative Poisson
   ratios, that is, when a solid experiences lateral expansion under
   stretching instead of lateral contraction) start showing themselves in
   materials where there is a certain kind of geometrical orientational
   correlations between ``rigid{''} constituents. Properly arranged
   orientational degrees of freedom of building blocks govern the
   characteristic distances in auxetic materials and thus determine the way
   in which the materials contract or expand. Very often the building
   blocks are filamentous. We suggest a way to arrange filamentous objects
   into highly interwoven regular structures which may exhibit auxetic
   properties with negative Poisson ratio. Our purely geometrical
   consideration can be extended to an irregular positional arrangement.
   This implies that a solid of sufficiently dense ``random{''}
   arrangements of filaments (for example, ``wool{''} of nanowires or of
   carbon nanotubes) may become auxetic. (C) 2007 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \&

   studied periodic and aperiodic solids was determined by Monte Carlo
   simulations using the analysis of the box fluctuations in the constant
   pressure ensemble (NpT) with variable box shape. The results obtained
   for all the studied systems showed that the Poisson's ratio grows when

Abstract = {{We derive a theory for the elastic characterization of multicracked

   containing a two-dimensional arbitrary distribution of parallel slit
   cracks which is elastically equivalent to a crystal with orthorhombic
   symmetry. We obtain explicit expressions for the macroscopic elastic
   stiffness tensor which is found to depend upon both the density of
   cracks and their angular distribution, here described by a suitable
   order parameter. For the isotropic case, we find that the degradation
   depends exponentially on the crack density. In addition, we show an
   unusual elastic behavior of a multicracked medium in the plane strain
   condition: for a negative Poisson ratio, we obtain an effective Young
   modulus greater than the actual value of the host matrix.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To test the hypothesis that behavioral predictors of serious
   road traffic crashes (RTC) are correlated with unfavorable attitudes
   towards traffic safety.
   Design: Prospective and cross-sectional cohort study.
   Setting: France Participants: 13 447 of the 19 894 living members of the
   GAZEL cohort, workers and recent retirees of a French national utility
   company followed up since 1989.
   Main outcomes measures: Driving behavior and attitudes towards traffic
   safety in 2001 by questionnaire. Serious RTCs were recorded over the
   subsequent 3 years using the cohort annual questionnaire. Behavioral
   predictors of serious RTCs were assessed using generalized linear
   Poisson regression models with time-dependent covariates. Factor scores
   extracted from the first four attitudinal factors of principal component
   analysis were saved and then regressed on behavioral predictors as
   independent variables.
   Results: After controlling for potential confounders, the best
   predictors of serious RTCs were: ``exceeding speed limits on rural
   roads{''}, ``risky use of cellular phone{''}, and ``sleepy driving{''}.
   The adjusted rate ratio ranged from 1.47 to 2.16. Predictors of
   contravention of the highway code ( the first two predictors) were found
   to be strongly associated with negative attitudes towards
   ``enforcement{''} and ``speed limitations{''} with an adjusted odds
   ratio ranging from 1.31 to 2.02.
   Conclusion: Our study supports the view that individuals with a high
   propensity for driving behaviors associated with an increased risk of
   RTCs were more likely to have negative attitudes towards traffic safety.
   Changing drivers' negative or distorted opinions of traffic
   ``enforcement{''} as well as ``speed limitations{''} and ``alcohol
   prohibition on roads{''} could improve their compliance with road
   traffic rules.}},

Abstract = {{The modes of vibrations in auxetic structures are studied, with models
   where the two-dimensional lattice is represented by a planar mesh with
   rod-like particles connected by strings. An auxetic membrane can be
   obtained modifying a honeycomb one, according to a model proposed by
   Evans et al. in 1991 and used to explain a negative elastic Poisson's
   ratio. This property means that auxetic materials have a lateral
   extension, instead to shrink, when they are stretched. The models here
   proposed with rod-like particles inserted in the structure have
   interesting behaviour of acoustic and rotational branches of phonon
   dispersions. Complete bandgaps of vibrations can be obtained for a
   proper choice of lattice coupling parameters and distribution of masses
   in the unit cell of the lattice.}},

   Expressions for the in-plane Young's moduli of the above-mentioned

   found that the in-plane Young's moduli of two-dimensional cellular
   materials with negative Poisson's ratios depend both on the geometry of
   the cell, and on the induced strain of these cellular materials. The
   in-plane Young's moduli are no longer constants at large deformation.
   But at the limit of small strain, they converge to the results predicted

Abstract = {{Polyurethane foam was fabricated by `two-component method' for changing
   cell structures. Compression force applied immediately to the
   polyurethane foam just after complete foam formation at the top of the
   mold for generation cell structure of negative Poisson effect. That is
   what we called pressure-controlled method. The polyurethane foam,
   produced by pressure-control method (CT), has significant higher
   resilience (52.3\%) and similar level of shock absorption (47.5\%)
   compared with control polyurethane foam (resilience is 21.5\%, shock
   absorption is 54\%). The PU foam with negative Poisson's ratio showed
   excellent resilience with shock absorbance. The pressure-control method
   divided into two parts (CT0, CT1). The CT1 method is to apply
   compression force to the foam with time-delayed after foam formation.
   The PU foam produced by CT1 showed lower stress relaxation time, stress
   relaxation ratio, and maximum stress than CTO. Hence, CT1 foam is
   superior to other polyurethane foam as shock absorbing materials, such
   as shoes for diabetic patients.}},

Abstract = {{Soil invertebrates are the major determinants of soil processes such as
   organic matter decomposition and nutrient cycling. However, the effect
   of quantity and quality of organic inputs on soil biota has not been
   studied in agroforestry systems in southern Africa. Variations in soil
   macrofauna abundance under maize grown in fallows of Gliricidia sepium,
   Acacia anguistissima, Leucaena collinsii, Leucaena diversifolia,
   Leucaena esculenta, Leucaena pallida, Senna siamea, Calliandra
   calothyrsus and monoculture maize were assessed at three sites with
   contrasting agro-ecological conditions in eastern Zambia. It was
   hypothesised that spatial variations in soil macrofauna abundance under
   maize crops are mediated by heterogeneity in the quality and quantity of
   organic inputs produced by these legumes. The relationships between the
   abundance of macrofauna groups and litter, leaf, stump re-sprout and
   recycled biomass, stump survival and the quality index lignin
   (L)+polyphenol (P) to nitrogen (N) ratio were assessed using generalised
   linear models assuming spatial randomness (Poisson distribution) and
   aggregation (negative binomial distribution). Earthworms, beetles and
   millipedes showed spatial aggregation, which was partly explained by the
   heterogeneity in organic resource quantity and quality. Earthworms and
   beetles were more abundant under legumes that produced high quantities
   of biomass with low (L + P) to N ratios and species that have high stump
   survival after coppicing. Millipedes were favoured by species which
   produced high quantities of biomass with high (L + P) to N ratios.
   Although ants and termites showed spatial aggregation, their
   distributions were not influenced by the quantity or quality of biomass
   produced by the legumes. Centipedes and Arachnida showed spatial
   randomness, and their distribution was not influenced by any of the
   organic quality and quantity variables.}},

Pages = {{280-289}},
Abstract = {{The paper describes a combined analytical, numerical and experimental
   analysis on the compressive strength of hexagonal chiral honeycombs due
   to elastic buckling of the unit cells under flatwise compressive
   loading. Hexagonal chiral honeycombs are cellular structures composed
   noncentresymmetric unit cells, with an in-plane negative Poisson's ratio
   (NPR) with a value of -1. Cylinders connected by tangent ligaments at 60
   degrees degrees compose the unit cells. Approximated analytical models
   are proposed for the purpose of initial design assuming the main
   contribution to the elastic collapse stress being given by the nodes,
   and considering also the superposition of the critical elastic loads of
   each component of the unit cell. The models are expressed in terms of
   nondimensional geometric unit cell parameters (ligament to cylinder
   radius aspect ratio and relative density), and core material properties.
   Finite element calculations using shell and brick elements are also
   performed on unit cell models with periodic boundary conditions using
   linear bifurcation buckling analysis. The analytical and numerical
   results are compared with the outcome of a series of experimental
   flatwise compressive tests carried out on chiral honeycomb samples
   manufactured using rapid prototyping technique in PA sintered powder and
   ABS plastics. The comparison shows good convergence between the sets of
   results, and highlights the specific deformation mechanisms of the
   hexagonal chiral honeycomb cell. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In the area of biomaterials, the structures with negative Poisson's
   ratio are able to be applied to the polymer component of prosthesis,
   artificial blood-vessel and catheter. To induce its characteristic,
   previous studies postulated many structural shapes such as non-convex
   shape with re-entrant corners and re-entrant honeycomb. In this study,
   we proposed the rotational particle structures and investigated the
   Poisson's ratio and the ratio (E-e/E) of the elastic modulus of these
   structures based on structural design variables using finite element
   method.
   The auto-meshing preprocessor was coded using MATLAB in order to
   construct numerical models as design variables and perform finite
   element analysis (FEA) effectively. Three selected design variables were
   the ratio of fibril's length to particle's diameter (0.2-2.0), the ratio
   of fibril's length to its width (0.02 similar to 0.2) and the angle of
   fibril about horizontal axis (0 degree similar to tangential angle).
   Finite element model has 2D plain stress quadratic element and composed
   of 515 particles and 6-linked fibrils per each particle. For all of 213
   cases, one side of each model is applied a tension, 0.1\% strain and
   analyze Poisson's ratio and the ratio (E-e/E) of the elastic modulus.
   As the ratio of fibril's length to particle's diameter increased and the
   ratio of fibril's diameter to fibril's length decreased fixing the
   fibril's angle with 45 degree, the negative Poisson effect of rotational
   particle structures increased. The ratio of elastic modulus of these
   structures decreased with Poisson's ratio. The results show the
   reasonable values as compared with the previous analytical results.}},

Abstract = {{We review the results obtained for the 2D microscopic model of crystal
   having finite size particles proposed by Ishibashi and Iwata and later
   generalized in order to take into account deformability of particles. We
   focus on the elastic properties of the discrete model and also discuss
   various continuum analogues to the model, including the multifield
   continuum approximation. Several new results are reported, e.g., we
   describe the conditions of thermodynamic stability of the model and
   study the variation of Poisson ratio of the model as the function of
   model parameters in single-crystal and poly-crystal states. The role of
   the rotational degrees of freedom pertaining to the finite size
   particles is highlighted. Particularly we demonstrate that the
   microscopic rotations are responsible for auxetic behavior (i.e.,
   exhibiting negative Poisson ratio) of the macroscopically isotropic
   poly-crystal.}},

Abstract = {{We describe a fast and globally convergent fully four-dimensional
   incremental gradient (4DIG) algorithm to estimate the continuous-time
   tracer density from list mode positron emission tomography (PET) data.
   Detection of 511-keV photon pairs produced by positron-electron
   annihilation is modeled as an inhomogeneous Poisson process whose rate
   function is parameterized using cubic B-splines. The rate functions are
   estimated by minimizing the cost function formed by the sum of the
   negative log-likelihood of arrival times, spatial and temporal roughness
   penalties, and a negativity penalty. We first derive a computable bound
   for the norm of the optimal temporal basis function coefficients. Based
   on this bound we then construct and prove convergence of an incremental
   gradient algorithm. Fully 4-D simulations demonstrate the substantially
   faster convergence behavior of the 4DIG algorithm relative to
   preconditioned conjugate gradient. Four-dimensional reconstructions of
   real data are also included to illustrate the performance of this
   method.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CRASHWORTHINESS}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{689-698}},
Abstract = {{The finite element method has been used to investigate the
   crashworthiness of regular conventional and re-entrant cellular foams in
   pristine and defect forms. Defects were introduced by randomly deleting
   vertical ribs (cell walls), diagonal ribs and vertical-plus-diagonal
   ribs from the honeycomb models, which with suitable boundary conditions
   approximated to three-dimensional foams. Generally, the calculations
   show that deleting ribs leads to a reduction in magnitude of the Young's
   moduli and Poisson's ratios, although there are some notable exceptions.
   In particular, the Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio along the x-axis
   (perpendicular to the vertical ribs) actually increase in magnitude
   slightly when vertical ribs are deleted. In the case of the re-entrant
   honeycomb, a transition from auxetic (negative Poisson's ratio) to
   non-auxetic (positive Poisson's ratio) behaviour occurs at a critical
   threshold for diagonal rib deletion. For the conventional honeycomb, the
   Poisson's ratio for loading in the y-direction remains approximately
   constant when diagonal ribs are deleted.}},

Pages = {{159-174}},
Abstract = {{Mechanical properties of oil shales as a function of temperature and
   pressure are reviewed. Implications of evolution of these properties for
   in situ exploitation and basin modelling are explored. Mechanical
   properties at room temperature are well known. The existing data suggest
   a positive correlation between oil shale grade (organic matter content)
   and Poisson ratio, whereas tensile and compressive strength as well as
   modulus of elasticity show negative correlations. These properties are
   strongly affected by temperature. An increase in temperature results in
   loss of strength and decrease in Young's modulus. Strength follows a
   logarithmic decrease with increasing temperature, depending on grade.
   Creep is much enhanced by elevated temperature. Extrapolation of
   laboratory data to nature suggests that tensile fracturing may occur
   more easily during petroleum generation, and creep is more prominent in
   oil shales than in other rocks at this depth in the crust. More
   high-temperature experiments are required to validate these conclusions.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of this paper is to investigate the relation between
   object-oriented design choices and defects in software systems, with
   focus on a real-time telecommunication domain. The design choices are
   measured using the widely accepted metrics suite proposed by Chidamber
   and Kemerer for object oriented languages {[}S.R. Chidamber, C.F.
   Kemerer, A metrics suite for object oriented design, IEEE Transactions
   on Software Engineering 20 (6) (1994) 476-493].
   This paper reports the results of an extensive case study, which
   strongly reinforces earlier, mainly anecdotal, evidence that design
   aspects related to communication between classes can be used as
   indicators of the most defect-prone classes.
   Statistical models applicable for the non-normally distributed count
   data are used, such as Poisson regression, negative binomial regression,
   and zero-inflated negative binomial regression. The performances of the
   models are assessed using correlations, dispersion coefficients and
   Alberg diagrams.
   The zero-inflated negative binomial regression model based on response
   for a class shows the best overall ability to describe the variability
   of the number of defects in classes. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights

   flying speed and temperament scores. Six hundred and ten contemporary
   Nellores, with average age of 467 days and from two herds were used.
   Reactivity data did not fit Normal nor Poisson nor Negative Binomial

   84\%. Residual rank correlation between reactivity and temperament score
   vary from .75 to .85 (P <. 001), and were larger than the ones between
   reactivity and flight speed and between flight speed efficient in
   measuring temperament of Nellore cattle and and temperament score. The
   new methodology is efficient it has advantages in relation to the traits
   flight speed and temperament score. The measure of reactivity is easy,
   fast to get and safe to record. In addition, this trait presents large

Abstract = {{Rock is porous, with a connected network of cracks and pores. The static
   and dynamic behaviors of a rock sample under load depend on both the
   solid mineral matrix and the porous phase. In general, the configuration
   of the pore phase is complex; thus, most studies on the effect of the
   porous phase on rock deformation are conducted numerically and
   theoretical analyses of the constitutive relations are scarce. We have
   studied rock deformation under axially symmetric loading by analyzing a
   model where the pore phase is approximated by rough planes, randomly
   spaced and oriented, extending through the sample. The roughness is
   caused by asperities, all with the same tip radii, but having heights h
   with a probability density distribution given by the negative
   exponential e(-h/lambda) where lambda is a length parameter. Slip at
   contacts under local shear stress is resisted by simple Coulomb
   friction, with friction coefficient f. Both static and dynamic
   deformation were analyzed. The effect of porosity on deformation for
   both modes was found to be given by the nondimensional parameter lambda
   alpha(j), where alpha(j) is the total area of the fault planes per unit
   volume. We demonstrate that stress-induced microfracturing begins as
   randomly oriented microslip throughout the sample. As axial load
   increases, microslip occurs along preferred orientations and locations,
   which finally leads to deformation on a single fault. The model was
   found to fault under static loading conditions-the axial load at
   faulting and the angle of the ``fracture{''} plane agree with values of
   those parameters given by Coulomb's theory of fracture. Dynamic moduli
   and Poisson's ratio are found to be virtually elastic and independent of
   the friction coefficient acting at contacts. The attenuation Q(E)(-1)
   for uniaxial dynamic loading is a strong function of the friction
   coefficient and increases linearly with strain amplitude, in agreement
   with laboratory measurements. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The properties of the Poisson's ratio of microcellular foams with an
   internal pressure in the voids and low porosity are investigated. Of
   prime interest is the effect of the matrix creep on the deformation of
   the foam and how this effect influences the later deformation
   characteristics of the material in terms of a Poisson description.
   First, the definitions of Poisson's ratio for the microcellular foams
   under uniaxial stress are reviewed. Second, the deformation of the
   microvoids under the influence of the internal pressure is analyzed by
   means of Eshelby's equivalent inclusion method. Next, the formula of the
   macroscopic strain of the microcellular foams is derived by using
   Mori-Tanaka's scheme, and based on this formula, the expression of the
   Poisson's ratio of the material is obtained. Further, the calculation of
   the Poisson's ratio of the material is then carried out. Numerical
   results show that the Poisson's ratio of the microcellular foams is a
   time-dependent parameter. It is also discussed that because of the
   effect of the internal pressure in the voids, the global Poisson's ratio
   may be negative. Under the action of remote compressive load, the
   Poisson's ratio of the microcellular foams may be unbounded. Finally,
   the effects of the loading rate, the Poisson's ratio and the relaxation
   time of the polymeric matrix material, the porosity, and the pressure in
   the microvoids on the Poisson's ratio are discussed with the aid of
   numerical estimates. These analytical results indicate that the
   Poisson's ratio under uniaxial tension is different from that under
   uniaxial compression.}},

Abstract = {{Various seismic attributes of gas hydrate bearing sediments were
   analyzed in the accretionary prism offshore of southwestern Taiwan
   utilizing seismic imaging, velocity analysis, AVO analysis, and AVO
   inversion of large offset seismic data. A bottom-simulating reflector
   (BSR) is clearly observed on the seismic section with a reversed
   polarity compared to that of the seabed reflection. Instantaneous
   amplitude sectioning clearly shows lateral variations of the BSR. The
   zero-phase waveform of the BSR is distinct and the weak reflectors above
   the BSR can be observed on the instantaneous phase section. AVO analysis
   shows the absolute value of the negative BSR amplitude increasing with
   offset. A low P-wave interval velocity layer was found below the strong
   BSR by detailed velocity analysis. Both the P (normal incident P-wave
   reflection coefficient) and G (AVO gradient) values are highly negative
   for the strong BSR on the P and G sections, and they lie in the third
   quadrant of the P and G cross-plot section. The P+G (reflectivity of
   Poisson's ratio) value is also negative on the P+G section and the P-G
   (normal incident S-wave reflection coefficient) value is approximately
   zero on the P-G section along the same strong BSR. All the seismic
   characters described above suggest that a gas hydrate layer exists
   together with a free gas layer below it along strong BSRs in the area
   offshore southwestern Taiwan.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose
   To explore the relationship of HIV, hepatitis C (HCV), and alcohol
   abuse/dependence to risk for hepatocellular carcinoma and non-Hodgkin's
   lymphoma (NHL).
   Patients and Methods
   Male veterans ( n = 14,018) with a first HIV diagnosis in the Veterans
   Affairs Healthcare System from October 1997 to September 2004; and
   28,036 age-, race-, sex-, and location-matched HIV-negative veterans
   were identified. We examined the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma
   and NHL and presence of HCV and alcohol abuse/dependence using
   International Classification of Diseases, ninth revision (ICD-9-CM)
   codes. HIV-positive to HIV-negative incident rate ratios (IRRs) and 95\%
   CIs for the occurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma and NHL were
   calculated using Poisson regression models.
   Results
   HIV-positive veterans were at greater risk for hepatocellular carcinoma
   than HIV-negative veterans (IRR = 1.68; 95\% CI, 1.02 to 2.77). After
   adjusting for HCV infection and alcohol abuse/ dependence, HIV status
   was not independently associated with hepatocellular cancer ( IRR =
   0.96; 95\% CI, 0.56 to 1.63). HIV-positive veterans had 9.71 times (
   95\% CI, 6.99 to 13.49) greater risk of NHL than HIV-negative veterans.
   After adjusting for HCV and alcohol abuse/ dependence, the IRR for NHL
   comparing HIV-positive with HIV-negative veterans is similar ( IRR =
   10.03, 95\% CI, 7.19 to 13.97).
   Conclusion
   HIV-positive veterans have a higher relative incidence of hepatocellular
   carcinoma and NHL than HIV-negative veterans. For hepatocellular
   carcinoma, this association appears to be largely explained by the
   higher prevalence of HCV and alcohol abuse/ dependence. Efforts to
   decrease hepatocellular carcinoma among persons with HIV should focus
   primarily on detecting and treating HCV and reducing heavy alcohol use.}},

Abstract = {{Periodic cellular configurations with negative Poisson's ratio have
   attracted the attention of several researchers because of their superior
   dynamic characteristics. Among the geometries with a negative Poisson's
   ratio, the chiral topology features localized deformed configurations
   when excited at one of its natural frequencies. This is of particular
   importance as resonance can be exploited to minimize the power required
   for the appearance of localized deformations, thus giving practicality
   to the concept. The particular nature of these deformed configurations
   and the authority provided by the chiral geometry suggest the
   application of the proposed structural configuration for the design of
   innovative lifting devices, such as helicopter rotor blades or airplane
   wings. The dynamic characteristics of chiral structures are here
   investigated through a numerical model and experimental investigations.
   The numerical formulation uses dynamic shape functions to accurately
   describe the behavior of the considered structural assembly over a wide
   frequency range. The model is used to predict frequency response
   functions, and to investigate the occurrence of localized deformations.
   Experimental tests are also performed to demonstrate the accuracy of the

Abstract = {{Immune system perturbations are involved in pre-eclampsia
   pathophysiology. We hypothesised that immunomodulating substances, such

   Associations between indicators of immunomodulating exposures in

   In a Norwegian family cohort based on participants in agricultural
   censuses conducted by Statistics Norway 1969-89, 183 313 pregnancies to
   farmers were identified in the Medical Birth Registry of Norway. Cases
   notified as pre-eclampsia as well as pregnancies indicated by
   hypertension in combination with proteinuria were included. Data on farm
   production and meteorologically based fungal forecasts 1973-90 (a marker
   of temperate and humid climatic conditions known to favour fungal growth
   and mycotoxin formation in grain) were obtained and allocated to each
   farm. Pre-eclampsia prevalence rates were studied in strata of exposure
   indicators using Poisson regression models. Adjusted rate ratios (RR)
   and 95\% confidence intervals {[}CI] were computed.
   We identified 4912 cases, equivalent to 26.8 pre-eclampsia cases per
   1000 pregnancies {[}95\% CI 26.1, 27.6]. Pre-eclampsia showed moderate
   associations with animal farming, RR 1.14, {[}95\% CI 1.07, 1.22] and
   moderate negative associations with grain production, RR 0.93, {[}95\%
   CI 0.86, 1.01], and two or more fungal forecasts appearing in any year
   1973-90, RR 0.90 {[}95\% CI 0.84, 0.97], using no years with two or more
   forecasts as reference.
   Exposure to immunomodulating substances as indicated by grain farming,
   animal farming and fungal warnings could possibly have moderate effects
   on pre-eclampsia risk, thus supporting the study hypothesis. The use of
   exposure indicators as surrogates for real exposures may introduce a
   non-differential misclassification of the exposure that would attenuate
   any true exposure-outcome association. The use of exposure proxies
   warrants that inferences from the study should be made with caution.}},

Title = {{Variations in low birth weight and preterm delivery among blacks in
   relation to ancestry and nativity: New York City, 1998-2002}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES. Black women in the United States are more likely to give
   birth to preterm and low birth-weight infants than their white
   counterparts, but little is known about variation in birth outcomes
   within the black population. This study aimed to test the hypothesis
   that the risk of low birth weight and preterm birth within the black
   population varies by maternal ancestry and nativity.
   POPULATION AND METHODS. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using
   New York City birth records. All of the recorded live births to black
   women occurring in New York City between January 1, 1998, and December
   31, 2002 (N=168 039), were divided into the following self-reported
   ancestry groups: African, American, Asian, Cuban, European, Puerto
   Rican, South and Central American ( excluding Brazilian), and West
   Indian and Brazilian. To estimate adjusted risk ratios for low birth
   weight (weight at birth < 2500g) and preterm birth (gestational age at
   delivery < 37 weeks, based on clinical estimate), we ran 3 models for
   each outcome, using negative binomial regression and Poisson regression
   with robust SE estimation. All of the models used blacks reporting
   American ancestry as the reference group. The first model included
   ancestry as the primary exposure variable along with covariates that
   included maternal age, parity, smoking, and education, as well as
   paternal education and race. Nativity (US-or foreign-born) was included
   in the second model, and terms representing interaction effects between
   ancestry and nativity were included in the third model.
   RESULTS. There was substantial variation in risks of preterm birth and
   low birth weight among the black subgroups, with all of the groups
   having lower risks than the American black reference group, even after
   adjusting for maternal risk factors and other covariates. Risk ratios
   for low birth weight ranged from 0.55 among South/Central Americans to
   0.91 among Cubans; risk ratios for preterm birth showed a similar
   pattern. Nativity was also associated with low birth weight and preterm
   birth; births to foreign-born women were less likely to be preterm or
   lowbirth weight than births to US-born women. Furthermore, nativity
   effects varied by ancestry group, with foreign-born status inversely
   associated with poor birth outcomes among South/Central Americans but
   not among West Indians/Brazilians.
   CONCLUSIONS. Important health differences may be masked in studies that
   treat black women in America as a homogeneous group and do not take
   ethnic variation and nativity into account.}},

Abstract = {{This paper analyzes the structural and acoustic behavior of sandwich
   beams with a chiral truss-core. This particular core configuration is
   considered to exploit some of the unique properties of the chiral
   geometry and to explore their potential benefits in terms of
   sound-transmission reduction and vibration isolation. The chiral core is
   composed of circular elements or nodes, joined by ligaments or ribs. The
   arrangement of nodes and ribs is such that chiral assemblies exhibit
   in-plane negative Poisson's ratio behavior as well as unique deformation
   patterns. The vibroacoustic performance of the considered beams is
   evaluated through a numerical model, formulated by employing dynamic
   shape functions derived directly from the distributed parameter model of
   beam elements. This formulation allows an accurate evaluation of the
   dynamic response of the considered structures at high frequencies with a
   limited number of elements. Furthermore, such a numerical model can be
   coupled with a Fourier-transform-based analysis of the sound radiated by
   the structure in a surrounding fluid medium. The structural-acoustic
   behavior of the proposed beams is investigated in terms of kinetic
   energy of the constraining layers and sound pressure levels
   corresponding to an incident pressure wave. A sensitivity study
   investigates the influence of core configuration and geometry on the
   beam performance. Moreover the performance of the chiral core is
   compared to that of cores with ``square{''} and hexagonal topologies.
   The results demonstrate the design flexibility offered by the proposed
   core design, whose configuration is defined by a number of independent
   parameters that can be modified and optimized to enhance the
   structural-acoustic performance of the beam.}},

Abstract = {{Negative Poisson ratio (NPR) materials based on a re-entrant honeycomb
   structure expand in the direction perpendicular to an externally exerted
   tension. This feature makes NPR structures attractive for use in
   microsensors and actuators as versatile motion transformers. When
   implemented in microdevices, where slender and flexible micromachined
   elements are widely used, the NPR material can tolerate large
   deflections. In the present work, motivated by the development of an
   optical sensor based on a photonic crystal device attached to a NPR
   based structure, we analyze the behavior of re-entrant honeycomb
   structures under large deflections. The model of the structure is built
   using extensible elastica theory for the description of geometrically
   nonlinear beams with an extensible axis. Results provided by the
   analytical model are compared with numerical results obtained by the
   finite element method. It is shown that the Poisson ratio (nu), which is
   defined entirely by the initial geometry of the structure undergoing
   small deflections, becomes strain dependent at large deflections. The
   extensibility of the beam's axis has a strong influence on the. of the
   structure at large deflections and leads to the appearance of a minimum
   on the strain-nu curve. An example of design is demonstrated which
   yields a desired strain-independent nu of the NPR structure under large
   deflections.}},

Abstract = {{The adaptive mode of frictional interaction has been studied as a
   self-locking effect upon contact deformation of isotropic and

   manifests itself in the fact that the bearing capacity of the joint
   rises with increasing shear load. In particular, the parameters of
   stress state (contact load, tangential stresses, slippage, etc.) were
   determined for a double-lap joint under conditions of compression with
   or without shear. The contact interaction was analyzed by the
   finite-element method for three profiles of symmetrically located
   contact elements (plane, cylindrical, and wedge-shaped). The Poisson
   ratio was varied within the range theoretically admissible for isotropic
   elastic media. Analogous calculations were also performed for a joint
   with a deformed element made of an anisotropic auxetic composite, whose
   reinforcement angle was varied. The maximum loads, tangential stresses,
   and slippage are obtained as nonlinear functions of Poisson ratio (in
   the isotropic case) and reinforcement angle of the composite material.
   The stress concentration and the increased ultimate shear forces are

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE. Encephalocele is classified as a neural tube defect, but
   questions have been raised regarding whether its epidemiological
   characteristics are similar to those of other neural tube defects.
   DESIGN. We compared characteristics of temporal trends in, and the
   impact of folic acid grain fortification on, the prevalence of
   encephalocele, spina bifida, and anencephaly using data from the
   Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program, a population-based
   birth defects surveillance system. Prevalences of encephalocele, spina
   bifida, and anencephaly were compared by maternal age, gender, race,
   birth weight, ascertainment period (1968-1981, 1982-1993, or 1994-2002),
   and fortification period (1994-1996 {[}prefortification] and 1998-2002
   {[}postfortification]) using prevalence ratios with 95\% confidence
   intervals. Temporal trends were assessed using Poisson and negative
   binomial regression models.
   RESULTS. Prevalence rates of encephalocele (n = 167), spina bifida (n =
   650), and anencephaly (n = 431) were 1.4, 5.5, and 3.7 per 10 000 live
   births, respectively. Encephalocele was similar to anencephaly in
   showing an increased prevalence among girls and multiple gestation
   pregnancies and to spina bifida and anencephaly in an annual prevalence
   decrease between 1968 and 2002 (-1.2\% for encephalocele, -4.2\% for
   spina bifida, and -3.6\% for anencephaly). With fortification,
   prevalence decreased for spina bifida but not significantly for
   encephalocele or anencephaly.
   CONCLUSIONS. Encephalocele shows more similarities to spina bifida or
   anencephaly than it shows differences with respect to characteristics,
   temporal trend, and impact of fortification. Additional studies should
   be done to explore the etiologic heterogeneity of encephalocele using
   better markers of folate status and a wider range of risk factors.}},

   subsequent testing for HCV up to 21 April 2005. A new HCV diagnosis was
   defined as anti-HCV antibody seroconversion or positive HCV RNA
   following a previous negative. Incident rate ratios (IRR) were
   calculated using Poisson regression in Stata (version 9). Men
   contributed time at risk from interview until either their diagnosis or
   their last negative test result.
   Results: Of the 422 men who completed questionnaires, 308 (73\%) had
   sufficient clinical and HCV testing data available for analysis.
   Incident HCV infection was identified in 11 men. Unprotected anal
   intercourse, more than 30 sex partners in the past year, higher numbers
   of new anal sex partners, rimming (oro-anal sex), fisting, use of sex
   toys, and intranasal recreational drug use were associated with HCV. In
   multivariate analysis only fisting remained associated with HCV
   (adjusted IRR 6.27, p = 0.005).
   Conclusions: In this study of HIV positive MSM, fisting is strongly
   associated with HCV infection. Where individuals report high risk sexual
   behaviours, clinicians should offer appropriate testing for HCV
   infection.}},

Title = {{The effect of protein dielectric coefficient on the ionic selectivity of
   a calcium channel}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{125}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{JUL 21}},
Abstract = {{Calcium-selective ion channels are known to have carboxylate-rich
   selectivity filters, a common motif that is primarily responsible for
   their high Ca2+ affinity. Different Ca2+ affinities ranging from
   micromolar (the L-type Ca channel) to millimolar (the ryanodine receptor
   channel) are closely related to the different physiological functions of
   these channels. To understand the physical mechanism for this range of
   affinities given similar amino acids in their selectivity filters, we
   use grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations to assess the binding of
   monovalent and divalent ions in the selectivity filter of a model Ca
   channel. We use a reduced model where the electolyte is modeled by
   hard-sphere ions embedded in a continuum dielectric solvent, while the
   interior of protein surrounding the channel is allowed to have a
   dielectric coefficient different from that of the electrolyte. The
   induced charges that appear on the protein/lumen interface are
   calculated by the induced charge computation method {[}Boda , Phys. Rev.
   E 69, 046702 (2004)]. It is shown that decreasing the dielectric
   coefficient of the protein attracts more cations into the pore because
   the protein's carboxyl groups induce negative charges on the dielectric
   boundary. As the density of the hard-sphere ions increases in the
   filter, Ca2+ is absorbed into the filter with higher probability than
   Na+ because Ca2+ provides twice the charge to neutralize the negative
   charge of the pore (both structural carboxylate oxygens and induced
   charges) than Na+ while occupying about the same space (the charge/space
   competition mechanism). As a result, Ca2+ affinity is improved an order
   of magnitude by decreasing the protein dielectric coefficient from 80 to
   5. Our results indicate that adjusting the dielectric properties of the
   protein surrounding the permeation pathway is a possible way for
   evolution to regulate the Ca2+ affinity of the common four-carboxylate
   motif.}},

Abstract = {{Time-resolved photoion and photoclectron velocity mapped images from NO2
   excited close to its first dissociation limit {[}to NO(X-2 Pi) +
   O(P-3(2))] have been recorded in a two colour pump-probe experiment,
   using the frequency-doubled and frequency-tripled output of a
   regeneratively amplified titanium-sapphire laser. At least three
   processes are responsible for the observed transient signals; a negative
   pump-probe signal (corresponding to a 266 nm pump), a very short-lived
   transient close to the cross-correlation of the pump and probe pulses
   but on the 400 nm pump side, and a longer-lived positive pump-probe
   signal that exhibits a signature of wavepacket motion (oscillations).
   These transients have two main origins; multiphoton excitation of the
   Rydberg states of NO2 by both 266 and 400 nm light, and electronic
   relaxation in the 1(2)B(2) state of NO2, which leads to a
   quasi-dissociaied NO2 high in the 1(2)A(1) electronic ground state and
   just below the dissociation threshold. The wavepacket motion that we
   observe is ascribed to states exhibiting free rotation of the O atom
   about the NO moiety. These states, which are common for loosely bound
   systems such as a van der Waals complex but unusual for a
   chemically-bound molecule, have previously been observed in the
   frequency domain by optical double resonance spectroscopy but never
   before in the time domain.}},

Title = {{Factors facilitating or limiting the use of AVO for coal-bed methane}},
Journal = {{GEOPHYSICS}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{71}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{C49-C56}},
Month = {{JUL-AUG}},
Abstract = {{There are similarities and differences in employing amplitude variation
   with offset (AVO) to explore for gas-sand reservoirs, as opposed to
   coal-bed methane (CBM) reservoirs. The main similarity is that large
   Poisson's ratio contrasts, resulting in AVO gradient anomalies, are
   expected for both kinds of reservoirs. The main difference is that
   cleating and fracturing raise the Poisson's ratio of a coal seam as it
   improves its reservoir potential for CBM, while gas always lowers the
   Poisson's ratio of a sandstone reservoir. The top of gas sands usually
   has a negative AVO gradient, leading to a class one, two, or three
   anomaly depending on the impedance contrast with the overlying caprock.
   On the other hand, the top of a CBM reservoir has a positive AVO
   gradient, leading to a class four anomaly. Three environmental factors
   may limit the usage of AVO for CBM reservoirs: the smaller contrast in
   Poisson's ratio between a CBM reservoir and its surrounding rock,
   variations in the caprock of a specific CBM reservoir, and the fact that
   CBM is not always free to collect at structurally high points in the
   reservoir. However, other factors work in favor of using AVO. The
   strikingly high reflection amplitude of coal improves signal/noise ratio
   and hence the reliability of AVO measurements. The relatively simple
   characteristics of AVO anomalies make them easy to interpret. Because
   faults are known to improve the quality of CBM reservoirs, faults
   accompanied by AVO anomalies would be especially convincing. A 3D-AVO
   example offered in this paper shows that AVO might be helpful to
   delineate methane-rich sweet spots within coal seams.}},

Abstract = {{We compared several modeling strategies for vaccine adverse event count
   data in which the data are characterized by excess zeroes and
   heteroskedasticity. Count data are routinely modeled using Poisson and
   Negative Binomial ( NB) regression but zero-inflated and hurdle models
   may be advantageous in this setting. Here we compared the fit of the
   Poisson, Negative Binomial ( NB), zero-inflated Poisson ( ZIP),
   zero-inflated Negative Binomial (ZINB), Poisson Hurdle (PH), and
   Negative Binomial Hurdle (NBH) models. In general, for public health
   studies, we may conceptualize zero-inflated models as allowing zeroes to
   arise from at-risk and not-at-risk populations. In contrast, hurdle
   models may be conceptualized as having zeroes only from an at-risk
   population. Our results illustrate, for our data, that the ZINB and NBH
   models are preferred but these models are indistinguishable with respect
   to fit. Choosing between the zero-inflated and hurdle modeling
   framework, assuming Poisson and NB models are inadequate because of
   excess zeroes, should generally be based on the study design and
   purpose. If the study's purpose is inference then modeling framework
   should be considered. For example, if the study design leads to count
   endpoints with both structural and sample zeroes then generally the
   zero-inflated modeling framework is more appropriate, while in contrast,
   if the endpoint of interest, by design, only exhibits sample zeroes ( e.
   g., at risk participants) then the hurdle model framework is generally
   preferred. Conversely, if the study's primary purpose it is to develop a
   prediction model then both the zero-inflated and hurdle modeling
   frameworks should be adequate.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials possess negative Poisson's ratios. As such, they can
   be applied in situations where traditional materials perform poorly or
   cannot perform. We investigate the plastic failure of a 3D auxetic strut

   ongoing research in miniaturized strut-based sandwich cores. The chosen
   lattice is also representative of an auxetic foam. Plastic failure
   models derived with respect to two physical parameters (packing
   parameter and relative density) which control the negative Poisson's
   ratio compare well with numerical data. Microscopic failure modes differ
   depending on the loading state: shear failure is due to global plastic
   yielding while plastic localization occurs under uniaxial loads. This
   observation suggests among others that it is advisable to use auxetic
   cores when structural softness under normal loads and hardness under
   transverse loads are both critical design conditions. (c) 2006 Elsevier

Abstract = {{We use a coupled petrological-thermomechanical model to investigate the
   dynamical effects of metamorphic reactions and melting on the seismic
   structure of thermal-chemical plumes beneath volcanic arcs. Plume
   generation is driven by the subduction of buoyant crustal rocks and
   expulsion of aqueous slab fluids that causes hydration and partial
   melting of the mantle wedge. The model demonstrates two chemically
   distinct types of plumes. Unmixed plumes initiate from the melting front
   within the mantle that arises as a consequence of infiltration of
   slab-derived water-rich fluids, whereas mixed plumes initiate from the
   slab itself and entrain both slab- and mantle-derived magmas. Mixed
   plumes explain magmas such as adakites with crustal signatures, while
   primitive arc tholeiites are attributed to unmixed plumes. As a
   consequence of the interplay between water content and temperature both
   positive and negative seismic velocity anomalies are associated with the
   plumes. Positive anomalies are prevalent close to the slab due to the
   lowered temperatures associated with regions of cold plume initiation.
   Negative seismic anomalies develop at shallower depth due to the
   partially molten rocks that form plume heads. Flat lying partially
   molten regions that form beneath volcanic arcs as a consequence of cold
   wet plumes are manifest by > 20\% variations in the local Poisson ratio,
   as compared to variations of similar to 2\% expected as a consequence of
   temperature variation within the mantle wedge. In contrast to models
   that attribute a purely thermal origin for mantle wedge seismic
   anomalies, the petrological-thermomechanical model is able to explain
   the strong seismic velocity variations existing beneath volcanic arcs.

Abstract = {{The lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) is applied to investigate the liquid
   junction potential (LJP) at an interface between two electrolyte layers.
   The Poisson equation for electrostatic field is solved to extend the
   applicable range to micro- and nanoscales in which electroneutrality
   does not hold. The LBM solutions are validated against analytical and
   finite difference method (FDM) results for evolution of concentration,
   net charge density and electrostatic potential. Noticeable separation of
   the concentration profiles of positive and negative ions occurs for
   kappa d less than 67 in simulation, where kappa is the inverse of the
   thickness of electrical double layer and d is the system length.
   Parametric study is performed for the peak potential and the time to
   reach the peak with respect to kappa d and xi which is the initial
   thickness ratio of the lower concentration to entire stream. Simple
   coding and easy parallelization will allow the LBM to make an efficient
   analysis tool for complex electrochemical systems. (c) 2006 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is to investigate the application of topology
   description function (TDF) in material design. Using TDF to describe the
   topology of the microstructure, the formulation and the solving
   technique of the design problem of materials with prescribed mechanical
   properties are presented. By presenting the TDF as the sum of a series
   of basis functions determined by parameters, the topology optimization
   of material microstructure is formulated as a size optimization problem
   whose design variables are parameters of TDF basis functions and
   independent of the mesh of the design domain. By this method, high
   quality topologies for describing the distribution of constituent
   material in design domain can be obtained and checkerboard problem often
   met in the variable density method is avoided. Compared with the
   conventional level set method, the optimization problem can be solved
   simply by existing optimization techniques without the process to solve
   the `Hamilton-Jacobi-type' equation by the difference method. The method
   proposed is illustrated with two 2D examples. One gives the unit cell
   with positive Poisson's ratio, the other with negative Poisson's ratio.
   The examples show the method based on TDF is effective for material

Abstract = {{Shear band (SB), axial, lateral and volumetric strains as well as
   Poisson's ratio of anisotropic jointed rock specimen (JRS) were modeled
   by Fast Lagrangian Analysis of Continua (FLAC). Failure criterion of
   rock was a composited Mohr-Coulomb criterion with tension cut-off. An
   inclined joint was treated as square elements of ideal plastic material
   beyond the peak strength. Several FISH functions were written to
   automatically find the addresses of elements in the joint and to
   calculate the entire deformational characteristics of plane strain JRS.
   The results show that for moderate joint inclination (JI), strain is
   only concentrated into the joint governing the behavior of JRS, leading
   to ideal plastic responses in axial and lateral directions. For higher
   JI, the post-peak stress-axial and lateral strain curves become steeper
   as JI increases owing to the increase of new SB's length. Lateral
   expansion and precursor to the unstable failure are the most apparent,
   resulting in the highest Poisson's ratio and even negative volumetric
   strain. For lower JI, the entire post-peak deformational characteristics
   are independent of JI. The lowest lateral expansion occurs, leading to
   the lowest Poisson's ratio and positive volumetric strain all along. The
   present prediction on anisotropic strength in plane strain compression
   qualitatively agrees with the results in triaxial tests of rocks. The JI
   calculated by Jaeger's formula overestimates that related to the minimum
   strength. Advantages of the present numerical model over the Jaeger's
   model are pointed out.}},

Abstract = {{We have mixed cellulose acetate and Zeocarb-225 in different ratios,
   leading to the preparations of Membrane-1 and Membrane-2. Membrane
   potential, water content, and conductance measurements have been carried
   out to estimate and analyze the data in terms of equilibria and
   important electrochemical parameters. The Donnan equilibrium has been
   incorporated to estimate the activity coefficient of counterions,
   y(p)(M), and solute, y(+/-)(M) in the membrane phase along with the
   parameter, so called phi expressing non-ideality. Dependence of the
   extent of hydrophilicity of both membranes on mean electrolyte
   concentrations has been examined. Selectivity in membranes is discussed
   in terms of dissociation equilibria, K-d(s) and K-d(f). It has been
   found that membrane Surface charge density as increases with increasing
   ofexternal NaCl concentration. Dependence ofwater d transport number and
   cationic transport number on electrolyte concentration shows a similar
   trend of variation. At higher mean concentration of electrolyte, water
   transport number in Membrane-2 has a negative value. Membrane-2 has a
   higher value of water transport number than Membrane-1. The entropy
   production due to solute and water transport has been quantified for
   both the membranes in the light of nonequilibrium thermodynamics. The
   various type of interactions Such as solute-membrane, solute-water, and
   water-membrane are analyzed in terms of friction coefficients (f(ij)) of
   Spiegler's frictional pore model. In our case, an f(wm) < f(sm) <
   f(sw)-like trend is observed in both membranes. These frictional
   coefficients show close dependence on external electrolyte
   concentrations. Pore potential values of Membrane-1 and Membrane-2 have
   been worked out using the Poisson-Boltzrnann equation. In both systems
   pore potential values increase with increasing mean electrolyte
   concentrations. The transport through Membrane-1 and Mernbrane-2 tends
   to follow diffusion-control criteria, i.e., (D-+/- center dot C center
   dot d/(D +/- CM)-C-M center dot delta) >> 2. A slightly higher value of
   solute rejection is found in Membrane-2. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All

   dependence within a wide range of voltages. When the internal and

   stretched and thinner when compressed. This paper discusses a new
   explanation for achieving auxetic behaviour in foam cellular materials,
   namely a `rotation of rigid units' mechanism. Such auxetic cellular
   materials can be produced from conventional open-cell cellular materials
   if the ribs of cell are slightly thicker in the proximity of the joints
   when compared to the centre of the ribs with the consequence that if the
   conventional cellular material is volumetrically compressed (and then
   `frozen' in the compressed conformation), the cellular structure will
   deform in such a way which conserves the geometry at the joints (i.e.
   behave like `rigid units') whilst the major deformations will occur
   along the length of the more flexible ribs which form `kinks' at their
   centres as a result of the extensive buckling. It is proposed that
   uniaxial tensile loading of such cellular systems will result auxetic
   behaviour due to re-unfolding of these `kinks' and re-rotation of the
   `rigid joints'. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Materials with a negative Poisson's ratio (auxetic) exhibit the unusual
   property of becoming wider when stretched and thinner when compressed. A
   naturally occurring auxetic material which has attracted a lot of
   research in recent years is alpha-cristobalite, a silicate for which
   negative Poisson's ratios have been experimentally measured. We present
   the results of force-field based molecular modelling studies which will
   provide an insight into nano-level deformations that occur when this
   silicate is subjected to externally applied uniaxial mechanical
   stresses. These results will suggest that the auxetic behaviour can be
   explained in terms of a `rotation of rigid units' model and, more
   specifically we will show that the auxetic behaviour in the (010) and
   (100) planes may be explained in terms of `rotating rectangles' which
   are the projections of the three-dimensional silicate framework in the
   (010) and (100) planes. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Young's moduli of zeolite single crystals (natrolite, Na-2(Al2Si3O10)
   center dot 2H(2)O, NAT-type) have been determined directly using static
   three-point bend, compression and indentation experiments for the first
   time. The values compare well with those previously determined from
   dynamic studies (Brillouin scattering and ultrasound) of the same
   zeolite. A strong anisotropy in elasticity is detected, in particular a
   larger Young's modulus along the crystal z-axis compared to those along
   the x and y axes, which reflects the anisotropic, fibrous structure of
   natrolite. The idealised, siliceous natrolite structure has previously
   been predicted to possess on-axis negative Poisson's ratios (auxetic
   behaviour), but the measured elastic constants are not consistent with
   this hypothesis. We use new simulation results via a molecular mechanics
   approach to show that the presence of extra-framework cations and water
   molecules in the true aluminosilicate zeolite framework removes the
   on-axis auxetic behaviour expected for the hypothetical siliceous
   framework and then discuss our new calculated elastic constants in
   relation to the experimental values. (c) 2006 Acta Materialia Inc.

Abstract = {{The tensile properties of kraft cooked Norway spruce were studied by
   tensile testing with in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD). Samples were of
   earlywood, cooked for varying times. The total lignin content of the
   samples was between 21.7\% and 9.3\%. Tensile tests with XRD were
   performed on wet samples, without XRD on dry samples. The tensile
   strength, the modulus of elasticity (MOE), and the elongation at
   fracture/yield were determined. X-ray diffraction was used to determine
   the microfibril angle (MFA) and the deformation of crystalline cellulose
   by monitoring the reflections 200 and 004. The (X-ray) Poisson ratio of
   crystalline cellulose was calculated, both before and after the yield
   point. The tensile strength and the MOE of the wet samples were
   significantly lower than in the dry samples. The tensile properties of
   dry samples were similar to dry earlywood samples of untreated Norway
   spruce. The MFA only showed notable changes due to strain when it was
   initially large, when a diminishing effect was observed. The Poisson
   ratio of crystalline cellulose was negative. The average values ranged
   between -0.26 and -1.17 before the yield point and between -0.86 and
   -1.05 after the yield point.}},

Title = {{Molecular dynamics simulation of electro-osmotic flows in rough wall
   nanochannels}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{73}},
Number = {{5, 1}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{We performed equilibrium and nonequilibrium molecular dynamics
   simulation to study electro-osmotic flows inside charged nanochannels
   with different types of surface roughness. We modeled surface roughness
   as a sequence of two-dimensional subnanoscale grooves and ridges (step
   function-type roughness) along the flow direction. The amplitude,
   spatial period, and symmetry of surface roughness were varied. The
   amplitude of surface roughness was on the order of the Debye length. The
   walls have uniform negative charges at the interface with fluids. We
   included only positive ions (counterions) for simplicity of computation.
   For the smooth wall, we compared our molecular dynamics simulation
   results to the well-known Poisson-Boltzmann theory. The density profiles
   of water molecules showed ``layering{''} near the wall. For the rough
   walls, the density profiles measured from the wall are similar to those
   for the smooth wall except near where the steps are located. Because of
   the layering of water molecules and the finite size effect of ions and
   the walls, the ionic distribution departs from the Boltzmann
   distribution. To further understand the structure of water molecules and
   ions, we computed the polarization density. Near the wall, its z
   component dominates the other components, indicating the preferred
   orientation ({''}ordering{''}) of water molecules. Especially, inside
   the groove for the rough walls, its maximum is 10\% higher (stronger
   ordering) than for the smooth wall. The dielectric constant, computed
   with a Clausius-Mosotti-type equation, confirmed the ordering near the
   wall and the enhanced ordering inside the groove. The residence time and
   the diffusion coefficient, computed using the velocity autocorrelation
   function, showed that the diffusion of water and ions along the
   direction normal to the wall is significantly reduced near the wall and
   further decreases inside the groove. Along the flow direction, the
   diffusion of water and ions inside the groove is significantly lowered
   while it is similar to the bulk value elsewhere. We performed
   nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulation to compute electro-osmotic
   velocities and flow rates. The velocity profiles correspond to those for
   overlapped electric double layers. For the rough walls, velocity inside
   the groove is close to zero, meaning that the channel height is
   effectively reduced. The flow rate was found to decrease as the period
   of surface roughness decreases or the amplitude of surface roughness
   increases. We defined the zeta potential as the electrostatic potential
   at the location of a slip plane. We computed the electrostatic potential
   with the ionic distribution and the dielectric constant both from our
   molecular dynamics simulation. We estimated the slip plane from the
   velocity profile. The zeta potential showed the same trend as the flow
   rate: it decreases with an increasing amplitude and a decreasing period
   of surface roughness.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To retrospectively assess outcome in patients with clinically
   unsuspected pulmonary embolism ( PE) at chest multi detector row
   computed tomography (CT).
   Materials and Methods: Institutional review board approval and informed
   consent were not required. PE was assessed in consecutive CT scans in
   1966 patients (mean age, 60 years; range, 15-96 years; male-female
   ratio, 1.79) and graded with severity score. Studies with true-positive
   and false-negative radiologic diagnoses were determined. Coexisting
   morbidity, anticoagulant therapy (ACT), complications, and 1-year
   outcome were reviewed. Statistical evaluation included Mann-Whitney U
   test, X-2 test, Poisson regression, and Kaplan-Meier statistics.
   Results: Scans were PE positive in 117 patients. Clinical data review
   was complete in 96 patients; 63 of 96 patients had malignancy; in 58, PE
   was not suspected. In 38 of these 58 patients, radiology report findings
   were false-negative (mean severity score, 20.21 +/- 17.88 {[}standard
   deviation] and 9.55 +/- 7.12 for those with true-positive and
   false-negative findings, respectively; P = .012). Forty-nine patients
   received therapeutic ACT; 21, prophylactic ACT; and 26, no treatment. PE
   severity was higher in patients with therapeutic ACT versus those
   without (P <.001). Bleeding complications were more frequent with
   therapeutic ACT (two early deaths, five major nonfatal hemorrhages) than
   without ( =one minor hemorrhage; P = .037). There were eight early
   deaths ( =therapeutic ACT, seven; without ACT, one; P = .037). Positive
   predictors of early death included severity score > 28, use of systemic
   thrombolytic therapy, occurrence of major hemorrhage, and new-onset
   cardiac or renal failure (P =.001- .043). Negative predictors were
   report with false-negative findings and no therapeutic ACT (P = .007-
   .037). Predictors of late death (n = 25) were older age, malignancy, and
   renal failure (P =.001 - .043).
   Conclusion: Clinically unsuspected PE may remain undetected at routine
   chest CT; these patients have favorable short-term outcome without
   therapeutic ACT. (c) RSNA, 2006.}},

Abstract = {{The homogeneous nucleation rates of light and heavy water have been
   measured in supercooled levitated micro-droplets at different

   times of ice in supercooled water follow the Poisson statistics. The
   nucleation rate has a negative temperature coefficient; it increases
   strongly with decreasing temperature. At the same degree of
   supercooling, the nucleation in heavy water is faster than in light
   water.
   The discussion of the experimental results is based on kinetic arguments
   in the frame of a two-state model of liquid water. The homogeneous
   nucleation rate J is tantamount to a volume-normalized apparent
   first-order rate constant J{*} which can be described by the product of
   the genuine rate constant j and an overall equilibrium constant K. K
   describes a large number of pre-equilibria, which are coupled to the

Abstract = {{The equilibrium Young's modulus of articular cartilage is known to be
   primarily determined by proteoglycans (PGs). However, the relation
   between the Poisson's ratio and the composition and structure of
   articular cartilage is more unclear. In this study, we determined
   Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of bovine articular cartilage in
   unconfined compression. Subsequently, the same samples, taken from
   bovine knee (femoral, patellar and tibial cartilage) and shoulder
   (humeral cartilage) joints, were processed for quantitative microscopic
   analysis of PGs, collagen content, and collagen architecture. The
   Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, PG content (estimated with optical
   density measurements), collagen content, and birefringence showed
   significant topographical variation (p < 0.05) among the test sites.
   Experimentally the Young's modulus was strongly determined by the tissue
   PG content (r = 0.86, p < 0.05). Poisson's ratio revealed a significant
   negative linear correlation (r = -0.59, p < 0.05) with the collagen
   content, as assessed by the Fourier transform infrared imaging. Finite
   element analyses, conducted using a fibril reinforced biphasic model,
   indicated that the mechanical properties of the collagen network
   strongly affected the Poisson's ratio. We conclude that Poisson's ratio
   of articular cartilage is primarily controlled by the content and
   organization of the collagen network. (c) 2006 Orthopaedic Research

Abstract = {{With the aim of understanding anisotropic crystals that possess a

   molecular mechanisms, we discuss the definition of the ratio and

   anisotropy and helpful in the investigation of isotropic polycrystals.
   We discuss alpha-cristobalite, a polymorph of silicon dioxide that
   possesses interesting negative ratio properties in single crystals and
   hypothetical polycrystals. In this connection, we draw attention to the
   transverse compliance as an alternative and simpler metric for gaging
   the ratio and for orientation averaging. For alpha-cristobalite, we
   arrive at new results for the directions that yield the most negative
   Poisson's ratio. This result should be of value in divining the
   underlying molecular mechanism that explains the negative values of
   Poisson's ratio in alpha-cristobalite, a crystal of tetragonal symmetry
   that possesses six independent elastic constants. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The large wavenumber suppression of unstable modes by space charge
   effects of the ionization instability in a weakly ionized and
   unmagnetized dusty plasma is investigated. The charge losses in the
   initial equilibrium state are balanced by electron impact ionizations
   originated by both the thermal electron populations and an additional
   monoenergetic electron beam. The multifluid dimensionless equations are
   deduced by using the time and length scales for elastic collisions
   between ions and neutral atoms and the Poisson equation relates the
   plasma potential fluctuations with charged particle densities instead of
   the quasineutral approximation. A general dimensionless dispersion
   relation is obtained from the linearized transport equations, where the
   ratios between the characteristic velocities, as the dust ion acoustic
   (IA), dust acoustic (DA), ion sound, and thermal speeds permits us to
   evaluate the weight of the different terms. In the long wavelength limit
   the results obtained using the quasineutral approximation are recovered.
   The differences found between roots of both dispersion equations are
   discussed, as well as those of previous models. The unstable mode of the
   linear ionization instability is originated by the imbalance between ion
   and electron densities in the rest state caused by the negative charging
   of dust grains. Contrary to dust free plasmas, the unstable mode exists,
   even in the absence of the ionizing electron beam. The numerical
   calculations of the roots of the full dispersion equation present a
   maximum unstable wavenumber not predicted by the quasineutral
   approximation, which is related with the minimum allowed length for
   space charge fluctuations within a fluid model. This upper limit of
   unstable wave numbers hinders the predicted resonant coupling in the
   long wavenumber regime between the DA and DIA waves. (c) 2006 American

Abstract = {{Analytic expressions for strains in carbon nanotubes of all chiralities
   in lateral and axial directions have been obtained. These expressions
   have been related to bond angle and bond length flexibilities. This
   finally results in obtaining very generalized results for Poisson ratio
   of all chirality and P: all diameter carbon nanotubes. It turns out that
   the Poisson ratio is always independent of carbon nanotube diameter, but
   depends on their chirality. On the assumption of fixed bond lengths,
   (only flexible bond angle), the Poisson ratio of all chirality tubes is
   obtained to be 1. When realistic flexibility of bond lengths and bond
   angles is assumed, the Poisson ratio is between similar to 0 and 0.3,
   depending upon chirality. There is thus a compensation in lateral
   dimension when both, bond lengths and bond angles are assumed flexible,
   which has also been described as possibly a cause of very small or
   negative thermal expansion of single nanotubes. Further, it has been
   found that the Poisson ratio is sensitive to applied initial stress,
   varying significantly when obtained under different initial stress
   values. It is observed that Poisson ratio can be used to justify the
   interaction potential by finding out the bond length flexibility in
   comparison to bond angle flexibility.}},

Month = {{JAN 28}},
Abstract = {{The lattice dynamics and molecular vibrations of benzene and deuterated
   benzene crystals are calculated from force constants derived from
   density-functional theory (DFT) calculations and compared with measured
   inelastic neutron-scattering spectra. A very small change (0.5\%) in
   lattice parameter is required to obtain real lattice-mode frequencies
   across the Brillouin zone. There is a strong coupling between wagging
   and breathing modes away from the zone center. This coupling and
   sensitivity to cell size arises from two basic interactions. Firstly,
   comparatively strong interactions that hold the benzene molecules
   together in layers. These include an intermolecular interaction in which
   H atoms of one molecule link to the center of the aromatic ring of a
   neighboring molecule. The layers are held to each other by weaker
   interactions, which also have components that hold molecules together
   within a layer. Small changes in the lattice parameters change this
   second type of interaction and account for the changes to the lattice
   dynamics. The calculations also reveal a small auxetic effect in that
   elongation of the crystal along the b axis leads to an increase in
   internal pressure in the ac plane, that is, elongation in the b
   direction induces expansion in the a and c directions. (c) 2006 American

Abstract = {{Background: The impact of antiretroviral therapy (ART) on sexual risk
   behavior and HIV transmission among HIV-infected persons in Africa is
   unknown.
   Objective: To assess changes in risky sexual behavior and estimated HIV
   transmission from HIV-infected adults after 6 months of ART.
   Design and methods: A prospective cohort study was performed in rural
   Uganda. Between May 2003 and December 2004 a total of 926 HIV-infected
   adults were enrolled and followed in a home-based ART program that
   included prevention counselling, voluntary counseling and testing (VCT)
   for cohabitating partners and condom provision. At baseline and
   follow-up, participants' HIV plasma viral load and partner-specific
   sexual behaviors were assessed. Risky sex was defined as inconsistent or
   no condom use with partners of HIV-negative or unknown serostatus in the
   previous 3 months. The rates of risky sex were compared using a Poisson
   regression model and transmission risk per partner was estimated, based
   on established viral load-specific transmission rates.
   Results: Six months after initiating ART, risky sexual behavior reduced
   by 70\% {[}adjusted risk ratio, 0.3; 95\% confidence interval (CI),
   0.2-0.7; P=0.0017]. Over 85\% of risky sexual acts occurred within
   married couples. At baseline, median viral load among those reporting
   risky sex was 122 500 copies/ml, and at follow-up, < 50 copies/ml.
   Estimated risk of HIV transmission from cohort members declined by 98\%,
   from 45.7 to 0.9 per 1000 person years.
   Conclusions: Providing ART, prevention counseling, and partner VCT was
   associated with reduced sexual risk behavior and estimated risk of HIV
   transmission among HIV-infected Ugandan adults during the first 6 months
   of therapy. integrated ART and prevention programs may reduce HIV
   transmission in Africa. (C) 2006 Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins.}},

Abstract = {{FISH functions were written and embedded in FLAC to calculate the axial,
   lateral and volumetric strains as well as the ratio of negative lateral
   strain to axial strain (called the calculated Poisson's ratio in plane
   strain compression, which is different from Poisson's ratio in elastic
   stage) of rock specimen in plane strain compression. The influence of
   pore pressure on pattern of shear band and entire deformational
   characteristics was numerically investigated. In elastic stage, the
   adopted constitutive relation of rock was linear elastic. Beyond the
   peak stress, a composite Mohr-Coulomb criterion with tension cut-off was
   used and the post-peak constitutive relation was linear softening.
   Numerical results show that higher pore pressure leads to larger failure
   zone, steeper shear band's inclination closer to Arthur's predictions,
   lower peak stress, lower absolute values of axial, lateral and
   volumetric strains corresponding to the peak stress. Lower pore pressure
   has not an influence on the slopes of stress-axial strain curve and
   stress-lateral strain curve beyond the peak stress since the failure
   mode of the specimen is independent of pore pressure. However, for
   higher pore pressure, the number of failed elements is greatly
   increased, leading to less steep post-peak stress-axial strain curve and
   stress-lateral strain curve. For higher pore pressure, higher lateral
   deformation and higher calculated Poisson's ratio as well as negative
   volumetric strain can be reached at the same axial strain. No apparent
   difference in precursors to unstable failure of rock specimen is
   observed with an increase of pore pressure. In strain-softening stage,
   the slopes of lateral strain-axial strain curve, Poisson's ratio-axial
   strain curve and volumetric strain-axial strain curve are not influenced
   by pore pressure; owing to the apparent lateral expansion, the
   calculated Poisson's ratio can exceed 0.5, as is consistent with some
   experimental measurements.}},

Abstract = {{Tumour multiplicity is a frequently measured phenotype in animal studies
   of cancer biology. Poisson variation of this measurement represents a
   biological and statistical reference point that is usually violated,
   even in highly controlled experiments, owing to sources of variation in
   the stochastic process of tumour formation. A recent experiment on
   murine intestinal tumours presented conditions which seem to generate
   Poisson-distributed tumour counts. If valid, this would support a claim
   about mechanisms by which the adenomatous polyposis coli gene is
   inactivated during tumour initiation. In considering hypothesis testing
   strategies, model choice and Bayesian approaches, we quantify the
   positive evidence favouring Poisson variation in this experiment.
   Statistical techniques used include likelihood ratio testing, the Bayes
   and Akaike information criteria, negative binomial modelling, reversible
   jump Markov chain Monte Carlo methods and posterior predictive checking.
   The posterior approximation that is based on the Bayes information
   criterion is found to be quite accurate in this small n case-study.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: Data collected within the German nosocomial infection
   surveillance system KISS are recommended as reference data for judging
   flosocomial infection rates in German intensive care units (ICUS). It is
   unknown whether the KISS data tend to under- or overestimate the true
   infection incidence rates. In this article, methodological aspects of
   the SIR1 study on the incidence of nosocomial infections are discussed,
   with the aim of estimating unbiased incidence rates of nosocomial
   infections in interdisciplinary German ICUs and examining whether the
   KISS data are representative.
   Methods. We discuss the following methodological issues: 1) Sample size
   estimation. 2) Stratified random sampling of German ICUs. 3)
   Investigation of seasonal effects. 4) Statistical modeling of incidence
   rates using a negative binomial regression model. 5) Comparison of
   weighted incidence rates with the standardized rate ratio (SRR).
   Results. Random sampling proved difficult to realize in practice since
   many ICUs refused to participate, particularly those in small hospitals.
   Analysis was adjusted for hospital size. No seasonal trends were found
   in the KISS data. Due to marked differences between ICUs, the number of
   infections is over-dispersed compared to a Poisson model, so negative
   binomial regression was used. Fifty ICUs were observed for two
   consecutive months each, corresponding to 21,832 patient days, during
   which 262 infections occurred. Infections were more frequent in large
   hospitals. The incidence rates provided by the SIR study are on average
   (SRR) 1.89 (1.63-2.20) times as large as those estimated by the KISS
   system.
   Conclusion: For estimating nosocomial infection incidence rates, `random
   sampling and statistical modeling of over-dispersion were successfully
   performed. The study provides evidence that the KISS surveillance system
   tends to underestimate the true incidence rates of nosocomial infections
   in German ICUs.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, I have introduced the current status and outlook for the
   field of tree ring analysis research in Japan, including
   dendrochronology, dendroclimatology and environmentology. There was a
   time when the application of dendrochronology techniques, which are
   commonly used in research of tree ring analysis, was considered
   difficult due to the warm climate and high volume of precipitation in
   Japan. In recent years, there have been growing expectations for the
   application of these techniques, such as proposals for new concepts of
   dating in the area of archaeological age determination. In order to
   establish tree ring analysis research in Japan, it is essential that we
   investigate standardization functions applied to eliminating trend
   variations occurring with age from the tree ring time series, and
   functions applied to the calculation of minute variations resulting from
   environmental factors. In conjunction with this, the following examples
   have been proposed as potential projects for the future.
   1) Comparative study of proposed functions. 2) Construction of a
   cross-check system for dated samples obtained with these techniques. 3)
   Verification of the contribution ratio of environmental factors
   contributing to auxetic growth. 4) Construction of a database for

Abstract = {{This paper describes part of a research programme that sought to provide
   a lightweight material that could be applied for structural damping
   applications. In particular this paper describes the findings of a study
   into a range of novel visco-elastic, open-celled foam materials with
   either positive or negative Poisson's ratio (i.e. auxetic). It was
   hypothesised that auxetic materials may offer additional strain energy
   dissipating mechanisms, leading to more effective structural damping
   than that offered by the conventional constrained or free-layer
   technologies that use materials with a positive Poisson's ratio. The
   materials fabricated for this study were able to provide significant
   damping when applied to thin steel plate and it was shown that the
   Poisson's ratio can affect the levels of damping obtained. The
   structural damping advantages attributed to materials with both negative
   and positive Poisson's ratio are discussed together with the strain
   energy dissipating mechanisms considered to be invoked. The study showed
   that substantial structural damping could be attributable to changes in
   thickness resonant effects controlled by the through-plane wave velocity
   and the applied foam layer thickness. Peak (thickness effect) damping
   occurs at lambda/4 and odd multiples off lambda/4 (i.e. (2n+1)lambda/4)
   resonant frequencies and the Poisson's ratio is shown to control the
   through-plane wave velocity in this case. That in turn modifies the
   thickness resonant frequency and the frequency at which peak damping
   occurs but the actual level of peak damping remains the same. Thickness
   effect damping can be very efficient over a narrow band of frequencies
   but any weight advantages over conventional damping materials will
   depend very much on the frequency range for which damping is required.
   It is suggested that control of the Poisson's ratio may be beneficial in
   certain circumstances in allowing similar damping performance but in a
   thinner layer.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an analysis of the effect of temperature rise and
   hydrostatic pressure on microbending loss, refractive index change, and
   stress components of a double-coated optical fiber by considering
   coating material parameters such as Young's modulus and the Poisson
   ratio.
   It is shown that, when temperature rises, the microbending loss and
   refractive index changes would decrease with increase of thickness of
   primary coating layer and will increase after passing through a minima.
   Increase of thickness of secondary coating layer causes the microbending
   loss and refractive index changes to decrease.
   We have shown that the temperature rise affecting the fiber makes the
   microbending loss and refractive index decrease, linearly. At a
   particular temperature, the microbending loss takes negative values, due
   to tensile pressure applied on the fiber.
   The increase of Young's modulus and the Poisson ratio of primary coating
   would lower the microbending loss and refractive index change whereas in
   the secondary coating layer, the condition reverses. (c) 2007 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Extensive research is being devoted to the analysis and application of
   cellular solids for the design of structural components with superior
   mechanical properties and multifunctional characteristics. The chiral
   geometry in particular is an innovative configuration which features an
   in-plane negative Poisson's ratio which leads to a very high shear
   modulus, while maintaining some degree of compliance. This unique
   mechanical behavior can be exploited for the design of sandwich
   structures with a core composed of a macroscopic chiral truss, laid out
   across the thickness. This concept, also denoted as ``truss-core{''}, is
   applied for the design of two-dimensional airfoils with both static and
   dynamic morphing capabilities. A coupled-physics model, comprising
   simultaneous CFD and elastic analyses, is developed to investigate the
   influence of the chiral core on the aerodynamic behavior of an airfoil.
   The model, in particular, predicts the static deflection of the airfoil
   as a result of given flow conditions. The morphing capabilities of the
   airfoil, here quantified as camber changes, are evaluated for various
   design configurations of the core.}},

Abstract = {{Structures that can physically adapt to fulfill many roles can enable a
   new generation of high-performance military systems. The key to
   achieving substantial benefit from shape-changing operations is large
   changes in structural geometry and stiffness. In this study, we
   demonstrate variable stiffness cellular materials capable of large
   global changes in area through local buckling modes. Furthermore,
   stiffness properties and Poisson ratios may be tailored to provide
   desirable structural reconfiguration properties such as negative Poisson
   ratio and highly anisotropic stiffness. However, stiffness properties of
   cellular materials are two to three orders of magnitude below their
   constitutive materials properties. Their elastic properties can vary
   considerably as a function of the applied strain level due to the
   redistribution of structural material within the cells. Another
   complication is the difficulty in controlling the local buckling mode
   due to sensitivity to boundary conditions and loading conditions.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the authors explore various ways that designed chambering
   of elastomers can enhance electroactive polymer (EAP) actuation. Such
   enhancements include structuring of chambers for various mechanical
   functions and advantages, boosting of surface area of a polymer for
   enhanced ionic migration, construction of advanced electret foams for
   sensing and for tunable hydrophobicity for micro/pumping action, and
   distribution of composite EAP devices throughout the chambered elastomer
   to achieve discrete controllability of electroactive polymer actuators.
   The authors also discuss the chambering of EAP materials themselves for
   enhanced actuation effects.
   With varied design of the chambers of the elastomer, the mechanical and
   structural properties of the elastomer can be tuned to greatly enhance
   EAP actuation. The chambers can be designed in accordion-like bellows to
   achieve extreme elongation with low forces, in spiral geometries to
   effect negative or neutral poisson's ratio under actuation, and with
   embedded fluidic bellows for fluidic actuation or sensing. These are but
   a few examples of the advantages that can be achieved via designed
   chambering of elastomers.
   The authors also discuss various application uses of the described
   chambering technologies. Such chambered elastomers, combined with
   advanced muscle-like actuators, can substantially benefit facelike
   robots (useful for entertainment and education etc), prosthetics, and
   numerous modalities of bio-inspired locomotion. In the efforts of the
   authors to generate facial expression robots with low-power lightweight
   actuators is described.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper analytical and finite element (FE) simulations are carried
   out to calculate the in-plane Poisson's ratio and Young's moduli of a
   new centresymmetric honeycomb configuration under uniaxial loading.
   Opposite to similar re-entrant honeycomb structures studied in the past,
   the new re-entrant unit cell topology takes into account possible
   manufacturing constraints typical of production routes like Resin
   Transfer Moulding (RTM) or Rapid Prototyping (RP). The results obtained
   through the analytical and FE analysis show a significant decrease of
   the Poisson's ratio for the internal cell angle between -20 degrees and
   +20 degrees compared to the classical re-entrant configurations
   exhibited in literature. The results also show that the presence of edge
   corners in the unit cell honeycomb configuration gives rise to a
   cellular structure with enhanced flexibility compared to the classical
   centresymmetric one. The results obtained by the analytical model show
   good agreement with the Gibson and Ashby rib-bending model when the
   honeycomb configuration reduces to the theoretical layout without
   modifications due to manufacturing constraints. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Ubiquitous in nature and finding applications in engineering systems,
   cellular solids are an increasingly important class of materials. Foams
   are an important subclass of cellular solids with applications as
   packing materials and energy absorbers due to their unique properties. A
   better understanding of foam mechanical properties and their dependence
   on microstructural details would facilitate manufacture of tailored
   materials and development of constitutive models for their bulk
   response. Numerical simulation of these materials, while offering great
   promise toward furthering understanding, has also served to convincingly
   demonstrate the inherent complexity and associated modeling challenges.
   The large range of deformations which foams are subjected to in routine
   engineering applications is a fundamental source of complication in
   modeling the details of foam deformation on the scale of foam struts. It
   requires accurate handling of large material deformations and complex
   contact mechanics, both well established numerical challenges. A further
   complication is the replication of complex foam microstructure geometry
   in numerical simulations. Here various advantages of certain particle
   methods, in particular their compatibility with the determination of
   three-dimensional geometry via X-ray microtomography, are exploited to
   simulate the compression of ``real{''} foam microstructures into
   densification. With attention paid to representative volume element
   size, predictions are made regarding bulk response, dynamic effects, and
   deformed microstructural character, for real polymeric, open-cell foams.
   These predictions include a negative Poisson's ratio in the stress

Abstract = {{Recent measurements of electrical potentials on cartilage undergoing
   compression revealed the expected negative streaming potentials due to
   the presence of fixed negative charge in the cartilage matrix. However,
   these measurements also detected positive electric potentials extending
   into the external saline bath. We hypothesized that these positive
   potentials arise from convective displacement of mobile ions through an
   extended non-equilibrium double layer at the cartilage/bath interface.
   To examine this possibility, we developed a model of electrolyte
   transport across a charged membrane and examined the distribution of
   electric potential and mobile ion concentrations in response to forced
   convection. The extended Nernst-Planck and Poisson equations were solved
   numerically assuming the membrane to be infinitely permeable and
   infinitely stiff so that neither a streaming potential nor a
   deformation-induced diffusion potential could occur. First order
   solutions for forced convection of a mono-monovalent electrolyte through
   the membrane depicted an altered structure of the extended double layer
   and the creation of net interfacial electric charge densities with
   opposing polarity on opposite sides of the membrane. The model predicted
   an increase of the electric and concentration polarizations with
   increasing ratio of membrane fixed charge to bath ionic strength, but
   only up to a point of saturation. In this regime, the non-linear
   behavior of the equation system reveals modifications of the extended
   double layers inducing localized electric fields and ion concentration
   gradients in addition with those induced in the bulk of the membrane.
   This convection-induced interfacial polarization has not been previously
   studied in detail and could be an important controlling factor in
   several situations involving transport and electrokinetic phenomena
   through charged media. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Auxeticity is the result of internal structural degrees of freedom that
   get in the way of affine deformations. This paper proposes a new
   understanding of strains in disordered auxetic materials. A class of
   iso-auxetic structures is identified, which are auxetic structures that
   are also isostatic, and these are distinguished from conventional
   elasto-auxetic materials. It is then argued that the mechanisms that
   give rise to auxeticity are the same in both classes of materials and
   the implications of this observation on the equations that govern the
   strain are explored. Next, the compatibility conditions of Saint Venant
   are demonstrated to be irrelevant for the determination of stresses in
   iso-auxetic materials, which are governed by balance conditions alone.
   This leads to the conclusion that elasticity theory is not essential for
   the general description of auxetic behaviour. One consequence of this is
   that characterisation in terms of negative Poisson's ratio may be of
   limited utility.
   A new equation is then proposed for the dependence of the strain on
   local rotational and expansive fields. Central to the characterization
   of the geometry of the structure, to the iso-auxetic stress field
   equations, and to the strain-rotation relation is a specific fabric
   tensor. This tensor is defined here explicitly for two-dimensional
   systems, however, disordered. It is argued that, while the proposed
   dependence of the strain on the local rotational and expansive fields is
   common to all auxetic materials, iso-auxetic and elasto-auxetic
   materials may exhibit significantly different macroscopic behaviours.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials (i.e. materials with a negative Poisson's ratio)
   expand laterally when stretched and become thinner when compressed. This
   unusual yet very useful property arises from the way by which the nano

   auxetic (networked polymers) built from calix{[}4] arene building
   blocks. These calix{[} 4] arene subunits are connected in such a way
   that they mimic the shape of a ``folded macrostructure{''} which is
   known to exhibit auxetic behaviour. We confirm through force-field based
   simulations that these newly proposed networked polymers exhibit
   negative Poisson's ratios, the magnitudes of which can be changed by
   introducing slight variations in the molecular structure of these
   polymers. We also develop simple geometry-based models which explain the
   values of the Poisson's ratios obtained through the force-field based

   of structures, which deform in a controlled fashion ( e. g. deforming
   solely through hinging or stretching). Methods used for the analysis
   typically involve construction of real physical macro-models and/or
   derivation of analytical expressions for the mechanical properties. This
   paper proposes an alternative method for analysing such structures
   whereby idealised ``hinging{''} or ``stretching{''} structures are
   constructed within a molecular modelling environment using dummy atoms
   and examined using standard molecular mechanics techniques. We will show
   that this methodology of ``empirical modelling using dummy atoms{''}
   (EMUDA) successfully reproduces the known properties of 2D conventional
   and auxetic hexagonal honeycombs hence confirming the suitability of
   this technique for studying auxetic structures.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials and structures exhibit the unexpected behaviour of
   getting wider when stretched and thinner when compressed. This behaviour
   requires the structures ( the internal structure in the case of
   materials) to have geometric features, which must deform in a way that
   results in the structure expanding when stretched. This paper assesses
   the potential for auxetic behaviour of a novel class of two-dimensional
   periodic structures which can be described as ``connected stars{''} as
   they contain star-shaped units of different rotational symmetry which
   are connected together to form two-dimensional periodic structures.
   These structures will be studied through a technique based on
   force-field based methods ( the EMUDA technique) and it will be shown
   that some, but not all, of these structures can exhibit auxetic
   behaviour. An attempt is made to explain the reasons for the presence or
   absence of a negative Poisson's ratio in these systems.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of particle softness on the Poisson's ratio of model
   solids has been investigated. We have used the repulsive inverse power
   potential (similar to r(-n) for particle separations, r) between the
   particles, which is conveniently characterised by one adjustable
   parameter, epsilon = 1/n. For large epsilon, the interaction is soft
   whereas in the epsilon --> 0 limit the particles approach hard spheres.
   The pressure and elastic constants of the solid phase have been
   calculated at various densities with constant temperature molecular
   dynamics ( MD) simulation for a range of the softness parameter in the
   range, n >12. Density-softness surfaces of these quantities were
   determined which revealed hitherto unrecorded trends in the behaviour of
   the elastic moduli and Poisson's ratio. It was found that the pressure
   and some elastic properties, e. g. the C-12 elastic constant and the
   bulk modulus, manifest a maximum value or `ridge' on this surface. The
   height of the maximum increases with density and interaction steepness
   (small epsilon). The Poisson's ratio varies essentially linearly with
   softness and is relatively insensitive to density. However, at higher
   densities and for larger steepness a considerable lowering of the
   Poisson's ratio is observed. In order to identify possible mechanisms
   for reducing the value of Poisson's ratio, nu, the fluctuation and
   Born-Green contributions were analysed. Changes in the Poisson's ratio
   are mainly determined by the fluctuation contribution which can cause a
   considerable decrease as well as increase of its value.}},

Abstract = {{In this report, we investigate the physical and dynamical properties of
   model fluids whose constituent particles have their softness varied in a
   systematic manner. Molecular dynamics ( MD) computer simulation is
   applied to inverse power or soft-sphere fluids, in which the particles
   interact through the pair potential, phi(r) = epsilon(sigma/r)(n) where
   n measures the steepness or stiffness of the potential. We have
   investigated the properties of model fluids with 4 <= n <= n 1152 over a
   wide density range. Attention is paid to local structural properties,
   the elastic moduli and the transport coefficients ( principally the
   shear viscosity, eta(s) and self-diffusion coefficient, D). We note that
   this is the first time mechanical and transport coefficient data have
   been reported for n = 4: It was found that the Batschinski - Hildebrand
   expressions, in which D and eta(-1)(s) are assumed to have a linear
   dependence on the molar volume, represent the data quite well for all n.
   The density for which, on extrapolation, each of these quantities are
   zero, increases with the softness of the interaction (or similar to
   n(-1)), suggesting that the effective hard sphere diameter decreases
   with increasing softness in the small n limit. This treatment leads to
   simple empirical formulas for the effect of density ( in an intermediate
   range) and n on the two transport coefficients of these fluids. As n
   decreases so do the relative fluctuations in the pressure and force on a
   particle. The local coordination number as measured up to the first
   minimum in the radial distribution function does not increase
   significantly above similar or equal to 13 up to the co-existence
   packing fluid, even for the softest of particles (i:e: n = 4). If we
   assume that the effective hard sphere diameter is approximately the
   position of the first peak in the radial distribution function, the
   Stokes - Einstein expression reproduces the simulation data reasonably
   well, with the boundary condition being typically between the stick and
   slip limits, and approaching the latter with increasing density. For the
   softer particles and with increasing packing fraction, the shear
   viscosity increases more rapidly than the self-diffusion coefficient
   decreases. For the softer systems, the bulk viscosity is relatively low
   compared to the shear viscosity, in contrast to the trend for the
   corresponding infinite frequency moduli. The softer particles are more
   ``rubbery{''} in their response ( relatively high bulk modulus compared
   to the shear modulus), which leads us to conclude that auxetic behaviour
   is more likely to arise when the building units are quite hard.}},

Abstract = {{High frequency localized vibration modes for linear isotropic elastic

   The cases of a one integer parameter of thickness resonances (for a

   cross-section) are fully investigated. One-dimensional Hermite-type
   equations for the eigenmodes are derived and associated frequency shifts

   the same as that of the local group velocity calculated at the maximal

Abstract = {{Background: There are limited empirical data on the prevalence and
   incidence of orphanhood due to parental HIV infection.
   Objective: To assess the prevalence and incidence of orphanhood, and the
   population attributable fraction (PAF) of incident orphanhood associated
   with parental HIV infection, in a rural population with a 14.8\% adult
   HIV prevalence.
   Methods: The data are derived from a community cohort in Rakai District,
   Uganda. Census data were collected on all resident members in 10 657
   households, including survival of parents of resident children in
   1996/1997. Consenting adults were interviewed, provided blood for HIV
   testing, and were followed up 10 months later to determine parental
   death and incident orphanhood. The incidence rate ratio (IRR) of
   orphanhood associated with parental HIV-infection was estimated by
   Poisson multivariate regression.
   Results: A total of 22 712 children aged 0-14 years were enumerated in
   1996/1997. The overall prevalence of orphanhood was higher among
   children of HIV-infected parents (22.7\%) compared with children of
   uninfected parents, 7.9\%. The annual incidence of orphanhood was 8.2\%
   if at least one parent was HIV positive, and 0.5\% if both parents were
   HIV negative (adjusted IRR = 18.93). Older age of children, and older
   maternal age were significantly associated with an increased risk of
   orphanhood. The PAF of incident orphanhood due to parental HIV infection
   was 37.3\%, and was highest among younger children (adjusted PAF =
   50.6\% for 0-4 year olds), and children with younger mothers aged < 25
   years (adjusted PAF = 75.7\%).
   Conclusions: Parental HIV infection markedly increased the incidence of
   orphanhood, especially among younger children and the children of
   younger mothers. (c) 2005 Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins}},

Abstract = {{The present models used for the calculation of creep could not describe
   the behaviour of materials. Therefore a reliable, detailed and
   material-based simulation of the material behaviour under the load is
   not possible. In this article, some phenomenological models, which are
   based on the invariant theory and contain all three invariants of the
   stress tensor, for the description of 3D creep of non-reinforced
   thermoplastics are discussed.
   These models describe the combination of potentials depending on the
   sign of the first stress invariant. Depending on the selected model, the
   transition from negative to positive range could be continuous or
   continuously differentiable. For the negative first invariant range the
   material is assumed to be incompressible.
   The applicability of these models is studied by comparing the measured
   viscoelastic POISSON's ratio. It is shown that, for the application
   having at least two experimentally defined parameters, a wide range of
   material characteristics can be described.}},

   years and incidence rate ratios estimated by Poisson multivariate
   regression, with the non-pregnant or non-lactating women as the
   reference group. We also assessed the husbands of the married women to
   study male risk behaviours.
   Findings HIV incidence rates were 2.3 per 100 person years during
   pregnancy, 1.3 per 100 person years during breastfeeding, and 1.1 per
   100 person years in the non-pregnant and non-lactating women. The
   adjusted incidence rate ratios were 2.16 (95\% Cl 1 . 39-3.37) during
   pregnancy and 1 . 16 (0.82-1.63) during breastfeeding. Pregnant women
   and their male partners reported significantly fewer external sexual
   partners than did the other groups. in married pregnant women who had a
   sexual relationship with their male spouses, the HIV incidence rate
   ratio was 1.36 (0.63-2.93). in married pregnant women in HIV-discordant
   relationships (ie, with HIV-positive men) the incidence rate ratio was
   1.76 (0.62-4.03).
   Interpretation The risk of HIV acquisition rises during pregnancy. This
   change is unlikely to be due to sexual risk behaviours, but might be
   attributable to hormonal changes affecting the genital tract mucosa or
   immune responses. HIV prevention efforts are needed during pregnancy to
   protect mothers and their infants.}},

Abstract = {{We calculate the electronic and lattice properties of C6B2 (Na3As type
   crystal structure) using the first-principles molecular dynamics (FPMD)
   method. C6B2 is a hypothetical hexagonal compound, which consists of two
   B-C layers and two C-C layers. All calculated electronic band structures
   are metallic. C6B2 has unoccupied flat bands close to the Fermi level at
   the Gamma-A line. These flat bands correspond to unoccupied sigma-bands
   of MgB2 at the Gamma-A line. Displacements of B atoms along a B-C bond
   split unoccupied flat bands at the F-A line into two subbands. A total
   energy change with displacements of B atoms indicates anharmonicity of a
   B-C stretching mode. We investigate C6B2 under various compression
   conditions. The change in the electronic band structure under a, b-axis
   compression (P,,) is small. In contrast, it is quite remarkable under
   e-axis compression.(P-z). We find the lattice anomaly of C6B2 under a,
   b-axis compression. This anomaly shows a kind of negative Poisson

Title = {{Estimating treatment efficacy over time: a logistic regression model for

Abstract = {{This paper presents a case study in longitudinal data analysis where the
   goal is to estimate the efficacy of a new drug for treatment of a severe
   chronic constipation. Data consist of long sequences of binary outcomes
   (relief/no relief) on each of a large number of patients randomized to
   treatment (low and high dose) or placebo. Data characteristics indicate:
   (1) the treatment effects vary non-linearly with time; (2) there is
   substantial heterogeneity across subjects in their responses to
   treatment; and (3) there is a high proportion of subjects who never
   experience any relief (the non-responders).
   To overcome these challenges, we develop a hierarchical model for binary
   longitudinal data with a mixture distribution on the probability of
   response to account for the high frequency of non-responders. While the
   model is specified conditionally on subject-specific latent variables,
   we also draw inferences on key population-average parameters for the
   assessment of the treatments' efficacy in a population. In addition we
   employ a model-checking method to compare the goodness-of-fit for our
   model against simpler modelling approaches for aggregated counts, such
   as the zero-inflated Poisson and zero-inflated negative binomial models.
   We estimate subject-specific and population-average rate ratios of
   relief for the treatment with respect to the placebo as functions of
   time (RRt), and compare them with the rate ratios estimated from the
   models for aggregated counts. We find that: (1) the treatment is
   effective with respect to the placebo with higher efficacy at the
   beginning of the study; (2) the estimated rate ratios from the models
   for aggregated counts appear to be similar to the average across time of
   the population-average rate ratios estimated under our model; and (3)
   model-checking suggests that the hierarchical and zero-inflated negative
   binomial model fit the data best.
   If we are mainly interested to establish the overall efficacy (or
   safety) of a new drug, it is appropriate to aggregate the longitudinal
   data over time and analyse the count data by use of standard statistical
   methods. However, the models for aggregated counts cannot capture time
   trend of treatment such as the initial treatment benefit or the
   development of tolerance during the early stage of the treatment which
   may be important information to physicians to predict the treatment
   effects for their patients. Copyright (C) 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The change in the frequency of a rare mutant allele under constant
   sex-differentiated viability selection in an infinite, partial full-sib
   mating population is studied. The diplo-diploid and haplo-diploid
   polygynous models are considered with a Poisson distribution for the
   number of offspring produced by every mated female. Reproduction is
   followed by weak selection among the offspring and then mating to form
   the next generation. It is shown that the rate of change with respect to
   the frequency of the mutant allele and the intensity of selection can be
   expressed in terms of costs or benefits of substituting the mutant type
   for the wild type, which correspond to average excesses in viability in
   females and males, multiplied by coefficients of relatedness to the
   individuals affected by such a substitution and reproductive values
   associated to the sexes of these individuals. This reveals hidden
   interactions between mated individuals and between males for mating, the
   former having positive effects on the reproductive success of related
   individuals and the latter having negative effects. Such interactions
   are the result of reproductive constraints when a fixed proportion of
   females must mate with a male sib and all females are fertilized as long
   as one mate is available. However, they affect the change in allele
   frequency because there is inbreeding or relatedness between mates and
   more generally relatedness between interacting individuals.
   Surprisingly, the effects of these interactions cancel out in a diploid
   population when the number of offspring is large enough so that the
   possibility for a female to have no male sib to mate with can be
   neglected and the viability differences are the same in both sexes.}},

Abstract = {{The Brillouin light-scattering technique was used to investigate the
   single-crystal elastic properties of two aluminosilicate zeolites,
   natrolite (NAT) and analcime (ANA), at ambient conditions. An inversion
   of the acoustic velocity data results in the full set of elastic
   stiffness moduli (C-ij's) for both materials. From the single-crystal
   moduli the aggregate adiabatic bulk moduli (K-s), shear moduli (G), and
   Poisson's ratios (nu) were found to be K-s=48.5(1.0) GPa, G=31.6(1.0)
   GPa, and nu=0.232(5) for NAT, and K-s=59.8(1.2) GPa, G=32.1(1.0) GPa,
   and nu=0.272(5) for ANA (Voigt-Reuss-Hill averages). The bulk and shear
   moduli of both zeolites are relatively low compared with those of
   densely packed aluminosilicates, reflecting an open framework structure
   of (Al,SiO4) tetrahedra which is easily deformed by bending the Si-O-Al
   angles. As expected for a less dense crystal, NAT is softer and more
   compressible than ANA. An evaluation of the directional Young's moduli
   shows that the compressibility of NAT is nearly uniform along the
   {[}100] and {[}010] axes, while {[}001] is stiffer, in agreement with
   previous compression studies. We do not find experimental evidence of
   negative Poisson's ratios for NAT zeolites as predicted by recent

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Static tests and ultrasonic measurements (2.25 MHz) have been carried
   out on a series of composite laminates of glass fibres in a
   polypropylene matrix. A range of angle ply laminates were prepared for
   this study, with laminate angles theta of +/- 0, 10, 20, 30 and 40
   degrees. The high frequency measurements were made using the ultrasonic
   immersion technique, which allows the determination of a complete set of
   the elastic constants of a material. The relationship between the
   ultrasonically determined elastic constants of the angle ply laminates
   was found to be in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions, as
   previously validated for carbon fibre/epoxy angle ply laminates.
   A comparison between the ultrasonic and statically measured values was
   made for two of the angle ply laminates (theta = 0 and 20 degrees). It
   was found that the static values were lower than those measured at
   ultrasonic frequency, particularly those constants that were more matrix
   dominated (for example the transverse moduli of the laminates).
   Measurements on a pure polypropylene sample at both testing frequencies
   confirmed that the change in matrix properties with frequency was the
   cause of this difference. The change in properties with test frequency
   is likely to be much larger in this system than in other composite
   materials because the glass transition temperature of polypropylene is
   close to ambient temperature. Dynamic mechanical tests (1 Hz) were
   carried out on a sample of pure polypropylene to assess this effect. We
   also give an appropriate method of estimating the dependence of glass
   transition temperature on frequency. The results for polypropylene are
   compared with those for other commonly used polymer matrix materials:
   epoxy resin, nylon and polyetheretherketone (PEEK): DMTA measurements
   were also made on these samples.
   The effect of test frequency on matrix properties, for the glass/PP
   laminates, was further investigated by examining the relationship of the
   Poisson's ratios with laminate angle using a mixture of ultrasonic
   experiments and theoretical predictions. Previously we have shown that
   the degree of anisotropy between the reinforcing fibre and the matrix
   phase is paramount in determining whether the material will show a
   negative Poisson's ratio at a critical laminate angle. The ultrasonic
   measurements carried out in this study on the glass/PP laminates showed
   a minimum in one of the Poisson's ratio at a laminate angle of 32
   degrees, but the value did not become negative. However, theoretical
   predictions showed that for a static frequency measurement (1 Hz), where
   the matrix is softer and hence the anisotropy of each laminate ply is
   higher, the laminate will show a negative Poisson's ratio with a minimum
   at a laminate angle of around 28 degrees. (c) 2005 Springer Science +

   Poisson's ratio of film samples (15 x I x 1 mm) of 3 were measured in
   quasi-static tension using a video extensometer. For 3, the values of
   the Young's moduli (E) and Poisson's ratios W were similar between axes

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{There has been much recent interest in Bayesian inference for
   generalized additive and related models. The increasing popularity of
   Bayesian methods for these and other model classes is mainly caused by
   the introduction of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation
   techniques which allow realistic modeling of complex problems. This
   paper describes the capabilities of the free software package BayesX for
   estimating regression models with structured additive predictor based on
   MCMC inference. The program extends the capabilities of existing
   software for semiparametric regression included in S-PLUS, SAS, R or
   Stata. Many model classes well known from the literature are special
   cases of the models supported by BayesX. Examples are generalized
   additive ( mixed) models, dynamic models, varying coefficient models,
   geoadditive models, geographically weighted regression and models for
   space-time regression. BayesX supports the most common distributions for
   the response variable. For univariate responses these are Gaussian,
   Binomial, Poisson, Gamma, negative Binomial, zero inflated Poisson and
   zero inflated negative binomial. For multicategorical responses, both
   multinomial logit and probit models for unordered categories of the
   response as well as cumulative threshold models for ordered categories
   can be estimated. Moreover, BayesX allows the estimation of complex

Abstract = {{We present distribution functions and mark correlations of the shapes of
   massive dark matter halos derived from Hubble volume simulations of a
   Lambda CDM universe. We measure both position and velocity shapes within
   spheres that encompass a mean density 200 times the critical value and
   calibrate small-N systematic errors using Poisson realizations of
   isothermal spheres and higher resolution simulations. For halos more
   massive than 3 x 10(14) h(-1) M-circle dot, the shape distribution
   function peaks at (minor/major, intermediate/major) axial ratios of
   (0.64, 0.76) in position and is rounder in velocity, peaking at (0.72,
   0.82). Halo shapes are rounder at lower mass and/or redshift; the mean
   minor-axis ratio in position follows < c/a > (M,z) c(15,0){[}1-alpha In(
   M/10(15) h(-1) M-circle dot)](1+z)(-epsilon), with c(15,0) = 0.631 +/-
   0.001, alpha = 0.023 +/- 0.002, and epsilon = 0.086 +/- 0.004. Position
   and velocity principal axes are well aligned in direction, with median
   alignment angle 22 degrees, and the axial ratios in these spaces are
   correlated in magnitude. We investigate mark correlations of halo pair
   orientations using two measures: a simple scalar product shows >= 1\%
   alignment extending to 30 h(-1) Mpc, while a filamentary statistic
   exhibits nonrandom alignment extending to scales similar to 200 h(-1)
   Mpc, 10 times the sample two- point correlation length and well into the
   regime of negative two- point correlation. Shapes of cluster halos are
   little affected by the large-scale environment; the distribution of
   supercluster member minor-axis ratios differs from that of the general
   population at only the few percent level.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{123}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{Elastic constants and the Poisson ratio of the fcc hard-sphere
   crystalline phases, free of defects and with vacancies, are determined
   by two Monte Carlo methods: (i) the analysis of the box fluctuations in
   the constant pressure ensemble with variable box shape (N-P-T) and (ii)
   by the free-energy differentiation with respect to deformation in the
   fixed box ensemble (N-V-T). Very good agreement is observed for the
   extrapolated to the infinitely large system limit results of both the
   methods. The coefficients of the leading singularities of the elastic
   constants near close packing are estimated; they are well described by
   the free volume approximation. Two mechanisms influencing the Poisson
   ratio are studied. (i) It is shown that at high densities particle
   motions decrease the Poisson ratio with respect to the static case which
   corresponds to zero temperature. Simulations performed for systems of
   soft spheres, interacting through n-inverse-power potentials, r(-n),
   show that the elastic constants of the hard spheres can be obtained in
   the limit n ->infinity. When T -> 0 the elastic constants of the soft
   spheres tend to those of the static model. (ii) It is also shown that
   vacancies decrease C(11) and C(44) and increase C(12) and, hence,
   increase the Poisson ratio with respect to the defect-free state of the
   system. (c) 2005 American Institute of Physics.}},

Title = {{The burden of fractures in Brazil: A population-based study}},
Journal = {{BONE}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{261-266}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Introduction. The elderly population is growing fast worldwide, and
   therefore, investigation of health outcomes peculiar to these
   individuals is a public health priority nowadays. The decade between
   2000 and 2010 is denominated as the Bone and Joint Decade, and
   researchers are encouraged to quantity the burden of musculo-skeletal
   disorders worldwide. This is particularly relevant to developing
   countries. where the burden of these diseases is not well known. This
   Study aims to evaluate the prevalence of fractures (lifetime and
   previous year) and its association with socio-demographic variables and
   medical diagnosis of osteoporosis.
   Materials and methods. Population-based cross-sectional study including
   a multiple-stage sample of individuals aged 20 years or more living in
   Pelotas. a southern Brazilian city. Both the lifetime prevalence of
   fractures and the proportion of fractures in the year prior to the
   interview were investigated. Sex, age, skin color, socioeconomic level,
   schooling level and medical diagnosis of osteoporosis were used as
   independent variables. After descriptive and crude analyses, a Poisson
   regression was carried Out in order to provide prevalence ratios
   including adjustment for confounding.
   Results. The lifetime prevalence of fractures was 28.3\%, and 2.3\% of
   the individuals broke a bone in the year prior to the interview. Among
   men, most fractures were Caused by sports practice and happened in
   leisure-time outside home. Among women, most fractures occurred inside
   home and were caused by falls. The lifetime prevalence of fractures was
   positively associated with male sex and white or mixed skin color. The
   prevalence of fractures in the year prior to the inter-view was greater
   among poor individuals and those with a medical diagnosis of
   osteoporosis. Among all fractures happened in older adults (60 years or
   more) in the 12 months prior to the interview, 83.3\% were caused by
   falls.
   Conclusions. Data of this investigation might help policy makers to
   reduce the burden of fractures, particularly among women and older
   adults, by stimulating prevention against household falls and
   osteoporosis. Special attention should be given to the poorest
   individuals, who have a greater likelihood of developing several
   negative health outcomes and presented a higher risk of fractures in the
   present study. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To assess the role of sexually transmitted infection (STI)
   management to prevent HIV acquisition among sex workers in Burkina Faso.
   Design: Open cohort study of professional and nonprofessional sex
   workers with 3-month follow-up visits.
   Methods: Baseline and follow-up visits consisted of the administration
   of a behavioral questionnaire, education sessions on HIV and STIs, a
   medical examination, and laboratory testing for STI and HIV diagnosis.
   Results: Three hundred seventy-seven HIV-negative women were enrolled in
   the study. The cumulated HIV incidence was 3.2 per 100 person-years
   (Poisson 95\% confidence interval: 1.9-4.9). Bacterial and parasitic
   STIs were low at baseline, whereas herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2)
   prevalence was 54.7\%. By a Cox regression model, self-assessment of
   high HIV risk in the past, less than 5 clients per week, and no change
   of a steady partner were independently associated with HIV acquisition.
   Among STIs, only infection with HSV-2 tended to be associated with HIV
   acquisition (odds ratio = 2.45; P = 0.15). Overall, condom use increased
   during the study but to a lesser extent with steady partners.
   Conclusions: Bacterial and parasitic STIs are no longer a key
   determinant of HIV acquisition, given the current stage of the outbreak
   in Burkina Faso. Although efforts for STI control should be maintained,
   strategies should focus on nonprofessional sex workers, steady partners,
   and HSV-2 infection to tackle HIV transmission further in this high-risk
   group.}},

Abstract = {{A novel route for production of auxetic fibres has been adapted from
   conventional melt extrusion techniques. These fibres were reproduced,
   characterised and tested, for the first time, to assess the potential of
   auxetic fibres as reinforcements in composite materials. Initial
   experimental work has included the embedding of single fibres in
   modified epoxy resin. Auxetic fibre specimens were then compared with
   conventional fibre specimens through a specially designed fibre pullout
   testing procedure. The auxetic specimens displayed superior anchoring
   properties. The average maximum force at de-bonding of the auxetic
   fibres (0.95 N) was observed to be over 100\% higher than that for
   conventional ones (0.44 N) and the average energy required to fully
   extract the auxetic fibre from the modified resin was 8.3 mJ while the
   conventional fibre required only 2.5 mJ on average. The results indicate
   that composites employing auxetic fibres as the reinforcement phase will
   exhibit enhanced resistance to failure due to fibre pullout. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{The synthesis and biological evaluation of
   perricillamine(6)-5-tert-butylproline(7)-oxytocin analogs and comparison
   with their proline(7)-oxytocin counterparts has led to the discovery of
   two potent oxytocin (OT) antagonists: {[}dPen(1),Pen(6)]-oxytocin (1,
   pA(2) = 8.22, EC50 - 6.0 nm) and {[}dPen(1),Pen(6),5-tBuPro(7)]-oxytocin
   (2, pA(2) = 8.19, EC50 = 6.5 nM). In an attempt to understand the
   conformational requirements for their biological activity, spectroscopic
   analyses of 1 and 2 were perfonned using H-1 NMR, laser Raman and CD
   techniques. In H2O, oxytocin analogs 1 and 2 exhibited cis-isomer
   populations of 7\% and 35\%, respectively. Measurement of the amide
   proton temperature coefficients revealed solvent shielded hydrogens for
   Gin(4) and Pen6 in the major trans-conformer of 1 as well as for Gln(4)
   in the minor cis-conformer of 2. Few long-distance NOES were observed,
   suggesting conformational averaging for analogs 1 and 2 in water;
   moreover, a lower barrier (16.6 +/- 0.2 kcal/mol) for isomerization of
   the amide N-terminal to 5-tBuPro(7) relative to OT was calculated from
   measuring the coalescence temperature of the GlY(9) backbone Nit signals
   in the NMR spectra of 2. Observed bands in the Raman spectra of 1 and 2
   correspond to C-beta-S-S-C-beta dihedral angles of +110-115 degrees and
   90 degrees, respectively. In water, acetonitrile and methanol, the CD
   spectra for 1 xhibited a positive maximum around 236-239 nm; in
   trifluoroethanol, the spectra shifted and a negative maximum was
   observed at 240 nm. The CID spectra of 2 were unaffected by solvent
   changes and exhibited a negative maximum at 236-239 nm. The CID and
   Raman data both suggested that a conformation having a right-handed
   screw sense about the disuffide and a chi(CS-SC) dihedral angle value
   close to 115 degrees was favored for analog 1 in water, methanol and
   acetonitrile, but not trifluoroethanol, where a +/- 90 degrees angle was
   favored. Analog 2 was more resilient to conformational change about the
   disuffide, and adopted a preferred disuffide geometry corresponding to a
   +/- 90 degrees chi(CS-SC) dihedral angle. Monte Carlo conformational
   analysis of analogs 1 and 2 using distance restraints derived from NMR
   spectroscopy revealed two prominent conformational minima for analog 1
   with disultide geometries around + 114 degrees and + 116 degrees.
   Similar analysis of analog 2 revealed one conformational minimum with a
   disuffide geometry around + 104'. In sum, the conformation about the
   disuffide in {[}dPen(1),Pen(6)]-OT (1) was shown to be contingent on
   environment and in TFE, adopted a geometry similar to that of
   {[}dPen(1), Pen(6),5- tBuPro(7)]-OT (2) which appeared to be stabilized
   by hydrophobic interactions between the 5-tBuPro(7) (5R)-tert-butyl
   group, the Len(8) isopropyl sidechain and the Pen(6)beta-methyl
   substituents. In light of the conformational rigidity of 2 about the
   disultide bond, and the similar geometry adopted by 1 in TFE, a S-S
   dihedral angle close to +110 degrees may be a prerequisite for their
   binding at the receptor. Copyright (c) 2005 European Peptide Society and

Abstract = {{Ultrasonic technique was used for the mechanical characterization of two

   wave velocity method using longitudinal and shear waves. The
   corresponding technical constants (Young's modulus, shear modulus and
   Poisson's ratios) were calculated from the stiffness matrix. For the
   Young's modulus, comparison was made with conventional four point
   bending test. Negative Poisson's ratios were calculated from ultrasonic
   data. The anisotropy of particleboard was determined with ultrasonic

Abstract = {{We present and analyse two implicit methods for Ito stochastic
   differential equations (SDEs) with Poisson-driven jumps. The first
   method, SSBE, is a split-step extension of the backward Euler method.
   The second method, CSSBE, arises from the introduction of a compensated,
   martingale, form of the Poisson process. We show that both methods are
   amenable to rigorous analysis when a one-sided Lipschitz condition,
   rather than a more restrictive global Lipschitz condition, holds for the
   drift. Our analysis covers strong convergence and nonlinear stability.
   We prove that both methods give strong convergence when the drift
   coefficient is one-sided Lipschitz and the diffusion and jump
   coefficients are globally Lipschitz. On the way to proving these
   results, we show that a compensated form of the Euler-Maruyama method
   converges strongly when the SDE coefficients satisfy a local Lipschitz
   condition and the pth moment of the exact and numerical solution are
   bounded for some p > 2. Under our assumptions, both SSBE and CSSBE give
   well-defined, unique solutions for sufficiently small stepsizes, and
   SSBE has the advantage that the restriction is independent of the jump
   intensity. We also study the ability of the methods to reproduce
   exponential mean-square stability in the case where the drift has a
   negative one-sided Lipschitz constant. This work extends the
   deterministic nonlinear stability theory in numerical analysis. We find
   that SSBE preserves stability under a stepsize constraint that is
   independent of the initial data. CSSBE satisfies an even stronger
   condition, and gives a generalization of B-stability. Finally, we
   specialize to a linear test problem and show that CSSBE has a natural
   extension of deterministic A-stability. The difference in stability
   properties of the SSBE and CSSBE methods emphasizes that the addition of
   a jump term has a significant effect that cannot be deduced directly
   from the non-jump literature.}},

Title = {{Selecting a distributional assumption for modelling relative densities

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL MODELLING}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{185}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{1-12}},

Abstract = {{The selection of a distributional assumption suitable for modelling
   macroinvertebrate density data is typically challenging.
   Macroinvertebrate data often exhibit substantially larger variances than
   expected under a standard count assumption, that of the Poisson
   distribution. Such overdispersion may derive from multiple sources,
   including heterogeneity of habitat (historically and spatially),
   differing life histories for organisms collected within a single
   collection in space and time, and autocorrelation. Taken to extreme,
   heterogeneity of habitat may be argued to explain the frequent large
   proportions of zero observations in macroinvertebrate data. Sampling
   locations may consist of habitats defined qualitatively as either
   suitable or unsuitable. The former category may yield random or
   stochastic zeroes and the latter structural zeroes. Heterogeneity among
   counts may be accommodated by treating the count mean itself as a random
   variable, while extra zeroes may be accommodated using zero-modified
   count assumptions, including zero-inflated and two-stage (or hurdle)
   approaches. These and linear assumptions (following log- and square
   root-transformations) were evaluated using 9 years of mayfly density
   data from a 52km, ninth-order reach of the Upper Mississippi River
   (n=959). The data exhibited substantial overdispersion relative to that
   expected under a Poisson assumption (i.e. variance:mean ratio= 23 >> 1),
   and 43\% of the sampling locations yielded zero mayflies. Based on the
   Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), count models were improved most by
   treating the count mean as a random variable (via a Poisson-gamma
   distributional assumption) and secondarily by zero modification (i.e.
   improvements in AIC values = 9184 units and 47-48 units, respectively).
   Zeroes were underestimated by the Poisson, log-transform and square
   root-transform models, slightly by the standard negative binomial model
   but not by the zero-modified models (61\%, 24\%, 32\%, 7\%, and 0\%,
   respectively). However, the zero-modified Poisson models underestimated
   small counts (1 <= y <= 4) and overestimated intermediate counts (7 <= y
   <= 23). Counts greater than zero were estimated well by zero-modified
   negative binomial models, while counts greater than one were also
   estimated well by the standard negative binomial model. Based on AIC and
   percent zero estimation criteria, the two-stage and zero-inflated models
   performed similarly. The above inferences were largely confirmed when
   the models were used to predict values from a separate, evaluation data
   set (n = 110). An exception was that, using the evaluation data set, the
   standard negative binomial model appeared superior to its zero-modified
   counterparts using the AIC (but not percent zero criteria). This and
   other evidence suggest that a negative binomial distributional
   assumption should be routinely considered when modelling benthic
   macroinvertebrate data from low flow environments. Whether negative
   binomial models should themselves be routinely examined for extra zeroes
   requires, from a statistical perspective, more investigation. However,
   this question may best be answered by ecological arguments that may be
   specific to the sampled species and locations. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Count data models are established to overcome the shortcommg of linear

   ones. The study applies to nonhome based trips at household level to
   perform efficient analysis on count data. The Poisson model with an
   assumption of equidispersion has frequently been used to analyze count
   data. However, if the variance of data is greater than the mean, the
   Poisson model tends to underestimate errors, resulting in problem in
   reliability. Excess zeros in data result in heterogeneity leading to
   biased coefficient estimates for the models. The negative binomial model
   and the modified count data models are established to consider
   overdispersion and heterogeneity to improve the reliability. The optimal
   model is chosen through Vuong test. Model reliability is also checked by

Abstract = {{Although Cox proportional hazards regression is the default analysis for
   time to event data, there is typically uncertainty about whether the
   effects of a predictor are more appropriately characterized by a
   multiplicative or additive model. To accommodate this uncertainty, we
   place a model selection prior on the coefficients in an
   additive-multiplicative hazards model. This prior assigns positive
   probability, not only to the model that has both additive and
   multiplicative effects for each predictor, but also to sub-models
   corresponding to no association, to only additive effects, and to only
   proportional effects. The additive component of the model is constrained
   to ensure non-negative hazards, a condition often violated by current
   methods. After augmenting the data with Poisson latent variables, the
   prior is conditionally conjugate, and posterior computation can proceed
   via an efficient Gibbs sampling algorithm. Simulation study results are
   presented, and the methodology is illustrated using data from the

Abstract = {{The structural variations with pressure in alpha-cristobalite, a

   first-principles calculations using the projector-augmentcd-wave (PAW)

   We provide theoretical ab initio results for the volume compressibility
   and a complete set of independent elastic constants of cristobalite
   under hydrostatic pressures up to 10-15 GPa. Our calculated structural
   and elastic properties under pressure are in good agreement with the
   experimental data. In addition, the corresponding results of the
   molecular-dynamics simulations with the interatomic potential are also
   presented for comparison. The dominant mechanism of compression is the
   reduction of the Si-O-Si angles within the alpha-cristobalite structure,
   whereas the SiO4 tetrahedron undergoes only a slight distortion.
   alpha-Cristobalite is more compressible than other SiO2 polymorphs as
   shown by their volume compressibilities, because of its characteristic
   framework structure similar to re-entrant honeycombs. With increasing
   pressure, the rotational motions of the rigid SiO4 tetrahedra play an
   important role in the compressive behavior of cristobalite. The present
   simulations confirm that the system undergoes transformation from
   auxetic to non-auxetic under hydrostatic pressure of ca. 2 GPa, while
   retaining strong elastic anisotropy.}},

   METHODS: Poisson and negative binomial regression, with exposure time
   represented by cumulative training days for each horse, were used to
   relate explanatory variables to the incidence rate (IR) of cases of
   inflammation of the SDFT (n=51), and injuries involving the SA (n=48) in
   a population of 1,571 commercially-trained racehorses over 554,745 study
   days. Only the first occurrence of an injury for any one horse was
   eligible for inclusion. Separate analyses were run for data from horses
   in training regardless of whether they had started in a trial or race,
   and using a subset of these data restricted to those preparations
   associated with at least one start in a trial or race. Results were
   reported as incidence rate ratios (IRR) and 95\% confidence intervals
   (CI).
   RESULTS: Male horses had a higher risk of injury to the SA (IRR 2.57;
   p=0.005) and tended to have a higher risk of injury to the SDFT (IRR
   1.74; p=0.09) than female horses. Increasing age was associated with
   increased risk of injury. Horses aged 4 and >= 5 years were 6.76 (p <
   0.001) and 15.26 (p < 0.001) times more likely to incur injury to the
   SDFT, and 2.91 (p=0.02) and 3.54 (p=0.005) times more likely to incur
   injury to the SA, respectively, than 2-year-olds. Horses were more
   likely to suffer an injury to the SDFT or SA in a training preparation
   that was not associated with any starts in official trials or races
   compared with those preparations that were associated with more than one
   start (p < 0.001), and more likely to injure the SA compared with
   preparations containing one start (p=0.03). The IR of injury to the SDFT
   tended to be lower between November-January (IRR 0.78; p=0.08) and
   February-April (IRR 0.75; p=0.08) compared with August-October.
   Incidence of injury to the SDFT or SA was not associated with the
   cumulative distance raced in the last 30 days of a training preparation.
   CONCLUSION: This study identified risk factors for injury to the SDFT
   and SA in Thoroughbred racehorses in New Zealand. Injuries were more
   likely in males, older horses and in horses in training preparations
   without any starts. There was no evidence of association between injury
   and cumulative high-speed exercise.}},

Abstract = {{It is now almost 100 years since Hugh Campbell Ross began his
   experiments on white blood cells and cancer. By suspending peripheral
   blood cells in a solution of agar gel, he was able to observe changes in
   them provoked by various natural and artificial substances, which he
   named auxetics, kinetics, or augmentors, depending on the effects they
   produced. After his early experience he focused his attention
   particularly on lymphocytes in peripheral blood samples; he claimed to
   have observed rapid division in them, although at that time they were
   looked upon as end cells without a future. He contended that his results
   challenged what had become the orthodox view of the role of the nucleus
   in mitosis, asserting that cytologists had been led astray by relying on
   examination of fixed, dead structures. When doubt was cast on his claim
   to have induced cell division, his brother Ronald, Nobel laureate in
   physiology or medicine, came to his defense, but to no avail, and
   although he continued his experiments for a number of years they were
   quietly forgotten. Fifty years later the occurrence of mitotic division
   of peripheral blood lymphocytes was established beyond any doubt by
   Nowell and Hirschhorn.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper a concept of hexagonal chiral honeycomb is proposed as a
   truss-like internal structure for adaptive wing box configurations. In
   contrast with classical centresymmetric cellular structures like
   rectangular or hexagonal grids, the proposed honeycomb did not present
   inversion symmetry, and featured an in-plane negative Poisson's ratio
   behaviour. The cellular structure considered exhibited this Poisson's
   ratio behaviour under a large range of strain. A set of numerical
   (finite element, FE) simulations have been carried out in order to
   correct the initial theoretical predictions to take into account axial,
   shear and elastic deformations of all elements composing the unit cell
   when subjected to uniaxial loading. The homogenized linear elastic
   mechanical properties were then introduced in an FE wing box model of a
   racecar wing coupled to a panel code to simulate unidirectional static
   fluid-structure coupling between the wing box and the flow surrounding
   the airfoil. The cellular solid proposed as the internal layout of the
   wing box allowed conforming deformations with the external flow, giving
   a variation of the camber line and trailing edge displacement, and
   acting as an aileron.}},

Abstract = {{Materials with a negative Poisson's ratio have been modelled largely by
   regular 2D networks. These models represent the conceptual features of
   the microscale of materials with a negative Poisson's ratio. To date
   they do not reflect the detail or exact structure of any known auxetic
   material. In this paper, 2D materials have been constructed whose
   microstructure is represented exactly by the auxetic models. These
   materials are subjected to an axial strain and the measured Poisson's
   ratio is compared to the predictions by the models. The models are also
   amended to fit better the observed deformation within the 2D materials.
   The models are found to predict some behaviour reasonably well but only

Abstract = {{Introduction: Eye anomalies, including anophthalmos and microplithalmos
   (absent eye and small eye), are common features in congenital infection
   syndromes such as rubella. Influenza, Coxsackie virus, and Parvovirus
   are less well-established teratogens. We report an ecologic analysis of
   anophthalmia/microphthalmia prevalence in England in relation to
   temporal variation in these infections using routine infection data.
   Methods: The national (England) anophthalmos/microphthalmos register
   holds details of 406 babies (excluding chromosomal anomalies) born
   1988-1994. Weekly infection data were obtained from the U.K. Public
   Health Laboratory Service and Royal College of General Practitioners
   Weekly Returns Service. We assigned cases and births an estimated
   exposure based on the population infection counts in the gestational
   weeks known to be critical for ocular development. We calculated the
   rate ratio of anophthalmos/microphthalmos prevalence for infection in
   the 90th percentile compared with the 10th percentile by Poisson
   regression.
   Results: There was a positive association between severe
   anophthalmos/microplithalmos prevalence and Parvovirus B19 (rate ratio =
   1.26; 95\% confidence interval = 1.00-1.58) and for influenza (1.41;
   1.08-1.84). Coxsackie virus showed a negative association with any
   anophthalmos/microphthalmos (0.75; 0.58-0.98) and with severe cases
   (0.66; 0.46-0.95).
   Conclusions: This analysis provides suggestive evidence for a
   teratogenic role of influenza and Parvovirus in
   anophthalmos/microphthalmos. The role of maternal infections in
   congenital anomaly etiology is worthy of further investigation.}},

   the effect of soaking soft porous solids in magneto or

Abstract = {{A model is designed for predicting the elastic constants of a random
   planar network of interconnected fibres while accounting for two
   features of such networks: negative Poisson ratio behaviour and random
   triangulation. The model is based on a periodic network involving both
   plates and fibres segments, with possibility of reentrant cell shapes.
   The plates are intended to represent the effect of triangulation. Bounds
   for the elastic constants are obtained by calculating volume weighted
   averages of the elastic properties for periodic networks characterised
   by a uniform distribution of in-plane fibre orientations. Predictions
   are derived for the dependence of the in-plane Young's modulus,
   out-of-plane Young's modulus, and in-plane shear modulus on out-of-plane
   fibre orientation for a fibre volume fraction of 0.20. These predictions
   are assessed by reference to experimental results for transversely
   isotropic networks, with very low average out-of-plane fibre
   orientation, made by sintering compressed mats of stainless steel
   fibres. A comparison is also made with the predictions of a model for
   truss lattice core, which is liable to represent the case of a fully
   triangulated network. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{One method for producing synthetic auxetic materials is starting with
   polymer powders and using a combination of compaction, sintering, and
   extrusion. This article presents a novel variation on this route,
   omitting the extrusion stage and generating the required microstructure
   by compaction followed by multiple sintering. The effects of single,
   double, and quadruple sintering on compacted cylinders are examined in
   terms of a detailed microstructural examination, study of density and
   dimensional variations, and measurement of Poisson's ratio. The best
   results were obtained by compaction followed by double sintering,
   resulting in a strain dependent Poisson's ratio as low as v = -0.32.
   This new technique has great potential for increasing the range of
   geometries that can be fabricated and is very akin to ceramic sintering
   techniques. (c) 2005 Society of Plastics Engineers.}},

Volume = {{46}},

Pages = {{195-224}},

Abstract = {{We consider estimation in the class of first order conditional linear
   autoregressive models with discrete support that are routinely used to
   model time series of counts. Various groups of estimators proposed in
   the literature are discussed: moment-based estimators; regression-based
   estimators; and likelihood-based estimators. Some of these have been
   used previously and others not. In particular, we address the
   performance of new types of generalized method of moments estimators and
   propose an exact maximum likelihood procedure valid for a Poisson
   marginal model using backcasting. The small sample properties of all
   estimators are comprehensively analyzed using simulation. Three
   situations are considered using data generated with: a fixed
   autoregressive parameter and equidispersed Poisson innovations; negative
   binomial innovations; and, additionally, a random autoregressive
   coefficient. The first set of experiments indicates that bias correction
   methods, not hitherto used in this context to our knowledge, are
   sometimes needed and that likelihood-based estimators, as might be
   expected, perform well. The second two scenarios are representative of
   overdispersion. Methods designed specifically for the Poisson context
   now perform uniformly badly, but simple, bias-corrected, Yule-Walker and
   least squares estimators perform well in all cases.}},

Abstract = {{Professor Lakes created foams with negative Poisson's ratio:; in 1987.
   Since then he has examined interesting and fantastic characteristics of
   such foams and proposed their realistic and future possible
   applications. The present study was motivated by our interest in how
   such a foam behaves for a sudden loading if it is saturated with fluid.
   To highlight mechanical interactions between elastic deformation of such
   a foam and diffusion of the saturating fluid, we solved four problems in
   a unified manner: 2D and 3D, Cryer and Mandel problems. It is found that
   for all these problems the pore fluid pressure near the sample center
   climbs up from its initial pressure and then declines and vanishes; its
   peak is much higher for negative Poisson's ratios, that is, much more
   remarkable Mandel-Cryer effect. Stress components such as tangential
   stress also show similar behavior, and the tangential stress has tension
   near the sample surface in spite of compressive loading. It is also
   found that for the step-like axial compression the Mandel cylinder
   sample laterally expands immediately after the loading, then shrinks and
   finally becomes thinner than its original thickness; a possible
   application is proposed.}},

Abstract = {{Analytical and Molecular Mechanics methods have been used to study the
   structure and deformation mechanisms acting at the molecular level in
   the auxetic polymorph of crystalline silica (alpha-cristobalite). The
   Molecular Mechanics simulations indicate a stress-induced phase
   transition from alpha-cristobalite to `ordered' beta-cristobalite occurs
   for uniaxial loading along the x(2) direction. This is in reasonable
   agreement with the previous prediction from an analytical model assuming
   deformation is by concurrent dilation and cooperative rotation (about
   axes in the x(1)-x(2), plane, passing through the midpoints of opposing
   edges - the alpha-axes) of the SiO4 tetrahedral molecular sub-units,
   previously shown to predict the Poisson's ratio for loading in the),
   direction. The analytical models have been extended to include
   cooperative rotation of each tetrahedron about its axis (the c-axis)
   mostly closely aligned with the principal unit-cell x(3)-axis. The new
   models enable significantly improved prediction of the Poisson's ratios
   of (alpha-cristobalite when loaded in one of the transverse (x(1) or
   x(2)) directions. Parametric fitting of the analytical models indicate
   that the deformation mechanism for transverse uniaxial loading of
   alpha-cristobalite is by concurrent dilation and cooperative rotation
   about the local a and c-axes of the SiO4, tetrahedra. (c) 2005 WILEY-VCH

Abstract = {{Based on a number of experimental studies, we propose to consider how
   elastic interactions between a crystal and its surroundings change
   crystal growing conditions. To aim to do this, we analyze the influence
   of some nonequilibrium modification of the Gibbs-Thomson thermodynamic
   condition, prescribed at the crystal boundary, on some properties of a
   kinetic model of protein crystal growth in a mass-convection regime.
   Next, to draw the physical picture more realistically, we study the
   influence of a certain stochastic perturbation on the crystal growth
   rate. To fulfill the task we apply the description of crystal growth in
   terms of nonequilibrium thermodynamics at a mesoscopic level. The
   proposed model offers a quite comprehensive picture of the formation of
   modem organic crystalline materials such as non-Kossel crystals. (c)

Abstract = {{The auxetic foams first produced by Lakes have been modelled in a
   variety of ways, each model trying to reproduce some observed feature of
   the microscale of the foams. Such features include bent or broken ribs
   or inverted angles between ribs. These models can reproduce the
   Poisson's ratio or Poisson's function of auxetic foam if the model
   parameters are carefully chosen. However these model parameters may not
   actually reflect the internal structure of the foams. A big problem is
   that measurement of parameters such as lengths and angles is not
   straightforward within a 3-d sample. In this work a sample of auxetic
   foam has been imaged by 3-d X-ray computed tomography. The resulting
   image is translated to a form that emphasises the geometrical structure
   of connected ribs. This connected rib data are suitably analysed to
   describe both the microstructural construction of auxetic foams and the
   statistical spread of structure, that is, the heterogeneity of an
   auxetic foam. From the analysis of the microstructure, observations are
   made about the requirements for microstructural models and comparisons
   made to previous existing models. From the statistical data, measures of
   heterogeneity are made that will help with future modelling that
   includes the heterogeneous aspect of auxetic foams. (c) 2005 WILEY-VCH

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials exhibit the unexpected feature of becoming fatter when
   stretched and narrower when compressed, in other words, they exhibit a
   negative Poisson's ratio. This counter-intuitive behaviour imparts many
   beneficial effects on the material's macroscopic properties that make
   auxetics superior to conventional materials in many commercial
   applications. Recent research suggests that auxetic behaviour generally
   results from a cooperative effect between the material's internal
   structure (geometry setup) and the deformation mechanism it undergoes
   when submitted to a stress. Auxetic behaviour is also known to be
   scale-independent, and thus, the same geometry/deformation mechanism may
   operate at the macro-, micro- and nano- (molecular) level. A
   considerable amount of research has been focused on the `re-entrant
   honeycomb structure' which exhibits auxetic behaviour if deformed
   through hinging at the joints or flexure of the ribs, and it was
   proposed that this `re-entrant' geometry plays an important role in
   generating auxetic behaviour in various forms of materials ranging from
   nanostructured polymers to foams. This paper discusses an alternative
   mode of deformation involving `rotating rigid units' which also results
   in negative Poisson's ratios. In its most ideal form, this mechanism may
   be constructed in two dimensions using `rigid polygons' connected
   together through hinges at their vertices. On application of uniaxial
   loads, these `rigid polygons' rotate with respect to each other to form
   a more open structure hence giving rise to a negative Poisson's ratio.
   This paper also discusses the role that,rotating rigid units' are
   thought to have in various classes of materials to give rise to negative
   Poisson's ratios. (c) 2005 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH A Co. KGaA, Weinheim.}},

Abstract = {{Polymers containing para-quaterphenyl rods laterally attached to the
   polymer main chain have been synthesized. The molecular design choices
   which led to use of the quaterphenyl rod to achieve auxetic response
   will be discussed. Preparative chemistry of the monomers will be
   described along with the details of the polymerization reaction. Both
   polyethers and polyesters were prepared. The length of the flexible
   alkyl main chains which link the rods plays an important role in
   determining whether the resulting polymers will exhibit liquid
   crystallinity. Polymers with longer alkyl links exhibit nematic liquid
   crystallinity and the rods appear to have their long axes oriented
   roughly parallel and along the main chain direction. X-ray scattering
   experiments were performed on the polymers both in the quiescent
   (unstretched) and the stretched states. Results from these experiments
   suggest that, under tensile strain, site connectivity driven
   rod-reorientation occurs in these materials giving rise to an increase
   in the interchain distance for these polymers. This increase in the
   interchain separation is consistent with our concept of a molecular
   level auxetic mechanism for this type of designed polymer. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{We have studied thermal expansion and contraction of polystyrene thin
   film supported on silicon substrate using X-ray reflectivity and
   inelastic neutron scattering techniques. In annealing experiments, we
   found fast and very slow contraction processes in the thin films above
   the glass transition temperature. The fast one was attributed to normal
   relaxation (annealing) process observed in bulk and responsible partly
   for the reported apparent negative expansivity. In addition, we found
   extremely slow re-expansion process in the glassy state. The ultra-slow
   contraction and re-expansion have been assigned to the lateral expansion
   and contraction of the film, respectively. Using well-annealed films, we
   have evaluated thermal expansivity as a function of film thickness, and
   found that it decreases with film thickness in a thickness range below
   twice of radius of gyration of a polymer chain 2R(g), in the glassy
   state. The decrease has been attributed to hardening of harmonic force
   constant due to confinement in a thin film. This idea was confirmed in
   the inelastic neutron scattering measurements. (c) 2005 WILEY-VCH Verlag

Abstract = {{The elastic properties of cristobalite and quartz, the typical
   polymorphs of SiO2, are studied with particular emphasis on the
   structural phase transition and the high-temperature phase. Using the
   equilibrium molecular dynamics (MD) method with a stress-fluctuation
   formula, we have successfully evaluated the adiabatic elastic constants
   (C-ij) of both cristobalite and quartz in a wide temperature range,
   including the alpha-beta phase-transition region. In the results for
   cristobalite, the anomalous property of a negative Poisson's ratio
   appears over the entire temperature range of 300-1800 K, where the bulk
   modulus is extremely low compared with the shear modulus. However, the
   mechanisms differ between the alpha- and beta phases, according to the
   structural data obtained from the MD simulations. On the other hand,
   quartz exhibits a negative Poisson's ratio in the narrow temperature
   region between ca. 750 and 825 K before the phase transition occurs.
   After the transition to the beta-phase, the bulk modulus is shown to
   increase sharply, and a positive value of Poisson's ratio is recovered.
   For cristobalite as well as quartz, we have confirmed that the recovery
   of bulk C-ij's in the beta-phase can be attributed to internal
   relaxations, which arise from the cooperative motions of corner-linked
   SiO4, tetrahedra. (c) 2005 WILEYNCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA, Weinheim.}},

Abstract = {{Monte Carlo simulations of two three-dimensional hard-body models, hard
   dimers and hard cyclic trimers, were performed in the NpT ensemble. The
   Poisson's ratio was determined for degenerate crystalline phases in both
   systems. In contrast to the results of analogous simulations in
   two-dimensions, positive values were obtained both for the dimers and
   the trimers. However, the Poisson's ratio of the trimers was lower than
   that for the dimers and the latter was lower than that for the spheres.
   This suggests that a negative Poisson's ratio may be obtained for
   molecules composed of more spheres. (c) 2005 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \&

Abstract = {{The first auxetic fibre was successfully produced in polypropylene using
   a novel melt-spinning route. These fibres were extruded at 159 degrees C
   with a screw speed 10 rpm (1.05 rad s(-1)) and 2 mpm (0.03 in s(-1))
   take-up speed. Characterisation of these fibres involved optical
   techniques (videoextensometry) to measure the strains along both the
   length and the width simultaneously during deformation. The unique
   processing route has now been developed to expand the range of auxetic
   extruded polymeric products. We report here that auxetic polypropylene
   films have been developed, and auxetic polyester and polyamide fibres
   have now been produced. We also report the development of a simple rough
   particle model to predict auxetic behaviour that may be applicable to
   the developed fibres and films. Finally, a review of some potential
   applications for auxetic fibres and films will be presented. These
   include as reinforcements in composites, anchoring devices, smart
   bandages for health-care, breathable packaging and tear resistant films.

Abstract = {{The paper investigates the wave propagation characteristics of periodic
   two dimensional, auxetic lattice structures. Periodic structures in
   general feature unique wave propagation characteristics, whereby waves
   are allowed to propagate only within specific frequency bands. Two
   dimensional periodic structures complement this feature with a low
   frequency directional behavior. The combination of these unique
   characteristics makes two dimensional periodic structures ideal
   candidates for the design of pass-band directional mechanical filters.
   Focus is here placed on honeycomb lattice configurations. A sensitivity
   analysis is first presented to investigate the influence of band-gap and
   directional behaviors with respect to changes in the internal angle. The
   presented results demonstrate how re-entrant topologies feature enhanced
   wave attenuation capabilities with respect to hexagonal lay-outs. An
   optimization problem is then formulated by considering the internal
   angle as a design variable, and the width of the attenuation frequency
   ranges and angular range of propagation at low frequencies as objective
   functions. The identified optimal configurations feature combined
   properties which demonstrate the effectiveness of the analysis

   technique based on Edge Detection from digital images recorded during
   quasi-static tensile test. The samples have been subjected to tensile
   and compressive tests at quasi-static and constant strain-rate values

   iso-volumetric foams samples, i.e., foams subjected to the same
   volumetric compression of the auxetic ones, exhibiting a near zero
   Poisson's ratio behaviour. The auxetic and non-auxetic foams have been
   also tested under sinusoidal cycling load up to 10 Hz, with maximum
   pre-strain applied of 12\%. The hysteresis of the cycling loading curve
   has been measured to determine the damping hysteretic loss factor for
   the various foams. The measurements indicate that auxetic foams have

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the flat-wise compression behavior of an
   innovative cellular structure configuration. The considered layout has a
   hexagonal chiral geometry featuring cylinders, or nodes, joined by
   ligaments, or ribs. The resulting assembly is characterized by a number
   of interesting properties that can be exploited for the design of
   alternative honeycombs or cellular topologies to be used in sandwich
   construction. The flat-wise strength of the chiral geometry is
   investigated through classical analytical formulas for the linear
   buckling of thin plates and shells and a bifurcation analysis performed
   on a Finite Element model. The analytical expressions predict the global
   buckling behavior and the resulting critical loads, and can be directly
   compared with the results obtained from the Finite Element analysis. In
   addition, the Finite Element model predicts local buckling. modes, which
   should be considered to evaluate the possible development of localized
   plasticity. A sensitivity study is performed to evaluate the influence
   of the geometry of the chiral structure on its buckling strength. The
   study shows that the considered topology can offer great design
   flexibility, whereby several parameters can be-selected and modified to
   improve the flat-wise performance. The comparison with traditional,
   hexagonal centro-symmetric structural configurations concludes the paper
   and demonstrates the enhanced performance and the potentials of chiral

   intuition can not help us understand their mechanical behaviour or,

   From a literature review and from analytical calculations confirmed with
   the use of numerical homogenization, it seems that some nonconvex-shaped
   (re-entrant) microstructure is the most understandable origin of the
   auxetic behaviour. The picture is quite clear in elastostatics, for
   which a quite large number of potential applications have been discussed
   in the engineering literature. Analogous problems in elastodynamics and
   in the area of viscoelasticity have not been discussed thoroughly in the
   open literature. The purpose of this article is to summarize the

   a stretch along a cube-face diagonal and corresponding lateral strain
   along the orthogonal cube-face diagonal and cube-axis were considered by
   the authors. In this paper the stereographic projections of Poisson's
   ratio for a set of natural crystals with cubic, hexagonal and monoclinic
   symmetry were computed. From these stereographic projections the
   Poisson's ratio for any possible directions of stretch and lateral
   strain in the crystal were calculated and orientations of stretch and
   lateral strain with extreme values of Poisson's ratio were obtained.
   Crystals with auxetic behavior were revealed. Orientations of stretch
   directions and lateral strain directions with negative values of
   Poisson's ratio were determined. By analysis of the above results cuts
   with optimal negative values of Poisson's ratio were revealed in zinc,
   molybdenum sulfide, carbon, graphite, polypropylene, monoclinic natural
   minerals labradorite and augite, a complex silicate and in a set of
   cubic alloys. The exotic behavior of change of cross-section of a
   cylindrical rod during stretching along the rod axis was revealed in the
   naturally-occurring mineral SiO2, cristobalite - an example of a
   molecular auxetic. The elastic constants of crystals from the manual of
   Landolt-Bornstein were used in the calculations. (c) 2005 WILEY-VCH

Abstract = {{Monte Carlo computer simulations with variable shape of the periodic box
   were performed for a few two-dimensional, hard-body models showing
   elastically isotropic solid phases. Two examples of homomolecular (i.e.
   consisting of identical molecules) systems of anisotropic molecules are
   discussed which form unusual solid phases, showing negative Poisson's
   ratio and know as auxetic ones, at densities and pressures higher than
   the elastically isotropic solid phases. Sharp extremes of the Poisson's
   ratio were observed for both systems at freezing of the orientational
   degrees of freedom of the molecules: a minimum was observed for the
   system for which the auxetic phase with frozen rotation is isotropic and
   a maximum was found for the other system. This indicates that isotropic
   auxetic phases can have auxetic precursors with much more negative
   Poisson's ratios than those characterizing the auxetic phases
   themselves. An example of a hetero-molecular (i.e. mixture consisting of
   different molecules), elastically isotropic system is also discussed -
   the polydisperse hard disc system. The simulations revealed a maximum of
   the Poisson's ratio in the close packing limit at any nonzero
   polydispersity. Although no manifestation of any auxetic behaviour has
   been found in this system, the obtained results indicate other unusual
   effect - a jump (discontinuity) of the Poisson's ratio at close packing
   when the polydispersity tends to zero. The results obtained in this work
   demonstrate that the Poisson's ratio can play the role of a sensitive
   indicator of (at least) some structural changes in solids. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{We have further explored the final stages of the collapse of an unstable
   cavity or bubble using the Molecular Dynamics computer simulation
   technique. A nanometre sized spherical volume of molecules was removed
   from a bulk Lennard-Jones liquid, which being mechanically and
   thermodynamically unstable, proceeded to collapse. The molecules with
   the highest kinetic energy were the first to enter the initially empty
   cavity. The temperature of individual molecules inside the cavity, while
   the density was still typical of a gas, could reach at least an order of
   magnitude larger than that of the surrounding liquid, e.g., equivalent
   to 6, 000 K for water, which is not unreasonable for the
   sonoluminescence effect to be seen. During the filling in of the cavity,
   the average temperature decreased, as the contents thermally
   equilibrated with the surrounding liquid. The bubble partially filled
   in, and then proceeded to partially empty again, and so on in an
   oscillatory manner, with ever decreasing amplitude towards the final
   uniform liquid state. This,recoil' effect is predicted by classical
   hydrodynamic treatments and has been observed in experiment for much
   larger bubbles. The temperature, density and normal pressure component
   were resolved as a function of radius from the centre of the bubble at
   selected times during the collapsing process. The simulations support
   the view that MD can provide a realistic representation of the final
   stages of cavity collapse. It does not make assumptions about equation
   of state and transport coefficients as would be required for a
   comparable solution of the Navier-Stokes hydrodynamics equations, and is
   therefore an especially appropriate description for the final stages of
   the collapse. (c) 2005 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA, Weinheim.}},

   explained by the anisotropic morphology of the polymer plaque resulting
   from its compression preparation. The high Poisson's ratio in the

Abstract = {{Quasi-static behavior of a poroelastic circular cylinder subjected to
   constant strain-rate axial compression was analyzed within the framework
   of the continuum mechanics of fluid-saturated, linear, poroelastic
   materials. The solutions obtained in the Laplace space were numerically
   inversed into the time domain. The results were illustrated in the form
   of curves for a wide range of drained Poisson's ratio (from positive to
   negative). It was found that, although the axial strain increases
   linearly with respect to time, all other strains, pore fluid pressure
   and all stresses do not; especially, in the case of the negative
   Poisson's ratio, the tangential strain becomes tensile immediately after
   loading and reverses its sign after a while; thereafter the compressive
   strain grows up to infinity. The pore fluid pressure and the tangential
   stress approach a steady state (constant) value after experiencing their
   transient process. Apparent stress-strain curves are nonlinear due to
   the pore fluid diffusion, with the more nonlinear for the smaller
   Poisson's ratio, especially for the negative ratio.}},

   use of excised larynges include easy accessibility to fundamental
   studies of the vocal fold vibration without invasive testing.
   Acoustic analysis of voice or electroglottography provide certain
   insight into voice production processes but optical techniques for the
   study of vocal fold vibrations have drawn considerable attention.
   Videoendoscopy, stroboscopy, highspeed photography, and kymography have
   shown to provide a visual impression of vocal fold dynamics but are
   limited in providing insight into the fundamental deformation processes
   of the vocal folds. Quantitative measures of deformation have been
   conducted through micro-suture techniques but are invasive and allows
   for measurements of only view image points. Laser triangulation is
   non-invasive but is limited to only one local measurement point. Here,
   digital image correlation technique with the software VIC 3D {[}5] is
   applied. For the experimental set-up see Fig. 2. The analysis consists
   of (1) stereo correlation to obtain in-plane displacements and (2)
   stereo triangulation step to obtain out-of-plane deformation. For the
   stereo correlation images of the object at two different stages of
   deformation are compared. A point in the image of the undeformed object
   is matched with the corresponding point in the deformed stage.
   ``Subsets{''} of digital images are traced via their gray value
   distribution from the undeformed reference image to the deformed image.
   The uniqueness of the matching is enabled by the creation of a speckle
   pattern on the object's surface. Here, a white pigment is mixed into the
   silicone rubber and subsequently black enamel paint is sprayed onto the
   superior surface of the vocal folds. The stereo triangulation requires
   two images of the object at each stage of deformation. These are
   obtained in a single CCD frame by placing a beam splitter in the optical
   axis between camera and object. These images provide a ``left{''} and
   ``right{''} view of the model larynx. Thus, the deformed shape of the
   vocal folds can be obtained. The method allows for noninvasive
   measurement of the full-field displacement fields. Images of the
   superior surface of the model larynx are obtained by the use of a high
   speed digital camera with a frame rate of 3000 frames per second
   allowing for more than 30 image frames for each vibration cycle. For the
   3D digital image correlation analysis two images of the object are
   obtained for each time instance as a beam splitter is placed in the
   optical axis between the camera and the model larynx.
   Phonation frequencies and onset pressure are given in Fig. 3, showing
   that the model larynx behavior is close to actual physiological data.
   Figs 4(a) and (b) provide superior views of the model larynx at maximum
   glottal opening and at glottal closure, respectively. As one example of
   measured strain fields, Figs 5(a) and (b) depict the distributions of
   the transverse strain component, on the glottal surface in a contour
   plot on the deformed superior surface. The knowledge of the distribution
   of this strain component is relevant to the assessment of the impact of
   vocal fold collision on potential tissue damage. In the position of
   maximum opening the vocal folds are deformed by a combination of a
   bulging-type deformation and the opening movement. At this time
   instance, the transverse strains at the medial surface are found to be
   negative, an indication of Poisson's deformation. During the closing
   stage, vocal folds collide and simultaneously a mode 3 vibration pattern
   emerges. Closure of the glottal opening is not complete and two
   incomplete closure areas are formed during the closure stage. These open
   areas are located at the anterior and posterior ends of the model
   larynx, see Fig. 4(b). The finding of this type of incomplete closure is
   agreement with both actual glottal measurements {[}6] and 3D finite
   element simulations of {[}7]. Transverse strains during that stage are
   now positive and considerably larger that during the opening stage.
   Finally, Fig. 6 depicts the time evolution of the out of plane
   displacements along the medial surface for the closing phase and Fig. 7
   depicts the maximum values of the longitudinal strain (at the coronal
   section of the medial surface) in dependence of the flow rate.
   These examples of measurements indicate that the DIC method is promising
   for studies of vocal fold dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{In this study the static and dynamic characteristics of conventional
   open cell polyurethane (PU), of auxetic (negative Poissons ratio) and of
   iso-density foams were analysed. The specimens were produced from
   conventional gray open-cells polurethane foam with 30-35 pores/inch and
   0.0027 g/cm(3) density, by means of process which has been previously
   defined by the authors. Poissons ratio measurements were performed under
   quasi-static conditions using an MTS 858 servo-hydraulic test machine
   and a video image acquisition system. For the auxetic foams the results
   suggested similar behaviour to that previously reported in the
   literature, with significant increases it? stiffness during compressive
   loading, and a significant dependence of the Poissons ratio oil the
   applied strain. Transmissibility tests, performed in accordance with the
   ISO 13753 procedure for antivibration glove materials, suggested a
   strong dependence of the transmissibility on the foam manufacturing
   parameters. Within the frequency range from 10 to 31.5 Hz the
   transmissibility was found to be greater than 1, while it was less than
   I at all frequencies greater than 31.5 Hz. The transmissibility results
   were similar to the mean values for 80 resilient materials tested by
   Koton et. al., but were higher than the five best materials (not all
   polymeric) identified by the same researchers. In this study it has been
   suggested that the resilient behaviour of glove isolation materials
   should also be evaluated in terms of the indentation characteristics. A
   simple, linear elastic, Finite Element simulation was therefore
   performed, and the indentation results suggested that auxetic foams
   offer a significant decrease in compressive stresses with respect to
   conventional PU foams.}},

Abstract = {{It is confirmed, by considering a wide range of laminated composites

   a correspondingly large value of the in-plane axial Poisson's ratio

   expansivity may be obtained - much further negative than for any

   some of the previously reported limitations of a device to control
   thermal expansion when made with monolithic materials. The use of the
   device, as a platform to control the expansivity of an optical fibre
   containing a Bragg grating, is discussed in detail and it is shown that
   the required negative expansivity of -10(-5) K-1 may easily be obtained

Abstract = {{Background: Time-series analyses have been used for decades to
   investigate time-varying environmental exposures. Recently, the
   case-crossover design has been applied to assess acute effects of air
   pollution. Our objective was to compare time-series and case-crossover
   analyses using varying referent periods (ie, unidirectional,
   ambidirectional, and time-stratified).
   Methods: We examined the association between temperature and
   cardiorespiratory mortality among the elderly population in the 20
   largest metropolitan areas of the United States. Risks were estimated by
   season and geographic region in 1992. We obtained weather data from the
   National Climatic Data Center and mortality data from the Division of
   Vital Statistics. Conditional logistic regression (case-crossover) and
   Poisson regression (time-series) were used to estimate the increased
   risk of cardiorespiratory mortality associated with a 10degreesF
   increase in daily temperature, accounting for dew-point temperature and
   other potential confounding factors.
   Results: In the time-stratified case-crossover analysis, the strongest
   associations were found in the summer; in the Southwest, Southeast,
   Northwest, Northeast, and Midwest, the odds ratios were 1.15 (95\%
   confidence interval = 1.07-1.24), 1.10 (0.96-1.27), 1.08 (0.92-1.26),
   1.08 (1.02-1.15), and 1.01 (0.92-1.11), respectively. Mostly null or
   negative associations were found in the winter, spring, and fall. The
   ambidirectional case-crossover and the time-series analyses produced
   quantitatively similar results to those from the time-stratified
   analysis. The unidirectional analysis produced conflicting results.
   Conclusions: Inferences from studies of weather and mortality using the
   ambidirectional or time-stratified case-crossover approaches and the
   time-series analyses are comparable and provide consistent findings in
   this study.}},

Abstract = {{Estimating numbers of undiscovered mineral deposits is a fundamental
   part of assessing mineral resources. Some statistical tools can act as
   guides to low variance, unbiased estimates of the number of deposits.
   The primary guide is that the estimates must be consistent with the
   grade and tonnage models. Another statistical guide is the deposit
   density (i.e., the number of deposits per unit area of permissive rock
   in well-explored control areas). Preliminary estimates and confidence
   limits of the number of undiscovered deposits in a tract of given area
   may be calculated using linear regression and refined using frequency
   distributions with appropriate parameters. A Poisson distribution leads
   to estimates having lower relative variances than the regression
   estimates and implies a random distribution of deposits. Coefficients of
   variation are used to compare uncertainties of negative binomial,
   Poisson, or MARK3 empirical distributions that have the same expected
   number of deposits as the deposit density. Statistical guides presented
   here allow simple yet robust estimation of the number of undiscovered
   deposits in permissive terranes.}},

Abstract = {{The problem considered herein is the dynamic, subsonic, steady-state
   propagation of a semi-infinite, generalized plane strain crack in an
   infinite, transversely isotropic, linear viscoelastic body. The
   corresponding boundary value problem is considered initially for a
   general anisotropic, linear viscoelastic body and reduced via transform
   methods to a matrix Riemann-Hilbert problem. The general problem does
   not readily yield explicit closed form solutions, so attention is
   addressed to the special case of a transversely isotropic viscoelastic
   body whose principal axis of material symmetry is parallel to the crack
   edge. For this special case, the out-of-plane shear (Mode III), in-plane
   shear (Mode II) and in-plane opening (Mode I) modes uncouple. Explicit
   expressions are then constructed for all three Stress Intensity Factors
   (SIF). The analysis is valid for quite general forms for the relevant
   viscoelastic relaxation functions subject only to the thermodynamic
   restriction that work done in closed cycles be non-negative. As a
   special case, an analytical solution of the Mode I problem for a general
   isotropic linear viscoelastic material is obtained without the usual
   assumption of a constant Poisson's ratio or exponential decay of the
   bulk and shear relaxation functions. The Mode I SIF is then calculated
   for a generalized standard linear solid with unequal mean relaxation
   times in bulk and shear leading to a non-constant Poisson's ratio.
   Numerical simulations are performed for both point loading on the crack
   faces and for a uniform traction applied to a compact portion of the
   crack faces. In both cases, it is observed that the SIF can vanish for
   crack speeds well below the glassy Rayleigh wave speed. This phenomenon
   is not seen for Mode I cracks in elastic material or for Mode III cracks
   in viscoelastic material.}},

Journal = {{NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{33}},

Pages = {{1154-1161}},
Abstract = {{We have investigated electrostatic and surface features of an essential
   region of the catalytic core of the spliceosome, the eukaryotic
   precursor messenger (pre-m) RNA splicing apparatus. The nucleophile for
   the first of two splicing reactions is the 2'-hydroxyl ( OH) of the
   ribose of a specific adenosine within the intron. During assembly of the
   spliceosome's catalytic core, this adenosine is positioned by pairing
   with a short region of the U2 small nuclear (sn) RNA to form the
   pre-mRNA branch site helix. The solution structure of the spliceosomal
   pre-mRNA branch site {[}Newby,M.I. and Greenbaum,N.L. (2002) Nature
   Struct. Biol., 9, 958 - 965] showed that a phylogenetically conserved
   pseudouridine (Psi) residue in the segment of U2 snRNA that pairs with
   the intron induces a markedly different structure compared with that of
   its unmodified counterpart. In order to achieve a more detailed
   understanding of the factors that contribute to recognition of the
   spliceosome's branch site helix and activation of the nucleophile for
   the first step of pre-mRNA splicing, we have calculated surface areas
   and electrostatic potentials of Psi-modified and unmodified branch site
   duplexes. There was no significant difference between the total
   accessible area or ratio of total polar: nonpolar groups between
   modified and unmodified duplexes. However, there was substantially
   greater exposure of nonpolar area of the adenine base, and less exposure
   of the 2'-OH, in the Psi-modified structure. Electrostatic potentials
   computed using a hybrid boundary element and finite difference nonlinear
   Poisson-Boltzmann approach {[}Boschitsch, A. H. and Fenley, M.O. (2004)
   J. Comput. Chem., 25, 935 955] revealed a region of exceptionally
   negative potential in the major groove surrounding the 2'-OH of the
   branch site adenosine. These surface and electrostatic features may
   contribute to the overall recognition of the pre-mRNA branch site region
   by other components of the splicing reaction.}},

Journal = {{PLANT ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{178}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{189-199}},
Abstract = {{Spatial pattern of a biotic population may change over time as its
   component individuals grow or die out, but whether this is the case for
   desert annual plants is largely unknown. Here we examined seasonal
   changes in spatial patterns of two annuals, Eriogonum abertianum and
   Haplopappus gracilis, in initial (winter) and final (summer) densities.
   The density was measured as the number of individuals from 384 permanent
   quadrats (each 0.5 m x 0.5 m) in the Chihuahuan Desert near Portal,
   Arizona, USA. We used three probability distributions (binomial,
   Poisson, and negative binomial or NB) that represent three basic spatial
   patterns (regular, random, and clumped) to fit the observed frequency
   distributions of densities of the two annuals. Both species showed clear
   clumped patterns as characterized by the NB and had similar inverse
   J-shaped frequency distribution curves in two density categories. Also,
   both species displayed a reduced degree of aggregation from winter to
   summer after the spring drought (massive die-off), as indicated by the
   increased k-parameter of the NB and decreased values of another NB
   parameter p, variance/mean ratio, Lloyd's Index of Patchiness, and David
   and Moore's Index of Clumping. Further, we hypothesized that while the
   NB (i.e., Poisson-logarithmic) well fits the distribution of individuals
   per quadrat, its components, the Poisson and logarithmic, may describe
   the distributions of clumps per quadrat and of individuals per clump,
   respectively. We thus obtained the means and variances for (1)
   individuals per quadrat, (2) clumps per quadrat, and (3) individuals per
   clump. The results showed that the decrease of the density from winter
   to summer for each plant resulted from the decrease of individuals per
   clump, rather than from the decrease of clumps per quadrat. The great
   similarities between the two annuals indicate that our observed temporal
   changes in spatial patterns may be common among desert annual plants.}},

   employed to modify the structure and properties of polyurethane (PU)
   foams. Consequently, foams with a range of pore sizes, shapes and
   orientations have been produced, including those possessing auxetic
   (negative Poisson's ratio) behaviour. Four conversion conditions were
   employed: triaxial, biaxial and uniaxial compression (to linear
   compression ratios of 0.9, 0.8 and 0.7) and uniaxial tension to (linear
   extension ratios of 1.1 and 1.2). The converted foams were then observed
   by either SEM or optical microscopy, as appropriate, to determine the
   pore structure. Mechanical properties were measured using tensile
   testing in conjunction with videoextensometry, allowing the values of
   Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio to be ascertained. Increased
   anisotropy in the pore structure and elastic properties was observed.
   The biaxial as well as the triaxial conversion routes led to auxetic
   behaviour for the PU foams.}},

Abstract = {{Systems with negative Poisson ratio (NPR) behave in a counterintuitive
   way: when pulled (pushed) in one direction, they expand (shrink) in all
   directions. In this lecture we discuss application of computer
   simulations to study NPR systems and sketch an idea - based on the
   Cauchy relations - of systematic studies of mechanisms which may lead to
   NPR. Roughly speaking, the NPR systems can be divided into three groups:
   (i) systems of artificial structures (on micro-, mezo- or macroscopic
   scale), (ii) systems at special conditions (e.g. systems at negative
   pressure, systems near some phase transitions, etc.), and (iii)
   thermodynamically stable phases. We concentrate on the third group and
   study a class of two-dimensional model particles forming isotropic solid
   phases which exhibit the NPR. Depending on the interaction potential
   used, they show periodic or aperiodic structures. The Poisson ratio of
   the aperiodic solids can be decreased by transforming them into periodic
   crystals.}},

Abstract = {{The devastating intraplate earthquake of M-w 7.7 of 26 January, 2001
   took place along the south-dipping reverse fault in the lower crust
   (similar to23 km) of Kutch, Gujarat, India, obliterating some 14,000
   people. The aftershock activity has ensued for three years. We analyzed
   997 aftershocks of Mgreater than or equal to3.0 to study the b value and
   fractal correlation dimensions in time and space. The `b' value is found
   to be 0.8+/-0.03 from the Gutenberg-Richter relation and 0.76+/-0.02
   from the maximum-likelihood, suggesting a typical value for the
   intraplate region. The spatial correlation is 1.71+/-0.02, indicating
   that events are approaching a two-dimensional region. Further, the
   temporal correlation dimension is estimated to be 0.78+/-0.02,
   confirming the structure is mono-fractal in time domain. The depth
   section of b value shows a peak at 15-35 km depth range coinciding with
   the maximum occurrence of aftershocks (similar to 47\%), which is
   inferred as a fluid-filled highly fractured rock matrix with fractures
   of high density. It will be important to note that tomographic results
   also suggest a low Vp, low Vs and a large Poisson's ratio for the same
   depth range, further confirming this inference. Additionally, we have
   studied the variation of D-2(s) and b value with time. During the first
   two months of aftershock activity the results show a marked negative
   correlation between spatial correlation dimension D-2 (large) and b
   value (low), indicating the predominance of large events associated with
   weak clustering. The negative correlation means the stress release along
   faults of a larger surface area. After two months the fractal dimension
   (D-2(s)) and b value suggests a positive correlation implying more
   numerous smaller shocks with stress release along faults of a smaller
   surface area. This would indicate a reduced probability of large
   magnitude earthquakes due to fragmentation of the fault zone.}},

Abstract = {{Although the information derived from biological markers could
   conceivably be used to overcome some of the problems intrinsic to
   virtually all epidemiologic study designs-case definition, true exposure
   level, host susceptibility and resistance to factors of interest, the
   misclassification of study subjects (false positive and false negative
   test results), etc-, we are still unable to resolve all such problems
   with the tools available at present. Biological markers seem more
   promising as potential indicators of the degree of susceptibility than
   as indicators of disease occurrence, an application requiring further
   technical refinement. Currently biological markers are employed in
   public health mainly to screen for particular diseases. Unfortunately,
   these markers have their limitations. For one thing, it is unlikely that
   they will completely eliminate the problem of false positive and false
   negative results, since DNA from solid tumors undergoes slight
   degradation due to necrosis and since genetic markers are susceptible to
   the effects of exposure to medication, diet, sex, ethnicity, and even
   the circadian cycle. And even if false positives and negatives were
   ultimately eliminated, it would be impossible to use many of the
   analytical tools based on two by two tables, such as the chi squared
   test, logistic regression, the Poisson regression, Cox' proportional
   hazards ratio, etc., since such tools rely on comparisons of the number
   of false positives and negatives in the exposed and non-exposed groups.
   Finally, albeit no less important, certain ethical issues must be
   carefully considered before allowing the massive use of human genetic
   markers, which could lead to violations of the rights of individuals,
   families, and communities if carried out in an indiscriminate,
   unregulated fashion. Epidemiology is rapidly broadening its scope, a
   trend that will continue into the future; new analytical tools will be
   developed, and the working hypotheses to which such tools will be
   applied will change. At present the scientific community is paying
   increased attention to this field of study, but more research and
   discussion are needed to respond to many of the questions for which we
   have no satisfactory answers yet.}},

   simulations, which also indicate that the cooperative rotation predicted
   for loading along x(3) is not sufficient to describe the deformation
   mechanism for loading along x(1). A negative hydrostatic pressure offset
   is observed to lead to a change in the sign of the predicted Poisson's

Abstract = {{Periodic cellular configurations with negative Poisson's ratio have
   attracted the attention of several researchers because of their superior
   dynamic characteristics. Among the geometries featuring a negative
   Poisson's ratio, the chiral topology possesses a geometric complexity
   that guarantees unique deformed configurations when excited at one of
   its natural frequencies. Specifically, localized deformations have been
   observed even at relatively low excitation frequencies. This is of
   particular importance as resonance can be exploited to minimize the
   power required for the appearance of localized deformations, thus giving
   practicality to the concept. The particular nature of these deformed
   configurations and the authority provided by the chiral geometry,
   suggest the application of the proposed structural configuration for the
   design of innovative lifting bodies, such as helicopter rotor blades or
   airplane wings. The dynamic characteristics of chiral structures are
   here investigated through a numerical model and experimental
   investigations. The numerical formulation uses dynamic shape functions
   to accurately describe the behavior of the considered structural
   assembly over a wide frequency range. The model is used to predict
   frequency response functions, and to investigate the occurrence of
   localized deformations. Experimental tests are also performed to
   demonstrate the accuracy of the model and to illustrate the
   peculiarities of the behavior of the considered chiral structures.}},

   (MR) fluid coating. An auxetic solid expands in all directions when
   pulled in only one, thus behaving in an opposite manner compared to
   `classical' solids. When compared with the conventional PU foam, the
   auxetic PU foam shows enhanced crashworthiness properties and increased
   sound absorption characteristics (at low frequencies). Samples of
   auxetic foam coated with MR fluid are examined in this work. While the
   tensile mechanical properties of the MR fluid-coated samples are
   affected mainly by surface effects, the acoustic absorption
   characteristics show almost constant values beyond the cut-off frequency
   level of the original uncoated auxetic foam. With regard to the foams'
   electromagnetic properties, the auxetic structure and MR coating cause
   an increase in the refractive index and loss factor compared to the
   conventional foams. These electromagnetic effects are due to the
   presence of a high relative density and metal particulates in the foam
   material.}},

Abstract = {{Let p be a probability measure on the real line with finite moments of

   Then there exists a sequence \{P-n\}(n=0)(infinity) of orthogonal

   function to derive \{P-n, alpha(n), omega(n)\} from a given mu. Two
   types of pre-generating functions are studied. We apply our method to
   the special distributions such as Gaussian, Poisson, gamma, uniform,
   arcsine, semi-circle, and beta-type to derive \{P-n, alpha(n),

   are exactly the classical polynomials such as Hermite, Charlier,
   Laguerre, Legendre, Chebyshev of the first kind, Chebyshev of the second

Abstract = {{The main objective of this research was to estimate heritabilities of
   seven osteochondrosis (OC) lesions in station-tested pigs and their
   genetic and phenotypic correlations with four meat quality (MQ) traits,
   the percentage of premium cuts (PPC), daily weight gain (DWG), and feed
   conversion ratio (FCR). Observed OC lesions were on the head of humerus
   (HK), condylus medialis humeri (CMH), condylus lateralis humeri (CLH),
   radius and ulna proximal (RUP), distal epiphyseal cartilage of ulna
   (DEU), head of femur (FK), and condylus medialis femoris (CMF). Meat
   quality traits were i.m. fat (IMF), muscle pH at 1 h after slaughter
   (pH1), muscle pH at 30 h after slaughter (pH30), and light reflectance
   on muscle (H30). The data set comprised 2,710 animals, of which 1,291
   animals had OC records. All traits were analyzed by multiple-trait
   linear mixed model, with the animal's genetic and common litter effects
   as random. Fixed effects in the model varied between traits. Each OC
   lesion was further analyzed by a univariate generalized linear mixed
   model or, equivalently, ``threshold models,{''} assuming logistic,
   probit (normal), and Poisson distributions of the underlying
   ``liability{''} to the disease. For OC lesions, estimates of
   heritability were low on the original ``incidence{''} scale (0.06 for HK
   to 0.16 for CLH) and moderate to high on the liability scale (0.08 to
   0.42). Genetic correlations (r(g)) between OC lesions and most MQ traits
   and PPC were generally unfavorable. Significant rg were -0.44 for
   DWG-CMH, 0.31 for DWG-CMF, 0.40 for FCR-HK, 0.21 for PPC-CLH, 0.32 for
   PPC-RUP, 0.30 for PPC-CMF, -0.54 for pH1-CLH, 0.47 for pH1-DEU, -0.34
   for pH30-CMH, 0.58 for pH30-DEU, -0.50 for H30-HK, -0.31 for H30-DEU,
   and 0.31 for H30-CMF. Genetic susceptibilities to some OC lesions within
   the front leg were positively related to each other (r(g) range = 0.57
   to 0.69), but r(g) between front and hind leg OC lesions were mostly
   negative (range = -0.21 to -0.40). Estimated h(2) was 0.60 for PPC, and
   ranged from 0.12 to 0.66 for MQ traits, 0.28 for DWG, and 0.42 for FCR.
   Genetic correlations among meat quality and quantity traits ranged from
   -0.66 to 0.37. This is the first study to report genetic and phenotypic
   correlations between OC lesions and several meat quality and quantity
   traits in pigs. These findings will be useful to pig industry,
   especially in designing breeding programs for robust pigs.}},

Abstract = {{In a recent paper by Ting and Chen {[}18] it was shown by examples that
   Poisson's ratio can have no bounds for all anisotropic elastic
   materials. With the exception of cubic materials, the examples presented
   involve a very large transverse strain. We show here that a very large
   Poisson's ratio with a bounded transverse strain exists for all
   anisotropic elastic materials. The large Poisson's ratio with a bounded
   transverse strain occurs when the axial strain is in the direction very
   near or at the direction along which Young's modulus is very large. In
   fact the transverse strain has to be very small for the material to be
   stable. If the non-dimensionalized Young's modulus is of the order
   delta(-1), where delta is very small, the axial strain, the transverse
   strain and Poisson's ratio are of the order delta, delta(1/ 2) and
   delta(-1/ 2), respectively.}},

Abstract = {{An electrodynamics-based model was formulated for simulation of ion
   diffusion in microbial polysaccharides. The fixed charges and
   electrostatic double layers that may associate with microbial
   polysaccharides and their effects on ion diffusion were explicitly built
   into the model. The model extends a common multicomponent ion diffusion
   formulation that is based on irreversible thermodynamics under a zero
   ionic charge flux condition, which is only applicable to the regions
   without fixed charges and electrostatic double layers. An efficient
   numerical procedure was presented to solve the differential equations in
   the model. The model well described key features of experimental
   observations of ion diffusion in negatively charged microbial
   polysaccharides including accelerated diffusive transport of cations,
   exclusion of anions, and increased rate of cation transport with
   increasing negative charge density. The simulated diffusive fluxes of
   cations and anions were consistent with a cation exchange diffusion
   concept in negatively charged polysaccharides at the interface of plant
   roots and soils; and the developed model allows to mathematically study
   such diffusion phenomena. An illustrative example was also provided to
   simulate dynamic behavior of ionic current during ion diffusion within a
   charged bacterial cell wall polysaccharide and the effects of the ionic
   current on the compression or expansion of the bacterial electrostatic
   double layer at the interface of the cell wall and bulk solution. (C)

Abstract = {{A complete set of second and third order elastic constants of the cubic
   austenite phase in CuA/Ni shape memory alloy was determined by
   ultrasonic pulse-echo method. Because of the very high elastic
   anisotropy of the austenite phase (A = 12.02), a negative Poisson ratio
   V is obtained for loading the crystal in certain directions, e.g. nu(12)
   = nu(21) = -0.62 in the coordinate system {[}110], {[}110], {[}001].
   Measurements of the third order elastic constants were carried out in
   nine selected specimen geometries (acoustic modes). The wave velocity
   was highly sensitive to the applied stress only in two shear modes. The
   onset of the stress-induced martensitic transformation (MT) was detected
   by acoustic emission (AE), ultrasonic wave velocity and attenuation
   measurements in given order. The acoustic emission was thus the most
   sensitive acoustic method for detection of early stages of the
   transformation. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{The prediction of heave in unsaturated, expansive soils has historically
   been studied primarily as a one-dimensional type analysis. This paper
   proposes a methodology that can be used for the prediction of one-,
   two-, or three-dimensional heave. It is suggested that negative
   pore-water pressures (i.e., soil suctions) can be estimated through a
   saturated-unsaturated seepage analysis. The results of the seepage
   analysis are then used as input for the prediction of displacements in a
   stress-deformation analysis. The formulation of the governing partial
   differential equations for both seepage and stress-deformation is based
   on the general theory of unsaturated soils using two independent stress
   state variables. The elasticity parameter functions required for a
   stress-deformation analysis can be calculated from various tests,
   including conventional one-dimensional oedometer tests. The proposed
   method is studied and tested against data collected on a case history
   involving a slab-on-ground floor on Regina clay. The predicted results
   from the two-dimensional analysis agree well with the measured data in
   terms of both total vertical displacements and final water contents in
   the soil. The results of a parametric study are also presented to show
   the effect of measured soil parameters (i.e., swelling index and initial
   void ratio) and assumed parameters (i.e., Poisson's ratio and
   coefficient of earth pressure at rest) on the predicted displacements.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To investigate the relationship between utilisation of
   service mammography screening and breast cancer mortality in New South
   Wales (NSW) women.
   Setting: Population-based biennial mammography screening was
   progressively introduced in NSW from 1988, with active recruitment and
   re-invitation for women aged 50-69 years, and reached full geographic
   coverage by 1996. Biennial mammography screening participation has
   varied widely over time and by municipality.
   Methods: Breast cancer mortality by age, period and municipality was
   obtained from the NSW Central Cancer Registry. Biennial mammography
   screening rates for the same strata were obtained from the BreastScreen
   NSW database. Temporal changes in breast cancer mortality for NSW were
   summarised as annual average declines using Poisson regression. Breast
   cancer mortality for 1997-2001 was examined in relation to lagged
   biennial screening rates by municipality, adjusted for age, area
   socio-economic and geographic indicators, and breast cancer incidence,
   also using Poisson regression.
   Results: For the 50-69 year age group, the mean annual breast cancer
   mortality decline was 0.8\% (not significant) for 1988-1994, and 4.4\%
   (p < 0.0001) for 1995-2001. Statistically significant negative
   associations between breast cancer mortality in 1997-2001 and lagged
   biennial screening rates were found with the highest significance at a
   four-year lag for women aged 50-69 years (p = 0.0003) and also for women
   aged 50-79 years (p = 0.0002). From the regression coefficient, a 70\%
   biennial screening rate is associated with 32\% lower breast cancer
   mortality (compared to zero screening).
   Conclusions: The effect of population-based mammography screening on
   breast cancer mortality in NSW inferred using this method is consistent
   with results of trials and other service studies. This suggests that
   population-based mammography screening programs can achieve significant
   reductions in breast cancer mortality with adequate participation.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To explore lip cancer (LC) associations with work
   environmental exposures in a record-linkage study of Norwegian farmers.
   We hypothesize immunosuppressive substances (e.g. mycotoxins,
   pesticides) to influence LC incidence.
   Methods: A cohort of 131,243 male Norwegian farmers born 1925-1971 was
   established by cross-linkage of national registers and followed up
   through 1999 for incident LC, (ICD-7 site 140) in the Cancer Registry of
   Norway. Farm production data from agricultural censuses 1969-1979 and
   meteorological data on solar radiation and fungal forecasts (events of
   wet and temperate conditions known to favour fungal growth and mycotoxin
   formation) served as exposure proxies. Adjusted rate ratios (RR) and
   95\% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using Poisson regression.
   Results: We identified 108 LC cases (rate 4.4 per 100,000 person-years).
   We found LC to be moderately associated with horses on the farm (RR =
   1.6, CI = 1.0-2.4), construction work employment (RR = 1.7, CI =
   1.1-2.6), pesticide use (RR = 0.7, CI = 0.4-1.0), grain production (RR =
   1.3, CI = 0.9-2.1) and increasing levels of fungal forecasts (RR = 1.6,
   CI = 0.92.8 in the highest two quartiles).
   Conclusion: Moderate associations of LC with grain production and fungal
   forecasts and the negative association with pesticide could possibly be
   explained by exposure to immunosuppressive mycotoxins. Some of the
   associations observed could be explained by solar exposure.}},

Abstract = {{Three new kinds of molecular networks are designed and predicted to

   that the kabob-like polymers with auxegens lying vertically on the main

   horizontally on the main chain cannot. Besides, a half kabob-like or
   pseudo-ladder polymer with auxegens linked at the intersection of the

Abstract = {{Aims To determine the most appropriate regression models to use when
   assessing risk factors for severe hypoglycaemia and to investigate the
   impact of model misspecification and its clinical implications.
   Methods A total of 1229 children with Type 1 diabetes (mean age 11.7
   years sd 4.1), of which 605 (49.2\%) were males, were studied.
   Prospective assessment of severe hypoglycaemia (an event leading to loss
   of consciousness or seizure) was made over the 9-year period, 1992-2001.
   Patients were seen every 3 months and episodes of hypoglycaemia along
   with clinical data were recorded. Over 70\% of children never
   experienced a severe hypoglycaemic event. Data were analysed using the
   Poisson regression, negative binomial, zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) and
   zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) models. The over-dispersion and
   likelihood ratio statistics were calculated and the analytical methods
   compared.
   Results The Poisson regression model did not fit the data well. The
   negative binomial and the zero inflated Poisson and negative binomial
   models fitted the data better than Poisson.
   Conclusions The commonly used Poisson regression models to analyse
   hypoglycaemia epidemiology may lead to biased parameter estimates and
   incorrect determination of risk factors for hypoglycaemia. We recommend
   the use of the negative binomial or zero inflated models to examine any
   risk factors associated with severe hypoglycaemia. Careful consideration
   must be given to the interpretation of hypoglycaemia surveys and their

Abstract = {{Objectives: To examine the utility of the zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP)
   and zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) modelling approaches for
   modelling four sets of dental caries data from the same cohort study
   {[}with particular attention to the influence of childhood socioeconomic
   status (SES)]: cross-sectional data on the deciduous dentition at age 5
   years; cross-sectional data on the permanent dentition at age 18 and 26
   years; and longitudinal data on caries increment between ages 18 and 26
   years. Methods: Data on dental caries occurrence at ages 5, 18 and 26
   years were obtained from the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and
   Development Study (DMHDS). ZIP and ZINB models were fitted to the
   cross-sectional (n = 745) and longitudinal (n = 809) data sets using
   Stata (Intercooled Stata 7.0). The dependent variables for the three
   cross-sectional analyses were the DMFS indices at age 5, 18, and 26
   years, and net DFS increment (NETDFS) was the dependent variable for the
   longitudinal analysis. Results: The empty ZIP model was a poor fit for
   all four data sets, whereas the empty ZINB model showed good fit;
   consequently both the cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses were
   conducted using ZINB modelling. Being in the high-SES group during
   childhood was associated with a greater probability of being caries-free
   by age 18 years, over and above that which would be expected from the
   negative binomial process. Low childhood SES also had the largest
   coefficient in the modelling of the negative binomial process, but at
   age 5 years, where the adjusted mean dmfs score in the low-SES group was
   6.8 (compared with 4.7 and 2.9 in the medium- and high-SES groups,
   respectively). The substantial SES differences which existed at age 5
   years (in the deciduous dentition) had reduced somewhat by age 18 years,
   and had widened again by age 26 years. In the longitudinal analysis,
   `baseline' caries experience (age 18-year DMFS) was a predictor both of
   being an extra zero and of caries severity. Conclusion: This
   investigation of the utility of the zero-inflated approach for modelling
   both cross-sectional and longitudinal caries data has shown that
   ZIP/ZINB models can provide new insight into disease patterns. It is
   anticipated that they will become increasingly useful in epidemiological
   studies that use the DMF index as the outcome measure.}},

Abstract = {{Measurements have been carried out on the in-plane and through the

   reproducible results obtained. It is confirmed that in-plane negative
   values may be obtained in specific directions. The physical reason for
   this and its connection with the necessary appearance of a large Poisson
   ratio is pointed out. The expansivity of the matrix material depends
   strongly on temperature. Very good agreement between the experimental
   values and those predicted from the properties of the two constituents
   is found provided that the value for the expansivity of the
   polyoropylene is that within the temperature range considered. It is
   shown that the polypropylene matrix does not provide a matrix which is
   stable enough in its properties to enable the system to yield consistent
   negative values of expansivity. An alternative system is proposed and a
   single experiment confirms that a negative value of the thermal

Abstract = {{As field sampling is time consuming, it is necessary to develop
   efficient sampling techniques to obtain accurate estimates of the weed
   seedbank in soil. The relative efficiency between sampling schemes
   depends on the spatial variability in weed seed density across
   agricultural fields. Spatial variability of the weed seed density was
   characterized by theoretical correlograms. A systematic sampling (square
   grill) scheme was considered and it was found that, taking into account
   spatial variability, this sampling scheme was more efficient than simple
   random sampling. As a result, the sample size can be reduced in
   comparison with that given in previous studies, where spatial
   correlation was ignored. The reduction depends on the correlation
   structure defined as a function of the ratio, tau, between the nugget
   effect and the sill of the variogram. The maximum reduction of the
   sample size, without loss of either precision or confidence level
   corresponds to the case where there is no nugget effect, tau = 0. The
   opposite extreme case, where the reduction is nil, corresponds to the
   case of a pure nugget effect tau = 1. The abaci based on given
   expressions are provided to determine the sample size in species whose
   spatial pattern can be fitted either to a Poisson or to a negative

Abstract = {{Although a negative Poisson's ratio ( that is, a lateral extension in
   response to stretching) is not forbidden by thermodynamics, for almost
   all common materials the Poisson's ratio is positive. In 1987, Lakes
   first discovered negative Poisson's ratio effect in polyurethane (PU)
   foam with re-entrant structures, which was named anti-rubber, auxetic,
   and dilatational by later researchers. In this paper, the term `auxetic'
   will be used. Since then, investigation on the auxetic materials has
   held major interest, focusing on finding more materials with negative
   Poisson's ratio, and on examining the mechanisms, properties and
   applications. Therefore, more materials were found to have the
   counter-intuitive effect of auxeticity due to different structural or
   microstructrual mechanisms. The present article reviews the latest
   advances in auxetic materials, their structural mechanisms, performance

Abstract = {{Collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles have caused severe life
   and property losses in many countries. The majority of bicycle-motor
   vehicle (BMV) accidents occur at intersections. In order to reduce the
   number of BMV accidents at intersections, a substantial understanding of
   the causal factors for the collisions is required. In this study,
   intersection BMV accidents were classified into three types based on the
   movements of the involved motor vehicles and bicycles. The three BMV
   accident classifications were through motor vehicle related collisions,
   left-turn motor vehicle related collisions, and right-turn motor vehicle
   related collisions. A methodology for estimating these BMV accident
   risks was developed based on probability theory. A significant
   difference between this proposed methodology and most current approaches
   is that the proposed approach explicitly relates the risk of each
   specific BMV accident type to its related flows. The methodology was
   demonstrated using a 4-year (1992-1995) data set collected from 115
   signalized intersections in the Tokyo Metropolitan area. This data set
   contains BMV accident data, bicycle flow data, motor vehicle flow data,
   traffic control data, and geometric data for each intersection approach.
   For each BMV risk model, an independent explanatory variable set was
   chosen according to the characteristics of the accident type. Three
   negative binomial regression models (one corresponding to each BMV
   accident type) were estimated using the maximum likelihood method. The
   coefficient value and its significance level were estimated for each
   selected variable. The negative binomial dispersion parameters for all
   the three models were significant at 0.01 levels. This supported the
   choice of the negative binomial regression over the Poisson regression
   for the quantitative analyses in this study. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Objective: To evaluate the impact of policy and practice changes in
   prenatal screening for Down's syndrome on prenatal diagnosis and live
   birth prevalence of Down's syndrome.
   Design: Population-based observational study.
   Setting: Greater Paris.
   Population: Residents of Greater Paris who gave birth or had a
   termination of pregnancy in Paris during 1981-2000( similar to 38,000
   births per year).
   Methods: Data on 1916 cases of Down's syndrome were obtained from the
   Paris Registry of Congenital Anomalies. Analyses included binomial and
   Poisson models of trends in three periods: prior to 1989(reference
   period), 1989-1995(reimbursement of amniocentesis in case of
   ultrasonographic anomalies) and 1996-2000(widespread use of reimbursed
   serum screening and measurement of nuchal translucency).
   Main outcome measures: Trends in proportion of Down's syndrome cases
   diagnosed prior to birth; live birth prevalence of Down's syndrome.
   Results: The proportion of Down's syndrome detected prenatally for women
   < 38 years of age increased ninefold; from 9.5\% (95\% CI 2.7-22.6) in
   1981 to 84.9\% (95\% CI 74.6-92.2) in 2000. For women > 38 years of age,
   the increase was 1.5-fold. The live birth prevalence of Down's syndrome
   decreased by 3\% per year (prevalence ratio {[}PR] 0.97, 95\% CI
   0.96-0.99); the age-adjusted decrease was 13\%. The analysis by period
   showed that the decrease in live birth prevalence of Down's syndrome was
   greater after 1988.
   Conclusions: By far, most cases of Down's syndrome are currently
   detected prenatally in the Parisian population. Consequently, the live
   birth prevalence of Down's syndrome has decreased despite consistent
   trends towards delayed childbearing. These positive public health
   effects have to be balanced against a relatively high rate of
   amniocentesis and the potentially negative consequences of widespread
   prenatal testing for individuals born with Down's syndrome.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Most materials will shrink or expand laterally when stretched or
   compressed, i. e. they have positive Poisson ratios,but materials with
   negative Poisson ratios will undergo lateral expansion when stretched
   longitudinally and become thinner when compressed. And materials
   exhibiting this novel and counterintuitive behavior, now known as
   auxetic materials, have been successfully fabricated with many new
   applications. Currently, molecular auxeties, namely auxetic materials at
   the molecular level, have become the most exciting endeavor in the
   development of auxetic materials. In this paper, as new alternatives to
   the making of molecular auxetics, several types of centipede-like linear
   polymers both with single and double legs on the side chain,
   single-arrow-like, double-arrow-like organic compounds were designed as
   building blocks for self-assembling into auxetic network structures
   through hydrogen bonds. The second derivative method is used to
   calculate Poisson ratios after doing molecular mechanics (MM)
   optimization. The results show that all these self-assembly networks can
   be arranged as inverted honey-comb like structures and their Poisson's
   ratios in at least one plane are negative and even the self assembly of
   small molecules with special architecture may achieve auxeticity in some
   cases. Compared with many approaches proposed so far, that of the
   self-assembly of both single polymers and single small molecules into
   molecular auxetics reported here is quite novel. It provides a new route
   to synthesize molecular auxetics, which should be much easier than that
   for synthesizing two-dimensional cross-linked auxetic networks. Yet its
   successful realization requires great experimental efforts.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we present the results of the combined analyses of ocean
   bottom seismometer and multi-channel seismic reflection data collection
   offshore southwestern Taiwan, with respect to the presence of gas
   hydrates and free gas within the accretionary wedge sediments. Estimates
   of the compressional velocities along EW9509-33 seismic reflection
   profile are obtained by a series of pre-stack depth migrations in a
   layer stripping streamlined Deregowski loop. Strong BSR is imaged over
   most of the reflection profile while low velocity zones are imaged below
   BSR at several locations. Amplitude versus angle analysis that are
   performed within the pre-stack depth migration processes reveal strong
   negative P-impedance near the bottom of the hydrate stability zone,
   commonly underlain by sharp positive P impedance layers associated with
   negative pseudo-Poisson attribute areas, indicating the presence of free
   gas below the BSR. Ray tracing of the acoustic arrivals with a model
   derived from the migration velocities generally fits the vertical and
   hydrophone records of the four ocean-bottom seismographs (OBS). In order
   to estimate the Poisson's ratios in the shallow sediments at the
   vicinity of the OBSs, we analyze the mode-converted arrivals in the
   wide-angle horizontal component. P-S mode converted reflections are
   dominant, while upward P-S transmissions are observed at large offsets.
   We observe significant compressional velocity and Poisson's ratio
   pull-down in the sediment below the BSR likely to bear free gas. When
   compared to Poisson's ratio predicted by mechanical models, the values
   proposed for the OBSs yield rough estimates of gas hydrate saturation in
   the range of 0-10\% in the layers above the BSR and of free gas
   saturation in the range of 0-2\% just below the BSR.}},

Abstract = {{This paper illustrates various dynamic characteristics of open cell
   compliant polyurethane foam with auxetic (negative Poisson's ratio)
   behaviour. The foam is obtained from off-the-shelf open cell
   polyurethane grey foam with a manufacturing process based on mechanical
   deformation on a mould in a temperature-controlled oven. The Poisson's
   ratio is measured with an image processing technique based on edge
   detection with wavelet methods. Foam samples have been tested in a
   viscoelastic analyser tensile test machine to determine the Young's
   modulus and loss factor for small dynamic strains. The same samples have
   also been tested in an acoustic impedance tube to measure acoustic
   absorption and specific acoustic resistance and reactance with a
   transmissibility technique. Another set of tests has been set up on a
   cam plastometer machine for constant strain rate dynamic crushing
   analysis. All the tests have been carried out on auxetic and normal foam
   samples to provide a comparison between the two types of cellular
   solids. The results from the experimental tests are discussed and
   interpreted using microstructure models for cellular materials existing
   in the literature. The negative Poisson's ratio foam presented in this
   paper shows an overall superiority regarding damping and acoustic
   properties compared to the original conventional foam. Its dynamic
   crushing performance is also significantly superior to the normal foam,
   suggesting a possible use in structural integrity compliant elements.}},

Abstract = {{The formation and propagation of streamers in SF6 and its gas mixtures
   were simulated using the hybrid Monte-Carlo-Collision/Fluid model in
   uniform and non-uniform fields. The simulation in uniform field is based
   on accurate numerical solution of Poisson's equation in conjunction with
   the continuity equations for electrons, negative and positive ions. Some
   simplifications for the non-uniform field's calculation were applied due
   to the limit of a computer's calculation speed. The effect of O-2 upon
   the SF6/N-2/O-2 gas mixture's critical field is also discussed. The
   electron density, positive and negative ion densities, electric field in
   the discharge channel, which are very important to understand the
   phenomena of streamer development and to assess the insulation strength
   of the gas mixture, are also presented in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{Materials or structures that contract in the transverse direction under
   uniaxial compression, or expand laterally when stretched are called to
   have negative Poisson's ratios. A theoretical approach to predict
   negative Poisson's ratios of auxetic honeycombs has been developed,
   which is based on the large deflection model. The equations of the
   deflection curves of the inclined member of the re-entrant cell, strains
   and Poisson's ratios of auxetic honeycombs in two orthogonal directions
   have been derived. The deformed shapes of the inclined member of the
   re-entrant cell are calculated. The negative Poisson's ratios of auxetic
   honeycombs are no longer a constant at large deformation. They, vary
   significantly with the strain. The effect of the geometric parameters of
   the cell on the Poisson's ratios is analyzed. (C) 2003 Elsevier SAS. All

Abstract = {{This paper presents results from an analysis of traffic measurements
   taken at the G(b) interface of a GPRS network. Data was captured in one
   week long data sets between November 2002 to March 2004. This paper
   provides new results, based on three of these data sets, and extends on
   the work presented in {[}5]. The data was analysed to characterise the
   aggregate workload statistics, including marginal distribution and
   autocorrelation, and identify any trends over this timeframe. A study of
   models that adequately characterise the traffic was also undertaken.
   We find that the aggregate work process (Bytes ``departing{''} the SGSN)
   has a marginal distribution closely matching a negative exponential;
   however, this does not allow us to conclude that the packet arrival or
   departure processes are Poisson. The ``burstiness{''} of the traffic
   (i.e. the Coefficient of Variation) was found to become smaller over
   time, i.e. the traffic became smoother. This occurred due to a greater
   level of aggregation, as a direct result of more ``low traffic{''} users
   connecting to the network This may be indicative of an increase in WAP
   and mobile e-mail usage
   Four potential models for the aggregate work process were investigated
   The latest data shows that the trend towards a more Gaussian-type
   marginal distribution model continues. Of the four models studied, the
   Poisson Pareto Burst Process gave the best fit to the queueing
   performance compared with the recorded traffic traces. The fit to the
   most recent data traffic measurements has substantially improved
   compared with the earlier results.}},

Abstract = {{Microscopic rotations can play a very important role in the molecular
   crystals or in some dielectric crystals where atoms are joined in
   comparatively rigid clusters and the inter-cluster interactions are
   comparatively weak. The range of unusual phenomena observed in such
   materials is fascinating, from incommensurate phase to negative Poisson
   ratio. Here we focus on the topological soliton dynamics in such
   materials and describe a number of effects, such as the trigger off and
   propagation of autowaves, soliton multiplication in the metastable
   media, soliton collisions and annihilations. All these phenomena are
   addressed in frame of the elastically hinged molecule (EHM) model having
   microscopic particles with rotational degrees of freedom. For this model
   we construct various continuum approximations. New important features of
   the continuum models for media with microscopic rotations are the
   increase in number of equations of motion due to the increase in number
   of degrees of freedom and the appearance of the higher gradient terms in
   the resulting equations. We also construct the multi-field continuum
   approximation capable of description not only long but also short waves.}},

   auxetic and matched carbon fibre/epoxy resin laminates to be
   specifically designed. These laminates were then fabricated and tested,

Abstract = {{We studied the interrelationship of elastic and piezoelectric properties
   with the lattice structure and crystal physics of paratellurite

   independent elastic constants C-ijkl, the associated internal friction
   Q(ijkl)(-1), and one piezoelectric coefficient e(14). We determined
   simultaneously these material coefficients using resonant ultrasound
   spectroscopy coupled with laser-Doppler interferometry. Mode
   identification, essential for success, was done by measuring the
   displacement distributions on a vibrating-specimen surface. Our C-ijkl
   were consistent with reported values measured by conventional methods.
   Our e(14) exceeds the reported value by 53\%. We focus on several
   unusual elastic properties, including a negative Poisson ratio.
   Considering a star-shape truss structure on the basal plane consistently
   explains all of them. Internal friction correlates with the C-ijkl
   temperature derivatives, suggesting phonon-phonon interactions as a
   dominant cause of the mechanical loss.}},

Abstract = {{Elastic properties of a class of two-dimensional model systems,
   consisted of hard cyclic multimers, are discussed. Each multimer is
   composed of m = 3k (where k is a positive integer) hard discs of
   diameter sigma and centers forming a perfect polygon of m-sides, where
   the side length is l. Close packed structures of such systems, which are
   isotropic from the point of view of elastic properties, were solved
   exactly in the close packing limit at zero temperature. It was shown
   that the Poisson ratio, v(p), of the multimers is negative when their
   roughness parameter, defined as alpha equivalent to 1/(2sigma), is
   large. In the limit m --> infinity obtains hard disc-like particles,
   which in contrast to the standard hard discs are rough. It is
   conjectured that the formula obtained for the Poisson ratio of the
   3k-multimers, v(p) = (1 - 2alpha(2))/(3 - 2alpha(2)), is valid also for

Abstract = {{Alloys of iron and non-magnetic gallium (of the form Fe1-xGax where x
   ranges from 13 to 30) exhibit large magnetostrictions of over 300 ppm at
   room temperature that are produced by saturation magnetic fields of
   approximately 600 Oe. While not producing magnetostrictions of the
   degree achievable with giant magnetostrictives, large magnetostrictive
   alloys of iron and gallium - called Galfenol - have much more desirable
   mechanical characteristics, such as non-brittleness and in-plane auxetic
   behavior. Additionally, Galfenol requires a much smaller saturation
   magnetic field than the giant magnetostrictives Terfenol and Terfenol-D
   (alloys of Iron and non-metallic Terbium and Dysprosium). Beginning from
   the body of knowledge gained from Terfenol and Terfenol-D dynamic
   research transducer designs is a good starting point for designing a
   Galfenol dynamic research transducer. However, several modifications are
   being made to adapt the transducer to some of Galfenol's unique
   properties. Any measured value uncertainty will quickly propagate
   through the calculated material properties. While not completely
   successful at addressing all the unique aspects Galfenol in this
   transducer design, the data presented will assist in future design
   attempts.}},

Abstract = {{A two-dimensional model of tri-atomic molecules (in which `atoms' are
   distributed on vertices of equilateral triangles, and which are further
   referred to as cyclic trimers) is solved exactly in the static
   (zero-temperature) limit for the nearest-neighbour site-site
   interactions. It is shown that the cyclic trimers form a mechanically
   stable and elastically isotropic non-chiral phase of negative Poisson
   ratio. The properties of the system are illustrated by three examples of
   atom-atom interaction potentials: (i) the purely repulsive
   (n-inverse-power) potential, (ii) the purely attractive (n-power)
   potential and (iii) the Lennard-Jones potential which shows both the
   repulsive and the attractive part. The analytic form of the dependence
   of the Poisson ratio on the interatomic potential is obtained. It is
   shown that the Poisson ratio depends, in a universal way, only on the
   trimer anisotropy parameter both (1) in the limit of n --> infinity for
   cases (i) and (ii), as well as (2) at the zero external pressure for any
   potential with a doubly differentiable minimum, case (iii) is an

Abstract = {{Background: The rates and risk factors for overall and medical
   condition-specific hospitalizations in HIV-positive women have not been
   examined in detail or compared with rates in risk factor-matched
   HIV-negative women.
   Objective: To determine the rates and risk factors for overall and
   condition-specific hospitalizations.
   Methods: Prospective cohort study of 885 HIV-positive women and 425
   HIV-negative women followed for semiannual research visits between 1993
   and 2000 in 4 urban locations in the United States. Outcome measures
   were hospitalization diagnoses with diabetes mellitus, nonacute renal
   conditions, cardiovascular conditions, liver conditions, AIDS defining
   conditions, and overall hospitalizations. Clinical and laboratory risk
   factors were assessed at research visits every 6 months, and effects of
   risk factors on hospitalization rates were calculated using generalized
   estimating equations and Poisson regression.
   Results: Renal laboratory abnormalities, hypertension, and clinical AIDS
   were each associated with 3 of the 5 condition-specific hospitalization
   rates. Over time, diabetes-, nonacute renal-, and cardiovascular-related
   rates were flat or slightly increased and liver-related rates were
   significantly increased in HIV-positive women. Hospitalization rates
   with an AIDS-defining condition declined sharply in the latter half of
   the study period.
   Conclusions: In this population of largely African-American, inner-city,
   HIV-infected women, renal abnormalities, hypertension, and hepatitis C
   virus infection were common. Rate ratios indicated that ``non-AIDS{''}
   risk factors were important predictors of hospitalization. In the highly
   active antiretroviral therapy era, clinicians must pay attention to
   these risk factors for morbidity and should closely monitor renal
   abnormalities, hypertension, and hepatitis status.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to (1) describe the prevalence of
   mandibular incisor irregularity (11) among untreated adults in the
   United States and (2) evaluate the factors explaining individual
   differences in II. Data were derived for a random sample of 9044
   individuals (49\% male and 51\% female; 35\% Mexican American, 34\%
   black, and 31\% white) between 15 and 50 years of age collected as part
   of the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Although
   the differences were small (0.5 mm), males had significantly greater 11
   than did females; blacks showed less 11 than did whites (0.9 mm) and
   Mexican Americans (1.1 mm). Family income was negatively related with
   II. Incisor irregularity increased in a curvilinear fashion with age,
   with the greatest increases occurring during early adulthood. Although
   the number of premolars and molars (first and second) were positively
   related with 11, the presence of third molars had a negative effect on
   II. Multivariate Poisson regression analyses showed that the ethnicity,
   the number of first and second molars, sex, and age combined to explain
   differences in II. Odds ratios were relatively low, indicating that
   these factors explained relatively small amounts of between-subject
   variation. We conclude that (1) approximately 50\% of individuals in the
   United States who were 15-50 years of age have little or no 11, 23\%
   have moderate 11, and 17\% have severe irregularity, (2) erupted third
   molars are not associated with increased crowding, (3) crowding
   increases most during early adulthood, and (4) although individual
   differences in crowding are multifactorial, the primary determinants
   remain unidentified.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Much debate remains regarding why certain countries
   experience dramatically higher winter mortality. Potential causative
   factors other than cold exposure have rarely been analysed.
   Comparatively less research exists on excess winter deaths in southern
   Europe. Multiple time series data on a variety of risk factors are
   analysed against seasonal-mortality patterns in 14 European countries to
   identify key relations
   Subjects and setting: Excess winter deaths ( all causes), 1988 - 97,
   EU-14.
   Design: Coefficients of seasonal variation in mortality are calculated
   for EU-14 using monthly mortality data. Comparable, longitudinal
   datasets on risk factors pertaining to climate, macroeconomy, health
   care, lifestyle, socioeconomics, and housing were also obtained. Poisson
   regression identifies seasonality relations over time.
   Results: Portugal suffers from the highest rates of excess winter
   mortality (28\%, CI = 25\% to 31\%) followed jointly by Spain (21\%, CI
   = 19\% to 23\%), and Ireland ( 21\%, CI = 18\% to 24\%). Cross country
   variations in mean winter environmental temperature ( regression
   coefficient (beta) = 0.27), mean winter relative humidity (beta = 0.54),
   parity adjusted per capita national income (beta = 1.08), per capita
   health expenditure (beta = 1.19), rates of income poverty (beta =
   20.47), inequality (beta = 0.97), deprivation (beta = 0.11), and fuel
   poverty (beta = 0.44), and several indicators of residential thermal
   standards are found to be significantly related to variations in
   relative excess winter mortality at the 5\% level. The strong, positive
   relation with environmental temperature and strong negative relation
   with thermal efficiency indicate that housing standards in southern and
   western Europe play strong parts in such seasonality.
   Conclusions: High seasonal mortality in southern and western Europe
   could be reduced through improved protection from the cold indoors,
   increased public spending on health care, and improved socioeconomic
   circumstances resulting in more equitable income distribution.}},

   carbon nanotubes of different helicities and diameters between 5.5 and
   10.8 A. The systems contain from 112 to 268 atoms and were optimized
   under periodic boundary conditions in the axial direction. Both the
   carbon networks and the overall tube dimensions were optimized. Most of
   the C-C bond lengths are slightly lengthened relative to graphene ( two-
   dimensional graphite); the others remain essentially the same or are
   shorter. There is overall a longitudinal compression of the tube. The
   strain energy per atom, relative to graphene, varies inversely with the
   square of the tube radius. The Young's moduli decrease with increasing
   radius but do not depend upon chirality. The Poisson ratios are nearly
   constant. The consequences of removing an electron from each system were
   also investigated. In most instances, the tube dimensions were little
   affected; in only a few cases is there a change in length or radius (
   positive or negative) as large as 0.10\%. The Young's moduli remain the

Abstract = {{Investigators in clinical research are often interested in determining
   the association between patient characteristics and cost of medical or
   surgical treatment. However, there is no uniformly agreed upon
   regression model with which to analyse cost data. The objective of the
   current study was to compare the performance of linear regression,
   linear regression with log-transformed cost, generalized linear models
   with Poisson, negative binomial and gamma distributions, median
   regression, and proportional hazards models for analysing costs in a
   cohort of patients undergoing CABG surgery. The study was performed on
   data comprising 1959 patients who underwent CABG surgery in Calgary,
   Alberta, between June 1994 and March 1998. Ten of 21 patient
   characteristics were significantly associated with cost of surgery in
   all seven models. Eight variables were not significantly associated with
   cost of surgery in all seven models. Using mean squared prediction error
   as a loss function, proportional hazards regression and the three
   generalized linear models were best able to predict cost in independent
   validation data. Using mean absolute error, linear regression with
   log-transformed cost, proportional hazards regression, and median
   regression to predict median cost, were best able to predict cost in
   independent validation data. Since the models demonstrated good
   consistency in identifying factors associated with increased cost of
   CABG surgery, any of the seven models can be used for identifying
   factors associated with increased cost of surgery. However, the
   magnitude of, and the interpretation of, the coefficients vary across
   models. Researchers are encouraged to consider a variety of candidate
   models, including those better known in the econometrics literature,
   rather than begin data analysis with one regression model selected a
   priori. The final choice of regression model should be made after a
   careful assessment of how best to assess predictive ability and should
   be tailored to the particular data in question. Copyright (C) 2003 John

Abstract = {{The article reports on structure and mechanical properties of Ti-B alloy
   films sputter deposited from a sintered TiB2 target using an unbalanced
   do magnetron. We present results of a systematic investigation of the
   effect of negative substrate bias, Us, substrate ion current density
   i(s), and substrate temperature, T-s, on properties of Ti-B films. The
   X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis shows that the Ti-B films consist of
   the hexagonal TiB2 phase with the typical (0001) texture only. The TiBx
   films are over-stoichiometric with the ratio x=B/Ti approximate to 2.4.
   All Ti-B films sputter ion plated in argon magnetron discharge are
   superhard films with hardness H>40 GPa and exhibit high values of (i)
   effective Young's modulus E{*}=E/(1-v(2)) up to approximately 600 GPa
   and (ii) elastic recovery, W-e, up to approximately 82\%; here E and v
   are the Young's modulus and the Poisson's ratio, respectively. Besides,
   it was found that the value of the Bragg's angle 29 of the (0001)
   reflection line can be easily controlled by the energy delivered to the
   film during its growth by (1) the substrate heating T-s and (2) ion
   bombardment (Us, is). The angle 26 of the (0001) reflection increases
   with increasing Ts from 300 to 550 C and decreasing US from -150 to -50
   V In this range of process parameters, the energy E-p delivered to the
   growing film per condensing atom by ion bombardment can be adjusted to a
   value, at which the (0001) reflection from sputtered films is close to
   that of the TiB2(0001) powder standard. These films exhibit a low
   macrostress, which approaches to zero. It enables to sputter thick (up
   to 8 mum) superhard (H > 40 GPa) Ti-B films. The optimum value of E-p is
   achieved when the Ti-B film is sputtered at U-s = -50 V, i(s) =1
   mA/cm(2), T-s = 550 degreesC with a deposition rate a(D) = 52 nm/min.
   The Ti-B film prepared under these conditions exhibits a maximum
   hardness of H = 77 GPa, measured using a computer controlled
   microhardness tester Fischerscope H100 at the Vickers diamond indenter

Abstract = {{A soft elastohydrodynamic lubrication model is formulated for deformable
   roll coating involving two contra-rotating rolls, one rigid and the
   other covered with a compliant layer. Included is a finite-strip model
   (FSM) for the deformation of the layer and a lubrication model with
   suitable boundary conditions for the motion of the fluid. The scope of
   the analysis is restricted to Newtonian fluids, linear
   elasticity/viscoelasticity and equal roll speeds, with application to
   the industrially relevant highly loaded or `negative gap' regime.
   Predictions are presented for coated film thickness, interroll
   thickness, meniscus location, pressure and layer deformation as the
   control parameters - load (gap), elasticity, layer thickness and
   capillary number, Ca - are varied. There are four main results:
   (1) Hookean spring models are shown to be unable to model effectively
   the deformation of a compliant layer when Poisson's ratio nu --> 0.5. In
   particular, they fall to predict the swelling of the layer at the edge
   of the contact region which increases as v - 0.5; they also fail to
   locate accurately the position of the meniscus, X-M, and to identify the
   presence, close to the meniscus, of a `nib' (constriction in gap
   thickness) and associated magnification of the sub-ambient pressure
   loop.
   (ii) Scaling arguments suggest that layer thickness and elasticity may
   have similar effects on the field variables. It is shown that for
   positive gaps this is true, whereas for negative gaps they have similar
   effects on the pressure profile and flow rate yet quite different
   effects on layer swelling (deformation at the edge of the contact
   region) and different effects on X-M.
   (iii) For negative gaps and Ca similar to O(1), the effect of varying
   either viscosity or speed and hence Ca is to significantly alter both
   the coating thickness and X-M. This is contrary to the case of fixed-gap
   rigid roll coating.
   (iv) Comparison between theoretical predictions and experimental data
   shows quantitive agreement in the case of X-M and qualitive agreement
   for flow rate. It is shown that this difference in the latter case may
   be due to viscoelastic effects in the compliant layer.}},

Abstract = {{The space charge model (SCM) relies on the Poisson-Boltzmann (PB)
   equation, and hence on the assumption of negligible ion size effects, to
   calculate the radial distribution of the electrical potential and ionic
   concentrations. The consideration of nanopores and/or high surface
   charge densities demands that we account for the finite ion size. In
   this work, the SCM has been extended by including the ion size effects
   in the modified PB equation, in the transport equations, and in the
   diffusion coefficients, through the Renkin function. The ion size
   effects on the electrokinetic flow through a nanoporous membrane caused
   by a concentration gradient under open circuit and no applied pressure
   gradient conditions have been analyzed. The conditions for the
   observation of the negative anomalous osmosis have also been studied. It
   has been concluded from the calculations that ion size effects decrease
   the average ionic concentrations in the pore solution, reduce the
   absolute values of the average solute flux density and the average
   solution velocity, and increase the absolute value of the membrane
   potential. Since the reduction in the solute flux density is quite
   significant, it is concluded that this extension of the SCM should be
   used, at least, when analyzing permeability measurements.}},

Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{57}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{519-522}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Background: The study describes variations in use of surgical procedures
   by community income in the Netherlands. From the literature it is known
   that surgical rates have a socioeconomic gradient. Both positive and
   negative associations of socioeconomic factors of patients ( for
   example, income, education) with surgical rates have been reported. The
   question raised here is: how do ( possible) socioeconomic variations in
   surgery in the Netherlands compare with variations observed elsewhere?
   Data and Methods: The data comprised Dutch hospital discharges and
   population estimates for 1999. Socioeconomic status was indicated by a
   patient's income and based on the average family income of the postcode
   area of residence. Poisson regression was used to compute relative
   incidence ( odds ratios) for 10 common surgical procedures. The model
   included age, gender, degree of urbanisation, and province of residence.
   Results: The association between surgical rates and community level
   income is rather weak. For half of the surgical rates the authors
   observed higher utilisation rates in communities with low income levels,
   but the differences are small. The range of odds ratios in the lowest
   income quintile group ( compared with the group with the highest income)
   observed is: 0.87 to 1.18. Men from a low income community received more
   appendicectomies ( 1.18), cholecystectomies ( 1.12), knee replacements (
   1.06), and prostatectomies ( 1.14) and less tonsillectomies ( 0.90).
   Women from a low income community received more appendicectomies (
   1.12), caesarean sections ( 1.18), hip and knee replacements (
   1.05,1.17), and hysterectomies ( 1.14). Whereas they received less
   coronary artery bypass grafts ( 0.92), cholecystectomies ( 0.87), and
   tonsillectomies ( 0.92).
   Conclusions: Compared with findings reported in the international
   literature, this study indicates that variations in use of surgical
   procedures by community income in the Netherlands are comparatively
   small. Because of lack of data the authors could not study the influence
   of variations in need for surgical care by community income, but as the
   incidence of conditions requiring surgical interventions generally is
   higher in lower income groups, it is suspected some degree of
   underutilisation exists in these groups.}},

Abstract = {{The wave propagation in sandwich beams with cellular core is analyzed
   and controlled. The material properties of cellular cores are highly
   dependent on the geometry of the cell composing the honeycomb structure.
   Core materials of different geometry placed periodically along the beam
   length introduce the proper impedance mismatch necessary to impede the
   propagation of waves along the beam.
   A theoretical model is developed to describe the wave propagation
   characteristics and the vibration of the sandwich beam. The model is
   used to obtain the transfer matrix for a unit cell of the considered
   periodic structure, which is then used to analyze the dynamics of wave
   propagation along the beam. The transfer matrix is also properly recast
   in order to obtain the dynamic stiffness matrix and formulate a spectral
   finite element model for the periodic sandwich beam. The spectral finite
   element model employs dynamic shape functions obtained from the solution
   of the distributed parameter model, which allow predicting the dynamic
   behavior of the structure with a significantly reduced number of
   elements as compared to conventional FEM.
   The transfer matrix of the sandwich beam identifies the location of the
   frequency bands where travelling waves are attenuated. The influence of
   core geometry and periodicity on the location and extension of these
   stop bands is assessed through a series of simulations. The effect of
   the periodicity of the structure is also evaluated by considering the
   vibration response of a clamped free beam excited by the harmonic motion
   of the base. The results demonstrate the simplicity and the
   effectiveness of the proposed treatment whereby the transmission of
   waves and the vibration over specified frequency bands can be
   significantly reduced without requiring additional passive or active
   control devices. The unique characteristics of cellular solids therefore
   can be used to design light-weight composite panels that behave as
   mechanical filters. The filtering capabilities of such passive composite
   panels may be easily changed and optimized to reduce their
   transmissibility over a desired frequency range without compromising the
   size and the weight of the structure.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, we address the problem of computing the distribution
   functions that can be expressed as discrete mixtures of continuous
   distributions. Examples include noncentral chisquare, noncentral beta,
   noncentral F, noncentral t, and the distribution of squared sample
   multiple correlation. We illustrate the need for improved algorithms by
   pointing out situations where existing algorithms fail to compute
   meaningful values of the cumulative distribution functions (cdf) under
   study. To address this problem we recommend an approach that can be
   easily incorporated to improve the existing algorithms. For the
   distributions of the squared sample multiple correlation coefficient,
   noncentral t, and noncentral chisquare, we apply the approach and give a
   detailed explanation of computing the cdf values. We present results of
   comparison studies carried out to validate the calculated values and
   computational times of our suggested approach. Finally, we give the
   algorithms for computing the distributions of the squared sample
   multiple correlation coefficient, noncentral t, and noncentral chisquare
   so that they can be coded in any desired computer language. (C) 2003

   and total OIs by country of origin. In a Cox proportional hazards
   regression analysis that controlled for HAART use, CD4 counts, and age,
   U.S.-born Latino women were more likely than Central American-born
   Latino women to develop an OI from 1996 to 2000 (hazard ratio {[}HR] =
   2.9, 95\% confidence intervals {[}CIs]: 1.3, 6.5). In a Poisson
   regression analysis, U.S.-born Latino men and women combined were at
   greater risk for HIV encephalopathy (RR = 3.4, 95\% CIs: 1.2, 10.0) and
   Kaposi's sarcoma (RR = 2.9, 95\% CIs: 1.1, 7.6). In addition to
   underreporting that may result from the use of English-based criteria
   for diagnosing HIV encephalopathy among Spanish-speaking patients, these
   HAART era data suggest that variation in OI risk among Latinos may also
   be explained by acculturation factors, such as loss of social support

Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{59}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{254-262}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Whenever inference for variance components is required, the choice
   between one-sided and two-sided tests is crucial. This choice is usually
   driven by whether or not negative variance components are permitted. For
   two-sided tests, classical inferential procedures can be followed, based
   on likelihood ratios, score statistics, or Wald statistics. For
   one-sided tests, however, one-sided test statistics need to be
   developed, and their null distribution derived. While this has received
   considerable attention in the context of the likelihood ratio test,
   there appears to be much confusion about the related problem for the
   score test. The aim of this paper is to illustrate that classical
   (two-sided) score test statistics, frequently advocated in practice,
   cannot be used in this context, but that well-chosen one-sided
   counterparts could be used instead. The relation with likelihood ratio
   tests will be established, and all results are illustrated in an
   analysis of continuous longitudinal data using linear mixed models.}},

Year = {{2003}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Cellular structures like honeycombs or reticulated micro-frames are
   widely used in sandwich construction because of their superior
   structural static and dynamic properties. The aim of this study is to
   evaluate the dynamic behavior of two-dimensional cellular structures,
   with the focus on the effect of the geometry of unit cells on the
   dynamics of the propagation of elastic waves within the structure.
   The characteristics of wave propagation for the considered class of
   cellular solids are analyzed through the finite element model of the
   unit cell and the application of the theory of periodic structures. This
   combined analysis yields the phase constant surfaces, which define the
   directions of waves propagating in the plane of the structure for the
   assigned frequency values. The analysis of iso-frequency contour lines
   in the phase constant surfaces allows the prediction of the location and
   extension of angular ranges, and therefore regions within the structures
   where waves do not propagate.
   The performance of honeycomb grids of regular hexagonal topology is
   compared with that of grids of various geometries, with the emphasis on
   configurations featuring a negative Poisson's ratio behavior. The
   harmonic response of the considered structures at specified frequencies
   confirms the predictions from the analysis of the phase constant
   surfaces and demonstrates the strongly spatially-dependent
   characteristics of periodic cellular structures.
   The numerical results presented indicate the potentials of the phase
   constant surfaces as tools for the evaluation of the wave propagation
   characteristics of this class of two-dimensional periodic structures.
   Optimal design configurations can be identified in order to achieve the
   desired transmissibility levels in specified directions and to obtain
   efficient vibration isolation capabilities. The findings from the
   presented investigations and the described analysis methodology will
   provide invaluable guidelines for the prototyping of future concepts of
   honeycombs or cellular structures with enhanced vibro-acoustics
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{Between 1991 and mid 2000, the surveillance of Bovine Spongiform
   Encephalopathy (BSE) in France was based solely on clinical surveillance
   through a Mandatory Reporting System. Since 2000, the implementation of
   active surveillance programmes using rapid tests, as a complementary
   tool targeted at dead and slaughtered cattle has shown that part of the
   BSE cases were not detected with the clinical surveillance. In order to
   obtain a better knowledge of the strength of the clinical surveillance,
   we analysed a vigilance index defined as the ratio of negative clinical
   suspicions to the cattle population in the region and period of
   interest. The temporal analysis of the vigilance index showed that it
   did not vary much between 1991 and 1999, increased sharply since 2000,
   and then decreased partly in 2001. The geographical analysis of the
   variations of the vigilance index was performed at the department level
   by comparing the observed number of negative clinical suspicions per
   department to the expected number, computed on the basis of the national
   average index and standardised on the production type of the
   cattle-dairy versus beef suckling cattle. As assumed, the data followed
   a Poisson distribution. We observed a high geographical variation of the
   vigilance index: ten departments out of 91 presented a significantly
   higher vigilance index than the national one, and four a significantly
   lower vigilance index. The vigilance index showed that the clinical
   surveillance was heterogeneous during the past twelve years, both in
   time and geographic location, in a range of one to ten. So the apparent
   trend in the BSE epidemic during this period as well as the differences
   in the spatial incidence of BSE have to be analysed with caution.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, materials with negative poisson's ratio properties have

   negative poisson's ratio of the polyolefin blends was investigated by
   using a YJY stress flake deformation transducer. A maximum value of - 9
   was observed for the poisson's ratio of the blends, and the stable value
   for samples may reach - 1.4. The morphology of the blends was also
   studied. The results showed that the convacation phenomenon occurred

Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{35}},

Abstract = {{Poisson and negative binomial (NB) models have been used to analyze
   traffic accident occurrence at intersections for several years. There
   are however, limitations in the use of such models. The Poisson model
   requires the variance-to-mean ratio of the accident data to be about 1.
   Both the Poisson and the NB models require the accident data to be
   uncorrelated in time. Due to unobserved heterogeneity and serial
   correlation in the accident data, both models seem to be inappropriate.
   A more suitable alternative is the random effect negative binomial
   (RENB) model, which by treating the data in a time-series cross-section
   panel, will be able to deal with the spatial and temporal effects in the
   data.
   This paper describes the use of RENB model to identify the elements that
   affect intersection safety. To establish the suitability of the model,
   several goodness-of-fit statistics are used. The model is then applied
   to investigate the relationship between accident occurrence and the
   geometric, traffic and control characteristics of signalized

Abstract = {{Systems of model planar, nonconvex, hard-body ``molecules{''} of
   fivefold and sevenfold symmetry axes are studied by constant pressure
   Monte Carlo simulations with variable shape of the periodic box. The
   molecules, referred to as pentamers (heptamers), are composed of five
   (seven) identical hard disks ``atoms{''} with centers forming regular
   pentagons (heptagons) of sides equal to the disk diameter. The elastic
   compliances of defect-free solid phases are computed by analysis of

   within the same run in which the elastic properties are computed.
   Results obtained by using pseudorandom number generators based on the
   idea proposed by Holian and co-workers {[}Holian , Phys. Rev. E 50, 1607
   (1994)] are in good agreement with the results generated by DRAND48. It
   is shown that singular behavior of the elastic constants near close
   packing is in agreement with the free volume approximation; the
   coefficients of the leading singularities are estimated. The simulations
   prove that the highest density structures of heptamers (in which the

Abstract = {{Background: Hormonal contraceptives have been associated with increased
   risk of HIV acquisition.
   Methods: The association between hormonal contraception use and HIV
   acquisition was assessed in a rural community-based cohort in Rakai
   District, Uganda. A group of 5117 sexually active HIV-negative women
   were surveyed at 10 month intervals between 1994 and 1999. Information
   on demographic and sociobehavioral characteristics, use of hormonal
   contraception (pill and injectable methods), condoms and the number of
   sexual partners was obtained by home-based interview. HIV incidence rate
   ratios (IRR) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) associated with hormonal
   contraception were estimated by multivariate Poisson regression after
   adjustment for age, condom use, number of sexual partners, marital
   status, education and history of genital ulcer disease.
   Results: At one or more interviews, 16.6\% of women reported use of
   hormonal contraceptives and 23.0\% reported condom use. HIV incidence
   was 2.3/100 person-years in hormonal contraceptive users compared with
   1.5/100 person-years in non-hormonal contraceptive users (unadjusted
   IRR, 1.56; 95\% CI, 1.00-2.33). After multivariate adjustment, the IRR
   associated with hormonal contraceptives was reduced to 0.94 (95\% CI,
   0.53-1.64). The adjusted IRR was 1.12 (95\% CI, 0.48-2.56) with oral
   contraceptive use and 0.84 (95\% CI, 0.41-1.72) with injectable methods.
   Conclusion: Use of hormonal contraception is not associated with HIV
   acquisition after adjustment for behavioral confounding. (C) 2003

Title = {{Practical assessment of the models for identification of defect-prone

Volume = {{65}},

Abstract = {{The goal of this paper is to investigate and assess the ability of
   explanatory models based on design metrics to describe and predict
   defect counts in an object-oriented software system. Specifically, we
   empirically evaluate the influence of design decisions to defect
   behavior of the classes in two products from the commercial software
   domain. Information provided by these models can help in resource
   allocation and serve as a base for assessment and future improvements.
   We use innovative statistical methods to deal with the peculiarities of
   the software engineering data, such as non-normally distributed count
   data. To deal with overdispersed data and excess of zeroes in the
   dependent variable, we use negative binomial (NB) and zero-inflated NB
   regression in addition to Poisson regression.
   Furthermore, we form a framework for comparison of models' descriptive
   and predictive ability. Predictive capability of the models to identify
   most critical classes in the system early in the software development
   process can help in allocation of resources and foster software quality
   improvement. In addition to the correlation coefficients, we use
   additional statistics to assess a models' ability to explain high
   variability in the data and Pareto analysis to assess a models' ability
   to identify the most critical classes in the system.
   Results indicate that design aspects related to communication between
   classes and inheritance can be used as indicators of the most
   defect-prone classes, which require the majority of resources in
   development and testing phases. The zero-inflated negative binomial
   regression model, designed to explicitly model the occurrence of zero
   counts in the dataset, provides the best results for this purpose. (C)

Abstract = {{We use molecular dynamics simulations to study attractive interactions
   and the underlying ionic correlations between parallel like-charged rods
   in the absence of additional salt. For a generic bulk system of rods we
   identify a reduction of short-range repulsions as the origin of a
   negative osmotic coefficient. The counterions show signs of a weak
   three-dimensional order in the attractive regime only once the
   rod-imposed charge inhomogeneities are divided out. We also treat the
   case of attraction between a single pair of rods for a few selected line
   charge densities and rod radii, Measurements of the individual
   contributions to the force between close rods are studied as a function
   of Bjerrum length. We find that even though the total force is always
   attractive at sufficiently high Bjerrum length, the electrostatic
   contribution can ultimately become repulsive. We also measure azimuthal
   and longitudinal correlation functions to answer the question how
   condensed ions are distributed with respect to each other and to the
   neighboring rod. For instance, we show that the prevalent image of
   mutually interlocked ions is qualitatively correct, even though
   modifications due to thermal fluctuations are usually strong.}},

Abstract = {{The finite element (FE) method has been used to study the mechanical and
   thermal properties of both conventional and re-entrant (i.e. negative
   Poisson's ratio) honeycombs, which may be used as the cores of sandwich
   panel composites. Failure of the honeycomb structures was simulated
   using a crack propagation method developed in-house. The cell-wall
   stress build up in the conventional honeycomb was calculated to be
   significantly reduced relative to the re-entrant honeycomb under (2D)
   hydrostatic loading, implying that the conventional core will undergo
   significantly less internal damage than the re-entrant core. Conversely,
   the re-entrant honeycomb performs better than the conventional honeycomb
   under thermal loading conditions. The size and pathway of the crack
   formed during the simulation is dependent on the failure stress
   distribution used in the crack propagation routine. (C) 2003 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Dynamic behaviour of a beam subjected to a random train of moving SDOF
   oscillators is investigated. The train of oscillators idealizes the
   stream of vehicles moving over a bridge. The arrivals of the vehicles
   are assumed to be governed by a Poisson counting process and the
   vehicles are assumed to travel at the same constant speed. The
   deflection function of the beam is expanded in terms of approximating
   functions, thus the multi-degree-of-freedom model is obtained. Due to
   the interactions between the motion of the beam and vertical motions of
   the oscillators the resulting ordinary differential equations of motion
   have time-varying coefficients. The number of equations equals n+m,
   where n is the number of degrees of freedom for the beam and m is the
   random number of oscillators, which are simultaneously on the beam; in
   other words the total number of equations varies randomly with time. A
   Monte Carlo simulation method is used to find the mean value and the
   variance of the beam deflection. A sample train of oscillators is
   obtained by sampling the interarrival times from the
   negative-exponential distribution. The equations of motion for each
   sample train of oscillators are solved numerically, using Matlab's ODE
   solvers. The computations have been performed for equal masses of the
   oscillators. The results obtained for a moderately short bridge and
   typical mean arrival rates of vehicles reveal that the transient maxima
   of the mean response occur within first few passage times and the
   response variance becomes then essentially steady. Based on the analysis
   of vehicle occurrence probabilities a simplified simulation technique is
   proposed where the train consists of first few oscillators only. The
   numerical results show that the proposed simplified technique allows the
   prediction of the maximum transient response accurately enough.}},

Abstract = {{Unbound aggregate base layers in a quarry haul road in Georgia were
   characterized using embedded sensors and in situ seismic testing. Two
   sections of the road were constructed as inverted pavements, one using a
   South African Roads Board method and the other using a conventional
   Georgia Department of Transportation method. A third was constructed
   using a traditional method. Miniaturized versions of traditional
   cross-hole and downhole seismic tests were conducted to determine the
   stiffnesses of each base layer. Horizontally propagating compression and
   shear waves were measured under four different loading conditions to
   determine Young's moduli and Poisson's ratios of the base. An increase
   in stiffness with an increase in load was measured. Additionally, it was
   found that the Georgia and South Africa sections had similar
   stiffnesses. Surprisingly, the traditional section was found to be
   somewhat stiffer than the other sections. This higher stiffness is
   thought to be caused by a prolonged period of compaction before
   construction of the unbound aggregate base layer, which essentially
   transforms the traditional section into an inverted pavement. Using the
   vertical total normal stresses computed from ILLI-PAVE, a value of 0.3
   for the earth pressure coefficient was found to be reasonable for this
   material in determining the radial total normal stresses. The radial
   effective normal stresses were calculated from the radial total normal
   stresses and experimentally determined pore water pressures.
   Additionally, the negative pore water pressures in the partially
   saturated granular base had a significant impact on the stiffness of the
   unbound aggregate base layer, especially under small load levels.}},

Pages = {{376-383}},
Abstract = {{A two-region model for describing the conductivity of porous fixed
   charge membranes is proposed. In the surface region, the conductivity is
   due to the mobile positive ions (counterions) around the negative fixed
   charges. In the pore center region, the conductive properties resemble
   those of the external electrolyte solution because the fixed charges are
   assumed to be effectively neutralized by the counterions in the surface
   region. Activation energies and surface diffusion coefficients are
   estimated by assuming that the counterion jump from a fixed charge group
   is the rate limiting process for surface transport. The barrier energy
   for this jump is calculated using a simple electrostatic model with two
   microscopic parameters, the sum of the counterion and fixed charge
   hydration radii and the local dielectric constant. The bulk conductivity
   is obtained from experimental data. The total membrane conductivity and
   the counterion transport number are then calculated as functions of the
   external solution concentration for several pore radii and membrane
   fixed charge concentrations. The results are compared with those given
   by the Donnan model for homogeneous membranes and by the numerical
   solution of a continuous model based on the Poisson Boltzmann equation
   extended to finite size ions. The study of the membrane conductivity for
   a series of electrolytes allows to distinguish clearly between the
   mechanism characteristic of the bulk ionic conductivity and that of
   surface conductivity. The surface conductivity is found to be
   significant for narrow pores at low external solution concentrations.}},

   cell polyurethane gray foam for dynamic crash loading applications. The
   acoustic absorption coefficients and real and imaginary part of the
   specific acoustic impedance have been measured with an ASTM standard
   impedance tube using a transmissibility technique. The foam shows a
   significant increase of the absorption properties in the low frequency
   range compared to equivalent conventional open cell foams. The acoustic
   properties of the foams are identified using an empirical model to

Abstract = {{In this paper we consider interval estimation of the mean in the natural
   Exponential family with a quadratic variance function; the family
   comprises the binomial, Poisson, negative binomial, normal, gamma, and a
   sixth distribution.
   For the three discrete cases, the Wald confidence interval and three
   alternative intervals are examined by means of two term Edgeworth
   expansions of the coverage probability and a two term expansion of the
   expected length. The results and additional computation suggest that the
   equal tailed Jeffreys interval and the likelihood ratio interval are the
   best overall alternatives to the Wald interval. We also show that the
   poor performance of the Wald interval is not limited to the discrete
   cases, and a serious negative bias occurs in the nonnormal continuous
   cases as well. The results axe complemented by various illustrative

Abstract = {{The electric field effect (EFE) in a coaxial cylindrical capacitor
   configuration was used to study the modification of transport and
   thermoelectric properties of the semiconductors PbTe and Bi2Te3 as glass
   coated microwires. Theoretical analysis of microwire EFE was done on the
   basis of Poisson equation in cylindrical geometry with corresponding
   boundary conditions. The radial dependences of transport characteristics
   have been calculated for PbTe and Bi2Te3 wires at positive and negative
   polarity of the gate voltage under the assumption that the carrier
   mobility is similar with the bulk material mobility. Some aspects of
   microwire fabrication by different methods as well as some general wire
   characteristics are presented. The first results of experimental
   measurements of wire transport properties under EFE show the increasing
   or decreasing of the average Seebeck coefficient in dependence of gate
   potential polarity in accordance with the theoretical analysis.}},

Abstract = {{A clinical trial was carried out in two provinces of Canada to
   investigate the effect of treatment with eprinomectin at calving on
   production parameters in adult dairy cattle in 1999-2000. One of the
   objectives of this study was to evaluate the impact of treatment on
   reproductive performance as measured by: calving-to-conception interval,
   calving-to-first service interval and number of services per conception.
   The ability of an indirect ELISA using a crude adult Ostertagia
   ostertagi antigen to predict response to treatment also was evaluated.
   All lactating cows in 20 dairy herds were allocated randomly to receive
   either eprinomectin pour-on or placebo at calving. Information on
   reproductive parameters was obtained from computerised cow records.
   Survival models were used to evaluate the effect of treatment on the two
   intervals and a Poisson model was used to evaluate the number of
   services to conception. A total of 549 cows were included in these
   analyses. A marginally significant treatment effect on
   calving-to-conception interval was observed (hazard ratio = 1.24, P =
   0.06) but not on calving-to-first service interval. A significant
   reduction in the number of breedings to conception for treated animals
   also was observed with a longer effect in cows with short interval to
   first service. Milk samples from a subset of 109 late-lactation cows
   were tested for antibodies against O. ostertagi. The ELISA
   optical-density ratio (ODR) values obtained between 120 days before
   calving and drying off were categorised as high ODR (greater than or
   equal to0.5) and low ODR (<0.5). Among untreated animals, the hazard of
   conception was lower (hazard ratio = 0.38, 95\% Cl = {[}0.19, 0.75]) for
   high-ODR cows compared to low ODR cows suggesting that higher parasite
   burdens had an adverse effect on reproductive performance. Treated
   high-ODR cows had a hazard of conception equivalent to the hazard for
   all cows in the low-ODR group (indicating that treatment prevented the
   negative effect associated with these higher parasite burdens). (C) 2002

Abstract = {{All of the thermal and elastic constants of the high-aspect ratio,

   in-plane thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) (alpha(1)) was determined
   by TMA, and the glass transition behavior was studied by DMTA. The TGA
   study provided information about the thermal stability of the material,
   and DSC was applied to study the thermal calorimetric properties of the
   material. The in-plane Young's modulus (E-1) was measured by tensile
   tests. The residual stresses of a 1D stretched ribbon sample and a 2D
   stretched membrane sample were measured by vibrational holography tests,
   and the in-plane Poisson's ratio (nu(1)) was also determined by
   holography. The out-of-plane Poisson's ratio (nu(2)) was obtained by
   high pressure gas dilatometry measurements. The bulk compressibility
   (kappa) and the volumetric TEC (alpha(v)) of the material were measured
   by a pressure-volume-temperature (PVT) apparatus. Finally, the
   out-of-plane properties, including the out-of-plane TEC (alpha(2)) and
   the out-of-plane Young's modulus (E-2), were calculated from the
   measured in-plane properties and the volumetric properties. Therefore,
   the compliance matrix of the studied SU8 coating could be obtained. (C)

Abstract = {{Two examples of charged media in water are studied by numerical
   simulations: aqueous solutions of highly asymmetrical electrolytes
   (large and highly charged spherical particles Surrounded by small and
   slightly charged counterions) and a swelling clay (charged plane sheets
   surrounded by small counterions). In the former example. Brownian
   dynamics (BID) showed that the mean number of counterions in the
   vicinity of polyions nearly balances the charge of the macroion and that
   the turnover of the small ions in this region is important. The effect
   of hydrodynamic interactions on the dynamics is weak for small ions but
   is great for macroions. On the other hand, the relative decrease of the
   macroion self-diffusion coefficients is more important than that of
   counterions. Moreover, the small ions retain a relatively high
   self-diffusion coefficient at the highest concentration, a concentration
   at which the macroions freeze. BD simulation was also used to obtain the
   distribution of counterions Na+ between the sheets of a fairly hydrated
   montmorillonite. The obtained profile was very similar to those we
   obtained by atomic simulations (Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics) and
   by a Poisson-Boltzmann treatment. It justifies the description of the
   solvent as a continuum as soon as the system is hydrated enough.
   However, for less hydrated states of the clay (mono- or bi-layer of
   water), only atomic simulations can bring exploitable information. We
   showed that, according to whether the counterion is Na+ and/or Cs+, the
   behaviours in the bihydrated clay are very different: although Na+ is
   easily hydrated and is located in the middle of the pores, Cs+ remains
   close to the negative surfaces of the sheets and its preferential paths
   along the surface sites can be underscored from obtained trajectories.}},

Abstract = {{The mathematical formalism of the steady-state Poisson equation is
   applied to a variant of Freeman Dyson's ``Toy Model{''} for a first
   origin. Our kinetic approach allows for an examination of the requisite
   conditions under which metabolism is quantized into discrete eigenstates
   (e.g. Dyson's disordered, saddle point, and metabolically active toy
   cell states). The surface reaction machinery additionally allows for
   more realistic modeling, whence the crucial role of sticking
   coefficients (catalyst precursors) as prebiotic selectors emerges. In
   our interior source model, a steady influx of vent nutrients fuels the
   intracellular synthesis of (impermeable) monomers within a
   rock-encradled cavity. Random adsorptions and desorptions occur at
   inactive ``cell{''} wall sites (where the inert monomers remain
   impermeable until their eventual return to the intracellular metabolite
   pool). Occasionally, metabolizing reactions also occur due to
   endogeneous source monomers adsorbing at their ``active{''} sites.
   Dyson's mean field approach is used to simplify the species-specific
   sticking coefficients at empty active (substrate) sites to functions of
   the fraction x of sites occupied by (catalytically) active monomers. In
   short, our work suggests that disorder-order transition models based on
   random drift between discrete metabolic eigenstates (Dyson's Toy Model)
   do not, in general, extend to more realistic metabolisms. From a
   perspective based on quasi-random feedback kinetics, the
   contraindication for discretization (spontaneous generation) in
   non-autocatalytic metabolisms is consistent with the emergence of
   ordered metabolism under hydrothermal driving forces, a provisio the
   occurrence of each period of vent dormancy coincides with a discrete
   zero-source (dormant) metabolic state. Cell drift to higher order is
   induced by the random reactions which happen to enhance the substrate
   specificity (chemical selectivity) of the sticking coefficients for
   active monomers. The result is stronger sink effects for metabolizing
   species, whence active adsorptions are promoted in favor of inactive
   adsorptions at substrate sites. Positive feedback plays a crucial role
   in preserving ({''}propagating{''}) order in the cell wall reaction
   kinetics and is held in check by negative feedback inhibition of
   excessive cell growth. Finally, the eventual desorption of randomly
   growing dysfunctional proteins is postulated as a deterrent to
   deterioration catastrophes. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Analytical investigations on the contact problems between two
   homogeneous and isotropic soft bodies were performed to simulate the
   contact of human buttocks and seat cushions. The cushion materials'
   Poisson's ratio were allowed to be negative. The human buttocks were
   modeled as an ideal sphere with radius 15 cm, and assumed to have a low
   Young's modulus and a Poisson's ratio close to 0.5. These parameters
   were held constant during our analysis. Peak contact pressure was
   reduced by adjusting the contour curvature of cushions according to
   Hertz theory, as expected. Moreover, analysis by both the Hertz model
   and a finite thickness 3D elasticity model showed that using negative
   Poisson's ratio cushions could further reduce the pressure. Negative
   Poisson's ratio cushions may be beneficial in the prevention of pressure
   sores or ulcers in the sick and in reduction of pressure-induced
   discomfort in seated people. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The wave propagation in and the vibration of sandwich plates with
   cellular core are analyzed and controlled. Negative Poisson's ratio
   (auxetic) core materials of different geometry placed periodically in
   the plate introduce the proper impedance mismatch necessary to obstruct
   the propagation of waves over specified frequency bands (stop bands) and
   in particular directions. The location and the extension of the stop
   bands and the directions of wave propagation can be modified by proper
   selection of the periodicity and of the geometrical and physical
   properties of the core.
   A finite element model is developed to predict the dynamic response of
   three-layered sandwich panels with honeycomb core. The finite element
   model along with the theory of periodic structures evaluates the
   influence of core materials of different geometry placed periodically
   along the two dimensions of the structure. This combined analysis yields
   the phase constant surfaces for the considered sandwich plates, which
   define location and extension of the stop bands, as well as the
   directions of wave propagation at assigned frequency values. The
   analysis of the phase constant surfaces and the evaluation of the
   harmonic response at specified frequencies demonstrate the plates'
   directional properties, whose spatial patterns strongly depend on the
   configuration of the periodic core and on the excitation frequency.
   Auxetic honeycombs are here considered as core materials in order to
   obtain maximum design flexibility. Their elastic and inertial
   characteristics in fact vary substantially with their internal geometry.
   For given configurations they outcast up to five times the corresponding
   properties of traditional hexagonal honeycombs.
   The presented numerical results demonstrate the unique characteristics
   of this class of two-dimensional periodic structures, which behave as
   directional mechanical filters. The findings of the study suggest that
   optimal configurations for the periodic cellular core may be identified
   in order to design passive composite panels, which are stable and quiet
   over desired frequency bands and which fit desired transmissibility
   levels in particular directions. Such unique filtering capabilities are
   achieved without requiring additional passive or active control devices
   and therefore without compromising the size and the weight of the
   layered structure.}},

Abstract = {{The data analyzed in this paper are part of the results described in
   Bueno et al. (2000). Three cytogenetics endpoints were analyzed in three
   populations of a species of wild rodent - Akodon montensis - living in
   an industrial, an agricultural, and a preservation area at the Itajai
   Valley, State of Santa Catarina, Brazil. The
   polychromatic/normochromatic ratio, the mitotic index, and the frequency
   of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocites were used in an attempt to
   establish a genotoxic profile of each area. It was assumed that the
   three populations were in the same conditions with respect to the
   influence of confounding factors such as animal age, health, nutrition
   status, presence of pathogens, and intra- and inter-populational genetic
   variability. Therefore, any differences found in the endpoints analyzed
   could be attributed to the external agents present in each area. The
   statistical models used in this paper are mixtures of negative-binomials
   and Poisson variables. The Poisson variables are used as approximations
   of binomials for rare events. The mixing distributions are beta
   densities. The statistical analyzes are under the bayesian perspective,

Abstract = {{Changes in lipid composition have recently been shown to exert
   appreciable influences on the activities of membrane-bound proteins and
   peptides. We tested the hypothesis that the conformational states of
   rhodopsin linked to visual signal transduction are related to
   biophysical properties of the membrane lipid bilayer. For bovine
   rhodopsin, the meta I-meta II conformational transition was studied in
   egg phosphatidylcholine (PC) recombinants versus the native rod outer
   segment (ROS) membranes by means of flash photolysis, Formation of
   metarhodopsin II was observed by the change in absorbance at 478 nm
   after a single actinic flash was delivered to the sample. The meta
   I/meta II ratio was investigated as a function of both temperature and
   pH. The data clearly demonstrated thermodynamic reversibility of the
   transition for both the egg PC recombinants and the native ROS
   membranes. A significant shift of the apparent pK(a) for the acid-base
   equilibrium to lower values was evident in the egg PC recombinant, with
   little meta II produced under physiological conditions. Calculations of
   the membrane surface pH using a Poisson-Boltzmann model suggested the
   free energies of the meta I and meta 11 states were significantly
   affected by electrostatic properties of the bilayer lipids. In the ROS
   membranes, phosphatidylserine (PS) is needed for full formation of meta
   II, in combination with phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and
   polyunsaturated docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6omega3) chains. We
   propose that the PS surface potential leads to an accumulation of
   hydronium ions, H3O+, in the electrical double layer, which drive the
   reaction together with the large negative spontaneous curvature (H-0)
   conferred by PE plus DHA chains. The elastic stress/strain of the
   bilayer arises from an interplay of the similar to zero H-0 from PS and
   the negative H-0 due to the PE headgroups and polyunsaturated chains.
   The lipid influences are further explained in terms of matching of the
   bilayer spontaneous curvature to the curvature at the lipid/rhodopsin
   interface, as formulated by the Helfrich bending energy. These new
   findings guide current ideas as to how bilayer properties govern the
   conformational energetics of integral membrane proteins. Moreover, they
   yield knowledge of how membrane lipid-protein interactions involving
   acidic phospholipids such as PS and neutral polyunsaturated DHA chains
   are implicated in key biological functions such as vision.}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Electric polarization arising in hybrid aligned nematic liquid crystal
   layers with rigid boundary conditions is studied numerically by solving
   the torques equation and Poisson equation. Three phenomena that give
   rise to the polarization are taken into account: flexoelectricity,
   surface polarization and adsorption of ions. The director orientation
   within the layer, as well as the distribution of electric potential and
   space charge density are calculated for layers deformed by an external
   magnetic field. The role of the ionic space charge is investigated. For
   a particular set of parameters of a model substance, the voltage arising
   between the layer surfaces varies from 10(-1) V (in an extremely pure
   nematic) to 10(-3) V ( in material with a typical ion concentration).
   The surface polarization yields an additional voltage (of the order
   10(-2) V) nearly independent of the ion concentration. The effect of
   simultaneous flexoelectric polarization and ion adsorption is evidently
   different from a linear superposition of their separate contributions.
   The flexoelectric polarization leads to partial separation of ions of
   opposite signs. In the case of positive flexoelectric coefficients, a
   thin sublayer of positive charge arises at the planar-orienting boundary
   plate. The negative charge is displaced towards the homeotropically
   aligning plate. The magnitude of this effect increases with the magnetic
   field. The surface phenomena introduce additional subsurface charges.}},

Abstract = {{Apple scab (Venturia inaequalis) causes important economic losses in
   many apple production areas of the world. The disease is controlled by
   numerous fungicide applications regardless of the presence of ascospores
   in the orchard. Airborne ascospore concentration (AAC) can be measured
   in real time to time fungicide applications. However, the level of
   heterogeneity of the AAC in commercial orchards was unknown.
   Consequently, the spatial distribution of V. inaequalis ascospores was
   studied in a commercial apple orchard of 0.43 ha. The potential
   ascosporo dose (PAD) and AAC were measured in 40 quadrats each of 108
   m(2). In each quadrat, the AAC was monitored during the major rain
   events in spring 1999 and 2000 using spore samplers. The
   variance-to-mean ratio for the PAD and for most of the AAC sampling
   dates was >1, indicating an aggregated pattern of distribution. None of
   the frequency distributions of the most important ascospore ejection
   events followed the Poisson probability distribution, indicating that
   the pattern of distribution was not random. For all events, AAC had an
   aggregated pattern of distribution as suggested by the negative binomial
   distribution. The PAD followed neither the Poisson nor the negative
   binomial distribution. Geostatistical analyses confirmed the aggregated
   pattern of distribution. The cultivars had an effect on the PAD and AAC
   distribution pattern, but both PAD and AAC were not uniformly
   distributed within a block of the same cultivar. Therefore, the number,
   location, and height of samplers required to estimate AAC in orchards
   need to be investigated before using information on AAC for decision
   making.}},

Abstract = {{Results derived from exact linear homogeneous elastodynamic theory are
   used for two-dimensional unloaded plates in order to understand certain
   features generated by proper symmetric Lamb modes. It is shown that S,
   modes for all elastic materials have a phase velocity defined below the
   usual critical frequency and which initially exhibits anomalous
   dispersion (has a negative slope with respect to frequency). Over a
   certain range, it has a phase velocity that is double valued. In
   addition, there are an infinite number of proper symmetric Lamb modes
   that have this characteristic for materials with a Poisson ratio equal
   to 1/3. It also appears that all A(3n) modes are anomalous when V(L)less
   than or equal to2V(T). The cause and implication of these effects are
   examined, including an associated negative group velocity over a small
   frequency zone for these modes. Further, it is noted that all proper
   symmetric Lamb modes have a plateau region in phase velocity with
   respect to wave number. It is shown that this always occurs for a phase
   velocity corresponding to the longitudinal bulk velocity of the elastic
   material. These issues are examined along with how one may obtain
   material parameters and possibly plate thickness from their dispersion

Volume = {{21}},

Abstract = {{Background. The objective of this study was to examine central venous
   catheter (CVC)-related nosocomial blood stream infection risks of
   umbilical venous, percutaneous and Broviac catheters, as well as
   variations in CVC use and CVC-related risk for nosocomial blood stream
   infection in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).
   Methods. A cohort study was performed based on 19 507 infants admitted
   to 17 NICUs in the Canadian Neonatal Network from January, 1996, through
   October, 1997. Information on these subjects was prospectively collected
   by trained abstractors. Incidence of infection was measured as infection
   episodes per 1000 patient days. The risk ratio (RR) of CVC use for
   nosocomial blood stream infection was calculated as the infection rate
   during catheter days divided by the infection rate during noncatheter
   days. Using a Poisson regression model we examined the adjusted RR of
   CVC use for nosocomial blood stream infection, controlling for patient
   characteristics and illness severity at admission. Interinstitutional
   variations in CVC-related infection risks were examined by stratified
   analyses.
   Results. CVC were used in 22.5\% of patients. The incidence of
   nosocomial blood stream infection was 2.9 per 1000 noncatheter days, 7.2
   per 1000 umbilical venous catheter days, 13.1 per 1000 percutaneous
   catheter days and 12.1 per 1000 Broviac catheter days. The RR for
   nosocomial blood stream infection, adjusted for differences in patient
   characteristics and admission illness severity, was 2.5 for umbilical
   venous catheter, 4.6 for percutaneous catheter and 4.3 for Broviac
   catheter (P < 0.05). There were significant (P < 0.05) risk-adjusted
   variations in CVC-related infection risks among NICUs.
   Conclusions. CVC use increased the risk of nosocomial blood stream
   infection. The risk of nosocomial blood stream infection in percutaneous
   and Broviac catheters was 70 to 80\% higher than in umbilical venous
   catheters. There was significant variation in CVC-related infection
   risks among Canadian NICUs.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the linkage between Mg2+ binding and RNA folding requires
   a proper theoretical model describing the energetics of Mg2+ binding to
   the folded and unfolded states of RNA. Our current understanding of Mg2+
   binding to these different RNA states derives from empirical
   thermodynamic models that depend on a number of unjustified assumptions.
   We present a rigorous theoretical model describing the linkage between
   RNA folding and magnesium ion binding. In this model, based on the
   non-linear Poisson-Boltzmann (NLPB) equation, the stabilization of RNA
   by Mg2+ arises from two distinct binding modes, diffuse binding and site
   binding. Diffusely bound Mg2+ are described as an ensemble of hydrated
   ions that are attracted to the negative charge of the RNA. Site-bound
   Mg2+ are partially desolvated ions that are attracted to electronegative
   pockets on the RNA surface. We explore two systems, yeast tRNA(Phe) and
   a 58-nucleotide rRNA fragment, with different Mg2+ binding properties.
   The NLPB equation accurately describes both the stoichiometric and
   energetic linkage between imaging for both of these systems without
   requiring any fitted parameters in the calculation. Moreover, the NLPB
   model presents a well-defined physical description of how Mg2+ binding
   helps fold an RNA. For both of the molecules studied here, the relevant
   unfolded state is a disordered intermediate state (1) that contains
   stable helical secondary structure without any tertiary contacts.
   Diffusely bound Mg2+ interact with these secondary structure elements to
   stabilize the I state. The secondary structural elements of the I state
   fold into a compact, native tertiary structure (the N state). Diffuse
   binding plays a dominant role in stabilizing the N state for both RNAs
   studied. However, for the rRNA fragment, site-binding to a location with
   extraordinarily high electrostatic potential is also coupled to folding.
   Our results suggest that much experimental data measuring the linkage
   between Mg2+ binding and RNA folding must be reinterpreted. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional, hard-body systems of cyclic multimers (pentamers and
   heptamers) are studied by Monte Carlo simulations. Elastic properties
   (the elastic constants and the Poisson ratio) are computed for hexagonal
   solid phases with molecular rotation by using an algorithm based on the
   strain-fluctuation method. In both systems a minimum of the Poisson
   ratio is observed at the same density at which a qualitative change of
   the orientational single distribution function occurs. This result
   confirms that, in each of the studied systems, a phase transition occurs
   between two elastically isotropic solid phases exhibiting orientational
   disorder: a higher-density phase with (strongly) hindered rotation and a
   lower-density phase with (almost) free rotation. The study also suggests
   that it is worth paying more attention to the dependence of the Poisson
   ratio on the thermodynamic variables (volume, pressure or temperature)
   in solids because this quantity can play the role of a sensitive
   indicator of (at least some) structural phase transitions.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The buckling of a finite section of a cylindrical shell resembling a
   two-dimensional contact lens, and the collapse of a tubular shell of
   infinite extent are considered. The deformation is due, respectively, to
   the application of an edge force or to a negative transmural pressure.
   In both cases, the shell develops elastic bending moments due to the
   deformation from a specified resting shape according to a linear
   constitutive equation, accompanied by in-plane and transverse shear
   tensions. In the case of a section of a shell with a flat resting shape,
   classical results due to Euler and Love show that, as the applied edge
   force is increased beyond a sequence of thresholds, an infinite family
   of deformed shapes becomes possible corresponding to buckled states that
   bifurcate from the zero-curvature resting configuration. It is shown
   here that a corresponding infinite family of shapes is also possible for
   a finite shell whose resting shape is a section of circle. These shapes,
   however, no longer arise from bifurcations, but rather constitute
   disconnected solution branches of a nonlinear boundary-value problem. A
   closed cylindrical shell whose cross-section has a circular resting
   shape exhibits similar bifurcations when the difference between the
   exterior and interior pressure exceeds a sequence of thresholds, but a
   shell with a non-circular resting shape deforms into a multitude of
   shapes described by isolated solution branches. The computed
   two-dimensional buckled shapes are used to reconstruct the
   three-dimensional shape of a slowly collapsing fluid-conveying vessel.
   The reconstruction procedure involves stacking together cross-sections
   at axial positions that are found by integrating the differential
   equation determining the axial pressure distribution in unidirectional
   pressure-driven flow, subject to a constant flow rate. The dimensionless
   coefficient relating the local pressure gradient to the flow rate is
   computed by solving the Poisson equation governing unidirectional
   viscous flow using a boundary-element method, and expressing the flow
   rate as a boundary integral involving the shear stress which is
   available from the solution of the boundary-integral equation. In an
   appendix, the energy of the bending state is discussed with reference to
   specific choices made by previous authors in various branches of science
   and engineering.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated the spatial distribution of Tetramicra
   brevifilum spores in the musculature of infected turbot Scophthalmus
   maximus, with the aim of identifying the most appropriate body locations
   for diagnostic assays. A PCR protocol optimized for the detection of T.
   brevifilum spores in turbot muscle is also described. In fish showing
   low- and moderate-intensity infection, the spatial distribution of
   spores was best fitted by a negative binomial distribution, indicating a
   clumped spatial pattern; the negative binomial coefficient k was lower
   for fish with low-intensity infection, indicating a more markedly
   clumped pattern in these fish. In fish with high-intensity infection,
   the spatial distribution of spores was best fitted by the Poisson
   distribution, indicating a random pattern. In both low- and
   moderate-intensity infection, spores were present at highest density in
   the musculature adjoining the dorsal fins. Samples for PCR were
   therefore obtained from this location. PCR amplification was of the
   small subunit ribosomal DNA (SSUrDNA), using a pair of species-specific
   primers that amplify, the 1250 bp product. The PCR protocol developed
   showed better sensitivity than microscopical techniques (detection rate
   by microscopy 25\% versus 42\% by PCR), suggesting that it may be useful

Abstract = {{The decomposition of the tensor product of a positive and a negative
   discrete series representation of the Lie algebra su(1, 1) is a direct
   integral over the principal unitary series representations. In the
   decomposition discrete terms can occur, and these are a finite number of
   discrete series representations or one complementary series
   representation. The interpretation of Meixner functions and polynomials
   as overlap coefficients in the four classes of representations and the
   Clebsch-Gordan decomposition, lead to a general bilinear generating
   function for the Meixner polynomials. Finally, realizing the positive
   and negative discrete series representations as operators on the spaces
   of holomorphic and anti-holomorphic functions, respectively, a
   non-symmetric type Poisson kernel is found for the Meixner functions.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH}},
Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{107}},

Month = {{JAN 10}},
Abstract = {{{[}1] The Brazilian Lithosphere Seismic Project (BLSP, a joint project
   by University of Sao Paulo and Carnegie Institution, 1992-1999) operated
   more than 20 temporary broadband stations in the southeastern Brazilian
   shield. The area, a transect 1000 km long and 300 km wide, covers
   different geological provinces: the Precambrian Sao Francisco craton,
   the adjacent Brasiliano (700-500 Ma) fold belts, and the Parana basin of
   Paleozoic origin. Crustal thicknesses were estimated for 23 sites using
   receiver functions. For each station, receiver functions were stacked
   for different sets of earthquakes according to azimuth and distance. The
   P-to-S Moho converted phase was clearly identified at most sites.
   Crustal thicknesses were estimated using an average crustal P wave
   velocity of 6.5 km/s. Poisson's ratio of 0.23 (Vp/Vs = 1.70) was used
   for the Sao Francisco craton and adjacent fold belt (based on travel
   times from small, local earthquakes) and 0.25 was used for the Parana
   basin and coastal belt. Crustal thicknesses ranged from 35-47 km.
   Although there is a clear inverse correlation between topography and
   Bouguer gravity anomalies in the study area, Moho depths show the
   opposite pattern from that expected: areas of low topography and less
   negative Bouguer anomalies, such as the Parana basin, have thicker crust
   (40-47 km) compared with the high elevation areas of the craton and fold
   belt (37-43 km). Two hypothesis are proposed to explain the data: (1) A
   lower density, by 30-40 kg/m(3), in the lithospheric mantle under the
   Archean block of the Sao Francisco craton relative to the Proterozoic
   lithosphere is responsible for maintaining the high elevations in the
   plateau area. Relatively low density and high P wave velocity are
   compatible with a depleted (low FeO) composition for the Archean
   lithosphere. (2) Alternatively, if the density contrasts between Archean
   and Proterozoic lithospheres are smaller than the values above, then the
   crust beneath the Parana basin must be more dense than that of the
   craton. Higher crustal density and high Poisson's ratio would be
   consistent with magmatic underplating in the lower crust beneath the
   Parana basin, as inferred from other studies.}},

Journal = {{CELLULAR POLYMERS}},
Year = {{2002}},

Abstract = {{Finite Element (FE) modelling is used to investigate the effect of
   varying the rib thickness on the mechanical properties of conventional
   and re-entrant periodic honeycombs. The calculations confirm that the
   re-entrant honeycomb has a negative Poisson's ratio. The data show that
   the mechanical properties vary not only with honeycomb relative density,
   but also on how the relative density variation is achieved. Reducing the
   thickness of `vertical' ribs, whilst maintaining constant `diagonal' rib
   thickness, does not alter the Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio in the
   x direction (E-x and V-xv), but does lead to a decrease in the magnitude
   of the y-directed properties (E-v and V-vx). Reducing the diagonal rib
   thickness at constant vertical rib thickness leads to a more marked
   decrease in E-v as well as in E-x, whereas V-xv and V-vx both increase
   in magnitude. An analytical model is also developed to account for
   different vertical and diagonal rib thicknesses, and good agreement with
   the FE model data is achieved. The results have implications for
   applications in which maximising or maintaining mechanical properties
   with respect to relative density is important.}},

Abstract = {{Materials with negative Poisson's ratios (auxetic materials) have
   several advantages compared to conventional materials, including
   increased plane strain fracture resistance and increased shear modulus.
   A method for the manufacture of honeycomb ceramics with a structure,
   which yields negative Poisson's ratio is described. Ceramics with
   cellular or honeycomb structures have applications as substrates in
   catalytic converters for the emissions from internal combustion engines.
   In such devices due to the extreme temperature variations, the structure
   has to provide high thermal shock resistance. It is possible to increase
   the thermal shock resistance by incorporating specific web geometries,
   Such structures can absorb or compensate for compressive and tensile
   stresses generated in the body during thermal expansion and contraction.
   It is shown that such structures can be produced by the extrusion of
   ceramic pastes through polymer dies produced by rapid prototyping
   (selective laser sintering), CAD technology was used to design the die.
   A ceramic paste based on a zirconia powder was used to make the cellular
   extruded tube. The negative Poisson's ratio behaviour was confirmed by
   employing a simple test.}},

Abstract = {{The Fokker-Planck equation is considered, which is connected to the
   birth and death process with immigration by the Poisson transform. The
   fractional derivative in time variable is introduced into the
   Fokker-Planck equation in order to investigate an origin of oscillatory
   behavior of cumulant moments. From its solution (the probability density
   function), the generating function (GF) for the corresponding
   probability distribution is derived. We consider the case when the GF
   reduces to that of the negative binomial distribution (NBD), if the
   fractional derivative is replaced to the ordinary one. The H-j moment
   derived from the GF of the NBD decreases monotonically as the rank j
   increases. However, the H-j moment derived in our approach oscillates,
   which is contrasted with the case of the NBD. Calculated H-j moments are
   compared with those of charged multiplicities observed in p(p) over bar,
   e(+) e(-), and e(+) p collisions. A phenomenological meaning of
   introducing the fractional derivative in time variable is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Cellular structures like honeycombs or reticulated micro-frames are
   widely used in sandwich construction because of their superior
   structural static and dynamic properties. Aim of this study is to
   evaluate the dynamic behavior of bi-dimensional cellular structures,
   with focus on the effect of the geometry of the unit cell composing the
   solid on the dynamics of the propagation of elastic waves within the
   structure.
   The characteristics of wave propagation for the considered class of
   cellular solids are analyzed through the Finite Element model of the
   unit cell and the application of the theory of periodic structures. This
   combined analysis yields the phase constant surfaces, which define the
   directions of wave propagation in the plane of the structure for
   assigned frequency values. The analysis of iso-frequency contour lines
   in the phase constant surfaces allows predicting the location and
   extension of angular ranges, and therefore regions within the
   structures, where waves do not propagate.
   The performance of honeycomb grids of regular hexagonal topology is
   compared with that of grids of various geometries, with emphasis on
   configurations featuring a negative Poisson's ratio behavior. The
   harmonic response of the considered structures at specified frequencies
   confirms the predictions from the analysis of the phase constant
   surfaces and demonstrates the strongly spatially dependent
   characteristics of periodic cellular structures.
   The presented numerical results indicate the potentials of the phase
   constant surfaces as tools for the evaluation of the wave propagation
   characteristics of this class of two-dimensional periodic structures.
   Optimal design configurations can be identified in order to achieve
   desired transmissibility levels in specified directions and to obtain
   efficient vibration isolation capabilities. The findings from the
   presented investigations and the described analysis methodology will
   provide invaluable guidelines for the prototyping of future concepts of
   honeycombs or cellular structures with enhanced vibro-acoustics
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{The wave propagation in and the vibration of sandwich plates with
   cellular core are analyzed and controlled. Negative Poisson's ratio
   (auxetic) core materials of different geometry placed periodically in
   the plate introduce the proper impedance mismatch necessary to obstruct
   the propagation of waves over specified frequency bands (stop bands) and
   in particular directions. The location and the extension of the stop
   bands and the directions of wave propagation can be modified by proper
   selection of the periodicity and of the geometrical and physical
   properties of the core.
   A Finite Element model is developed to predict the dynamic response of
   three-layered sandwich panels with honeycomb core. The Finite Element
   model along with the theory of periodic structures is used to evaluate
   the influence of core materials of different geometry placed
   periodically along the two dimensions of the structure. This combined
   analysis yields the phase constant surfaces for the considered sandwich
   plates, which define location and extension of the stop bands, as well
   as the directions of wave propagation at assigned frequency values. The
   analysis of the phase constant surfaces and the evaluation of the
   harmonic response at specified frequencies indicate that the plates are
   characterized by dynamic behaviors with directional properties, with
   spatial patterns strongly dependent on the configuration of the periodic
   core and on the excitation frequency. Auxetic honeycombs are considered
   as core materials in order to obtain maximum design flexibility. The
   elastic and inertial characteristics of auxetic honeycombs in fact vary
   substantially with their internal geometry and for given configurations
   outcast up to five times the corresponding properties of traditional
   hexagonal honeycombs.
   The presented numerical results demonstrate the unique characteristics
   of this class of two-dimensional periodic structures, which behave as
   directional mechanical filters. The findings of this study suggest that
   optimal configurations for the periodic cellular core can be identified
   in order to design passive composite panels, which are stable and quiet
   over desired frequency bands and which fit desired transmissibility
   levels in particular directions. Such unique filtering capabilities are
   achieved without requiring additional passive or active control devices
   and therefore without compromising the size and the weight of the
   layered structure.}},

Abstract = {{This paper demonstrates that the conditional negative binomial model for
   panel data, proposed by Hausman, Hall, and Griliches (1984), is not a
   true fixed-effects method. This method which has been implemented in
   both Stata and LIMDEP-does not in fact control for all stable
   covariates. Three alternative methods are explored. A negative
   multinomial model yields the same estimator as the conditional Poisson
   estimator and hence does not provide any additional leverage for dealing
   with overdispersion. On the other hand, a simulation study yields good
   results from applying an unconditional negative binomial regression
   estimator with dummy variables to represent the fixed effects. There is
   no evidence for any incidental parameters bias in the coefficients, and
   downward bias in the standard error estimates can be easily and
   effectively corrected using the deviance statistic. Finally, an
   approximate conditional method is found to perform at about the same
   level as the unconditional estimator.}},

Abstract = {{The stochastic wave load environment of offshore structures is of such a
   complicated nature that any engineering analysis requires extensive
   simplifications. This concerns both the transformation of the wave field
   velocities and accelerations to forces on the structure and the
   probabilistic description of the wave field itself. In this paper the
   last issue is in focus. The modeling follows the traditional structure
   of subdividing the time development of the wind driven wave process into
   sea states within each of which the wave process is modeled as a
   stationary process. The wave process of each sea state is modeled as an
   affinity in height and time of a Gaussian process defined by a
   normalized dimensionless spectrum of Pierson-Moskowitz type. The
   affinity factors are the so-called significant wave height H-s and the
   characteristic zero upcrossing time T-z. Based on measured data of (H-s,
   T-z) from the North Sea a well fitting joint distribution of (H-s,T-z)
   is obtained as a so-called Nataf model. Since the wave field is wind
   driven, there is a correlation between the time averaged wind velocity
   pressure Q and the characteristic wave height in the stationary
   situation. Using the Poisson process model to concentrate on those load
   events that are of importance for the evaluation of the safety of the
   structure, that is, events with Q larger than some threshold q(0),
   available information about the wind velocity pressure distribution in
   high wind situations can be used to formulate a Nataf model for the
   joint conditional distribution of (H-s, T-z, Q) given that Q > q(0). The
   distribution of the largest wave height during a sea state is of
   interest for designing the free space between the sea level and the top
   side. An approximation to this distribution is well known for a Gaussian
   process and by integration over all sea states given Q > q(0), the
   distribution is obtained that is relevant for the free space design.
   However, for the forces on the members of the structure also the wave
   period is essential. Within the linear wave theory (Airy waves) the drag
   term in the Morison force formula increases by the square of the ratio
   between the wave height and the wave length, and the mass force term
   increases proportional to the ratio of the wave height and the square of
   the period. For a strongly narrow band Gaussian process Longuet-Higgins
   has derived a joint distribution of the height and the period. However,
   simulations show that the Pierson-Moskowitz spectrum (or any other
   standard spectrum for wind driven sea waves of similar bandwidth such as
   the JONSWAP spectrum) does not provide a sufficiently narrow banded
   process for the distribution of Longuet-Higgins to make a good fit.
   Surprisingly it turns out that the random time L between two consecutive
   0-upcrossings and the random wave height H observed between the two
   0-upcrossings behave such that L and the ratio H/L are practically
   uncorrelated and both normally distributed except for clipping the
   negative tails. This result is of global nature and is therefore very
   difficult if not impossible to obtain by analytical mathematical
   reasoning. Finally, by combining all the derived distributional models
   into a Rosenblatt transformation, a first order reliability analysis of
   a tubular offshore platform can be made with respect to static pushover.
   Correction For non-linear wave theory can be taken into account crudely
   by using the deterministic 5th order Stokes wave in the limit state
   formulation.
   A dynamic analysis will be more complicated, of course, but the provided
   distributional information and the demonstrated modeling principles are
   judged as generally applicable. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{A rigid smooth indentor slides at a constant speed on a compressible
   isotropic neo-Hookean half-space that is subjected to pre-stress aligned
   with the surface and sliding direction. A dynamic steady-sliding
   situation of plane strain is treated as the superposition of
   contact-triggered infinitesimal deformations superposed upon finite
   deformations due to pre-stress. The neo-Hookean material behaves for
   small mains as a linear elastic solid with Poisson's ratio 1 : 4. Exact
   solutions are presented for both deformations and, for a range of
   acceptable pre-stress values, the infinitesimal component exhibits the
   typical non-isotropy induced by pre-stress, and several critical speeds.
   In view of the unilateral constraints of contact, these speeds serve to
   define the sliding speed ranges for which physically acceptable
   solutions arise. A Rayleigh speed is the upper bound for subsonic
   sliding, and transonic sliding can occur only at a single speed. For the
   generic parabolic indentor, contact zone traction continuity is lost at
   the zone leading edge for trans- and supersonic sliding. For pre-stress
   levels that fall outside the acceptable range, either a negative Poisson
   effect occurs, or a Rayleigh speed does not exist and the unilateral
   constraints cannot be satisfied for any subsonic sliding speed.}},

Title = {{Effect of surface charges on the curvature moduli of a membrane}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{64}},
Number = {{5, 1}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The modificatior, of the curvature moduli due to surface charges in
   lipid bilayers is analyzed using the nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann
   equation for the relationship between the charge density and surface
   potential. An expansion in a small parameter epsilon, which is the ratio
   of the Debye length and the radius of curvature, is used. At low charge
   densities, previous results obtained from the Debye-Huckel approximation
   are recovered. At high charge densities, the corrections to the mean and
   Gaussian curvature approach constant values. The total energy of
   curvature for a symmetrically charged membrane becomes negative when the
   charge density is increased beyond a critical value, indicating that the
   membrane spontaneously forms vesicles. An asymmetry in the charge
   densities on the two monolayers that form the bilayer results in a
   spontaneous curvature, and the radius of curvature could be large
   compared to the Debye length when the asymmetry is small. The case of
   adsorbed charges is also considered, where there is a reduction in the
   chemical energy when a charge is adsorbed on the surface. At low charge
   density, the mean and Gaussian curvature are equal in magnitude and
   opposite in sign to that for fixed charges, while at high charge
   density, the mean and Gaussian curvature approach values identical to
   that for a surface with fixed charges. Numerical calculations of the
   change in the curvature moduli with realistic parameter values indicate
   that these effects are likely to be of importance in the spontaneous
   formation of vesicles.}},

Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{10}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Analytical expressions are derived for the Poisson's ratios associated
   with a three-dimensional network of regular, corner-sharing tetrahedra
   in which: (1) the tetrahedra are assumed to be rigid and free to rotate
   relative to each other; (2) the tetrahedra are assumed to maintain shape
   and orientation but are free to change size (dilate); (3) tetrahedral
   rotation and dilation are assumed to act concurrently. The structure has
   a primitive unit cell containing four tetrahedra and is analogous to the
   molecular structure of a-cristobalite. Strain-dependent variations in
   Poisson's ratio are also predicted by the models. For deformation due to
   tetrahedral rotation the network is found to exhibit negative Poisson's
   ratios in each of the three principal directions, with the magnitude of
   the Poisson's ratio being dependent on the angle of rotation of the
   tetrahedra. The behaviour of the Poisson's ratio is isotropic in the
   transverse plane, but anisotropic elsewhere. In the dilation model
   negative Poisson's ratios equal to -1 are observed for uniaxial loading
   in any of the principal directions, with the value being constant
   irrespective of tetrahedral size. The model for concurrent tetrahedral
   rotation and dilation allows positive as well as negative Poisson's
   ratios, with the values determined by the framework geometry and
   relative strengths of the two mechanisms. The concurrent model also
   offers a design route to materials and structures having ultrahigh
   Young's moduli.}},

Abstract = {{Cancer has long been known to be a hazard of exposure to ionizing
   radiation. However, the assessment of health effects from exposure to
   radiation is a matter of considerable controversy. This paper presents
   results of a retrospective study of leukemia incidence (203-207, ICD-9)
   around the highest Cs-137 pollution in Poland (as an effect of the
   Czarnobyl disaster and/or military bomb tests). The data relating to all
   the registered leukemias in males and females originated from the
   Regional Cancer Registry in Opole. The information on Cs-137
   concentration rates in Opole province was derived from the state
   monitoring provided by the Polish Geological Institute in Warsaw. The
   spatial analysis - based on the random-effects Poisson regression model
   - was carried out via the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique
   (Gibbs sampling) using BUGS software. The model incorporated
   epidemiological data and an ecological covariate - isotope
   concentrations - and provided a framework for estimating the strength of
   a dose-response relationship. The differences in incidence levels were
   quantified by traditional standardized morbidity ratios (SMRs) and
   presented in thematic maps as well as in combined charts of
   distance-disease-dose relations. Additionally, to assess spatial disease
   clustering, a Tango test was adopted. The results of this ecological
   study suggest that the Cs-137 concentrations did not have any negative
   influence on the exposed population.}},

Abstract = {{By means of molecular dynamics technique, the dynamic process of
   nucleation and motion of a partial dislocation is carefully investigated
   in a nanoscopic specimen of single crystalline nickel under {[}001]

   two successive unstable behaviors of local lattices observed in the
   homogeneously deformed body; the first unstable behavior is the collapse
   of local lattices that breaks the homogeneous Poisson's contraction,
   leading to the deformation concentration. The second is the unstable
   shear of lattices on a slip plane in the deformation concentrated
   region. The nucleation and glide of dislocation can be observed as the
   migration of atoms on the slip plane as a result of these unstable
   behaviors. The criteria of the onset of the unstable behaviors axe
   evaluated based on the elastic stiffness coefficients, B-ijkl. That is,
   the instability criteria proposed by Wang et al. {[}Wang, J. et al.,
   Phys. Rev, Lett. 71-25 (1993) 4182-4185] are adopted to evaluate local
   instability. The results show that the elastic stiffness of the first

Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{733-747}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The previously existing quasilinear theory of the generation of a
   large-scale radial electric field by small-scale drift turbulence in a
   plasma is generalized for the case of strong turbulence which is usually
   observed in experiments. The geostrophic equation (i.e., the reduced
   Charney-Hasegawa-Mima equation) is used to construct a systematic theory
   in the two-scale direct interaction approximation. It is shown that, as
   in the quasilinear case, drift turbulence results in a turbulent
   viscosity effect and leads to the renormalization of the Poisson bracket
   in the Charney-Hasegawa-Mima equation. It is found that, for strong
   drift turbulence, the viscosity coefficient is represented as a sum of
   two parts, which are comparable in magnitude. As in quasilinear theory,
   the first part is determined by the second-order correlation functions
   of the turbulent field and is always negative. The second part is
   proportional to the third-order correlation functions, and the sign of
   its contribution to the turbulent viscosity coefficient depends strongly
   on the turbulence spectrum. The turbulent viscosity coefficient is
   calculated numerically for the Kolmogorov spectra, which characterize
   the inertial interval of the drift turbulence. (C) 2001 MAIK

   of 0.36 kcal/mol, better than that of the SM5.42R universal solvation
   model(1) by Li et al. For the 245-molecule set (model II) that has
   experimental aqueous solvation free energies, our WSAS model achieves an
   average error of 0.48 kcal/mol, marginally larger than that of Li's
   model (0.46 kcal/mol). We have used a 401 molecule set, the largest
   training set (model IV) that we know of solvation model development, to
   derive the SAS weights in order to reproduce the experimental solvation
   free energies in water. For this model, we have achieved an average
   unsigned error of 0.54 kcal/mol and an RMS error of 0.79 kcal/mol. The
   advantage of this model lies in its simplicity and independence of
   charge models. We have successfully applied this model to predict the
   relative binding free energies for the five binding modes of
   HIV-1RT/efavirenz. The most favorable binding mode, which has an RMSD of
   1.1 Angstrom (for 54 C-alpha around the binding site) compared to the
   crystal structure, has a binding free energy at least 10 kcal/mol more
   negative than the other binding modes. Moreover, the solvation free
   energies with WSAS have a high correlation (the correlation coefficient
   is 0.92) to the solvation free energies calculated by the
   Poisson-Boltzmann/surface area (PBSA) model. As an efficient and fast
   approach, WASA is also attractive for protein modeling and protein
   folding studies. We have applied this model to predict the solvation
   free energies of the 36-mer villin headpiece subdomain in its native
   structure, a compact folding intermediate, and a random coil. The rank
   order of the solvation free energies and the free energies for the three
   kinds of conformational clusters are in reasonable agreement with those
   found by MM-PBSA, a widely used solvation free energy model.}},

Abstract = {{A rigid smooth indentor slides at a constant sub-sonic speed on a
   half-space of an isotropic compressible neo-Hookean material that is
   initially subjected to a pre-stress aligned with the surface. A dynamic
   steady-state situation of plane strain is considered and, following
   Beatty and Usmani and Green and Zerna, is viewed as contact-triggered
   infinitesimal deformations superposed upon finite deformations due to
   pre-stress. The neo-Hookean material treated behaves for small strains
   as a linear elastic solid with Poisson's ratio 1/4. Exact solutions for
   both deformations are presented and, for a range of acceptable
   pre-stress values, these illustrate the anisotropy induced by pre-stress
   and a critical sliding speed corresponding to the Rayleigh speed.
   Imposition of the unilateral Signorini conditions of contact show that
   the Rayleigh speed is the upper bound for sub-sonic sliding. For
   pre-stress levels that fall outside this range, however, either a
   negative Poisson effect occurs, or a Rayleigh wave does not exist and
   the Signorini conditions cannot be satisfied for any sub-sonic speed.

Abstract = {{When a force deforms an elastic object, practical experience suggests
   that the resulting displacement will be in the same direction as the
   force. This property is known as positive stiffness'. Less familiar is
   the concept of negative stiffness, where the deforming force and the
   resulting displacement are in opposite directions. (Negative stiffness
   is distinct from negative Poisson's ratio(2-6), which refers to the
   occurrence of lateral expansion upon stretching an object.) Negative
   stiffness can occur, for example, when the deforming object has
   stored(7) (or is supplied(8) with) energy. This property is usually
   unstable, but it has been shown theoretically(9) that inclusions of
   negative stiffness can be stabilized within a positive-stiffness matrix.
   Here we describe the experimental realization of this composite approach
   by embedding negative-stiffness inclusions of ferroelastic vanadium
   dioxide in a pure tin matrix. The resulting composites exhibit extreme
   mechanical damping and large anomalies in stiffness, as a consequence of
   the high local strains that result from the inclusions deforming more
   than the composite as a whole. Moreover, for certain temperature ranges,
   the negative-stiffness inclusions are more effective than diamond
   inclusions for increasing the overall composite stiffness. We expect
   that such composites could be useful as high damping materials, as stiff
   structural elements or for actuator-type applications.}},

Title = {{Modeling and analysis of the electrokinetic mass transport and
   adsorption mechanisms of a charged adsorbate in capillary
   electrochromatography systems employing charged nonporous adsorbent
   particles}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2001}},

Abstract = {{Mass-transfer systems based on electrokinetic phenomena (i.e., capillary
   electrochromatography (CEC)) have shown practical potential for becoming
   powerful separation methods for the biotechnology and pharmaceutical
   industries. A dynamic mathematical model, consisting of the momentum
   balance and the Poisson equations, as well as the unsteady-state
   continuity expressions for the cation and anion of the background
   electrolyte and of a positively charged analyte (adsorbate), is
   constructed and solved to determine quantitatively the electroosmotic
   velocity, the electrostatic potential, the concentration profiles of the
   charged species in the double layer and in the electroneutral core
   region of the fluid in the interstitial channels for bulk flow in the
   packed chromatographic column, and the axial current density profiles as
   the adsorbate adsorbs onto the negatively charged fixed sites on the
   surface of the nonporous particles packed in the chromatographic column.
   The frontal analysis mode of operation is simulated in this work. The
   results obtained from model simulations provide significant physical
   insight into and understanding of the development and propagation of the
   dynamic profile of the concentration of the adsorbate (analyte) and
   indicate that sharp, highly resolved adsorption fronts and large amounts
   of adsorbate in the adsorbed phase for a given column length can be
   obtained under the following conditions: (i) The ratio, gamma (2,0), of
   the electroosmotic velocity of the mobile liquid phase at the column
   entrance after the adsorption front has passed the column entrance to
   the electrophoretic velocity of the anion is very close to -1. The
   structure of the equations of the model and model simulations indicate
   that a stable adsorption front cannot develop when gamma (2,0) is less
   than -1 unless the value of the mobility of the cation is less than the
   value of the mobility of the analyte, which may be a rare occurrence in
   practical CEC systems. (ii) The ratio of the mobility of the cation to
   the mobility of the analyte is less than two orders of magnitude. This
   effect becomes more significant as the value of the equilibrium
   adsorption constant, K-A,K-3,K- of the analyte increases. (iii) The
   concentration of the analyte relative to the concentration of the cation
   is increased (feed solutions with less dilute concentrations of the
   analyte are employed). Therefore, to obtain good performance for CEC
   systems operated in the frontal analysis mode (well-resolved adsorption
   fronts and high adsorbate amounts in the adsorbed phase), one can choose
   an electrolyte whose cation has a mobility that is not more than one or
   two orders of magnitude greater than the mobility of the analyte and
   whose anion has a mobility such that the value of gamma (2,0) is close
   to -1; one can then bring the value of gamma (2,0) closer to -1 by
   decreasing the particle diameter, d(p), and/or making the value of the
   surface charge density, delta (0), of the particles more negative (in
   effect, making the value of the zeta potential, zeta (p), at the surface
   of the particles more negative at time t = 0) to change the value of the
   velocity, < upsilon (x)>/(x=0), of the electroosmotic flow (EOF) at the
   column entrance (< upsilon (x)>/(x=0) is determined after the adsorption
   front has passed the column entrance). This approach could provide
   conditions in the column that avoid overloading of the adsorbate.
   One can obtain faster breakthrough times at the sacrifice of resolution
   and utilization of the adsorptive capacity of the packed bed if one
   employs a cation whose mobility is very large relative to the mobility
   of the analyte and/or an anion that provides a value of gamma (2,0)
   significantly greater than -1. If it is possible, one can increase the
   concentration of the analyte in the feed stream to avoid sacrificing
   resolution and adsorptive capacity of the packed bed and still decrease
   the time at which breakthrough occurs. Also, the dynamic behavior of the
   axial current density, i(x), profiles indicates that the magnitude of i,
   and/or the change in the value of i, across the adsorption front could
   serve as a measurement for the rate of propagation of the adsorption
   front through the column. Furthermore, the effect of the decreased
   magnitude of the velocity of the EOF in the region of the column where
   the analyte is present in the adsorbed phase could act to decrease the
   effect of tailing when CEC systems are operated in the pulse injection
   mode (analytical electrochromatography) because the higher velocity of
   the fluid upstream of the migrating adsorption zone may compress the
   tail of the peak. (C) 2001 Academic Press.}},

   compliance was relatively high and dominated by the face sheets. Two of
   the core configurations were `'soft{''} and exhibited behavior governed
   by core shear. The relative dimensions of the cores evaluated in this
   study were far from those that minimize the weight, because of

Abstract = {{This paper extends the theory of a filtered Poisson process proposed by
   Snyder {[}Random Point Processes, Wiley New York, 1975]. The cumulants
   for the filtered Poisson process have been given by Snyder. The filtered
   Poisson process is a particular form of a filtered point process in
   which the point process is a compound Poisson process. In practice, the
   point process is not always Poissionian and it might be represented by
   the binomial or negative binomial distribution. Thus, it is advantageous
   to construct the statistical properties of a filtered point process on
   the basis that the occurrence counting process is of both the binomial
   and the negative binomial types. This paper derives the characteristic
   functional for a filtered point process where the point process is of
   both the binomial and the negative binomial types. The first four
   cumulants for these types are also deduced. From these cumulants, we can
   readily obtain the basic statistics (mean, variance, coefficient of
   skewness, coefficient of kurtosis, and correlation coefficient) of a
   random variable that can be modeled as a filtered point process. (C)

Abstract = {{The microscopic model of a crystal consisting of finite size particles
   is proved to be more realistic for many ferroelectric crystals than the
   models with pointwise particles. Two ideas naturally appeared when
   deriving the continuum approximations for this model. The first one is
   to consider a crystal as micropolar media, which is the continuum analog
   for the microscopic model with particles having rotational degrees of
   freedom. The second idea is to use the many-field approximation. A
   particular problem of the negative Poisson ratio, having no place in a
   model with pointwise particles, is also discussed. Finally, a new
   mechanism of the lock-in transition in a crystal supporting the
   incommensurate phase is offered.}},

Abstract = {{A combined method of a genetic algorithm and finite element stress
   analysis has been developed to design the structure of materials. The
   genetic algorithm is applied to searching structures that have a desired
   property by combining it with the finite element analysis, which is used
   to predict the elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio. The calculation of
   the stress analysis is validated from the comparison with the theory on
   parallel, series, and random structures. The combined method was applied
   to two searches of structures. One was to find structures that have a
   desired elastic modulus, respectively. The calculation successfully
   found a proper structure for each desired elastic modulus. The other was
   the search of the structure that shows a negative Poisson's ratio. A
   structure having the negative Poisson's ratio was generated by the
   calculation. Although this original structure would appear to have no
   features, it gave us a good idea for the design of materials by
   investigating the stress distribution in the original structure. A new
   structure that consists of a unique and continuous pattern of the higher
   elastic component was designed from the calculation. The reason for the
   negative Poisson's ratio is explained by mechanical linkage. (C) 2001

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{36}},

Pages = {{2557-2563}},
Abstract = {{Ultrasonic wave velocity measurements have been used to determine the
   elastic stiffness moduli and related elastic properties of high-purity,
   dense beta -Si3N4 ceramic samples as functions of temperature in the
   range 150-295 K and hydrostatic pressure up to 0.2 GPa at room
   temperature. Due to its covalently bonded, rigid structural framework
   beta -Si3N4 is an elastically stiff material; the elastic stiffness
   moduli of the ceramic at 295 K are: C-L = 396 GPa, mu = 119 GPa, B-S =
   238 GPa, E = 306 GPa, Poisson's ratio sigma = 0.285. The longitudinal
   elastic stiffness C-L increases with decreasing temperature and shows a
   knee at about 235 K; the decrease in slope below the knee indicates mode
   softening. The shear elastic stiffness mu shows mode softening which
   results in a plateau centred at about 235 K and an anomalous decrease
   with further reduction in temperature. The hydrostatic-pressure
   derivatives of elastic stiffnesses at 295 K are (partial
   derivativeC(L)/partial derivativeP)(P)=0 = 4.5 +/- 0.1, (partial
   derivativeB(S)/partial derivativeP)(P)=0 = 4.3 +/- 0.1 and (partial
   derivative mu/partial derivativeP)(P)=0 = 0.17 +/- 0.02 (pressure < 0.12
   GPa). An interesting feature of the nonlinear acoustic behaviour of this
   ceramic is that, in the pressure range above 0.12 GPa, the values
   obtained for (partial derivative mu/partial derivativeP)(P)=0 and the
   shear mode Gruneisen parameter (gamma (S)) are small and negative,
   indicating acoustic-mode softening under these higher pressures. Both
   the anomalous temperature and pressure dependences of the shear elastic
   stiffness indicate incipient lattice shear instability. The shear gamma
   (S)(=0.005) is much smaller than the longitudinal gamma (L)(=1.18)
   accounting for the thermal Gruneisen parameter gamma (t)h(=1.09): since
   the acoustic Debye temperature Theta (D)(=923 +/- 5 K) is so high, the
   shear modes play an important role in acoustic phonon population at room
   temperature. Hence knowledge of the elastic and nonlinear acoustic
   properties sheds light on the thermal properties of ceramic beta -Si3N4.

Abstract = {{The elastic constants c(11), c(12) and c(44) of U, Np, Pu, and Am
   telluride single crystals have been obtained by Brillouin scattering
   from the measured sound velocities in prominent crystallographic
   directions. In case of the U chalcogenides also by ultrasound
   techniques. The Cauchy pressure, the Poisson ratio, the anisotropy
   ratio, the bulk modulus and the Debye temperature have been derived from
   these data. U and Pu telluride have a negative c(12), implying
   intermediate valence. AmTe has a very low bulk modulus, but a positive
   c(12). It is extremely soft, with a very low sound velocity. For AmTe
   also the LO and TO phonon frequencies could be determined. The elastic
   data point to a divalent Am state. The optical reflectivity of the light
   actinide tellurides land sometimes of all chalcogenides) has been
   measured between UV and infrared wavelengths, in the case of AmTe down
   to the far infrared. The plasma edge of the free carriers has been
   determined, which yields the ratio of n/m{*}. Together with the gamma
   value of the specific heat and magnetic data a consistent proposal for
   the electronic structure of the light actinide chalcogenides can be
   given. Thus, the Pu chalcogenides are intermediate valent and represent
   the high-pressure phase of the corresponding Sm chalcogenides. AmTe, as
   judged by the electronic, optic and magnetic properties seems to be in
   the 5f(7) configuration, i.e. divalent Am, but with a narrow,
   half-filled (24 meV) wide 5F band, about 0.1 eV below the bottom of the
   6d conduction band. We thus propose a new kind of unhybridized heavy
   fermion. Also AmTe seems to represent a high-pressure phase of EuTe. (C)

Abstract = {{The wave propagation in sandwich beams with cellular core is analyzed
   and controlled. The material properties of cellular cores are highly
   dependent on the geometry of the cell composing the honeycomb structure.
   Core materials of different geometry placed periodically along the beam
   length introduce the proper impedance mismatch necessary to impede the
   propagation of waves along the beam.
   A Spectral Finite Element model is developed to describe the wave
   propagation characteristics and the vibration of the sandwich beam. The
   model uses dynamic shape functions obtained from the solution of the
   corresponding distributed parameter model and thus allows for predicting
   the dynamic behavior of the structure with a significantly reduced
   number of elements as compared with the conventional FEM.
   The model is used to derive the transfer matrix of the sandwich beam,
   which identifies the location of the frequency bands where traveling
   waves are attenuated. The influence of core geometry and periodicity on
   the location and extension of these stop bands is assessed through a
   series of simulations. The effect of the periodicity of the structure is
   also evaluated by considering the vibration response of a clamped free
   beam excited by the harmonic motion of the base. The results demonstrate
   the simplicity and the effectiveness of the proposed treatment whereby
   the transmission of waves and the vibration over specified frequency
   bands can be significantly reduced without requiring additional passive
   or active control devices. The unique characteristics of cellular solids
   therefore can be used to design light-weight composite panels that
   behave as mechanical filters. The filtering capabilities of such passive
   composite panels may be easily changed and optimized to reduce their
   transmissibility over a desired frequency range without compromising the
   size and the weight of the structure.}},

Abstract = {{Foams have previously been fabricated with a negative Poisson's ratio
   (termed auxetic foams). A novel model is proposed to explain this and to
   describe the strain-dependent Poisson's function behaviour of honeycomb
   and foam materials. The model is two-dimensional and is based upon the
   observation of broken cell ribs in foams processed via the compression
   and heating technique usually employed to convert conventional foams to
   auxetic behaviour. The model has two forms: the ``intact{''} form is a
   network of ribs with biaxial symmetry, and the ``auxetic{''} form is a
   similar network but with a proportion of cell ribs removed. The model
   output is compared with that of an existing two-dimensional model and
   experimental data, and is found to be superior in predicting the
   Poisson's function and marginally better at predicting the stress-strain
   behaviour of the experimental data than the existing model, using
   realistic values for geometric parameters. (C) 2000 Acta Metallurgica

Title = {{Explaining two-lane highway crash rates using land use and hourly

Abstract = {{This paper describes the estimation of Poisson regression models for
   predicting both single and multi-vehicle highway crash rates as a
   function of traffic density and land use, as well as ambient light
   conditions and time of day. The study focuses on seventeen rural,
   two-lane highway segments, each one-half mile in length with varying
   land use patterns and where actual hourly exposure values are available
   in the form of observed traffic counts. Land-use effects are represented
   by the number of driveways of various types on each segment. Hourly
   exposure is represented for single-vehicle crashes as the total vehicle
   miles traveled and volume/capacity ratio; for multi-vehicle crashes it
   is the product of the hourly volumes on the main highway and the roads
   intersecting it along the study segment. For single-vehicle crashes, the
   following variables were found to be significant, with a positive or
   negative effect as noted: daytime (06:00-19:00 h, negative effect), the
   natural log of the segment volume/capacity ratio (negative), percent of
   the segment with no passing zones (positive), shoulder width (positive),
   number of intersections (negative), and driveways (mixed effects by
   type). Good multi-vehicle crash prediction models had guile different
   variables: daylight conditions from 10:00;-15:00 and 15:00-19:00 h
   (positive), number of intersections (negative), and driveways (positive
   for all types). The results show that traffic intensity explains
   differences in crash rates even when controlling for time of day and
   light conditions, and that these effects are quite different for single
   and multi-vehicle crashes. Suggestions for future research are also
   given. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Dielectric honeycombs are cellular materials often used in applications

   superior to those of a conventional honeycomb. By employing the
   finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) technique with periodic boundary
   conditions, the electromagnetic properties of re-entrant honeycombs are
   determined and compared to those of a conventional honeycomb. Re-entrant
   honeycombs are shown to have substantially superior electromagnetic
   properties. Measured permittivity data are used to substantiate the
   conclusions based on predicted FDTD data. The use of re-entrant
   honeycombs, rather than conventional honeycombs, in LO and radome

Abstract = {{We investigate, using an analytical and a numerical model, the in-plane
   stiffness of fiber mats. A mat is modeled by randomly depositing thin
   linear-elastic fibers on top of each other under the influence of an
   external pressure. The external pressure has the effect of bending the
   fibers over each other. The fibers are assumed rigidly bonded at
   contacts. For a low external pressure the stiffness of the mat deviates
   from that of its two-dimensional projection only by a geometrical
   factor, and the effective Poisson contraction is close to zero. For
   higher pressures, stiffness is governed by two competing effects and a
   maximum appears in the stiffness. The effective Poisson ratio is clearly
   negative in this range. An approximative analytical description is
   developed for the stiffness of mats formed under low external pressure.
   The stiffness is given as a function of only a few parameters: the
   degree of bonding, the dimensions of the fibers, the elastic constants
   of the fiber material, and the density of fibers. (C) 2000 American

Abstract = {{Background: Male circumcision is associated with reduced HIV
   acquisition.
   Methods: HIV acquisition was determined in a cohort of 5507 HIV-negative
   Ugandan men, and in 187 HIV-negative men in discordant relationships.
   Transmission was determined in 223 HIV-positive men with HIV-negative
   partners. HIV incidence per 100 person years (py) and adjusted rate
   ratios (RR) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated by Poisson
   regression. HIV-1 serum viral load was determined for the seropositive
   partners in HIV-discordant couples.
   Results: The prevalence of circumcision was 16.5\% fbr all men; 99.1\%
   in Muslims and 3.7\% in non-Muslims. Circumcision was significantly
   associated with reduced HIV acquisition in the cohort as a whole (RR
   0.53, CI 0.33-0.87), but not among non-Muslim men. Prepubertal
   circumcision significantly reduced HIV acquisition (RR 0.49, CI
   0.26-0.82), but postpubertal circumcision did not. In discordant couples
   with HIV-negative men, no serconversions occurred in 50 circumcised men,
   whereas HIV acquisition was 16.7 per 100 py in uncircumcised men (P =
   0.004). In couples with HIV-positive men, HIV transmission was
   significantly reduced in circumcised men with HIV viral loads less than
   50 000 copies/ml (P = 0.02).
   Interpretation: Prepubertal circumcision may reduce male HIV acquisition
   in a general population, but the protective effects are confounded by
   cultural and behavioral factors in Muslims. In discordant couples,
   circumcision reduces HIV acquisition and transmission. The assessment of
   circumcision for HIV prevention is complex and requires randomized
   trials. (C) 2000 Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of inhibition on the firing variability is examined in this
   paper using the biologically-inspired temporal noisy-leaky integrator
   (TNLI) neuron model. The TNLI incorporates hyperpolarising inhibition
   with negative current pulses of controlled shapes and it also separates
   dendritic from somatic integration. The firing variability is observed
   by looking at the coefficient of ``variation (C-V) (standard
   deviation/mean interspike interval) as a function of the mean interspike
   interval of firing (Deltat(M)) and by comparing the results with the
   theoretical curve for random spike trains, as well as looking at the
   interspike interval (ISI) histogram distributions. The results show that
   with 80\% inhibition, firing at high rates (up to 200 Hz) is nearly
   consistent with a Poisson-type variability, which complies with the
   analysis of cortical neuron firing recordings by Softky and Koch
   {[}1993, J. Neurosci. 13(1) 334-530]. We also demonstrate that the
   mechanism by which inhibition increases the C-V values is by introducing
   more short intervals in the firing pattern as indicated by a small
   initial hump at the beginning of the ISI histogram distribution. The use
   of stochastic inputs and the separation of the dendritic and somatic
   integration which we model in TNLI, also affect the high firing, near
   Poisson-type (explained in the paper) variability produced. We have also
   found that partial dendritic reset increases slightly the firing
   variability especially at short ISIs. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland

Abstract = {{Objectives-In the past, evidence on the negative consequences of
   workplace bullying has been limited to cross sectional studies of self
   reported bullying. In this study, these consequences were examined
   prospectively by focusing on sickness absence in hospital staff.
   Methods-The Poisson regression analyses of medically certified spells
   (greater than or equal to 4 days) and self certified spells (1-3 days)
   of sickness absence, relating to bullying and other predictors of
   health, were based on a cohort of 674 male and 4981 female hospital
   employees aged 19-63 years. Data on sickness absence were gathered from
   employers' registers. Bullying and other predictors of health were
   measured by a questionnaire survey.
   Results-302 (5\%) of the employees reported being victims of bullying.
   They did not differ from the other employees in terms of sex, age,
   occupation, type of job contract, hours of work, income, smoking,
   alcohol consumption, or physical activity. Victims of bullying had
   higher body mass and prevalence of chronic disease, and their rates of
   medically and self certified spells of sickness absence were 1.5 (95\%
   confidence interval (95\% CI) 1.3 to 1.7) and 1.2 (1.1 to 1.4) times
   higher than those of the rest of the staff. The rate ratios remained
   significant after adjustment for demographic data, occupational
   background, behaviour involving risks to health, baseline health status,
   and sickness absence.
   Conclusion-Workplace bullying is associated with an increase in the
   sickness absenteeism of the hospital staff. Targets of bullying seem not
   to belong to any distinct group with certain demographic characteristics
   or occupational background.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic honeycombs show in-plane negative Poisson's ratio properties;
   they expand in all directions when pulled in only one, and contract when
   compressed. This characteristic is due to the re-entrant shape of the
   honeycomb unit cell. The cell convoluteness gives a geometric stiffening
   effect that affects the linear elastic properties of the whole cellular
   solid. In this paper finite element simulations are carried out to
   calculate the in-plane Poisson's ratio and Young's moduli of re-entrant
   cell honeycombs for different geometric layout combinations (side cell
   aspect ratio, relative thickness and internal cell angle) subjected to
   uniaxial loading. The results show a high sensitivity of the mechanical
   properties for particular ranges of the geometric cell parameters. An
   image data detection technique is used to extract displacements and
   strains from an aramid paper re-entrant honeycomb sample in a tensile
   test. The comparison between numerical and experimental results shows
   good agreement.}},

Abstract = {{The transverse shear modulus of in-plane negative Poisson's ratio
   honeycombs is determined using numerical simulations. General honeycombs
   have theoretical upper and lower bounds of transverse shear moduli. The
   actual transverse shear modulus is an intermediate value, depending on
   the relative density and the gauge thickness ratio. The difference
   between upper and lower bounds is particularly significant for negative
   Poisson's ratio honeycombs. Finite element simulations confirm the
   theoretical trend, and show gauge ratio dependence different from that
   envisaged in the literature for conventional honeycombs. A modified
   approximate formula is thus proposed to predict the actual transverse
   shear modulus for honeycombs having in-plane negative Poisson's ratio
   values.}},

Abstract = {{A series of tests have been conducted on (i) auxetic, (ii) compression
   moulded and (iii) sintered ultra high molecular weight polyethylene. The
   auxetic material possesses a negative Poisson's ratio, nu, due to its
   complex porous microstructure which consists of nodules interconnected
   by fibrils and the sintered material has a positive nu and is
   microporous but does not contain fibrils. It was found that the auxetic
   material was both more difficult to indent than the other materials at
   low loads (from 10-100 N) and was the least plastic with the most rapid
   viscoelastic creep recovery of any residual deformation. Indeed, at low
   loads, where the resistance to local indentation is most elastic, the
   hardness increased by up to a factor of 8 on changing the Poisson's
   ratio from nu approximate to 0 to nu approximate to -0.8. A mechanism is
   proposed based on local densification under the indentor of the nodules
   and fibrils which explains how the microstructural response of an
   auxetic polymer can be used to interpret the results. (C) 2000 Kluwer

Abstract = {{We describe a methodology to calculate the relative free energies of
   protein-peptide complex formation. The interaction energy was decomposed
   into nonpolar, electrostatic and entropic contributions. A free
   energy-surface area relationship served to calculate the nonpolar free
   energy term. The electrostatic free energy was calculated with the
   finite difference Poisson-Boltzmann method and the entropic contribution
   was estimated from the loss in the conformational entropy of the peptide
   side chains.
   We applied this methodology to a series of DnaK peptide complexes. On
   the basis of the single known crystal structure of the peptide-binding
   domain of DnaK with a bound heptapeptide, we modeled ten other DnaK
   heptapeptide complexes with experimentally measured K-d values from 0.06
   mu M to 11 mu M, using molecular dynamics to refine the structures of
   the complexes, Molecular dynamic trajectories, after equilibration, were
   used for calculating the energies with greater accuracy. The calculated
   relative binding free energies were compared with the experimentally
   determined free energies. Linear scaling of the calculated terms was
   applied to fit them to the experimental values. The calculated binding
   free energies were between -7.1 kcal/mol and - 9.4 kcal/mol with a
   correlation coefficient of 0.86, The calculated nonpolar contributions
   are mainly due to the central hydrophobic binding pocket of DnaK for
   three amino acid residues. Negative electrostatic fields generated by
   the protein increase the binding affinity for basic residues flanking
   the hydrophobic core of the peptide ligand, Analysis of the individual
   energy contributions indicated that the nonpolar contributions are
   predominant compared to the other energy terms even for peptides with
   low affinity and that inclusion of the change In conformational entropy
   of the peptide side chains does not improve the discriminative power of
   the calculation. The method seems to be useful for predicting relative
   binding energies of peptide ligands of DnaK and might be applicable to
   other protein-peptide systems, particularly if only the structure of one
   protein-ligand complex is available. Proteins 2000;40:185-192. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{We developed a new computer wire coding method and then applied it to
   investigate the suggestion that control selection bias might explain the
   observed association between wire codes and childhood cancer made in the
   study conducted by Savitz et at. in the Denver area. The computer wire
   coding method used a geographic information system approach with data on
   the local distribution electric system and from tax assessor records.
   Individual residences were represented as a circle scaled to the ground
   floor area of the residence and centered on the lot centroid. The wire
   code of thr residence was determined from the distance between the
   circle and the relevant power line, and from the current carrying
   capacity of that line. Using this method, wire codes were generated for
   238 290 residences built before 1986, the time of the Savitz et al.
   study, in the Denver metropolitan area. We then attempted to reconstruct
   the 1985 population of hypothetically eligible control children in the
   Denver metropolitan area by using 1980 census data. Since data were not
   available to locate the children in each residence within a census
   block, uniform, Poisson, and negative binomial distributions were used
   to randomly assign children to residences. To evaluate the Likelihood of
   the wire code distribution of the controls selected by Savitz et al.,
   100 random trials were conducted for each distribution, matching two
   controls to each case. The odds ratios between childhood cancer and very
   high current configuration (VHCC) wire codes were reduced when the
   assigned controls were used, suggesting control selection bias may have
   been present. However, control selection bias is unlikely to account for
   all the reported association between childhood cancer and wire codes in
   the Savitz et al, study. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Negative Poisson's ratios are predicted for body-centered-cubic phases
   that Likely exist in white dwarf cores and neutron star outer crusts, as
   well as those found for vacuumlike ion crystals, plasma dust crystals,
   and colloidal crystals (including certain virus crystals). The existence
   of this counterintuitive property, which means that a material laterally
   expands when stretched, is experimentally demonstrated for very low

   predicted negative and positive Poisson's ratios might be important for
   understanding the asteroseismology of neutron stars and white dwarfs and
   the effect of stellar stresses on nuclear reaction rates. Giant
   Poisson's ratios are both predicted and observed for highly strained

Abstract = {{Our objective was to evaluate HIV prevalence and identify risk factors
   for PW infection among women attending the antenatal clinic (ANC) at a
   large public hospital in Kisumu town, western Kenya. Between June 1996
   and November 1997, in the context of a study to determine the effect of
   placental malaria on mother-to-child transmission of HN in western
   Kenya, HIV-1 antibody testing was offered to women with a singleton
   uncomplicated pregnancy of greater than or equal to 32 weeks' gestation
   attending the ANC. Women were interviewed using a structured
   questionnaire and had a fingerstick blood sample collected for
   haemoglobin (Hb), malaria smears, and HIV antibody testing.
   Overall HIV seroprevalence was 26.1\% (743/2844) (95\% confidence
   interval (CI): 24.5-27.7) and in bivariate evaluation was significantly
   associated with anaemia (Hb <11 g/dl) (risk ratio (RR) 1.8), malarial
   parasitaemia (RR 1.6), fever (axillary temperature greater than or equal
   to 37.5 degrees C at screening) (RR 1.6), a history of being treated for
   either vaginal discharge (RR 1.5) or tuberculosis (RR 1.6), reported
   alcohol consumption (RR 1.6), being an unmarried multigravida (RR 2.2)
   or a history of the most recent child having died (RR 2.0). Poisson
   regression analysis for all women identified 5 significant factors
   independently associated with HIV seropositivity: anaemia (adjusted RR
   1.7; 95\% CI 1.3-2.0), malarial parasitaemia (adjusted RR 1.7; 95\% CI
   1.4-2.0), a history of being treated for vaginal discharge (adjusted RR
   1.5; 95\% CI 1.1-2.0), fever (adjusted RR 2.0; 95\% CI 1.3-3.2) and
   reported alcohol consumption (adjusted RR 1.6; 95\% CI 1.1-2.5).
   Multigravidae women whose most recent child had died were also more
   Likely to be HIV seropositive (adjusted RR 1.9; 95\% CI 1.7-2.8). Only
   5.5\% (156/2844) of the women had none of these risk factors, of whom
   12\% (18/156) were HIV(+). Even though the model containing the 5
   identified factors fitted the data well (goodness-of-fit chi(2)=18.41,
   P=0.10), its collective capacity to predict HIV infection was poor;
   while 74\% of the truly positive women were correctly predicted positive
   by the model, 52\% of the truly negative women were misclassified.
   Among pregnant women attending the ANC in western Kenya, we were unable
   to identify a subgroup at risk of HIV infection using non-serological
   information, indicating that wherever possible universal access to
   voluntary HIV counselling and testing would be preferable to targeted
   screening.}},

Abstract = {{Equilibrium response of articular cartilage to indentation loading is
   controlled by the thickness (h) and elastic properties (shear modulus,
   mu, and Poisson's ratio, nu) of the tissue. In this study, we
   characterized topographical variation of Poisson's ratio of the
   articular cartilage in the canine knee joint (N = 6), Poisson's ratio
   was measured using a microscopic technique. In this technique, the shape
   change of the cartilage disk was visualized while the cartilage was
   immersed in physiological solution and compressed in unconfined
   geometry. After a constant 5\% axial strain, the lateral strain was
   measured during stress relaxation. At equilibrium, the lateral-to-axial
   strain ratio indicates the Poisson's ratio of the tissue, Indentation
   (equilibrium) data from our prior study (Arokoski et al., 1994,
   International Journal of Sports Medicine 15, 254-260) was re-analyzed
   using the Poisson's ratio results at the test site to derive values for
   shear and aggregate moduli, The lowest Poisson's ratio (0.070 +/- 0.016)
   located at the patellar surface of femur (FPI) and the highest (0.236
   +/- 0.026) at the medial tibial plateau (TMI). The stiffest cartilage
   was found at the patellar groove of femur (mu = 0.964 +/- 0.189 MPa, H-a
   = 2.084 +/- 0.409 MPa) and the softest at the tibial plateaus (mu =
   0.385 +/- 0.062 MPa, H-a = 1.113 +/- 0.141 MPa), Comparison of the
   mechanical results and the biochemical composition of the tissue
   (Jurvelin et al,, 1988. Engineering in Medicine 17, 157-162) at the
   matched sites of the canine knee joint indicated a negative correlation
   between the Poisson's ratio and collagen-to-PG content ratio. This is in
   harmony with our previous findings which suggested that, in unconfined
   compression, the degree of lateral expansion in different tissue zones
   is related to collagen-to-PC ratio of the zone. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In this article, a hyperelastic formulation for light and compliant
   foams which accounts for nonlinear effects at material and kinematic
   levels is introduced. This theory is applicable to a large number of 2-
   and 3-D irregular open-cell structures. An expression for the
   strain-energy function is proposed which includes bending and stretching
   contributions. Although this description allows for irregularity in the
   structure at local or cell level, it also assumes that the macro
   structure is homogeneous, i.e. built by repetition of the same irregular
   unit cell. This micromechanical formulation has explicit correlation
   with the foam structure, and therefore it preserves in the constitutive
   relation the symmetries or directional properties of the corresponding
   structures, including the cases of re-entrant foams which exhibit
   negative Poisson's ratio effects. Due to the introduction of nonlinear
   kinematics, the evolution of the structure during the loading process
   and its effects on the constitutive behavior can be traced, including
   the cases where configurational transformations are present leading to
   non-convex strain-energy functions. Several examples of the
   stress-strain behavior for arbitrary large homogeneous deformations in a
   diamond-like structure are presented. The effect of the structure
   reorientation on the transition of local deformation mechanisms is
   clearly shown. The development of texture and anisotropy induced by the
   deformation process is also demonstrated. Finally, the role of the
   deformation mechanisms on the relation between foam stiffness and foam
   density is analyzed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Micromachined polymeric honeycomb membranes having conventional and
   re-entrant cell geometries have been fabricated using femtosecond laser
   ablation. Mechanical properties characterization confirms that the
   re-entrant membrane is auxetic (possesses negative Poisson's ratios:
   nu(xy) = -1.82 +/- 0.05 and nu(yx) = -0.51 +/- 0.01) whereas the
   conventional membrane possesses positive Poisson's ratios (nu(xy) =
   +0.86 +/- 0.06 and nu(yx) = +0.6 +/- 0.1). Comparison with honeycomb
   theory confirms that the dominant deformation mechanism is flexure of
   the honeycomb ribs. The auxetic membrane has been challenged with
   single-sized glass chromatography beads such that the beads were
   initially resting on the re-entrant cells. Subsequent tensile loading of
   the membrane showed the auxetic cells opening during deformation,
   enabling the beads to pass through the membrane. We have modeled the
   pare-opening properties of both types of membranes, and the observed
   behavior for the auxetic membrane is consistent with the model. This is
   a clear proof-of-concept demonstration of the potential of auxetic
   materials and structures in filter defouling or cleaning operations.
   This paper, therefore, demonstrates the successful design and
   fabrication of a micromachined auxetic structure having specifically
   tailored mechanical properties that show enhanced functional performance
   over the conventional filter structure.}},

Abstract = {{The cooperative condensation of DNA and cationic liposomes to form
   ordered aggregates in aqueous solution is associated with the release of
   partially bound counterions. We directly determine the extent of
   counterion release by separating the supernatant from the precipitated
   condensates, measuring the conductivity of the solution before and after
   the phase transition. The extent of counterion release is calculated for
   a range of lipid/DNA concentration ratios based on the nonlinear
   Poisson-Boltzmann theory. Both experiment and theory show maximal,
   essentially complete, release of counterions at the isoelectric point,
   where the positive (lipid)/negative (DNA) charge ratio is 1:1.
   Furthermore, at this point the entropic contribution to the condensation
   free energy is maximal and dominant.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers two aspects for enhancing structural damping using
   passive, but novel, methods. Attempting to take a forward look to the
   twenty-first century, the concept of using biological and evolutionary
   methods to `grow' damping material on the surface of a vibrating
   component is described. A simple cantilever beam is used as the
   component and a `free-layer' viscoelastic damping treatment is `grown'
   on the structure in such a way as to provide optimum damping over a
   frequency bandwidth that encompasses flexural and torsional modes of
   vibration. To enhance the `controllability' of the damping, the
   viscoelastic material is considered as a cellular material displaying a
   negative Poisson's ratio and it is shown that for the `free-layer'
   treatment it is possible to produce a range of modal loss factors by
   changing the cell geometry. Only numerical studies are used and no
   experimental validation has been carried out, the idea being to
   stimulate ideas for future structural damping concepts.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic (negative Poisson's ratio) cellular materials expand in all
   direction when pulled in only one, thus behaving in an unusual manner
   compared to ``classical{''} materials. Negative Poisson's ratio
   honeycombs and open cell foams have shown increased shear modulus,
   indentation resistance and low cut-off frequency acoustic properties. In
   this paper FEM microstructure models are used to compute the static and
   viscoelastic properties of closed-cell and two-phase foam composites.
   The complex modulus of the materials is calculated making use of the
   correspondence principal and evaluating the strain energy distributions
   for the different phases. The results are compared to the ones given by
   models representing a global in-plane uniaxial loading. The static and
   storage modulus values of two-phase composite foam are significantly
   enhanced by the presence of a re-entrant (auxetic) skeleton layout. The
   loss factor shows also a significant sensitivity on the volume fraction
   and strain energy distribution on the microstructure unit cells. Static
   and free-vibration simulations on sandwich beams with different core
   cellular materials show that it is possible to obtain both enhanced
   stiffness per unit weight values and modal loss factors using two-phase
   cellular solids with a re-entrant skeleton.}},

Pages = {{211-227}},
Abstract = {{Rainfall anomaly patterns are obtained for the city of Barcelona from a
   statistical and a spectral point of view. The time series consists of
   monthly rainfall amounts recorded over 128 years without interruption.
   Monthly positive and negative anomalies, obtained as the difference
   between monthly amounts and monthly threshold values, are used for both
   types of analyses. The threshold levels are derived form the deciles of
   theoretical monthly rainfall distributions, which have been previously
   modelled by the gamma distribution. Positive anti negative anomalies of
   the monthly rain amounts are investigated fur these threshold levels.
   The statistical analysis is applied to each decile considered, yielding
   empirical exponential laws that can be used to forecast the cumulative
   number of episodes of consecutive months with either positive or
   negative anomalies equalling or exceeding a fixed length. A set of
   linear laws, relating the expected rainfall amount cumulated during an
   episode of a fixed length, is also deduced. It is worthy of mention
   that, independently of the decile considered, all the exponential and
   linear laws have satisfactory regression coefficients. Ar the same time,
   it has also been possible to establish the evolution of the coefficients
   of these laws with respect to the different deciles considered. The
   exponential laws for episodes of positive and negative anomalies are the
   starting point, together with two hypotheses, to model probabilities of
   repeated long episodes over an arbitrary number of years and their
   return periods in terms of the Poisson distribution model. Moreover,
   power spectra are derived for anomalies relative to the 50\% decile at
   monthly and seasonal scale. The spectral estimates obtained are then
   compared with theoretical spectra deduced from possible Markovian or
   random behaviour of the time series of anomalies. Finally, the
   significant spectral peaks are discussed and compared with other
   significant spectral components deduced for some areas of the
   Mediterranean domain.}},

Abstract = {{Monte Carlo simulations and analytical approximations for a primitive
   model of the metal/solid electrolyte interface are presented. The mobile
   positive and negative point charges in the solid electrolyte are
   restricted to the corresponding sites of a NaCl lattice (Schottky
   defects). Single imaging of the mobile charges in the metal was
   considered. This model of the metal/solid electrolyte interface differs
   substantially from the primitive model metal/liquid electrolyte
   interface as a direct result of the discrete spatial locations available
   to the charges. When the temperature or the dielectric constant of the
   electrolyte is high, the potential and charge decay monotonically with
   distance from the interface. The diffuse layer is however less evident
   than in an analogous primitive model of the metal/liquid electrolyte
   interface. At high values of the ratio (qe)(2)/T epsilon, an oscillation
   in the charge density profile is observed as in primitive model
   simulations of liquid electrolytes, This phenomenon is however more
   marked for solid electrolytes, which can be rationalized in terms of the
   discrete spatial locations occupied by the charges in the electrolyte,
   As a direct consequence of the charge oscillation, the interfacial
   capacitance may exceed the Helmholtz capacitance calculated using the
   lattice parameters of the solid electrolyte, a phenomenon which has been
   observed experimentally.(16-18) The Monte Carlo data can be fitted
   approximately by a simple modification of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation
   in which an exponentially decaying function of distance proportional to
   the total interfacial potential drop is added to the potential in the
   Boltzmann factor.}},

Abstract = {{The interaction of heptalysine with vesicles formed from mixtures of the
   acidic lipid phosphatidylserine (PS) and the zwitterionic lipid
   phosphatidylcholine (PC) was examined experimentally and theoretically.
   Three types of experiments showed that smeared charge theories (e.g.,
   Gouy-Ghapman-Stern) underestimate the membrane association when the
   peptide concentration is high. First, the zeta potential of PC/PS
   vesicles in 100 mM KCI solution increased more rapidly with heptalysine
   concentration (14.5 mV per decade) than predicted by a smeared charge
   theory (6.0 mV per decade). Second, changing the net surface charge
   density of vesicles by the same amount in two distinct ways produced
   dramatically different effects: the molar partition coefficient
   decreased 1000-fold when the mole percentage of PS was decreased from
   17\% to 4\%, but decreased only 10-fold when the peptide concentration
   was increased to 1 mu M. Third, high concentrations of basic peptides
   reversed the charge on PS and PC/PS vesicles. Calculations based on
   finite difference solutions to the Poisson-Boltzmann equation applied to
   atomic models of heptalysine and PC/PS membranes provide a molecular
   explanation for the observations: a peptide adsorbing to the membrane in
   the presence of other surface-adsorbed peptides senses a local potential
   more negative than the average potential. The biological implications of
   these ``discreteness-of-charge{''} effects are discussed.}},

Volume = {{39}},

Abstract = {{The Poisson's ratio of a material is strictly defined only for small
   strain linear elastic behavior. In practice, engineering strains are
   often used to calculate Poisson's ratio in place of the mathematically
   correct true strains with only very small differences resulting in the
   case of many engineering materials. The engineering strain definition is
   often used even in the inelastic region, for example, in metals during
   plastic yielding. However, for highly nonlinear elastic materials, such
   as many biomaterials, smart materials and microstructured materials,
   this convenient extension may be misleading, and it becomes advantageous
   to define a strain-varying Poisson's function. This is analogous to the
   use of a tangent modulus for stiffness. An important recent application
   of such a Poisson's function is that of auxetic materials that
   demonstrate a negative Poisson's ratio and are often highly strain
   dependent. In this paper, the importance of the use of a Poisson's
   function in appropriate circumstances is demonstrated. Interpretation
   methods for coping with error-sensitive data or small strains are also
   described.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a singular integral equation method is applied to
   calculate the stress intensity factor along crack front of a 3D inclined
   semi-elliptical surface crack in a semi-infinite body under tension. The
   stress field induced by displacement discontinuities in a semi-infinite
   body is used as the fundamental solution. Then, the problem is
   formulated as a system of integral equations with singularities of the
   form r(-3). In the numerical calculation, the unknown body force
   doublets are approximated by the product of fundamental density
   functions and polynomials. The results show that the present method
   yields smooth variations of mixed modes stress intensity factors along
   the crack front accurately for various geometrical conditions. The
   effects of inclination angle, elliptical shape, and Poisson's ratio are
   considered in the analysis. Crack mouth opening displacements are shown
   in figures to predict the crack depth and inclination angle. When the
   inclination angle is 60 degree, the mode I stress intensity factor F-I
   has negative value in the limited region near free surface. Therefore,
   the actual crack surface seems to contact each other near the surface.}},

Pages = {{423-432}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The buckling of compressively prestressed square membranes with built-in
   edges is investigated experimentally and analyzed theoretically. The
   buckling depends weakly on Poisson's ratio and essentially is a function
   of the reduced prestrain, <(epsilon)over bar>(0) = epsilon(0)a(2)/h(2)
   where epsilon(0) is the physical prestrain, a is the width, and h is the
   thickness of the membrane. As <(epsilon)over bar>(0) becomes
   increasingly negative, the membrane undergoes two symmetry breaking
   buckling transitions.' Beyond the first transition occurring at
   <(epsilon)over bar>(cr1), the buckling profile has all the reflection
   and rotation symmetries of a square. The reflection symmetries are lost
   through a second instability transition at <(epsilon)over bar>(cr3). The
   bifurcation points, <(epsilon)over bar>(cr1) and <(epsilon)over
   bar>(cr2). and-buckling profiles were calculated using analytical energy
   minimization and nonlinear finite-element simulation. Both
   methods:agree. The buckling of micromachined plasma-enhanced chemical
   vapor deposition silicon nitride membranes on a silicon wafer is
   interpreted in terms of the theoretical results. Good matching between
   measured and calculated buckling profiles is found. The extracted strain
   values are consistent irrespective of the size and buckling mode of the
   membranes. From the average strain across:the wafer epsilon(0) = -3.50 x
   10(-4) and complementary wafer curvature measurements, a Young's modulus
   of 130 GPa is deduced. Methods for the straightforward extraction of
   epsilon(0) from experimental center deflections of buckled square
   membranes are described. {[}443].}},

Abstract = {{The authors investigated the association between schizophrenia and
   rheumatoid arthritis.
   The design is a population-based case-control and follow-up study. The
   cases were 20495 patients admitted for schizophrenia and registered in
   the Danish Psychiatric Case Register. A total of 204912 persons matched
   on age and gender and chosen from the general population served as
   controls. Admissions for rheumatoid arthritis and other non-autoimmune,
   musculoskeletal disorders were checked in the Danish National Patient
   Register. Odds ratios and relative risks were estimated by the
   Mantel-Haenszel estimator and Poisson regression. The same analyses were
   carried out for 10242 patients with bipolar affective disorder and
   102420 controls for comparison. Individuals with schizophrenia had a
   reduced risk for being admitted with rheumatoid arthritis {[}odds ratio
   0.44 (CI 0.24-0.81)] in the case-control study. A similar result was
   found in the follow-up study, but the incidence of the degenerative
   disorders in the musculoskeletal system was equally significantly lower
   in both studies. The incidence of rheumatoid arthritis among the bipolar
   patients was the same as in the control population. The negative
   association between schizophrenia and rheumatoid arthritis may thus be
   the result of ascertainment bias and selection due to under reporting
   and treatment of the medical illness. Clinicians are reminded of the
   difficulties in detecting medical illness among individuals with
   schizophrenia. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This work presents the derivation of general streamflow cumulants from
   daily rainfall time series. The general streamflow cumulants can be used
   to compute basic streamflow statistics such as mean, variance,
   coefficient of skewness, and correlation coefficient. Streamflow is
   considered as a filtered point process where the input is a daily
   rainfall time series assumed to be a marked point process. The marks of
   the process are the daily rainfall amounts which are assumed independent
   and identically distributed. The number of rainfall occurrences is a
   counting process represented by either the binomial, the Poisson, or the
   negative binomial probability distribution depending on its ratio of
   mean to variance. The first three cumulants and the covariance function
   of J-day averaged streamflows are deduced based on the characteristic
   function of a filtered point process. These cumulants are functions of
   the stochastic properties of the daily rainfall process and the
   basin-response function representing the causal relationship between

Abstract = {{This study provides the reader with a methodology for directly deriving
   basic streamflow statistics (mean, variance, and correlation
   coefficient) from long-term recorded daily rainfall data. A daily
   streamflow sequence is considered as a filtered point process where the
   input is a storm time sequence that is assumed to be a marked point
   process. The mark is the storm magnitude that is constructed from a
   daily rainfall time series, and the correlation of the daily rainfall
   during the storm is considered. The number of storms is a counting
   process represented by either the binomial, the Poisson, or the negative
   binomial probability distribution, depending on its ratio of mean versus
   variance. As a pulse-response function for a filtered point process, the
   model of three serial tanks with a parallel tank is adopted to describe
   the physical process of rainfall-runoff. Thus the basic statistics
   (mean, variance, and covariance function) of J-day averaged streamflows
   can be estimated in terms of the constants expressing stochastic
   properties of a rainfall time series and the tank model's parameters
   representing the causal relationship between rainfall and runoff. The
   method is used to derive the streamflow statistics of an actual dam
   basin, the Sameura Dam basin, located in Shikoku island, Japan. The
   resulting computed means and variances of 5-day averaged streamflows
   show a good correspondence with observed ones.}},

Volume = {{35}},

Pages = {{3139-3147}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The Tokunaga cyclic model describes average network topology. A
   stochastic generalization is proposed. The stochastic model assumes that
   actual tributary numbers are random realizations from a negative
   binomial distribution whose mean is defined by the Tokunaga parameters
   epsilon(1) and K. These parameters can be interpreted as representing
   the effects of regional controls. Upon these regional controls is
   superimposed an inherent spatial variability in network topology. A
   third parameter alpha characterizes this spatial variability. When alpha
   becomes large, the negative binomial model approaches a Poisson model. A
   goodness-of-fit test based on a chi(2) test statistic is developed, and
   an inference framework for estimation of parameters and stream-related
   statistics is described. This methodology is illustrated on tributary
   data from three catchments, one of the order of 5 and two of the order
   of 8. It is shown that the stochastic Tokunaga model using the negative
   binomial distribution is not inconsistent with the tributary data,
   whereas the Poisson model is unambiguously rejected by the data. Monte
   Carlo Bayesian methods are used to evaluate the uncertainty in the
   Tokunaga parameters and in stream number related statistics such as the
   bifurcation ratio. It is shown that tributary data from the order-5
   network provide little power for discriminating between model
   hypotheses. The tributary data for the two order-8 basins are
   significantly different from the asymptotic stream number statistics
   predicted by Shreve's random network model. Finally, the problem of
   space filling or preservation of nontopological properties is considered
   in the context of the stochastic Tokunaga model.}},

Abstract = {{The energetic homogenization procedure for the determination of the
   effective elasticity tensor of grid structures as proposed in an earlier
   paper is extended to the analysis of general hexagonal and quadrilateral

   macroscopically equal deformation the same strain energy has to be
   stored in a representative volume element whether the given
   microstructure or the effective homogenized medium is considered. The
   components of the effective elasticity tensor are determined by partial
   derivation of the strain energy density with respect to the macroscopic
   strain components. The analysis is performed comparatively by an
   analytical approach and by means of the finite element method. Standard
   commercial sandwich core geometries are considered as well as highly
   non-orthotropic grid structures. The influence of the cell geometry on
   the effective properties is discussed in detail. Special interest is
   directed to negative Poisson's ratios as well as to effectively
   non-orthotropic elastic behaviour. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Two negative binomial mixed models with different dispersion

   with analogous estimates computed by an overdispersed Poisson mixed
   model. Estimators from the second negative binomial and overdispersed
   Poisson models had better frequentist properties than did those from the
   first negative binomial model. Nevertheless, application to a data set
   of number of artificial inseminations until conception in Holstein
   heifers suggested a slightly better fit of the first negative binomial

Abstract = {{The elastic properties of diamond-like carbon (DLC) films were measured
   by a simple method using DLC bridges which are free from the mechanical
   constraints of the substrate. The DLC films were deposited on a Si wafer
   by radio frequency (RF) glow discharge at a deposition pressure of 1.33
   Pa. Because of the high residual compressive stress of the film, the
   bridge exhibited a sinusoidal displacement on removing the substrate
   constraint. By measuring the amplitude with a known bridge length, we
   could determine the strain of the film which occurred by stress
   relaxation. Combined with independent stress measurement using the laser
   reflection method, this method allows the calculation of the biaxial
   elastic modulus, E/(1 - nu), where E is the elastic modulus and nu is
   Poisson's ratio of the DLC film. The biaxial elastic modulus increased
   from 10 to 150 GPa with increasing negative bias voltage from 100 to 550
   V. By comparing the biaxial elastic modulus with the plane-strain
   modulus, E/(1-nu(2)), measured by nano-indentation, we could further
   determine the elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio, independently. The
   elastic modulus, E, ranged from 16 to 133 GPa in this range of the
   negative bias voltage. However, large errors were incorporated in the
   calculation of Poisson's ratio due to the pile up of errors in the
   measurements of the elastic properties and the residual compressive
   stress. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Nitrogen dioxide is known as a deep lung irritant. The aim of this study
   was to find out whether the relatively low ambient air NO2
   concentrations in the northern city of Helsinki had an impact on the
   respiratory health of children.
   The association between personal exposure to ambient air NO2 and
   respiratory health was investigated in a 13-week follow-up study among
   163 preschool children aged 3-6 yrs, Personal weekly average exposure to
   NO2 was measured by passive diffusion samplers attached to the outer
   garments, Symptoms were recorded daily in a diary by the parents, Among
   53 children, peak expiratory flow (PEF) was measured at home in the
   mornings and evenings. The association between NO2 exposure and
   respiratory symptoms was examined with Poisson regression.
   The median personal NO2 exposure was 21.1 mu g.m(-3) (range 4-99 mu
   g.m(-3). An increased risk of cough was associated with increasing NO2
   exposure (risk ratio=1.52; 95\% confidence interval 1.00-2.31). There
   was no such association between personal weekly NO2 exposure and nasal
   symptoms, but a nonsignificant negative association was found between
   the exposure and the weekly average deviation in PEF.
   In conclusion, even low ambient air NO2 concentrations can increase the
   risk of respiratory symptoms among preschool children.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To study trends in the prevalence and incidence of HIV-1 and
   HIV-2 infections in Guinea-Bissau over the last 7 years, and to evaluate
   the protective effect of HIV-2 against HIV-1 infection.
   Design: Prospective follow-up of a cohort of police officers in
   Guinea-Bissau, and sentinel surveillance of pregnant women in Bissau.
   Methods: Participants in the police cohort were tested regularly for
   antibodies to HIV and Treponema pallidum, and information about sexual
   risk behaviour and a history of sexually transmitted diseases was
   obtained. Simultaneously, pregnant women at the maternity wards at the
   National Hospital in Bissau were screened annually For HIV antibodies.
   To evaluate changes in prevalence and incidence of HIV in the police
   cohort, the study period was divided into three time strata with 2-3
   years in each stratum. For the evaluation of a protective effect of
   HIV-2 on subsequent HIV-1 infection, two multivariate Poisson regression
   models were constructed, adjusting For different selected confounding
   variables.
   Results: Between 1990 and 1997, 2637 police officers were included in
   the cohort study, 90.7\% of whom were male. The overall prevalence of
   HIV-1 was 0.9\%, of HIV-2 it was 9.7\% and of HIV-1 and HIV-2 dual
   reactivity it was 0.5\%. For pregnant women the prevalence rates were
   0.9, 5.5 and 0.2\% for HIV-1, HIV-2 and dual reactivity respectively.
   The prevalence of HIV-1 increased significantly whereas the prevalence
   of HIV-2 declined significantly during the study period, among both
   police officers and pregnant women. The total incidence of HIV-1 and
   HIV-2 was 0.74 and 0.83 per 100 person-years respectively in the police
   cohort. The incidence of HIV-1 increased slightly from 0.62 to 0.78 per
   100 person-years (not significant), whereas the incidence of HIV-2
   declined significantly from 0.90 to 0.33 per 100 person-years over the
   study period. Seven police officers seroconverted From HIV-2 to dual
   reactivity (1.22 per 100 person-years). The adjusted incidence ratio of
   acquiring HIV-1 infection among HIV-2 positive subjects compared with
   HIV-negative subjects was 1.65 {[}95\% confidence interval (CI),
   0.73-3.74] and 1.98 (95\% CI, 0.80-4.87), depending on the confounding
   variables included.
   Conclusions: Our study shows an increasing prevalence of HIV-1 and a
   decreasing prevalence of HIV-2 in Guinea-Bisaau. The incidence of HIV-2
   declined significantly whereas the incidence of HIV-1 was relatively
   stable over the study period. No protective effect of HIV-2 against
   subsequent HIV-1 infection was observed, instead HIV-2-positive subjects
   had a tendency towards higher risk of acquiring HIV-1 infection compared
   with seronegative subjects.}},

Abstract = {{Two challenges in mechanics of granular media are taken up in this
   paper: (i) development of adequate numerical discrete element models of
   topologically disordered granular assemblies and (ii) calculation of
   macroscopic elastic moduli of such materials using effective medium
   theories. Consideration of the first one leads to an adaptation of a
   spring-network (Kirkwood) model of solid-state physics to disordered
   systems, which is developed in the context of planar Delaunay networks.
   The model! employs two linear springs: a normal one along an edge
   connecting two neighboring vertices (grain centers) which accounts for
   normal interactions between the grains, as well as an angular one which
   accounts for angle changes between two edges incident onto the same
   vertex; edges remain straight and grain rotations do not appear This
   model is then used to predict elastic moduli of two-phase granular
   materials-random mixtures of soft and stiff grains-for high coordination
   numbers. It is found here that an effective Poisson's ratio, nu(eff), Of
   such a mixture is a convex function of the volume fraction, so that
   nu(eff) may become negative when the individual Poisson's ratios of both
   phases are both positive. Additionally, the usefulness of three
   effective medium theories-perfect disks, symmetric ellipses, and
   asymmetric ellipses-is tested.}},

   0.85 for nearly disc-, blade-, sphere-, disk- and neddle-like

Abstract = {{Distance sampling techniques were compared to point (variable plot)
   sampling and fixed-radius circular plot sampling for inventory of teak
   (Tectona grandis) plantations in Indonesia. n-tree distance sampling
   selects the n trees closest to a sample point located in the field. The
   distance to the nth closest tree is used as a plot radius. Two n-tree
   estimators were compared. Prodan (1968) described a technique for n=6,
   which counts the nth tree as 1/2 for tree counts and tree volume (or
   other tree attributes). Another approach, here called `the (n-1)/n
   adjusted estimator', uses the bias correction factor (n-1)/n. Eberhardt
   (1967) demonstrated that the (n-1)/n adjusted estimator is unbiased for
   Poisson (random) and negative binomial (clumped) spatial distributions.
   No proof of unbiasedness is known for either method in uniform
   distributions which would be characteristic of plantations. n-tree
   sampling was performed in Indonesian teak plantations for values of n
   ranging from 3 to 10 for both methods. At the same locations, point
   (variable plot) samples with metric basal area factors 1 m(2) ha(-1)
   tree(-1) and 2 m(2) ha(-1) tree(-1) and fixed-radius circular plots 0.1
   ha in size were installed for comparison with the n-tree distance
   methods. The time required for each sampling method was recorded at each
   field location. For each method, an efficiency ratio was calculated as
   (C-k(2) x Time(k))/(C-0.1ha(2) x Time(0.1ha)) where C-k is the
   coefficient of variation for method k, Time(k) is the average time
   required for method k, C-0.1 ha is the coefficient of variation for 0.1
   ha plots and Time(0.1 ha) is the average time required for 0.1 ha plots.
   The more efficient methods have smaller efficiency ratios. According to
   this criterion, 5-tree distance sampling using Prodan's estimator was
   most efficient of the techniques compared that did not show bias for
   these data. The (n-1)/n adjusted estimator showed bias for these trials
   in teak plantations. This was probably due to the uniform spatial
   distribution characteristic of plantations. Point sampling with BAF=1
   m(2) ha(-1) tree(-1) and BAF=2 m(2) ha(-1) tree(-1) and 0.1 ha plot
   sampling were not as efficient as n-tree sampling methods for these
   trials. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A bivariate distribution, whose marginals are Poisson is developed as a
   product of Poisson marginals with a multiplicative factor. The
   correlation between the two variates can be either positive or negative,
   depending on the value chosen for the parameter in the above
   multiplicative factor. The distributional properties of this
   distribution are studied and this model is fitted to a bivariate
   discrete distribution with negative correlation coefficient. In this
   context, it should be worth noting that the bivariate Poisson
   distribution reported by Teicher (1954), (Campbell (1934), Holgate
   (1964)) has the inherent limitation that the correlation is necessarily
   positive, and hence is not useful in modelling the situations (e.g. in
   biology) involving competition for limited resources where a negative
   correlation is expected.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPOSITE MATERIALS}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{19}},
Pages = {{1843-1857}},
Abstract = {{In isotropic materials, it is known that values of Poisson's ratio
   larger than one half are thermodynamically inadmissible, for such values
   would lead to negative strain energy under certain loads. Although a
   negative Poisson's ratio is not forbidden by thermodynamics, it is rare
   in crystalline solids. With the development of modem fiber reinforced
   composite materials, the effective Poisson's ratio of laminated fiber
   reinforced composites shows a peculiar behavior as it becomes larger
   than one half or less than zero.
   In this article, a study of negative in-plane Poisson's ratio for a
   general class of randomly-oriented composite laminates is presented. A
   simple random statistical analysis has been presented. It is
   demonstrated that composite laminates with negative in-plane Poisson's
   ratio could be achieved by using the specific values of independent
   elastic constants E-1, E-2, G(12), and v(12) in each lamina. Also, the
   influence of the lamina material properties to the negative in-plane
   Poisson's ratio of the composite laminates is presented. The results
   from this statistical analysis provide a set of general guidelines for
   designing composite laminates with a special character-the negative
   in-plane Poisson's ratio.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper a theoretical and numerical study on the viscoelastic
   behavior of auxetic polymers and cellular materials is presented.
   Negative Poisson's ratio materials (alpha upsilon xi epsilon o sigma in
   Creek) expand in all directions when pulled in only one, and contract
   when compressed in one direction. This behavior is due to the special
   geometric layout of their unit cells. A theoretical model including
   viscoelastic and inertia effects on the unit cell has been prepared in
   order to compute the equivalent in-plane dynamic storage modulus and
   loss factor of the cellular material. The calculations show how inertia
   effects and geometric layout of the unit cell affect the viscoelastic
   behavior of the material over the frequency domain. The results show a
   very good agreement with the ones from analogous FEM models. Auxetic
   honeycombs are a good example of cellular materials with negative
   Poisson's ratio behavior. A Finite Element model has been elaborated to
   model also the viscoelastic response of the transverse shear modulus of
   this kind of honeycombs and compared with analytical results.}},

Abstract = {{Ratio estimation of the parametric mean for a characteristic measured on
   plants sampled by a line intercept method is presented and evaluated via
   simulation using different plant dispersion patterns (Poisson, regular
   cluster, and Poisson cluster), plant width variances, and numbers of
   lines. The results indicate that on average the estimates are close to
   the parametric mean under all three dispersion patterns. Given a fixed
   number of lines, variability of the estimates is similar across
   dispersion patterns with variability under the Poisson pattern slightly
   smaller than variability under the cluster patterns. No variance
   estimates were negative under the Poisson pattern, but some estimates
   were negative under the cluster patterns for smaller numbers of lines.
   Variance estimates become closer to zero similarly for all spatial
   patterns as the number of lines increases. Ratio estimation of the
   parametric mean in line intercept sampling works better, from the
   viewpoint of approximate unbiasedness and variability of estimates,
   under the Poisson pattern with larger numbers of lines than other
   combinations of spatial patterns, plant width variances and numbers of

Abstract = {{We review and discuss recent progress in modelling non-linear and
   non-local transport processes in heterogeneous media. The non-locality
   that we consider is caused by long-range correlations that either exist
   in the morphology of the media, or are caused by the transport processes
   themselves. The interplay between the non-linearity and non-locality is
   discussed in depth with the aim of establishing that, often
   non-linearity and non-locality are ``two sides of the same coin{''},
   such that one may have no meaning without the presence of the other one.
   First, we discuss linear and scalar, but non-local transport processes
   and, in particular, consider those in percolation systems with
   long-range correlations. It appears that there are significant
   differences between percolative transport processes in which the
   long-range correlations (or the covariance function) decrease with the
   distance r between two points, and those in which they increase as r
   does. Application of this problem to how and transport in geological
   formations is discussed. We then consider linear vector percolation, one
   type of which, the rigidity percolation, provides an example of a
   non-local vector transport in heterogeneous media. Applications of
   vector percolation to modelling elastic properties of glasses, composite
   solids and rock, mechanical and viscoelastic properties of polymers, and
   vibrations and dynamical properties of heterogeneous materials are
   discussed. Non-linear and non-local scalar transport processes are
   discussed next, including various breakdown phenomena in disordered
   composites, power-law transport, piecewise linear transport
   characterized by a threshold, and non-linear processes that arise as a
   result of imposing a large external potential gradient on a
   heterogeneous medium. Their relevance to flow of non-Newtonian fluids in
   porous media, to electrical currents and dielectric breakdown in
   composite solids and doped polycrystalline semiconductors, and several
   other problems is then discussed. Finally, we discuss non-linear and
   non-local vector transport, the most important example of which is
   mechanical fracture of disordered solids. We discuss exactly solvable
   models of fracture, quasi-static and dynamic lattice models, molecular
   dynamics simulations, and continuum formulation of the problem. In all
   cases, the predictions of the models are compared with the relevant
   experimental data. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Mean-field theory of elastic moduli of a two-phase disordered composite

   mean-field approximation, the effective Poisson ratio sigma(e) in
   composites with auxetic inclusions of various shapes such as discs,
   spheres, blades, needles, and disks is studied analytically and
   numerically. It is shown that phase properties such as inclusion volume
   or area fraction phi and matrix and inclusion Poisson ratios (sigma(m)
   and sigma) and Young's moduli (E-m and E) have a marked effect on
   sigma(e). The earlier theoretical findings of the existence of
   auxeticity windows and the widening effect of inclusion-inclusion
   interactions on the window for delta=E/E-m are reconfirmed for
   composites of auxetic spheres in both two and three dimensions, with new
   auxeticity windows discovered for the other inclusion shapes. For a
   composite with sigma= -0.8, sigma(m) = 0.25, and phi=0.4, it is found
   that the sphere is the most sigma(e)-lowering or

Abstract = {{Excitation and luminescence spectra of Pr3+ in LaOCl were measured over
   the spectral range from 11 000 cm(-1) to 22 000 cm(-1). At ambient
   pressure a total of 46 spectral lines could be observed. Under pressures
   up to 16 GPa, all lines exhibit a red-shift-however, with very different
   rates. From the spectral lines, the energy level scheme of the 4f(2)
   configuration could be partly derived. From 37 levels at ambient
   pressure, 30 could also be obtained under pressure. The energy level
   scheme is described by the use of free-ion (F-k (k = 2, 4, 6), alpha,
   beta, gamma, zeta) and crystal-field parameters (B-0(2), B-0(4), B-4(4),
   B-0(6), B-6(6)). According to the so-called nephelauxetic auxetic
   effect, the free-ion parameters F-k and zeta decrease under pressure.
   The magnitudes of the variations depend on the selected energy levels.
   Surprisingly the crystal-field strength shows a peculiar behaviour with
   an initial decrease and a minimum at 15 GPa. This behaviour can be
   explained within the context of the superposition model.}},

Abstract = {{Crustal structures for nine broad tectonic units in China, except the
   Tarim craton, are derived from seismic data for 18 geophysical
   refraction profiles, which include twelve geoscience transects and have
   a total length of 16216 km. AU the tectonic units except the Qinling
   orogen show a four-layered crustal structure, consisting of upper,
   middle, upper lower, and lowermost crust. If corrections are made to
   room temperature and 600 MPa, the upper lower crust has P-wave
   velocities of 6.7-6.8 km s(-1) and the lowermost crust 7.0-7.2 km s(-1).
   Velocities of the bulk lower crust and total crust are 6.8-7.0 and
   6.4-6.5 km s(-1), respectively. They are slower by 0.2-0.4 km s(-1),
   than the global averages. By correlation with experimental results on
   velocities of typical lower crustal rocks, the upper lower crust is
   suggested to be intermediate, while the lowermost crust is mafic in
   composition. Due to dominance of the former, the bulk lower crust is
   still intermediate for most tectonic units. However, inter-unit
   compositional variations are also evident, as indicated by large
   variations in the thickness ratio (0.3-3.0) of the upper lower to
   lowermost crust. The lower crust in East China as a whole is suggested
   to have similar to 57\% SiO2. The results contrast with generally
   accepted models of mafic lower crust. Our estimates of the total crust
   composition in central East China show a more evolved character compared
   to models of Rudnick and Fountain, and Taylor and McLennan and are
   characterized by a prominent negative Eu anomaly (Eu/Eu{*} = 0.80),
   higher SiO2 (61.8\%), and lower Sr/Nd (similar to 10) as well as lower
   Sr/Nd, Cr/Nd, Ni/Nd, Co/Nd, V/Nd and Ti/Nd ratios. This, together with
   slower crustal velocities and remarkably thin crustal thicknesses (34
   km) for the Paleozoic-Mesozoic Qinling-Dabie orogenic belt, leads to the
   suggestion that lower crustal delamination played an important role in
   modification of the East China crust. Mass balance modeling further
   suggests that eclogite from the Dabie-Sulu ultrahigh pressure
   metamorphic belt is the most likely candidate as the delaminated
   material, and that a cumulative 37-82 km thick eclogitic lower crust is
   required to have been delaminated in order to explain the relative Eu,
   Sr and transition metal deficits in the crust of central East China.
   Delamination of eclogites can also explain the significantly higher than
   eclogite Poisson's ratio in the present Dabie lower crust and upper
   mantle and lack of eclogite in Cenozoic xenolith populations of the
   lower crust and upper mantle in East China. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{A nonlinear micromechanical model for two-dimensional irregular
   hexagonal foams has been developed that allows for anisotropy in
   morphology and/or material. Based upon the orientation, cross section,
   length, and material properties of each strut, the resulting microlevel
   beam behavior within the unit cell determines its structural properties.
   Nonlinearity is introduced as coupled elastoplastic beam behavior, where
   the elastoplastic behavior of each beam is considered. The analytical
   formulation for the stiffness matric of the general elastoplastic unit
   cell is found by considering compatibility and equilibrium of the unit
   cell. The structural properties of the elastoplastic unit cell are
   embedded in a continuum finite element model as material properties,
   thus capturing the microstructure of the foam in an accurate and
   efficient mode. Structural nonlinearity is therefore directly linked to
   localized plasticity and its evolution at the microlevel. Elastic
   analyses investigated the degree of anisotropy in structural properties
   that was induced by various morphological changes. The differences in
   stress and deformation behavior between a regular hexagonal foam and a
   re-entrant foam were also demonstrated. Plastic analyses showed how
   structural nonlinearity could be explained by localized microstructural
   behavior. The advantage of this micromechanical model is that it allows
   a study of the effects of morphology and/or material anisotropies on the
   overall foam behavior.}},

   and the characteristics of larval distribution among parous flies. The
   variance over mean ratio (VMR) indicated that in all cases this
   distribution departed from Poisson and was strongly aggregated (VMR >
   1). The negative binomial was found to be an adequate model with a small
   value of the aggregation parameter k, but the degree of larval
   overdispersion increased as the mean larval load decreased, invalidating
   the use of a common k, value. A lineal relationship between it and the
   mean (mu) was established, k(mu) = k(1)mu, which permitted exploration
   of the relationship between the observed proportion of infected flies,
   p, and the estimated mean larval bur den per fly, m (all larval stages
   in parous flies). This would allow mean numbers of larvae per parous fly
   to be predicted from presence-absence data (e.g., from infection rates
   provided by polymerase chain reaction methods applied to pools of
   flies), assuming that k(1) is a known parameter. Given that both, and m
   are naturally low in S. ochraceum, their relationship was practically
   linear within the range of observed values. Predictions were tested with
   the Mexican data from which the clumping parameter was estimated as well
   as for Guatemalan data for which this information was not available.
   Results showed a highly satisfactory degree of agreement between
   predictions and observations. The sample sizes required to estimate mean
   larval loads from prevalence data for fixed levels of precision (defined
   as the ratio between SE{[}m] and m) were calculated for realistic S.
   ochraceum infection rates (those found in published pre- and postcontrol
   field surveys as well as in this work). For the special case in which
   the relationship between k and. the mean is linear and goes through the
   origin, k(mu) = k(1)mu, the number of flies to be examined for O.
   volvulus infections does not explicitly depend on the aggregation
   parameter, but rather on the unknown proportion of infected flies.
   Practical recommendations for the calculation of sample sizes are
   discussed. For infection levels <0.2\%, a minimum number between 6,000
   and 13,000 parous flies would have to be examined to estimate the mean
   larval load with a precision between 0.20 and 0.30. The linearity
   between onchocercal infection rare and infection intensity in the fly
   population indicates that relationships between the former and
   onchocerciasis patterns in the human population should be further
   explored. for the purposes of monitoring the impact of ivermectin
   control programs through entomological evaluations.}},

   terminal-lateral-lateral-terminal trimer, i.e., a trimer in which the
   connections to the first and third mesogens are at the end of the
   mesogen and both attachments to the central mesogen are lateral.
   Polymeric liquid crystals based on this unit have negative Poisson
   ratios. Additionally, electric field Kerr measurements were performed in
   the isotropic phase to extract the orientational susceptibility. The
   elastic constants were found to be similar to values obtained for
   typical monomers, albeit with a slightly enhanced ratio K-33/K-11 and
   reduced ratio K-11/K-22 especially near the transition temperature. The
   temperature dependence of the susceptibility was found to deviate
   significantly from that of typical monomers. The observed behavior is
   discussed in terms of coupled order parameters representing the terminal
   and core mesogens of the molecule.}},

Title = {{Effects of morphology and orientation on the behavior of two-dimensional

Abstract = {{This study deals with the elastic behavior of regular (equal strut
   lengths) hexagonal foams, both convex and non-convex (re-entrant).
   Explicit constitutive relations are given based on the unit cell
   geometry and strut material properties. Sensitivity studies show the
   effects of unit cell architecture and loading direction on the
   structural properties of the unit cell. The effect of cell strut angle
   on the structural properties is clarified by considering the change in
   relative density of the foam that is related to changes in the strut
   angles. It is shown that the density varies dramatically with strut
   angle for fixed strut lengths, which significantly effects the
   interpretation of results. An important conclusion regarding the effect
   of foam orientation (or loading direction) is that what has been
   referred to as a negative Poisson's ratio for re-entrant foams is
   actually a negative Poisson's ratio effect. This effect can in fact be
   reversed by simply rotating the foam; for intermediate rotation angles
   the foam may demonstrate a positive Poisson's ratio deformation
   behavior. Hexagonal re-entrant foams do not have a unique value of
   Poisson's ratio since they are anisotropic. For demonstration, the
   elastic re-entrant foam constitutive relations are embedded into a
   finite element model to study a foam anchor between rigid parallel
   walls. The effect of the cell strut angle on the anchoring effectiveness
   of the foam is discussed. Foams with strut angles of 100 degrees and 110
   degrees and equal relative densities are compared, and it is concluded
   that the foam with 100 degrees strut angle provides better anchoring.
   This conclusion is based on the finding that the 100 degrees foam is
   stiffer and has a stronger negative Poisson's ratio (lateral expansion
   under tension) effect than the 110 degrees foam having the same relative
   density. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{21 well-distributed teleseisms (30 degrees to 100 degrees distance) were
   recorded by mixed broad-band (BB) and short-period (SP) seismic arrays
   at Mineral King (MK) and Horseshoe Meadow (HM) in the southern Sierra
   Nevada and at Darwin Plateau (DP) between the Inyo and Argus ranges.
   These arrays permit identification and separation of direct P and S
   arrivals, reflections from topography, scattered energy, and arrivals
   from different back azimuths (multipath arrivals). P-to-S conversions
   can be identified from beamed BE or SP seismograms. Least squares time
   domain processing recovered single-event receiver functions from these
   beamed seismograms. Converted phases attributable to the Moho are clear
   and uncomplicated at DP; Ps-P times of 3.9-4.2 s correspond to crustal
   thicknesses of 31-33 km, assuming a mean P crustal velocity of 6.2 km/s
   and a Poisson's ratio (v) of 0.255. Ps-P times at HM (eastern Sierra)
   are 3.9-4.6 s (32-37 km) excepting some unusual seismograms from events
   at back azimuths of 225 degrees-239 degrees. MK (western Sierra) times
   for Ps-P show a strong E-W asymmetry: 3.9-4.1 s (31-33 km) from the
   east, and 4.8-5.3 s (39-42 km) from the west. The MK arrivals from the
   east are multiple and substantially weaker by comparison with HM and DP.
   These results confirm the absence of a thick crust under the southern
   High Sierra inferred from both a refraction experiment coincident with
   this experiment and some earlier studies. At DP the Moho event follows
   an intracrustal negative polarity event defining the top of an S wave
   low-velocity zone. This feature dips west under the Sierran crest at HM
   but is absent farther west at MK. This feature appears to be a
   manifestation of extensional strain and thus indicates that the
   surficially undeformed Sierra overlies a tectonized lower crust.
   Sub-Moho energy is absent under the Basin and Range (DP) but is
   conspicuous under the High Sierra at positive arrivals similar to 7.3 s
   (MK) and similar to 9 s (HM) after the P. These arrivals might be from
   the base of a low-velocity, low-density upper mantle body supporting the
   Sierra.}},

Abstract = {{Materials with specific microstructural characteristics and composite
   structures are able to exhibit negative Poisson's ratio. This fact has
   been shown to be valid for certain mechanisms, composites with voids and

   numerically shown that mainly the shape, but also the ratio of
   shear-to-bending rigidity of the beams do influence the apparent
   (phenomenological) Poisson's ratio. The same is valid for continua with
   voids, or for composites with irregular shapes of inclusions, even if
   the constituents are quite usual materials, provided that their porosity

Abstract = {{Elastic properties of multilayers with low period thickness show in some
   cases anomalies which are generally correlated with structural
   modifications in individual layers. In the recent past, several studies
   have evidenced using X-ray diffraction in-plane and out-of-plane strains
   with the same sign. Some authors have then proposed in the case of W/Ni
   and Nb/Cu metallic superlattices to use a negative Poisson's ratio. This
   result is surprising because the value of this coefficient in metals is
   generally positive. In this article. we introduce a novel interpretation
   mainly based on the experimental determination by sin(2) Psi method of
   the reference parameter (stress-free lattice parameter) used in strain
   calculations. Then, we show that the introduction of the bulk parameter
   instead of stress-free parameter for the reference parameter is an
   unrealistic assumption in the case of thin films and multilayers (W and
   Ag/Ni) and may thus lead to wrong results which are then in total
   disagreement with those obtained by other techniques. Therefore, the
   elastic anomaly concerning Poisson's ratio which has been reported by
   some authors in scientific literature do not result from real structure
   of multilayers but from experimental X-ray; diffraction data analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Frequency distributions of insect immatures per host are often fitted to
   contagious distributions, such as the negative binomial, to deduce
   oviposition pattern. However, different mechanisms can be involved for
   each theoretical distribution and additional biological information is
   needed to correctly interpret the fits. We chose the chestnut weevil
   Curculio elephas, a pest of the European chestnut Castanea sativa as a
   model to illustrate the difficulties of inferring oviposition pattern
   from fits to theoretical distributions and from the variance/mean ratio.
   From field studies over 13-16 years, we show that 20 out of the 31
   yearly distributions available Rt a negative binomial and 25 a
   zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP). No distribution fits a Poisson
   distribution. The ZIP distribution assumes heterogeneity within the
   fruit population. There are two categories of host: the first comprises
   chestnuts unsuitable for weevil oviposition or in excess relative to the
   number of weevil females, and the second comprises suitable fruits in
   which oviposition behavior is random. Our results confirm this host
   heterogeneity. According to the ZIP distribution, the first category of
   hosts includes on average 74\% of the chestnuts. A negative binomial
   distribution may be generated by either true or false contagion. We show
   that neither interference between weevil females, nor spatial variation
   in the infestation rate exist. Consequently, the observed distributions
   of immatures are not the result of false contagion. Nevertheless, we
   cannot totally exlude true contagion of immatures. In this paper we
   discuss the difficulty of testing true contagion in natural conditions.
   These results show that we cannot systematically conclude in favour of
   contagion when fitting a distribution such as the negative binomial or
   when a variance/mean ratio is higher than unity.}},

Abstract = {{Poisson's ratio is, for specified directions, the ratio of a lateral
   contraction to the longitudinal extension during the stretching of a
   material. Although a negative Poisson's ratio (that is, a lateral
   extension in response to stretching) is not forbidden by
   thermo-dynamics, this property is generally believed to be rare in
   crystalline solids(1). In contrast to this belief, 69\% of the cubic
   elemental metals have a negative Poisson's ratio when stretched along
   the {[}110] direction. For these metals, we find that correlations exist
   between the work function and the extremal values or Poisson's ratio for
   this stretch direction, which we explain using a simple electron-gas
   model. Moreover, these negative Poisson's ratios permit the existence,
   in the orthogonal lateral direction, of positive Poisson's ratios up to
   the stability Limit of 2 for cubic crystals. Such metals having negative
   Poisson's ratios may find application as electrodes that amplify the
   response of piezoelectric sensors.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we present a quantitative theory of temporal
   spike-frequency adaptation in cortical pyramidal cells. Our model
   pyramidal neuron has two-compartments (a ``soma{''} and a
   ``dendrite{''}) with a voltage-gated Ca2(+) conductance (g(Ca)) and a
   Ca2+-dependent K+ conductance (g(AHP)) located at the dendrite or at
   both compartments. Its frequency-current relations are comparable with
   data from cortical pyramidal cells, and the properties of spike-evoked
   intracellular {[}Ca2+] transients are matched with recent dendritic
   {[}Ca2+] imaging measurements. Spike-frequency adaptation in response to
   a current pulse is characterized by an adaptation time constant
   tau(adap) and percentage adaptation of spike frequency F-adap {[}\%
   (peak - steady state)/peak]. We show how tau(adap) and F-adap can be
   derived in terms of the biophysical parameters of the neural membrane
   and {[}Ca2+] dynamics. Two simple, experimentally testable, relations
   between tau(adap) and F-adap are predicted. The dependence of tau(adap)
   and F-adap On current pulse intensity, electrotonic coupling between the
   two compartments, g(AHP) as well the {[}Ca2+] decay time constant
   tau(Ca), is assessed quantitatively. In addition, we demonstrate that
   the intracellular {[}Ca2+] signal can encode the instantaneous neuronal
   firing rate and that the conductance-based model can be reduced to a
   simple calcium-model of neuronal activity that faithfully predicts the
   neuronal firing output even when the input varies relatively rapidly in
   time (tens to hundreds of milliseconds). Extensive simulations have been
   carried out for the model neuron with random excitatory synaptic inputs
   mimicked by a Poisson process. Our findings include 1) the instantaneous
   firing frequency (averaged over trials) shows strong adaptation similar
   to the case with current pulses; 2) when the g(AHP) is blocked, the
   dendritic g(Ca) could produce a hysteresis phenomenon where the neuron
   is driven to switch randomly between a quiescent state and a repetitive
   firing state. The firing pattern is very irregular with a large
   coefficient of variation of the interspike intervals (ISI CV > 1). The
   ISI distribution shows a long tail but is not bimodal. 3) By contrast,
   in an intrinsically bursting regime (with different parameter values),
   the model neuron displays a random temporal mixture of single action
   potentials and brief bursts of spikes. Its ISI distribution is often
   bimodal and its power spectrum has a peak. 4) The spike-adapting current
   I-AHP, as delayed inhibition through intracellular Ca2+ accumulation,
   generates a ``forward masking{''} effect, where a masking input
   dramatically reduces or completely suppresses the neuronal response to a
   subsequent test input. When two inputs are presented repetitively in
   time, this mechanism greatly enhances the ratio of the responses to the
   stronger and weaker inputs, fulfilling a cellular form of lateral
   inhibition in time. 5) The {[}Ca2+]-dependent I-AHP provides a mechanism
   by which the neuron unceasingly adapts to the stochastic synaptic
   inputs, even in the stationary state following the input onset. This
   creates strong negative correlations between output ISIs in a
   frequency-dependent manner, while the Poisson input is totally
   uncorrelated in time. Possible functional implications of these results
   are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{A new method is presented for evaluating the performance of 1-3
   polymer/piezoelectric ceramic composites for hydrophone applications.
   The Poisson's ratio effect, i.e., the enhancement of the hydrostatic
   performance which can be achieved by mixing piezoelectric ceramics with
   polymers, is studied in detail. Using an ``effective medium{''}
   approach, algebraic expressions are derived for the composite
   hydrostatic charge coefficient d(h), the hydrostatic figure of merit
   d(h)g(h), and the hydrostatic electromechanical coupling coefficient
   k(h) in terms of the properties of the constituent materials, the
   ceramic volume fraction, and a microstructural parameter p. The high
   contrast in stiffness and dielectric constants existing between the two
   phases can be exploited to derive simple, geometry-independent
   approximations which explain quantitatively the Poisson's ratio effect.
   It is demonstrated that the stiffness and the Poisson's ratio of the
   polymer matrix play a crucial role in enhancing hydrophone performance.
   Using a differential scheme to model the parameter p, we evaluate d(h),
   d(h)g(h), and k(h) for polymer/piezoelectric ceramic systems at varying
   compositions. Several examples involving Pb (Zr, Ti)O-3 and (Pb, Ca)TiO3
   piezoelectric ceramics are given to illustrate the theory. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{Elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio of diamond-like carbon (DLC) film
   was measured by a simple method using DLC bridges which are free from
   mechanical constraint of substrate. The DLC films were deposited on Si
   wafer by C6H6 r.f. glow discharge at the deposition pressure 1.33 Pa.
   Because of the high residual compressive stress of the film, the bridge
   exhibited a sinusoidal displacement by removing the constraint of the
   substrate. By measuring the amplitude with known bridge length, we could
   determine the strain of the film required to adhere to the substrate.
   Combined with independent stress measurement by laser reflection method,
   this method allows calculation of the biaxial elastic modulus, E/(1-nu),
   where E is the elastic modulus and nu Poisson's ratio of the DLC film.
   By comparing the biaxial elastic modulus with plane-strain modulus,
   E/(1-nu(2)), measured by nano-indentation, we could further determine
   the elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio, independently. The elastic
   modulus, E, increased From 87 to 133 GPa as the negative bias voltage
   increased from 400 to 550 V. Poisson's ratio was estimated to be about
   0.20 in this bias voltage range. For the negative bias voltages less
   than 400 V, however, the present method resulted in negative Poisson's
   ratio which is physically impossible. The limitation of the present
   method was also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper a novel class of core material for sandwich structures is
   analyzed from an analytical and numerical point of view. Honeycombs with
   re-entrant cell geometry present negative in-plane Poisson's ratio
   coefficients, with an increase of bending stiffness compared to the one
   of hexagonal honeycomb cores. Due to the orthotropic mechanical
   properties of this kind of core material it is possible to employ the
   formulations of laminated orthotropic plates in order to describe the
   vibroacoustic behavior of simply supported sandwich plates. The natural
   frequencies of these laminates are sensitive to the geometrical
   parameters of the core cells. As an example application, an infinite
   cylindrical sandwich shell in contact with exterior and interior fluid
   flow is examined. An improvement of transmission loss factors is
   observed, suggesting a possible use of these cores in acoustic
   insulation. Damping properties are modeled taking into account the
   complex modulus of the core material. Two models are examined, one with
   full viscoelastic core and the other with a free-layer symmetrical beam
   geometry in order to describe the walls of the core cells. Both cases
   show a significant increase of the storage moduli of the cores compared

Abstract = {{Brillouin scattering on surface acoustic waves is a very powerful tool
   to determine the elastic constants of intermediate valent crystals,
   since the method is non-destructive and no mechanical contact is needed.
   A strong evidence for intermediate valence is a negative value of
   Poisson's ratio, which describes the behavior of the volume under
   uniaxial pressure.
   SmS by itself makes a semiconductor-metal transition at a pressure of
   more than 6.5 kbar. When substituting the divalent Sm by a trivalent
   cation, like Y, La or Tm. SmS can become - depending on the doping
   concentration - intermediate valent without any applied, external
   pressure. In this work, we will present measurements of the velocities
   of the surface acoustic waves and the calculation of the elastic
   constants of La-and Tm-doped SmS compounds. We found a clear dependence
   of Poisson's ratio on the doping concentration and on the valence of the
   materials. Furthermore, we will discuss the mechanism leading to
   intermediate valence when substituting Sm. Besides the internal,
   chemical pressure, which is produced by the built in trivalent cations
   with their smaller ionic radii, we have clear evidence, that the free
   electrons in the 5d band, induced by the substituting atoms, also play
   an important role in making doped SmS intermediate valent. (C) 1998

Journal = {{POLIMERY}},
Year = {{1998}},

Pages = {{135-143}},
Abstract = {{The polymer polydispersity index, DPw/DPw i.e., the weight-average over
   the number-average degree of polymerization (DP), is discussed in
   relation to the degree of monomer conversion (alpha) for studying the
   reversible living polymerization and polymerization involving a
   bimolecular transfer onto the polymer followed by chain scission. The
   scission leads to segmental exchange though the concentrations of both
   active species and growing macromolecules remain unaffected (constant).
   Even. in the ideal irreversible polymerization when the DP of the
   growing macromolecules follows the Poisson distribution function type,
   the polydispersity index is related to alpha and to the initial monomer
   {[}M](o) and initiator {[}I](o) concentrations.. viz., <(DP)over
   bar>(w)/<(DP)over bar>(n) = 1 + alpha({[}M](o)/{[}I](o))/(1 +
   alpha{[}M](o)/{[}I](o))(2); the index may differ much from unity. In the
   living polymerization with reversible propagation, the DP distribution
   is described by the Flory-Schulz function (the most probable one) for
   which <(DP)over bar>(w)/<(DP)over bar>(n) = 2 - 1/DPn. The relationship
   <(DP)over bar>(w)/<(DP)over bar>(n) = f(alpha) can be evaluated by
   numerical methods only (e.g., Monte Carlo method, numerical
   integration). Styrene (S), L,L-lactide (LA) and tetrahydrofuran (THF)
   polymerizations were used to demonstrate that, the higher the monomer
   concentration at equilibrium ({[}M](eq)) (cf: Table 1), the shorter the
   lime of transition of the DP distribution from the Poisson to the most
   probable one. Next, by Monte Carlo calculations, the polymerization
   involving segmental exchange was shown to yield two populations of
   macromolecules having the same <(DP)over bar>(n) but different DP
   distributions, viz., the Poisson type and the negative binomial Polya
   type. A numerical method was developed to evaluate the <(DP)over
   bar>(w)<(DP)over bar>(n) = f(alpha) relationship for the polymerization
   involving segmental exchange, which made it possible to evaluate - for
   the first time - the k(p)/k(tr(2)) ratio (k(p) and k(tr(2)) being the
   propagation rate constant and the bimolecular transfer rate constant,
   resp.). This ratio was evaluated by comparing the family of <(DP)over
   bar>(w)<(DP)over bar>(n) = f(alpha) curves generated numerically at
   preset k(p)/k(tr(2))-values, with the experimentally observed <(DP)over
   bar>(w)<(DP)over bar>(n) = f(alpha) relationship obtained from SEC
   measurements. This method was used to analyze the polymerization of LA,
   initiated by an Al(O-iPr)(3) trimer, for which it was found that
   k(p)/k(tr(2)) = 100 (THF, 80 degrees C). Since k(p) 8.4 x 10(3)
   mol(-1).L.s(-1) {[}20], then k(tr(2)) = 8.4 x 10(-5) mol(-1).L.s(-1).}},

Abstract = {{A simple method to measure the elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio of
   diamond-like carbon (DLC) films deposited on Si wafer was suggested.
   This method involved etching a side of Si substrate using the DLC him as
   an etching mask. The edge of DLC overhang free from constraint of Si
   substrate exhibited periodic sinusoidal shape. By measuring the
   amplitude and the wavelength of the sinusoidal edge, we can determine
   the strain of the film required to adhere to the substrate. Combined
   with independent stress measurement by laser reflection method, this
   method allows calculation of the biaxial elastic modulus, E/(1 - nu);
   where E is the Elastic modulus and nu Poisson's ratio Of the DLC films.
   By comparing the biaxial elastic modulus with plane-strain modulus, E/(1
   - nu(2)), measured by nano-indentation, me could further determine the
   elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio, independently. This method was
   employed to measure the mechanical properties of DLC films deposited by
   C6H6 r.f. glow discharge at the deposition pressure 1.33 Pa. The elastic
   modulus, E, increased from 94 to 128 GPa as the negative bias voltage
   increased from 400 to 550 V. Poisson's ratio was estimated to be about
   0.22 in this bias voltage range. For the negative bias voltages less
   than 400 V, however, the present method resulted in negative Poisson's
   ratio. The limitation of the present method was discussed.}},

   make use of the ratio of two consecutive probabilities. The method
   developed is applied to various well known families of discrete
   distributions which include the binomial, negative binomial and Poisson
   distributions as special cases. Finally, a formula is presented to
   determine explicitly the failure rate of the families considered. This
   formula is used to determine the failure rate of various classes of

Abstract = {{The transport theory of ions and electrons in an oscillating electric
   field, typically at radio frequencies, is of interest both as a problem
   in basic physics and for its potential for application to modern
   technology, e.g., plasma processing. Our research has been motivated by
   both these considerations, but the present paper concerns theory and
   focuses on Boltzmann's kinetic equation in particular. We note that as
   far as kinetic theory is concerned, any substantial advances on the
   pioneering work of Margenau and Hartmann nearly fifty years ago have
   been remarkably limited in comparison with the extensive, systematic
   development of d.c. transport theory over the past two decades. Our goal
   has been to develop a comprehensive theory of a.c. charged particle
   transport, at a level of sophistication comparable with the d.c. theory,
   and the first steps are reported in the present paper, which deals with
   theoretical foundations and phenomenology. After examining the broader
   implications of space-time symmetries, namely, parity and phase-reversal
   invariance, we proceed through low-order moments of Boltzmann's
   equation, with collision terms approximated in the same way as for d.c.
   momentum-transfer theory, and look for relationships, however
   approximate, connecting experimentally measurable quantities, and
   otherwise attempt to shed light on transport phenomena peculiar to
   harmonically varying electric fields. In this way we obtain: (a) A full
   set of momentum-energy balance equations for both ions and electrons, to
   be solved simultaneously with Poisson's equation where appropriate; (b)
   A generalisation of Wannier's energy relation for ion swarms in an a.c.
   field; (c) Generalised Einstein relations for cycle-averaged electron
   swarm diffusion coefficients; (d) information about a.c. negative
   differential conductivity and the anomalous character of anisotropic
   diffusion in a.c. fields; (e) A procedure for adaptation of d.c.
   experimental swarm data to a.c. swarms and r.f discharges. The
   discussion is at the semiquantitative level, with emphasis on physical
   understanding. (C) 1997 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an empirical inquiry into the applicability of
   zero-altered counting processes to roadway section accident frequencies.
   The intent of such a counting process is to distinguish sections of
   roadway that are truly safe (near zero-accident likelihood) from those
   that are unsafe but happen to have zero accidents observed during the
   period of observation (e.g. one year). Traditional applications of
   Poisson and negative binomial accident frequency models do not account
   for this distinction and thus can produce biased coefficient estimates
   because of the preponderance of zero-accident observations. Zero-altered
   probability processes such as the zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) and
   zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) distributions are examined and
   proposed for accident frequencies by roadway functional class and
   geographic location. The findings show that the ZIP structure models are
   promising and have great flexibility in uncovering processes affecting
   accident frequencies on roadway sections observed with zero accidents
   and those with observed accident occurrences. This flexibility allows
   highway engineers to better isolate design factors that contribute to
   accident occurrence and also provides additional insight into variables
   that determine the relative accident likelihoods of safe versus unsafe
   roadways. The generic nature of the models and the relatively good power
   of the Vuong specification test used in the non-nested hypotheses of
   model specifications offers roadway designers the potential to develop a
   global family of models for accident frequency prediction that can be
   embedded in a larger safety management system. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{The New York City tuberculosis (TB) case rate declined from 1991 to 1994
   following more than a decade of increases. The present study
   investigated TB trends in New York City neighborhoods and their
   association with neighborhood-specific rates of application of directly
   observed therapy (DOT). Using Poisson regression models, TB trends in
   each of New York City's 30 health districts were classified as
   increasing, decreasing, or stable, as indicated respectively by
   significant positive, negative, or nonsignificant regression
   coefficients. Case counts increased in four health districts, decreased
   in 10, and were stable in 16. Decreasing TB was associated with a higher
   rate of application of DOT. TB cases among foreign-born persons
   increased in 12 health districts and were stable in 18, whereas cases
   among persons born in the United States decreased in 19 and were stable
   in 11 districts. Among the foreign-born, increasing TB was not
   associated with a lesser rate of application of DOT. These data provide
   some support for the role of DOT in containing TB, but also suggest that
   the application of DOT among foreign-born residents is less effective
   than among United States-born residents. This may be due to a greater
   proportion of TB cases among the foreign-born being due to reactivation
   of TB rather than new infection.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials have a negative Poisson's ratio, that is, they expand
   laterally when stretched longitudinally. One way of obtaining a negative
   Poisson's ratio is by using a re-entrant cell structure. Auxetic foam
   was fabricated from a conventional polymeric foam. Assuming similar
   mechanical properties for the solid material comprising the foams, the
   principle variable affecting the properties of the foam is the geometry
   of the cells. This means that the unusual mechanical properties of
   auxetic foams are attributed to the deformation characteristics of
   re-entrant microstructures. In this paper, the results of optical- and
   scanning electron-microscopic studies of the geometrical parameters for
   the different foams examined are presented. Examples of the
   microstructural deformation mechanisms observed are also presented.
   Comparison between the conventional foams and their auxetic conversions

Abstract = {{The uniqueness of the complementarity determining region III (CDRIII)
   has been utilized successfully in the last decade for development of a
   patient specific, molecular, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assay
   for determining minimal residual disease in various lymphoid
   malignancies. There are various approaches for carrying out this test.
   i) CDRIII primers are used to amplify the corresponding DNA from the
   same patient and quantitation of the amplified CDRIII bands is done by
   generation a standard curve of known amounts of purified patient's tumor
   DNA, followed by a linear regression analysis to quantitate the results.
   ii) CDRIII primers are used to amplify a serially-diluted patient's
   sample (unknown), with replicate points. According to Poisson equation,
   replicate points in each dilution can be either all positive, all
   negative, or `mixed', negative and positive. The quantitation, according
   to this approach is done by determination of the dilution point where
   there are `mixed' lanes plus the flanking `all negative' and `all
   positive' lanes, assuming that the test can always detect one tumor cell
   in 100,000 cells. In this communication we show evidence that the use of
   the Poisson method can lead to an underestimation of the amount of tumor
   cells, due to the great variability in the priming and amplification
   among the various CDRIII primers. This variation is inherent to the
   size, C/G ratio, melting point of each primer, etc. In a simulated
   statistical model we show that the magnitude of error in the Poisson
   method could reach 1-2 logs. In contrast, using the standard curve for
   each patient and regression analysis eliminate these problems.}},

   Neither spatial nor familial aggregation was detected when analysing the
   distribution of cases in the whole community using Poisson, negative
   binomial and pairwise odds ratio models. However, clustering of cases
   was observed when specific familial relationships were examined. The
   risk of HAT for a child was significantly increased if the mother had
   also had HAT, but it was not influenced by a past history of HAT in the
   father. Sisters and brothers of cases of HAT had a higher risk of HAT
   than siblings of individuals who had never had HAT,but no such
   association was documented for half-sisters and half-brothers. Among
   married couples, a past history of HAT in one spouse had no impact on
   the other spouse's risk of HAT. Indirect arguments suggested that
   familial clustering was a consequence of shared exposure, either
   sequential or simultaneous, rather than of genetic susceptibility. The
   existence of familial clustering should be kept in mind when
   implementing passive or active case-finding activities.}},

   dependance is given by the ratio sigma(2)/mu of the distribution of
   number of food items per patch, Bayesian foraging can therefore lead to
   positive (negative binomial distributional) or negative (binomial
   distribution) density dependent resource harvest and even to density
   independent (Poisson distribution) resource harvest, depending on the
   distribution of resources in the environment. In a second stage we
   incorporate learning about the distribution of resources ire the whole
   environment, The mean of the distribution of number of food items per

Abstract = {{An analysis was conducted of 27,982 deaths among 106,020 persons
   employed at four Federal nuclear plants in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, between
   1943 and 1985. The main objectives were to extend the evaluation of the
   health effects of employment in the nuclear industry in Oak Ridge to
   include most workers who were omitted from earlier studies, to compare
   the mortality experience of workers among the facilities, to address
   methodological problems that occur when individuals employed at more
   than one facility are included in the analysis, and to conduct
   dose-response analyses for those individuals with potential exposure to
   external radiation. All-cause mortality and all-cancer mortality were in
   close agreement with national rates. The only notable excesses occurred
   for white males for lung cancer {[}standardized mortality ratio (SMR) =
   1.18, 1,849 deaths] and non-malignant respiratory disease (SMR = 1.12,
   1,568 deaths). A more detailed analysis revealed substantial differences
   in death rates among workers at the Oak Ridge plants. Evaluation of
   internally adjusted log SMRs using Poisson regression showed that
   workers employed only at Tennessee Eastman Corporation or K-25 and at
   multiple facilities had higher death rates than similar workers employed
   only at X-10 or Y-12, and that the differences were primarily due to
   non-cancer causes. Analysis of selected cancer causes for white males
   indicated large differences among the workers at the different
   facilities for lung cancer, leukemia and other lymphatic cancer.
   Dose-response analyses for external penetrating radiation were limited
   to a subcohort of 28,347 white males employed at X-10 or Y-12. Their
   collective recorded dose equivalent was 376 Sv. There was a strong
   `'healthy worker effect'' in this subcohort - all-cause SMR = 0.80
   (4,786 deaths) and all-cancer SR IR = 0.87 (1,134 deaths). Variables
   included in the analyses were age, birth cohort, a measure of
   socioeconomic status, length of employment, internal radiation exposure
   potential and facility. For external radiation dose with a 10-year lag,
   the excess relative risk was 0.31 per Sv (95\% CI = -0.16, 1.01) for all
   causes and 1.45 per Sv (95\% CI = 0.15, 3.48) for all cancer. The
   estimated excess relative risk for leukemia was negative but imprecisely
   determined. A preliminary dose adjustment procedure was developed to
   compensate for missing dose but not other dosimetry errors. Results of
   the analyses using the adjusted doses suggest that the effect of missing
   dose is an upward bias in dose-response coefficients and test
   statistics. (C) 1997 by Radiation Research Society.}},

Abstract = {{A 2D model for the deformation of auxetic microporous polymers (those
   with a negative Poisson's ratio) has been previously developed,
   consisting of a network of rigid rectangular nodules interconnected by
   fibrils. This model has now been extended to describe the deformation of
   the network via concurrent fibril hinging and stretching mechanisms.
   Expressions for the strain-dependent Poisson's ratios and Young's moduli
   are derived and fully investigated with respect to their dependence on
   the model parameters. These expressions are compared with the
   experimental strain-dependent data for auxetic microporous
   polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and ultra-high molecular weight
   polyethylene (UHMWPE). The use of concurrent deformation mechanisms
   makes a very significant improvement in the agreement of theory with
   experiment for both cases. Slight discrepancies are discussed in terms
   of the use of the assumptions of a 2D network of regular, rectangular
   nodules and a constant force coefficient ratio governing the two
   deformation mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a new way to design and fabricate compliant
   micromechanisms and material structures with negative Poisson's ratio
   (NPR). The design of compliant mechanisms and material structures is
   accomplished in an automated way using a numerical topology optimization
   method. The procedure allows the user to specify the elastic properties
   of materials or the mechanical advantages (MA's) or geometrical
   advantages (GA's) of compliant mechanisms and returns the optimal
   structures. The topologies obtained by the numerical procedure require
   practically no interaction by the engineer before they can be
   transferred to the fabrication unit. Fabrication is carried out by
   patterning a sputtered silicon on a plasma-enhanced chemical vapor
   deposition (PECVD) glass with a laser micromachining setup.
   Subsequently, the structures are etched into the underlying PECVD glass,
   and the glass is underetched, an in one two-step reactive ion etching
   (RIE) process. The components are tested using a probe placed on an x-y
   stage. This fast prototyping allows newly developed topologies to be
   fabricated and tested within the same day. {[}188]}},

Abstract = {{We have proposed a mathematical method to investigate the matching
   conditions for an arterial graft in the femoral-popliteal region from a
   mechanical standpoint. Pulsatory blood flow, arterial wall motions, and
   conservation law are expressed by linear dynamical equations based on
   strict mechanical and constitutional considerations. To express the
   physiological blood flow in an actual arterial system, the tethering
   effects from the surrounding tissue and wall tensions were incorporated.
   The physiological parameters of arterial wall and tethering were
   utilized from reported experimental data. By complex analysis,
   mathematical expressions for the local impedance and reflection
   coefficient were obtained. They include not only blood properties such
   as viscosity and density, but also arterial properties including elastic
   modulus, radius, Poisson ratio, wall thickness, wall tension, frequency,
   and tethering effects from surrounding tissue. A matching condition was
   defined for minimizing the local impedance and reflection coefficient.
   The biophysical background was to reduce any mechanical mismatches, thus
   minimizing the disturbance of the now velocity profile and shear stress
   distribution within the artery. Impedance matching in turn diminishes
   the negative factors for graft substitution represented by intimal
   hyperplasia and thrombosis. The calculated impedance and reflection
   coefficient inversed parabolically to functions of the resistance of the
   host artery, and there was one host arterial resistance that minimized
   the impedance and reflection coefficient. The present analysis revealed
   that for matching host artery with an elevated resistance, the dynamic
   elastic modulus of the wall of the graft that minimizes the impedance
   and reflection coefficient was increased. This indicates that for a host
   artery with a high resistance, an impedance matched stiff wall graft is
   preferable. For a large radius and a compliant host artery on the other
   hand, a large compliant graft should be linked. The present theoretical
   matching conditions will prevent anastomotic hyperplasia and thrombosis
   in graft substitution.}},

Abstract = {{The relationship between the incidence of childhood-onset
   insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and levels of nitrate in drinking
   water in the former Yorkshire Regional Health Authority was investigated
   by means of an ecological analysis. A population-based register
   contributed 1797 0-16-year-olds diagnosed with diabetes between 1978 and
   1994. Nitrate data were based on 9330 samples of drinking water tested
   between 1990 and 1995 in 148 water supply zones, for which 1991 census
   small area statistics were taken on population density, ethnicity and
   socio-economic status. Diabetes incidence was positively associated with
   raised mean nitrate levels with a standardised incidence ratio of 115 in
   zones with greater than 14.85 mg.l(-1) (chi(2) = 26.81, 1 df, p <
   0.001). Significant negative trends were found between standardised
   incidence ratios and proportion of non-whites in the population (chi(2)
   = 33.57, 1 df, p < 0.001), childhood population density (chi(2) = 30.81,
   1 df, p < 0.001) and the Townsend deprivation score (chi(2) = 33.89, 1
   df,p < 0.001). Poisson regression modelling, adjusting for the other
   factors, showed a significant increase in relative incidence rate ratio
   from a baseline of 1 at nitrate levels below 3.22 mg.l(-1) to 1.27 (95\%
   confidence interval 1.09,1.48) for mean nitrate levels above 14.85
   mg.l(-1). An association between higher nitrate levels in domestic
   drinking water and incidence of childhood diabetes has been
   demonstrated. This was not explained by the ethnic composition of the
   population, population density or socioeconomic status. Nitrate in
   drinking water may be a precursor of chemicals which are toxic to the

Abstract = {{We consider an optimal design of composite hydrophones consisting of

   have optimally designed the piezocomposite to maximize the hydrostatic
   coupling factor, hydrophone figure of merit, or electromechanical
   coupling factor, using the methods of homogenization theory. The optimal
   composite is obtained by using a two-step procedure: (i) first we find
   the ideal structure of the matrix material by weakening the polymer by
   an optimal arrangement of pores, and (ii) then we embed the PZT rods in
   this matrix. The design parameters are the shape, volume fraction, and
   spatial arrangement of the piezoceramic rods, and the structure of the
   matrix material. It turns out that the optimal matrix is highly
   anisotropic and is characterized by negative Poisson's ratios in certain
   directions. The optimal composites possess performance characteristics
   that are significantly higher than those of a piezocomposite with an

Abstract = {{We analyze the electrostatic and hydrodynamic properties of a nuclease
   from the pathogenic gram-negative bacterium Serratia marcescens using
   finite-difference Poisson-Boltzmann methods for electrostatic
   calculations and a bead-model approach for diffusion coefficient
   calculations.
   Electrostatic properties are analyzed for the enzyme in monomeric and
   dimeric Sol ms and also in the context of DNA binging by the nuclease.
   Our preliminary results show that binding of a double-stranded DNA
   dodecamer by nuclease causes an overall shift in the charge of the
   protein by approximately three units of elementary charge pet monomer,
   resulting, in a positively charged protein? at physiologic pH. In these
   calculations,the free enzyme was found to have a negative (-1 e) charge
   per monomer at pH 7. The most dramatic shift in pK(a) involves His 89
   whose pK(a) increases by three pH units upon DNA binding. This shift
   leads to a protonated residue at pH 7, in contrast to the unprotonated
   form in the free enzyme. DNA binding also leads to a decrease in the
   energetic distances between the most stable protonation states of the
   enzyme. Dimerization has no significant effect on the electrostatic
   properties of each of the monomers for both free enzyme and that bound
   to DNA.
   Results of hydrodynamic calculations are consistent with the dimeric
   form of the enzyme in solution. The computed translational diffusion
   coefficient for the dimer model of the enzyme is in very good agreement
   with measurements from light scattering experiments. Preliminary
   electrooptical calculations indicate that the dimer should possess a
   large dipole moment (appr- oximately 600 Debye units) as well as
   substantial optical anisotropy (limiting reduced linear electric
   dichroism of about 0.3). Therefore, this system may serve as a good
   model for investigation of electric and hydrodynamic properties by
   relaxation electrooptical experiments. (C) 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Materials with specific microstructural characteristics and composite
   structures are able to exhibit negative Poisson's ratio. This result has
   been proved for continuum materials by analytical methods in previous
   works of the first author, among others {[}1]. Furthermore, it also has
   been shown to be valid for certain mechanisms involving beams or rigid
   levers, springs or sliding collars frameworks and, in general,
   composites with voids having a nonconvex microstructure. Recently
   microstructures optimally designed by the homogenization approach have
   been verified. For microstructures composed of beams, it has been
   postulated that nonconvex shapes with re-entrant corners are responsible
   for this effect {[}2]. In this paper, it is numerically shown that
   mainly the shape of the re-entrant corner of a non-convex, star-shaped
   microstructure influences the apparent (phenomenological) Poisson's
   ratio. The same is valid for continua with voids or for composities with
   irregular shapes of inclusions, even if the individual constituents are
   quite usual materials. Elements of the numerical homogenization theory
   are reviewed and used for the numerical investigation.}},

Abstract = {{The mathematical model of ion transport in the field of electric forces
   and diffusion gradients is based on particle conservation equations and
   the Poisson equation which governs the distribution of the electric
   potential. Designed for evaluating the currents through passive ion
   channels in cellular membranes, the model is formulated in a
   two-dimensional approximation assuming rotational symmetry. Three ionic
   species are considered in the present study: sodium, calcium and
   chlorine. The program developed for the numerical solution is based on a
   semi-analytical approximation suggested by Gummel \& Scharfetter. The
   present contribution reports calculations of the steady-state
   distributions of ionic species induced by an electric field due to a
   negative potential drop across the cellular membrane, which represent
   initial conditions for future calculations of the time development of
   the ion flux through the calcium channel. The numerical calculations
   were performed from the moment of potential application up to the time
   6.2 mu s, when a new steady state is established. At this stage, the
   maximum values of the sodium and calcium concentrations at the membrane
   surface are about 22\% and 47\% above the initial values of 145 mM and 1
   mM, respectively, while the chlorine concentration is approximately 18\%
   below. The electric field at the membrane surface is about 6.7 x 10(4)
   and decreases exponentially with distance. The length of the boundary
   layer is about 40 Angstrom. Since the model is based on fundamental
   principles, it can be used for the quantitative solution of any problem
   possessing rotational symmetry where a continuum approach is applicable
   and some elementary conditions are fulfilled, such as equilibrium (or at
   least quasi-equilibrium) of the particle energy distributions with
   respect to time and electric field, and the assumption that the
   transport coefficients are defined as functions of the field and their
   numerical values are known. (C) 1997 Academic Press Limited.}},

Abstract = {{SmS becomes intermediate valent at an applied pressure of about 6.5
   kbar. On the other hand, SmS doped with La or Tm is already intermediate
   valent at normal pressure and room temperature. The doping atoms
   (depending on their concentration) create new occupied states in the SmS
   gap which lead to the typical hybridised 4f(i)/4f(i-1)-5d(1)-states. The
   La-cation is always trivalent in LaS, whereas the Tm-cation has a
   valence between 2 and 3. Therefore, we expect to see a difference in the
   intermediate valent behaviour. A strong evidence of intermediate valence
   is a negative C-12 and a negative Poisson's ratio. Using high-resolution
   Brillouin-spectroscopy we measured the phase velocity of the surface
   acoustic waves in the (100)-plane of Sm1-xLaxS and Sm1-xTmxS. Applying a
   standard fit-algorithm we calculated all three elastic constants (C-11,
   C-12 and C-44) from the angular dispersion relation. To get more
   reliable results the compression-moduli also have been determined and
   linked to the elastic constants C-11 and C-12 in the fit model.}},

Abstract = {{Standard approaches for modelling dependence within joint tail regions
   are based on extreme value methods which assume max-stability, a
   particular form of joint tail dependence. We develop joint tail models
   based on a broader class of dependence structure which provides a
   natural link between max-stable models and weaker forms of dependence
   including independence and negative association. This approach overcomes
   many of the problems that are encountered with standard methods and is
   the basis for a Poisson process representation that generalizes existing
   bivariate results. We apply the new techniques to simulated and
   environmental data, and demonstrate the marked advantage that the new
   approach offers for joint tail extrapolation.}},

Abstract = {{We present a model for data in the form of matched pairs of counts. Our
   work is motivated by a problem in fission-track analysis, where the
   determination of a crystal's age is based on the ratio of counts of
   spontaneous and induced tracks. It is often reasonable to assume that
   the counts follow a Poisson distribution, but typically they are
   overdispersed and there exists a positive correlation between the
   numbers of spontaneous and induced tracks in the same crystal. We
   propose a model that allows for both overdispersion and correlation by
   assuming that the mean densities follow a bivariate Wishart
   distribution. Our model is quite general, having the usual
   negative-binomial and Poisson models as special cases. We propose a
   maximum-likelihood estimation method based on a stochastic
   implementation of the EM algorithm, and we derive the asymptotic
   standard errors of the parameter estimates. We illustrate the method
   with a data set of fission-track counts in matched areas of zircon

Abstract = {{The mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region was sequenced in 37 sperm
   whales from a large part of the global range of the species. Nucleotide
   diversity was several-fold lower than that reported for control regions
   of abundant and outbred mammals, but similar to that for populations
   known to have experienced bottlenecks. Relative rate tests did not
   suggest that the low diversity is due to a lower substitution rate in
   sperm whale mtDNA. Rather, it is more likely that demographic factors
   have reduced diversity. The pattern of nucleotide substitutions was
   examined by cladistic methods, facilitated by the apparent monophyly of
   lineages from the Southern Hemisphere, as defined by a single base pair
   deletion. Substitutions were nonrandom in nature, confined to a few
   `'hot spots,'' and parallel substitutions constituted a majority of the
   inferred changes. The substitution pattern fitted a negative binomial
   distribution better than a Poisson distribution, and the bias in number
   of substitutions among sites was considerably higher than previously
   reported for the mtDNA control region of any species. A novel method of
   estimating time since common ancestry was developed, which utilizes the
   transition/transversion ratio R and the number of substitutions inferred
   from a parsimony analysis. Using this method, we estimated the age of
   sperm whale mtDNA diversity to be about 6,000-25,000 years, and when the
   uncertainty of R was accounted for, a range of about 1,000-100,000 years
   was obtained.}},

Abstract = {{The dominant physical properties of SF6 are reviewed, and it is shown
   that the very high electron attachment coefficient in SF6 leads to a
   very different form of electrical corona in SF6, compared to that in
   air. The key to understanding these differences is the characteristic
   attachment time, tau, for the formation of negative ions which is 0.06
   ns for typical SF6 conditions, and 143 ns for typical conditions in air.
   As a consequence of the short attachment time, the field in an SF6
   streamer channel is limited to E greater than or equal to E{*}, greatly
   limiting the range of the streamers. (E is the electric field, and E{*}
   is the field for which the ionisation equals attachment.) In air such
   restrictions do not apply, due to the slower attachment rate, and
   streamers have a much greater range. The development of discharges (from
   the first electron through to fully developed discharges) is outlined
   for parallel plate electrodes, and point-plane electrodes in SF6 at
   atmospheric pressure with dc and impulse applied voltages. The theories
   are developed by solving the simultaneous continuity equations for
   electrons, positive ions, and negative ions, coupled with Poisson's
   equation which describes the space-charge dominated electric field. The
   effects of ionisation, attachment, recombination and photoionisation are
   included. The occurrence of stepped leaders in SF6 (similar to those
   occurring during lightning) is discussed, and preliminary results are
   presented which reveal a likely mechanism for streamer channel heating
   which causes leader formation in SF6. Results for the effects of
   pressure and of additives on corona formation in SF6 are also discussed.
   Finally, a practical solution is proposed for the problem of the failure
   of the corona fine tuning of the accelerator voltage in contaminated
   SF6.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Although cigarette smoking has consistently been shown to be
   positively related to the risk of adenomatous polyp development (benign
   neoplastic growth of epithelial tissue in the colon), most studies of
   cigarette smoking and the risk of colorectal cancer have been negative,
   However, in two large prospective studies in women and men, a
   statistically significant association between cigarette smoking and an
   increased risk of colorectal cancer was found, but only after more than
   35 years of smoking, Purpose: To shed further light on the alleged
   relationship between long-term smoking and colorectal cancer risk, we
   performed a retrospective cohort study among Swedish construction
   workers, with many long-term smokers, complete long-term follow-up, and
   a large number of observed cases, Methods: We analyzed the association
   of smoking with colon cancer and with rectal cancer, using data on a
   cohort of approximately 135 000 male construction workers, High-quality
   exposure information was collected with the use of a comprehensive
   questionnaire filled out at the time of enrollment in the cohort, from
   1971 through 1975, Complete follow-up was achieved through 1991 and the
   subjects were observed for an average of 17.6 years, thereby
   contributing approximately 2 375 000 person-years of folllow-up, We
   calculated age-adjusted rate ratios (RRs) with the use of Poisson-based
   multiplicative multivariate models followed by further multivariate
   modeling that adjusted for either variables. Results: A total of 713
   incident colon cancers and 505 rectal cancers were observed, There was
   no statistically significant association between current smoking status,
   number of cigarettes smoked or number of years smoking, and risk of
   colorectal cancer, The age-adjusted RRs were 0.98 (95\% confidence
   interval {[}CI] = 0.82-1.17) and 1.16 (95\% CI 0.94-1.44) for colon and
   rectal cancers, respectively, among current smokers, and 1.07 (95\% CI =
   0.63-1.82) and 1,08 (95\% CI = 0.58-2.033 among smokers of 25 or more
   cigarettes per day, relative to nonsmokers, Among smokers for more than
   30 years at the start of follow-up, the age-adjusted RRs were 1.03 (95\%
   CI = 0.85-1.35) and 1.21 (95\% CE = 0.96-1.53) for colon and rectal
   cancers, respectively; relative to nonsmokers, Heavy smokers of cigars
   and pipes had a statistically nonsignificant tendency toward excess risk
   for colon cancer, but there was no clear dose-risk trend, Conclusion:
   Our large cohort study did not indicate any excess risk of colon cancer
   in males who were long-term heavy smokers and weak support for an Our
   the majority of previous reports, The reasons for the discrepancies in
   comparison with recent U.S. data have yet to be identified.}},

   basic aqueous solutions. The apparent bimolecular rate constant for
   quenching (k(q)) is on the order of 10(12) M(-1) s(-1) at low ionic
   strength and diminishes by approximately 1 order of magnitude at 14 mM
   added ionic strength. This behavior is independent of the particular
   group 1A counterion salt but does depend on the polyelectrolyte linear
   charge density. At relatively high quencher concentration both Tl+ and
   Cs+ display negative curvature in their I-0/I Stem-Volmer plots.
   `'Displacement'' experiments were carried out in which K+ is added to a
   solution of the polyelectrolyte with a fixed concentration of Tl+,
   thereby decreasing the fluorescence quenching. These data and membrane
   dialysis imply preferential binding of the Tl+ to the polyelectrolyte
   (compared to Na+ and K+). A restricted geometry model based on Manning
   condensation theory is presented that captures many of the features of a
   Poisson-Boltzmann reaction-diffusion calculation of the quenching
   dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{A weighted equation based on the three-phase time-average and Wood
   equations is applied to derive a relationship between the compressional
   wave (P wave) velocity and the amount of hydrates filling the pore
   space. The proposed theory predicts accurate P wave velocities of marine
   sediments in the porosity range of 40-80\% and provides a practical
   means of estimating the amount of in situ hydrate using seismic
   velocity. The shear (S) wave velocity is derived under the assumption
   that the P to S wave velocity ratio of the hydrated sediments is
   proportional to the weighted average of the P to S wave velocity ratios
   of the constituent components of the sediment. In the case that all
   constituent components are known, a weighted equation using multiphase
   time-average and Wood equations is possible. However, this study showed
   that a three-phase equation with modified matrix velocity, compensated
   for the clay content, is sufficient to accurately predict the
   compressional wave velocities for the marine sediments. This theory was
   applied to the laboratory measurements of the P and S wave velocities in
   permafrost samples to infer the amount of ice in the unconsolidated
   sediment. The results are comparable to the results obtained by
   repeatedly applying the two-phase wave scattering theory. The theory
   predicts that the Poisson's ratio of the hydrated sediments decreases as
   the hydrate concentration increases and the porosity decreases. In
   consequence, the amplitude versus offset (AVO) data for the
   bottom-simulating reflections may reveal positive, negative, or no AVO
   anomalies depending on the concentration of hydrates in the sediments.}},

Abstract = {{In an effort to quantitatively examine the effect of coupling between
   multiple relaxation modes, a new model involving two coupled Maxwell
   modes is developed as a generalization of the upper-convected Maxwell
   and the Giesekus models. The model contains, in addition to the
   parameters inherent to a Maxwell model with two uncoupled modes (i.e.,
   lambda(1),lambda(2) and eta(1) = G(1) lambda(1), eta(2) = G(2)
   lambda(2)), a dimensionless coupling coefficient theta that multiplies a
   quadratic coupling term. In the two characteristic limits theta = 0 or
   (eta(1),lambda(1)) = (eta(2),lambda(2)), the Maxwell model with two
   uncoupled relaxation modes or the Giesekus constitutive model is
   obtained, respectively. The rheological behavior of the model is
   investigated in the linear and nonlinear deformation-rate regimes.
   Calculation of the linear viscoelastic behavior shows that the linear
   stress relaxation modulus is the sum of two decaying exponentials with
   characteristic times and preexponential factors that are quite different
   from lambda(1), lambda(2) and G(1), G(2), respectively. In slow, slowly
   varying flows, the zero shear-rate ratio Psi(2)(0)/Psi(1)(0) assumes
   small negative values when theta takes on small positive values. The
   nonlinear rheological behavior of the model is examined under the
   imposition of shear and extensional flow fields, from both a
   steady-state and transient perspective. The qualitative behavior
   observed is remarkably rich in describing the experimental trends seen
   in polymer melts and Boger fluids for a constant value of theta
   approximate to 0.1. (C) 1996 Society of Rheology.}},

Title = {{A generalized Schmidt star formation law: Observational constraints .2.}},

Abstract = {{This paper aims to see whether the observed distribution of the Roberts
   time for different samples of late-type galaxies of a given class
   (normal, active) may be fitted by a single theoretical distribution, and
   what additional constraints are put on models obeying a generalized
   Schmidt star formation law. We find that an extended Poisson
   distribution with expected value k{*} = 2.5 Gyr and median value
   k(double dagger) = 2.83 Gyr is consistent with five different samples of
   normal galaxies, provided systems with Roberts time T-R greater than or
   similar to 7 Gyr are excluded, and an extended Poisson distribution with
   expected value k{*} = 0.05 Gyr and median value k(double dagger) = 0.52
   Gyr is consistent with both a sample of active galaxies and a sample of
   compact HII regions. In this view, active galaxies and `'normal''
   galaxies with T-R greater than or similar to 7 Gyr should be regarded as
   merger products in different stages of evolution. In dealing with a
   generalized Schmidt star formation law, we take into consideration
   closed, comoving models of chemical evolution. The history of a galaxy
   is described by two main phases: contraction (which produces the
   extended component) and equilibrium (which gives the disk). Negative
   values of the ratio of contraction time to age of a galaxy, T-c/T,
   relate with present-day, fractional star formation rates C-D less than
   or similar to 0.025 Gyr(-1) and Roberts times T-R greater than or
   similar to 5 Gyr but, in general, the reverse is not true. Again, an
   extended Poisson distribution with expected value k{*} = 2.5 Gyr and
   median value k(double dagger) = 2.83 Gyr is consistent with two
   different samples (for which total masses also are reported and then
   ratios T-c/T can be calculated) of normal galaxies, provided systems for
   which T-c/T less than or equal to 0 are excluded. In this view, active
   galaxies and `'normal'' galaxies for which T-c/T less than or equal to 0
   should be regarded as mergers products in different stages of evolution.
   Further analysis provides additional support to two conclusions already
   established in a previous paper, namely: (i) models where star formation
   obeys a pure Schmidt law cannot fit the whole set of observations; and
   (ii) for assumed T-R = k(double dagger);T-c/T > 0 for normal galaxies;
   and T-c/T < 0.5 for at least a fraction of large-mass (M > 10(11)
   m(circle dot)) normal galaxies; a generalized Schmidt star formation law
   with an exponent n approximate to 1 is favoured over one with n
   approximate to 2. More precisely, 1 less than or similar to n less than
   or similar to 1.8 with a preferred value n approximate to 1.2, which
   makes a generalized Schmidt star formation law with n approximate to 1
   consistent with the observations. Finally, a stochastic process of star
   formation, related to a Poisson distribution, is briefly outlined.}},

Abstract = {{A theoretical model has been developed for predicting the elastic
   constants of honeycombs based on the deformation of the honeycomb cells

   given of structures with a negative Poisson's ratio. It is shown how the
   properties can be tailored by varying the relative magnitudes of the
   force constants for the different deformation mechanisms. Off-axis
   elastic constants are also calculated and it is shown how the moduli and
   Poisson's ratios vary with applied loading direction. Depending on the
   geometry of the honeycomb the properties may be isotropic (for regular
   hexagons) or extremely anisotropic. Again, the degree of anisotropy is
   also affected by the relative magnitude of the force constants for the
   three deformation mechanisms. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Honeycomb structures are widely used in structural applications because

   regular honeycomb increased with volume fraction. Poisson's ratio of the
   regular honeycomb structure decreased from unity as volume fraction
   increased. The re-entrant honeycomb structure had a negative Poisson's
   ratio, its value dependent upon the inverted angle of cell ribs. Young's
   modulus of the re-entrant honeycomb structure decreased as the inverted
   angle of cell ribs increased. The results are in good agreement with

Year = {{1996}},
Volume = {{53}},

Pages = {{540-546}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Objectives - Concern about the health hazards of exposure to workers in
   the ferroalloy industry has initiated this historical cohort study. The
   aim was to examine the mortality pattern among male employees in 12
   Norwegian ferroalloy plants.
   Methods - All men employed for at least six months who started their
   first employment during 1933-91 were eligible for the cohort. Deaths
   observed during 1962-90 were compared with expected figures calculated
   from national mortalities. Internal comparisons of rates were performed
   by Poisson regression analysis. The final cohort comprised 14 730 male
   employees who were observed for 288 886 person-years.
   Results - Mortality from all causes of death was slightly increased
   (3390 deaths, standardised mortality ratio (SMR) 1.08, 95\% confidence
   interval (95\% CI) 1.04-1.11). Regression analysis of total mortality
   showed a significant negative trend for the rate ratios with increasing
   duration of employment. An increased mortality was found among employees
   in urban plants compared with employees in rural plants (rate ratio (RR)
   1.21, 95\% CI 1.13-1.29). Excess deaths from cancer (SMR 1.11) and
   sudden death (SMR 1.47) were found among employees with at least three
   years of employment. Mortality from accidents, poisonings, and violence
   was increased among all employees (SMR 1.28). Excess deaths from this
   cause were however only found for the time after the end of employment
   in this industry and not during employment (SMR 0.90).
   Conclusions - The increased mortality from cancer and sudden death could
   be related to work exposures, at least in sub-groups, and these results
   warrant further studies. The excess deaths from accidents, poisonings,
   and violence were probably not related to work exposures. The mortality
   results for short term workers and other information indicate that
   systematic errors contribute to the increased overall mortality.}},

Abstract = {{Agarose hydrogels, which are composed of electrically neutral rigid
   rods, can deswell over a wide range of concentration. On being replaced
   in excess water, subsequent recovery both of their volume and their
   elastic modulus is, within experimental error, reversible. Here we
   describe some of the properties that the gels dispay upon deswelling:
   1 In conditions of uniaxial deswelling the gel undergoes a phase
   transition, which can be followed by analysing the concentration
   gradient generated in the sample.
   2 The mechanical properties of the deswollen gel are strongly
   anisotropic.
   3 The effective osmotic Poisson ratio sigma(os) = - (Delta
   lambda(perpendicular to)/Delta lambda(parallel to)) is negative, where
   Delta lambda(perpendicular to) and Delta lambda(parallel to) are the
   relative compressions of the sample in the directions perpendicular and
   parallel to the applied stress.
   4 With polarised incident light, the light scattered at 90 degrees
   displays a fringe pattern, the period of which provides a measure of the
   birefringence.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of present study was to investigate, using a disk model, the
   effects of charge density and 1-1 electrolyte properties on the diffuse
   portion of the electrical double layer near a 2:1 clay mineral particle,
   Numerical solutions for the inner potential and anion exclusion volume
   were obtained by solving a Poisson-Boltzmann equation with varying
   parameter values for electrolyte ion radius, electrolyte concentration,
   basal plane charge density, and edge surface charge density. Although
   the negative electrostatic potential of the basal planes may spill over
   to dominate a positively charged edge surface at low electrolyte
   concentrations because of the typically large particle
   radius-to-thickness ratio, the simulation results suggested that the
   spillover effect diminishes with an increase in 1-1 electrolyte
   concentration, The electric potential surrounding the edge surface is
   more positive for large (0.4 nm) hardsphere electrolyte ions than for
   small (0.2 nm) or point-charge ions, Reducing the basal plane charge
   density does not significantly affect the anion exclusion volume over a
   wide range of electrolyte concentration, A highly positive edge surface,
   however, may spill over to dominate the basal plane and thereby adsorb
   significant amounts of anions at low electrolyte concentrations. The
   disk model predictions of anion adsorption or exclusion behavior for 2:1
   clay mineral particles were consistent with available experimental
   observations. (C) 1996 Academic Press, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{With the use of a three-stage thermal processing route, similar to that
   used previously for the production of ultra high molecular weight
   polyethylene possessing a negative Poisson's ratio (i.e. displaying
   auxetic behavior), an auxetic form of polyethylene has been fabricated.
   The polypropylene is processed by the compaction, sintering, and
   extrusion of a powder. The importance of powder morphology on the
   ability of polypropylene to achieve magnetic behavior has been examined,
   revealing that particle shape, size, and surface roughness are critical
   variables for successful processing. Negative Poisson's ratios of up to
   -0.22 at 1.6\% strain have been obtained. The data have been
   successfully interpreted by use of a simple geometric model based on the
   polymer microstructure. These suggest that, by further optimizing the
   processing conditions, much larger negative Poisson's ratios should be
   achievable.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we find an expression for Green's function for the

   conditions (clamped elastic plate). We likewise determine the
   corresponding Poisson type kernels and the harmonic Bergman kernel.
   These results come in terms of certain new transcendental functions
   which in a natural way generalize the Weierstrass zeta function. They
   are analogous to the result of R. COURANT - D. HILBERT (Methoden der
   Mathematischen Physik I (3. Aufl.), Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Heidelberg,
   New York (1968), pp. 335-337) and H. VILLAT (Rend. Circ. Mat. Palermo,
   33 (1912), pp. 134-175) respectively. As an application we show that,
   regardless of the sire of the ratio of the radii of the bounding
   circles, the Green's function always assumes negative values, which
   constitutes another rather striking counter-example to the well-known
   Boggio-Hadamard conjecture.}},

   an electrical double layer, demonstrating the positiveness of the zeta
   potential arising when aluminium particles are introduced into distilled

   The present paper provides an additional comparison of these two double

Abstract = {{An analysis of mutation accumulation in finite, asexual populations
   shows that by modeling discrete individuals, a necessary condition for
   mutation-selection balance is often not met. It is found that over a
   wide parameter range (whenever N e(-mu/s) < 1, where N is the population
   size, mu is the genome-wide mutation rate, and s is the realized
   strength of selection), asexual populations will fail to achieve
   mutation-selection balance. This is specifically because the
   steady-state strength of selection on the best individuals is too weak
   to counter mutation pressure. The discrete nature of individuals means
   that if the equilibrium level of mutation and selection is such that
   less than one individual is expected in a class, then equilibration
   towards this level acts to remove the class. When applied to the classes
   with the fewest mutations, this drives mutation accumulation. This drive
   is in addition to the well-known identification of the stochastic loss
   of the best class as a mechanism for Muller's ratchet. Quantification of
   this process explains why the distribution of the number of mutations
   per individual can be markedly hypodispersed compared to the Poisson
   expectation. The actual distribution, when corrected for stochasticity
   between the best class and the mean, is akin to a shifted negative
   binomial. The parameterization of the distribution allows for an
   approximation for the rate of Muller's ratchet when N e(-mu/s) < 1. The
   analysis is extended to the case of variable selection coefficients
   where incoming mutations assume a distribution of deleterious effects.
   Under this condition, asexual populations accumulate mutations faster,
   yet may be able to survive longer, than previously estimated.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives-To identify and quantify any relations between occupational
   exposure to cadmium oxide fume and mortalities from lung cancer and from
   chronic nonmalignant diseases of the respiratory system.
   Methods-The mortality experience of 347 copper cadmium alloy workers,
   624 workers employed in the vicinity of copper cadmium alloy work
   (vicinity workers), and 521 iron and brass foundry workers (all men) was
   investigated for the period 1946-92. All subjects were first employed in
   these types of work in the period 1922-78 and for a minimum period of
   one year at one of two participating factories. Two analytical
   approaches were used, indirect standardisation and Poisson regression.
   Results-Compared with the general population of England and Wales,
   mortality from lung cancer among copper cadmium alloy workers was close
   to expectation (observed deaths 18, expected deaths 17 . 8, standardised
   mortality ratio (SMR) 101, 95\% confidence interval (95\% CI) 60 to
   159). A significant excess was shown for lung cancer among vicinity
   workers but not among iron and brass foundry workers (vicinity workers:
   observed 55, expected 34 . 3, SMR 160, 95\% CI 121 to 209, P < 0 . 01;
   iron and brass foundry workers: observed 19, expected 17 . 8, SMR 107,
   95\% CI 64 to 167). Increased SMRs for non-malignant diseases of the
   respiratory system were shown for each of the three groups (alloy
   workers: observed 54, expected 23 . 5, SMR 230, 95\% CI 172 to 300, P <
   0 . 001; vicinity workers: observed 71, expected 43 . 0, SMR 165, 95\%
   CI 129 to 208, P < 0 . 001; iron and brass foundry workers: observed 34,
   expected 17 . 1, SMR 199, 95\% CI 137 to 278, P < 0 . 01). Work
   histories of the copper cadmium alloy workers were combined with
   independent assessments of cadmium exposures over time to develop
   individual estimates of cumulative exposure to cadmium; this being a
   time dependent variable. Poisson regression was used to investigate
   risks of lung cancer and risks of chronic non-malignant diseases of the
   respiratory system in relation to three levels of cumulative cadmium
   exposure (< 1600, 1600-4799, greater than or equal to 4800 mu g . m(-3).
   y). After adjustment for age, year of starting alloy work, factory, and
   time from starting alloy work, there was a significant positive trend (P
   < 0 . 01) between cumulative exposure to cadmium and risks of mortality
   from chronic non-malignant diseases of the respiratory system. Relative
   to a risk of unity for the lowest exposure category, risks were 4 . 54
   (95\% CI 1 . 96 to 10 . 51) for the middle exposure category and 4 . 74
   (95\% CI 1 . 81 to 12 . 43) for the highest exposure category. There was
   a non-significant negative trend between cumulative cadmium exposure and
   risks of mortality from lung cancer. Relative to a risk of unity for the
   lowest exposure category, risks were 0 . 85 (95\% CI 0 . 27 to 2 . 68)
   for the middle exposure category and 0 . 81 (95\% CI 0 . 18 to 3 . 73)
   for the highest exposure category. Similar findings were obtained when
   adjustment was made for age only.
   Conclusions-The findings are consistent with the hypothesis that
   exposure to cadmium oxide fume increases risks of mortality from chronic
   non-malignant diseases of the respiratory system. The findings do not
   support the hypothesis that exposure to cadmium oxide fume increases
   risks of mortality for lung cancer.}},

Abstract = {{The selection of materials for semiconductor device passivation was
   investigated as regards the application of ZnO- and PbO-based glasses in
   MOS (metal, oxide, and silicon) devices. It was found that mechanisms
   affecting the application of these glasses to MOS devices were related
   to the molar polarizabilities and the OH radical contents in glasses.
   With regard to the recovery of C-V (capacitance-voltage) hysteresis
   loops in MOS capacitors, ZnO-based glasses were found to be superior to
   PbO-based glasses, since the molar polarizability of ZnO-based glasses
   was smaller than that of PbO-based glasses. The concentration of OH
   radicals depends on the composition of the glasses and had a negative
   effect on the recovery of C-V curve shifts in MOS capacitors passivated
   by these glasses. The glasses had low-temperature reflow below 800
   degrees C; PbO-based glasses had lower flow points than ZnO-based
   glasses. The possible mechanisms for the recovery of <Delta Vover
   bar(G)> shifts in C-V hysteresis loops were elucidated by the use of

Abstract = {{We present a theoretical study of the effective Poisson's ratio of
   elastic solids weakened by porosity and microcracks. Explicit
   expressions of the effective Poisson's ratio are obtained using the
   Mori-Tanaka mean-field approach as applied to macroscopically isotropic
   solids containing randomly distributed and randomly oriented spheroidal
   pores. We focus on the influence of pore shape and concentration and
   devote special attention to the limiting cases of spherical,
   penny-shape, and needle-shape pores. A key result of this study is that
   the effective Poisson's ratio depends only on pore concentration, pore
   shape, and Poisson's ratio of the bulk solid. In other words, it is
   independent of any other elastic constants of the bulk solid. Also, the
   ratio of the shear and bulk moduli behaves similarly. Unlike other
   elastic constants which monotonically decrease with pore concentration,
   Poisson's ratio may increase, decrease, or remain unchanged as a
   function of pore concentration, depending on the pore shape and
   Poisson's ratio of the bulk solid. We discuss ramifications of these
   findings with regard to the elastic constants of oxide superconductors,
   especially the bismuth cuprates, which show unusually low Poisson's
   ratios. We also discuss these low Poisson's ratios, including the
   possibility of negative Poisson's ratios.}},

Abstract = {{Intensive field surveys were conducted in eastern Nebraska to determine
   the frequency distribution model and associated parameters of broadleaf
   and grass weed seedling populations, The negative binomial distribution
   consistently fit the data over time (1992 to 1993) and space (fields)
   for both the inter and intrarow broadleaf and grass weed seedling
   populations, The other distributions tested (Poisson with zeros, Neyman
   type A, logarithmic with zeros, and Poisson-binomial) did not fit the
   data as consistently as the negative binomial distribution, Associated
   with the negative binomial distribution is a k parameter, k is a
   nonspatial aggregation parameter related to the variance at a given mean
   value, The k parameter of the negative binomial distribution was
   consistent across weed density for individual weed species in a given
   field except for foxtail spp, populations, Stability of the k parameter
   across field sites was assessed using the likelihood ratio test, There
   was no stable or common k value across held sites and years for all weed
   species populations, The lack of stability in k across field sites is of
   concern, because this parameter is used extensively in the development
   of parametric sequential sampling procedures, Because k is not stable
   across field sites, k must be estimated at the time of sampling,
   Understanding the variability in k is critical to the development of
   parametric sequential sampling strategies and understanding the dynamics
   of weed species in the field.}},

Abstract = {{The theory of osmosis and reverse osmosis in fine-porous charged
   membranes and diaphragms is presented in a deductive way with several
   well-structured levels of consideration. The analysis starts from the
   discontinuous version of irreversible thermodynamics where the membrane
   is considered as an absolutely black box without any information needed
   about its internal structure. As a trade-off for generality, however,
   the thermodynamic forces must be small. A number of qualitative
   conclusions is drawn proceeding from rather evident assumptions about
   the order of magnitude of various phenomenological coefficients. In the
   case of electrolyte mixtures those conclusions turn out surprisingly
   numerous and non-trivial including predictions of reflection
   coefficients larger than unity and strong negative osmosis. Both those
   anomalous phenomena are confirmed by experimental findings.
   The next step is the introduction of a `uniformly black' box, namely a
   macroscopically homogeneous membrane with otherwise unspecified internal
   structure. That permits to employ the continuous version of irreversible
   thermodynamics thus allowing to drop the restriction of small
   thermodynamic forces. In the case of binary electrolytes general
   solutions in quadratures are obtained for the problems of apparent
   osmotic pressure and of reverse osmosis, and a very accurate approximate
   solution in quadratures is obtained for the problem of osmosis. Some of
   the theoretical predictions are compared with experimental data on the
   reverse osmosis of binary electrolytes in track-etched membranes with
   the pore size of 8 nm.
   In the case of electrolyte mixtures a semi-quantitative asymptotic
   analysis is performed in the limiting case of reverse osmosis at
   sufficiently large Peclet numbers, and in the particular case of one
   dominant electrolyte in the mixture an exact solution in quadratures is
   obtained. Those analyses make possible to predict a number of
   non-trivial regularities that are confronted with experimental data on
   the pressure-driven transport of ternary electrolyte mixtures across
   various charged porous membranes. A good qualitative agreement between
   the theory and experiments is recorded.
   The next step is the specification of phenomenological coefficients
   within the scope of a general capillary model. That makes the box grey
   but not transparent, yet, as the shape of capillary cross-section as
   well as the nature of surface forces are not specified. General
   expressions for phenomenological coefficients derived in terms of ion
   distribution and diffusion coefficients make possible a qualitative
   analysis of the effect of inhomogeneity of ion distribution inside
   pores.
   Finally, the capillary space charge model is introduced making the
   analysis completely mechanistic. Several approaches are considered to
   the approximate description of the structure of overlapped diffuse parts
   of double electric layers in fine pores. Since qualitative effects of
   microscopic heterogeneity appear to be not dependent on the details of
   the pore geometry sample numerical calculations are performed for
   slit-like capillaries where there is a general solution of
   Poisson-Boltzmann equation in quadratures. A more general model of pores
   in an electrically conducting gel is introduced in an attempt to
   quantitatively describe the results of complete characterization of
   cation-exchange membranes in terms of irreversible thermodynamics.}},

Abstract = {{The Poisson's ratios and Young's moduli of 2D molecular networks having
   conventional and re-entrant honeycomb forms have been modelled using
   molecular modelling. Three principle deformation mechanisms were
   observed: bond hinging, flexure and stretching. Analytical models have
   also been developed that can be used to describe each of these modes of
   deformation acting either independently or concurrently. A parametric
   fit of the force constants in the concurrent analytical model
   calculations to the molecular model calculations yields good agreement
   in the mechanical properties for all the structures studied. Specific
   trends in the force constants required to fit the data are observed.
   Consequently, a force constants library can be compiled and has been
   used to predict accurately the properties of more complex variants of
   the networks. This semi-analytical sub-unit approach enables a more

Abstract = {{The spatio-temporal patterns of spotted wilt disease in peanut, caused

   by several methods. The spatial distributions of symptomatic plants were
   mapped at 2-wk intervals during two consecutive years in fields of the
   susceptible peanut cultivar Florunner and in the resistant cultivar
   Southern Runner. The disease frequency data were subjected to quadrat
   analyses, including indices of dispersion (variance/mean ratio and the
   negative binomial k parameter), comparison of frequency distributions of
   symptomatic plants to expected distributions derived from several models
   of spatial dispersion (binomial, Poisson, and negative binomial), and
   two-dimensional distance class analysis at each sampling interval.
   Although significant spatial aggregation of diseased plants was detected
   in most samples, random or nearly random clusters of infected plants
   that apparently arose from a continuous immigration of viruliferous
   vectors dominated spatial aspects of epidemic progress. Aside from
   smaller incidence of disease in the resistant compared to the
   susceptible cultivar, no effect of cultivar was noted in relation to
   spatial or temporal patterns of disease development in this pathosystem.
   Spotted wilt temporal progress was well described by monomolecular
   models of disease progress in each cultivar and year. The data and
   analyses were consistent with the hypothesis that most infections arise
   as a result of primary transmission and that there is limited secondary
   spread of TSWV after it becomes established in the field.}},

Abstract = {{We are interested in the study of a thin plate, periodicially perforated
   by cylindrical holes, the axes of which are perpendicular to the plane
   of the plate. A horizontal section of the plate specifies its geometry,
   and shows a periodicity in the order of epsilon. The thickness of the
   plate is equal to e. The ratio of material is small, and is
   characterized by the parameter delta, the thickness of the bars being
   equal to epsilon delta. In this paper, we study the dependence of
   displacements on e, epsilon and delta, and to give equivalent limits
   when e, then epsilon, and finally delta, tend towards zero. An
   interesting result obtained in this work is the negative Poisson
   coefficient of the final equivalent material. Although this coefficient
   is theoretically between - 1/2 and 1, most materials encountered in
   practice have a positive one.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to evaluate whether long-term glucose control,
   as assessed by fasting plasma glucose determinations during 3 years, is
   a predictor of all-cause mortality in elderly NIDDM patients. Five
   hundred and sixty-six NIDDM patients attending the Verona Diabetes
   Clinic, aged 75 years and over, were followed-up from 1 January 1987 to
   31 December 1991 to assess all-cause mortality. From their clinical
   records all fasting plasma glucose determinations available for the
   years 1984 to 1986 were collected and analysed. Patients were grouped in
   tertiles according to mean (M-FPG), coefficient of variation (CV-FPG)
   and trend over time (slope, S-FPG) of fasting plasma glucose during the
   period of retrospective evaluation, Mortality was assessed by
   observed/expected ratios, univariate Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and
   multivariate Poisson regression model. By 31 December 1991, 61 men and
   127 women had died. Increased observed/expected ratios were found in
   women from the top M-FPG tertile, in patients (men and women) from the
   top CV-FPG tertile and in patients with a S-FPG less than -0.30 mmol/l
   per year (lowest tertile). Patients in the lowest tertile of CV-FPG and
   in the middle tertile of S-FPG had a reduced mortality risk.
   Kaplan-Meier survival analysis indicated that patients with high CV-FPG
   as well as those in tertiles I and III of S-FPG (i.e., those with a
   definitely negative or definitely positive slope) had an increased
   probability of dying, without any significant differences between the
   three tertiles of M-FPG. Poisson regression model showed that CV-FPG,
   but not M-FPG or S-FPG, was an independent significant predictor of
   mortality, These results suggest that glucose stability needs to be
   considered along with the absolute level of metabolic control when
   treating elderly NIDDM patients.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a method to design the periodic microstructure of a
   material to obtain prescribed constitutive properties. The
   microstructure is modelled as a truss or thin frame structure in 2 and 3
   dimensions. The problem of finding the simplest possible microstructure
   with the prescribed elastic properties can be called an inverse
   homogenization problem, and is formulated as an optimization problem of
   finding a microstructure with the lowest possible weight which fulfils
   the specified behavioral requirements. A full ground structure known
   from topology optimization of trusses is used as starting guess for the
   optimization algorithm. This implies that the optimal microstructure of
   a base cell is found from a truss or frame structure with 120 possible
   members in the 2-dimensional case and 2016 possible members in the
   3-dimensional case. The material parameters are found by a numerical
   homogenization method, using Finite-Elements to model the representative
   base cell, and the optimization problem is solved by an optimality
   criteria method.
   Numerical examples in two and three dimensions show that it is possible
   to design materials with many different properties using base cells
   modelled as truss or frame works. Hereunder is shown that it is possible
   to tailor extreme materials, such as isotropic materials with Poisson's
   ratio close to - 1, 0 and 0.5, by the proposed method. Some of the
   proposed materials have been tested as macro models which demonstrate
   the expected behaviour.}},

   auxetic behaviour (negative Poisson's ratio) and negative coefficients
   of thermal expansion(4-6). Our approach relies on the notion that rigid
   organic molecules of high symmetry will adopt one of only a few possible
   structures when linked via hydrogen bonds or coordination to
   metals(7-9). We use trigonal ligands to make networks joined at the
   vertices by metal ions; the resulting networks are homeotypic(10) with
   the honeycomb-like AIB(2) and the hinge-like ThSi2 phases. The
   hinge-like network has channels of inner diameter 15 Angstrom, within
   which included molecules can be exchanged while the framework remains
   intact, We have not yet determined whether this material is auxetic.}},

Abstract = {{The observed variability between mortality or morbidity rates in
   epidemiologic studies is partly due to random fluctuations. The same is
   true for rate ratios relative to reference rates. A method for
   estimating the distribution of true rate ratios is applied to a data set
   of perinatal mortality in 515 small areas in the North West Thames
   Health Region, England, in the period 1986-1990. Combining the random
   Poisson variability with the assumption that the true rate ratios are
   drawn from a gamma distribution (a family of positive unimodal
   distributions) produces a negative binomial lag-likelihood for the
   dispersion parameter of the gamma. The maximum likelihood estimate of
   this parameter and its confidence interval are then found via direct
   numerical methods; alternatively, the hypothesis of no heterogeneity is
   tested by a likelihood ratio. The standardized mortality ratios (SMRs)
   for the data have an empirical distribution with 5th percentile at 0 and
   95th percentile at 1.92, but their true variability, as described by the
   5th to 95th percentiles of the fitted gamma distribution, is from 0.72
   to 1.32. The likelihood ratio test confirmed this result, rejecting the
   hypothesis that the true rates are homogeneous (p = 0.015). The method
   requires only modest computing resources and is useful when assessing
   the need for more detailed study.}},

Abstract = {{Hemoglobins from normal human cells, from sickle cells, and from horse
   were investigated by electrooptical methods in their oxy and deoxy
   forms. The reduced linear dichroism measured as a function of the
   electric field strength demonstrates the existence of permanent dipole
   moments in the range of 250-400 Debye units. The reduced limiting
   dichroism is relatively small (less than or equal to 0.1); it is
   negative for hemoglobin from sickle cells and positive for the
   hemoglobins from normal human cells and from horse. The dichroism decay
   time constants are in the range from about 55 to 90 ns. Calculations of
   the electrooptical data from available crystal structures are given
   according to model of various complexity, including Monte Carlo
   simulations of proton fluctuations with energies evaluated by a finite
   difference Poisson-Boltzmann procedure. The experimental dipole moments
   are shown to be consistent with the results of the calculations. In the
   case of human deoxyhemoglobin, the root mean square dipole is higher
   than the mean dipole by a factor of about 4.5, indicating a particularly
   large relative contribution due to proton fluctuations. The ratio of the
   root mean square dipole to the mean dipole is much smaller (similar to
   1.1 to similar to 1.5) for the other hemoglobin molecules. The
   calculations demonstrate that the dichroism decay time constants are not
   simply determined by the size/shape of the proteins, but are strongly
   influenced by the orientation of the dipole vector with respect to the
   axis of maximal absorbance. The comparison of experimental and
   calculated electrooptical data provides a useful test for the accuracy
   of electrostatic calculations and/or for the equivalence of structures
   in crystals and in solutions.}},

Abstract = {{A theory is presented for the development of streamers from a positive
   point in atmospheric air. The continuity equations for electrons,
   positive ions, and negative ions are solved simultaneously with
   Poisson's equation. For an applied voltage of 20 kV across a 20 mm gap,
   streamers are predicted to cross the gap in 26 ns, and the calculated
   streamer velocities are in fair-agreement with experiment. When the gap
   is increased to 50 mm for the same voltage, the streamer is predicted
   not to reach the cathode. In this case an intense electric field front
   rapidly propagates about 35 mm into the gap in 200 ns. For a further 9.5
   mu s the streamer slowly moves into the gap, until the electric field at
   the head of the streamer collapses, and the streamer front stops moving.
   Finally, only positive space-charge remains; this moves away from the
   point, allowing the field near the point to recover, giving rise to a
   secondary discharge near the anode. The electric field distribution is
   shown to be quite different from that found previously for SF6; this is
   explained by the much lower attachment coefficient in air compared with
   that in SF6. These results show that streamers in air have a far greater
   range than streamers in SF6. This greater range cannot be explained by
   comparison of the values of E{*}, the electric field at which ionisation
   equals attachment.}},

Abstract = {{The thermodynamic analysis of viscoelastic constitutive laws makes it
   possible to estimate the class of admissible creep-relaxation functions.
   This set of functions turns out to be larger than it was traditionally
   supposed.  Except for the well known positive definite, monotone
   decreasing functions, the new class also includes the so-called
   non-traditional functions, such as locally non-monotone and even
   non-positive ones, hence involving the effect of the so-called negative
   viscosity.
   It is shown that generalized creep-relaxation functions turn out to be
   effective in the phenomenologic modelling of the complicated materials
   behaviour, like that in homogenization of heterogeneous bodies and in
   modelling of the wave propagation and of the negative Poisson ratio
   phenomena in composites.
   New directions for fundamental and applied research, that are considered
   with the thermodynamic admissibility of viscoelastic models, are
   discussed.  Examples of the application of generalized creep-relaxation
   functions are given, in particular for the dynamics of composites and
   for the thermomechanical modelling of wood.}},

Abstract = {{This article contains an analytic study of Poisson's ratio of re-entrant
   foam materials with negative Poisson's ratio.  These materials get
   fatter when stretched and thinner when compressed.  The Poisson effect
   is so fundamentally important to the properties of a material that a
   large change in the value of the ratio will have significant effects on
   the material's mechanical performance.  Isotropic foam structures with
   negative Poisson's ratio have been fabricated through a permanent
   volumetric transformation.  The cells were converted from the convex
   polyhedral shape of conventional foam cells to a concave or

   foam material will differ from that of a conventional foam in ways not
   addressed by existing theoretical treatment.  Poisson's ratio as a
   function of strain is obtained by modeling the three-dimensional unit
   cell as an idealized polyhedron unit cell.  Poisson's ratio is predicted
   to approach the isotropic limit of -1 with increasing permanent

Title = {{SYNCHRONY BETWEEN SINGLE-UNIT ACTIVITY AND LOCAL-FIELD POTENTIALS IN
   RELATION TO PERIODICITY CODING IN PRIMARY AUDITORY-CORTEX}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY}},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{73}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{227-245}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{1. We recorded responses from 136 single units and the corresponding
   local field potentials (LFPs) from the same electrode al 44 positions in
   the primary auditory cortex of 25 juvenile, ketamine-anesthetized cats
   in response to periodic click trains with click repetition rates between
   1 and 32 Hz; to Poisson-distributed click trains with an average click
   rate of 4 Hz; and under spontaneous conditions. The aim of the study is
   to evaluate the synchrony between LFPs and single-unit responses, to
   compare their coding of periodic stimuli, and to elucidate
   mechanisms-that limit this periodicity coding in primary auditory
   cortex.
   2. We obtained averaged LFPs either as click-triggered averages, the
   classical evoked potentials, or as spike-triggered averages. We
   quantified LFPs by initial negative peak-to-positive peak amplitude. In
   addition, we obtained trigger events from negativegoing level crossings
   (at similar to 2 SD below the mean) of the 100-Hz low-pass electrode
   signal. We analyzed these LFP triggers similarly to single-unit spikes.
   3. The average ratio of the LFP amplitude in response to the second
   click in a train and the LFP amplitude to the first click as a function
   of click rate was low-pass with a slight resonance at similar to 10 Hz,
   and, above that frequency, decreasing with a slope of similar to 24
   dB/octave. We found the 50\% point at similar to 16 Hz. In contrast, the
   LFP amplitude averaged over entire click trains was low-pass with a
   similar resonance but a high-frequency slope of 12 dB/ octave and a 50\%
   point at similar to 12 Hz.
   4. The LFP amplitude for click repetition rates between 5 and 11 Hz
   often showed augmentation, i.e., the amplitude increased in response to
   the first few clicks in the train and thereafter decreased. This
   augmentation was paralleled by an increase in the probability of firing
   in single units simultaneously recorded on the same electrode.
   5. We calculated temporal modulation transfer functions (tMTFs) for
   single-unit spikes and for LFP triggers. They were typically bandpass
   with a best modulating frequency of 10 Hz and similar shape for both
   single-unit spikes and LFP triggers. The tMTF per click, obtained by
   dividing the tMTF by the number of clicks in the train, was low-pass
   with a 50\% cutoff frequency at similar to 12 Hz, similar to that for
   the average LFP amplitude.
   6. The close similarity of the tMTFs for single-unit spikes and LFP
   triggers suggests that single-unit tMTFs can be predicted from LFP level
   crossings. The average ratio of the tMTF for single-unit spikes and LFP
   triggers was 0.38 +/- 0.25 (SD). Cross-correlations between single-unit
   spikes and LFP triggers showed a mean peak at a lag of 1.6 +/- 3.2 (SD)
   ms, a mean peak width of 13.9 +/- 7.7 (SD) ms, and a mean efficacy of
   0.21 +/- 0.28 (SD).
   7. We calculated first-order Poisson kernels between clicks and
   single-unit spikes, and LFP triggers and LFPs. Kernels were generally
   similar in shape for single-unit spikes and LFP triggers. The sequence
   of activation and suppression around the mean firing rate could
   generally be predicted from the waveform of the integrated click-evoked
   LFP. Poisson kernels accurately predicted the presence and salience of
   rebounds in single-unit responses to click train stimuli.
   8. Spike-triggered average LFPs were similar under Poisson click
   stimulation and spontaneous conditions. Their integrated waveforms,
   called average compound excitation potentials, lacked the strong
   excitatory rebounds of the click-evoked LFPs and the single-unit firing
   patterns.
   9. Double click transfer functions provided insufficient information to
   predict the response to successive clicks in periodic click trains for
   repetition frequencies in the range of 5-11 Hz, i.e., in the
   augmentation region. In contrast, the prediction for repetition rates <5
   Hz and >12 Hz was quite accurate.
   10. Predicting the double-click modulation transfer function on the
   basis of first- and second-order Poisson kernels calculated from the
   response to Poisson-distributed click trains was impossible. A good
   prediction was, however, obtained for the average LFP amplitude
   modulation transfer function up to repetition rates of similar to 16 Hz.
   The discrepancy for repetition rates >16 Hz suggests that the system has
   a much higher nonlinearity than second order and/or that the parameters
   of the system change during prolonged stimulation.}},

Abstract = {{The temperature variations of normal mode frequencies of a specimen of
   alpha-quartz single-crystal have been measured nearly up to the
   alpha-beta transition (T-0 = 573 degrees C), and all of the independent
   elastic constants were determined simultaneously by the rectangular
   parallelepiped resonance method. The results demonstrate that bulk
   moduli decrease largely toward T-0, while shear moduli show only a
   slight decrease. The trigonal constant C-14 decreases just below T-0,
   but seems to remain a finite value even at T-0. It is noted that the
   isotropic aggregate of alpha-quartz is a curious and scarce material in
   the sense that its bulk modulus is smaller than the shear modulus, and
   Poisson's ratio is very small or even negative at temperatures higher
   than 450 degrees C. In the measured temperature variations of mode
   frequencies, a characteristic feature was observed when two branches of
   A(g) modes came close, suggesting mode coupling. Except for this
   coupling between A(g) modes themselves, no definite evidence was
   observed which was indicative of coupling between modes of different
   symmetry. So it can be said the present sample is uniform in its
   property enough to suppress the coupling between modes of different
   symmetry.}},

   elaborated synthetic routes using new precursors (usually with multiple

   be new, kinetically stable, allotropic forms of carbon. Computer
   simulations show that they should exhibit new interesting properties
   e.g. negative Poisson coefficient. It is concluded that although the
   construction of all-carbon networks is still in its infancy but very
   important advances in synthesis of small sections of such structures
   have been made and hopefully, at the end of XX century we will have new
   allotropes of carbon in our hands.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a method to design the periodic microstructure of a
   material to obtain specified constitutive parameters. The problem can be
   called an inverse homogenization problem and is formulated as an
   optimization problem of finding the microstructure with the lowest
   possible weight which fulfills the specified behavioural requirements. A
   full ground structure known from topology optimization of trusses is
   used as starting guess for the optimization algorithm, which implies
   that the optimal microstructure of a base cell is found from a truss
   structure with 120 possible members in the 2-dimensional case and 2016
   possible members in the 3-dimensional case. The material parameters are
   found by a numerical homogenization method using finite elements to
   model the representative base cell, and the optimization problem is
   solved by an optimality criteria method.
   Numerical examples in two and three dimensions show that it is possible
   to design materials with many different properties, including isotropic
   materials with Poisson's ratio close to -1 and 0.5, using base cells
   modelled as truss structures. Some of the proposed base cells have been
   tested as macro models and methods to produce them in practice are

   carbon fibres.  Each panel was a balanced, symmetrical laminate with the
   plies alternating at +/- theta to a reference direction where theta = 0,
   10, 15, 20, 25, 30 and 40-degrees.  The full set of nine elastic
   constants was determined for each panel using ultrasonic velocity
   measurements.  The experimentally determined elastic constants were then
   compared with theoretical predictions obtained using standard laminate
   theory.  The Poisson's ratios of the composites were of particular
   interest in showing negative values for theta in the range between 15
   and 30-degrees, as predicted by the theory.}},

Abstract = {{The transition from a Townsend discharge to a normal discharge is
   investigated using a two-dimensional numerical model and an approximate
   analysis. The numerical model is based on a fluid description of
   electron and ion transport coupled with Poisson's equation, with the
   ionization source depending on the local field strength or provided by a
   Monte Carlo simulation of the fast electrons. The model is applied to an
   argon discharge, for a product of pressure and gap length in the 1-10
   Torr cm range. The proposed analytical model provides insight into the
   major physical phenomena observed experimentally in the subnormal glow
   region: the lateral constriction of the Townsend discharge with an
   increase of the current, the negative differential resistance of the
   discharge with a hysteresis loop in the current-voltage characteristics,
   and the appearance of current oscillations and their dependence on
   parameters of the external circuit. The field distortion is responsible
   for the constriction of the Townsend discharge provided that either the
   sign of the second derivative of the ionization coefficient alpha with
   respect to the electric field strength E is positive or the secondary
   emission coefficient gamma is an increasing function of E. A simple
   analytical description of nonlocal ionization is also suggested.
   Subnormal oscillations are treated as a two-dimensional phenomenon.}},

Abstract = {{A novel molecular network structure that has the unusual property of a
   negative Poisson's ratio has been modelled. This network is a
   combination of acetylene bonds and benzene rings that can be designed to
   have a range of different elastic constants and anisotropy. Molecular
   modelling techniques have been used to predict the elastic constants.
   The Young's moduli range between 20 and 117 GPa and Poisson's ratios
   between - 0.94 and 1.4 are predicted, depending on the exact details of
   the network geometry, These values are within die limits for an
   orthotropic elastic material.    Alternative analytical and
   finite-element models have also been used to try to simplify the
   calculations needed to predict the properties of the network. It is
   shown that considerable reductions in computational complexity, without
   an undue loss of accuracy, can be achieved. This method represents a new
   approach that is of use where complex network structures are built up

Abstract = {{Under certain biasing conditions, the intersubband energy separation in
   a quantum wire can match the optical phonon energy, thereby enhancing
   the scattering of charge carriers. We provide direct theoretical
   evidence that an anomalous negative differential transconductance (NDT)
   recently observed in an array of quantum wires at high temperatures is
   caused by resonant intersubband optical phonon scattering.
   Self-consistent 2D solutions of the Schrodinger and Poisson equations
   with a subsequent Monte Carlo analysis of intersubband scattering reveal
   a strong resonant polar optic phonon coupling between subbands at the
   gate bias indicated by the experimental data. The peak-to-valley ratio
   of the NDT exhibits a maximum near 170 K, thereby confirming the
   predictions of several theoretical investigations. The observation of
   resonant scattering is only possible because the quasi-1D form of
   Gauss's law shows an opposite trend to that for 2D systems in the
   dependence of the eigenenergy spectrum on gate bias.}},

Abstract = {{A low-density polymorph of silica, alpha-cristobalite, has been observed
   to have a negative Poisson ratio, i.e., when subjected to a uniaxial
   compression, this crystal contracts in the transverse direction. This
   behavior is uncommon. Other low-density polymorphs of silica, which have
   a similar chemical environment, have been reported to have positive
   Poisson ratios. We have investigated the elastic behavior of several
   silica phases: alpha-quartz, beta-quartz and alpha-cristobalite, with
   first-principles quantum-mechanical calculations, and with interatomic
   potentials. Our calculations confirm a negative Poisson ratio in
   alpha-cristobalite. We predict that a-quartz will have a negative
   Poisson ratio at high tensile strains, and that beta-quartz will never
   assume a negative ratio. We compute the second-order elastic constants
   of alpha-quartz and alpha-cristobalite using interatomic potentials and
   apply them in discussing the anisotropy of Poisson ratios in these
   materials. We demonstrate that the rigidity of the SiO4 tetrahedral
   units is intimately related to the occurrence of negative Poisson ratios
   in crystalline forms of silica.}},

Abstract = {{We have measured the count probability distribution function (CPDF) in a
   series of 10 volume-limited sub-samples of a deep redshift survey of
   IRAS galaxies. The CPDF deviates significantly from both the Poisson and
   Gaussian limits in all but the largest volumes. We derive the
   volume-averaged 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5 point correlation functions from the
   moments of the CPDF and find them all to be reasonably well described by
   power laws. Weak systematic effects with the sample size provide
   evidence for stronger clustering of galaxies of higher luminosity on
   small scales. Nevertheless, remarkably tight relationships hold between
   the correlation functions of different order. In particular, the
   `'normalized'' skewness defined by the ratio S3 = xi3BAR/xi2(2)BAR
   varies at most weakly with scale in the range 0.1 < xi2BAR < 10. That
   is, S3 is close to constant (= 1.5 +/- 0.5) from weakly to strongly
   nonlinear scales. On small scales, this is consistent with previous
   determinations of the three-point correlation function zeta = xi3. On
   larger scales, this conforms with the hypothesis of the growth of
   observed structures by gravitational clustering of initially Gaussian
   density fluctuations. We similarly find that xi4BAR is proportional to
   the third power Of xi2BAR in the same range of xi2BAR, and there is weak
   evidence that xi5BAR is proportional to the fourth power of xi2BAR.
   Furthermore, we find that the void probability function obeys a scaling
   relation with density to great precision, in accord with the
   scale-invariance hypothesis (xi(N)BAR is-proportional-to xi2N-1BAR)). 
   Double-counting cluster galaxies in order to match the cluster
   overdensities seen in optically selected samples of galaxies increases
   greatly the derived value Of S3 and S4, although the scaling between the
   correlations of different orders remains. Unfortunately, the relative
   sparseness of the IRAS sample precludes using it to make the most
   demanding tests of scale invariance, which rely on the overall shape of
   the CPDF at different scales. In this sparse limit, various models for
   the CPDF become degenerate and fit the IRAS data nearly equally well.
   Indeed, the CPDF is well fitted by both the negative binomial
   distribution, and the thermodynamical model of Saslaw \& Hamilton, and
   to a somewhat lesser extent by the log-normal distribution. All three
   models fit the data poorly for the densest subsample of IRAS galaxies
   examined, but this may be more a reflection of finite volume effects
   than of the inadequacy of the models.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Differences in the intrinsic radiosensitivity within and
   between different tumor classes have been noticed for human tumor cell
   lines using the clonogenic assay. By far, most of the cell lines studied
   up to now were derived from poorly differentiated tumors. In this study,
   the influence of tumor differentiation on the radiation doses necessary
   to control 50\% of small oxic spheroids (SCD50) was determined. Evidence
   of a distinct dependence of radioresponsiveness on tumor progression
   provides a background for an investigation of the underlying mechanisms.
   Methods and Materials: Spheroids were aggregated from 1000-1500 cells in
   agarose coated 24 multi-well plates. Their diameters ranged from 156 to
   405 mum, depending on the cell line. Spheroids were irradiated with
   graded Co-60 single doses using spheroid control as end point and a
   minimum follow-up period of 3 months.
   Results: Cell lines from three low grade gliomas and 10 malignant
   gliomas were studied in the spheroid control assay. The group mean SCD50
   values were 6.1 +/- 1.6 Gy and 13.1 +/- 3.3 Gy, respectively. Four cell
   lines from grade 2 soft tissue sarcomas had a mean SCD50 value of 6.2
   +/- 0.5 Gy and one undifferentiated sarcoma line of 11.0 Gy. Three
   well-differentiated breast cancer lines expressed the cell adhesion
   molecule E-cadherin, had an epitheloid morphology in monolayer culture,
   were estrogen receptor positive or contact inhibited in multicellular
   spheroids. Two undifferentiated breast cancer lines had a fibroblastoid
   morphology and were marker negative. The mean SCD50 value of the former
   was 10.5 +/- 1.0 Gy while that of the undifferentiated lines was 14.8
   +/- 2.8 Gy. Analysis of variance revealed a significant effect of the
   tumor type as well as the grade of dedifferentiation on the SCD50 after
   irradiation with one fraction or 2Gy/fraction. The surviving fractions
   at 2 Gy (SF2), obtained from the spheroid control rates after different
   fractionation schedules by approximation of the linear quadratic model
   assuming Poisson statistics were significantly dependent on tumor type
   (p = 0.001, ANOVA F-test) but not on tumor differentiation (p = 0.27).
   The alpha/beta ratios did not depend on tumor type (p = 0.08, ANOVA
   F-Test) but significantly increased with the grade of tumor cell
   dedifferentiation (p = 0.03).
   Conclusion: The spheroid model is suitable for measuring the
   radioresponsiveness of differentiated cell lines with very low colony
   forming efficiencies. Tumor cell differentiation is an important factor
   for the radioresponsiveness and recovery capacity of human tumor cells.}},

Abstract = {{The results of variable dielectric coefficient Poisson-Boltzmann
   calculations of the counter-ion concentration in the vicinity of an
   all-atom model of the B-form of DNA are presented with an emphasis on
   the importance of spatial variations in the dielectric properties of the
   solvent, particularly at the macro-ion-solvent interface. Calculations
   of the distribution of hard-sphere electrolyte ions of various
   dimensions are reported.
   The presence of a dielectric boundary significantly increases the
   magnitude of the electrostatic potential with a concomitant increase in
   the accumulation of small counter-ions in the groove regions of DNA.
   Because ions with radii greater than 2 angstrom have restricted access
   to the minor groove, the effect there is less significant than it is
   within the major groove. Changes in the dielectric coefficient for the
   electrolyte solution, allowing variation from 10 to 25, 40, 60, and 78.5
   within the first 7.4 angstrom of the surface of DNA, substantially
   increases the calculated surface concentration of counter-ions of all
   sizes. A lower dielectric coefficient near the macro-ion surface also
   tends to increase the counter-ion density in regions where the
   electrostatic potential is more negative than -kT. Regardless of the
   choice of dielectric coefficient, the number of ions in regions where
   the electrostatic potential is less than -kT remains the same for 0.153
   M added 1-1 monovalent electrolyte as for the case without added salt.
   The strong dependence of the calculated distribution of counter-ion
   density on the choice of dielectric coefficients representing the
   solvent continuum suggests that care must be taken to properly
   characterize the physical system when studying electrostatic properties
   using these methods.}},

   attempt to further document the pattern and causes of covariance between

   pCO2, temperature, salinity, nitrate concentration, POM concentration,
   chlorophyll a and the deltaC-13 of total dissolved inorganic carbon.
   While we found the previously reported general negative correlation
   between POC-deltaC-13 and {[}CO2aq], we also observed a prominent
   maximum in POC-deltaC-13 in the region immediately north of the
   Subtropical Convergence, coinciding with a maximum in {[}POM] and
   chlorophyll a, and with a minimum in pCO2. The increase in POC-deltaC-13
   between 59-degrees-S and die Subtropical Convergence is consistent with
   the trend expected if {[}CO2aq] were the main factor controlling the
   isotopic composition of POM. In contrast, data from the region north of
   the Subtropical Convergence clearly illustrate that POC-deltaC-13 can
   also vary independently of {[}CO2aq], as a 5 per mil decrease in
   POC-deltaC-13 was found in a region characterized by nearly constant
   {[}CO2aq]. We review several physiological factors which may account for
   these observations and discuss their implications for paleoceanographic
   reconstruction of {[}CO2aq] from the carbon isotopic composition of

Abstract = {{The growth behaviour of barium on silver(111) at room temperature is
   investigated by AES. XPS, MEIS. TDS, Work function measurements and by
   monitoring the secondary-electron-emission crystal current. It is shown
   that, for low coverage, initially a 2D monolayer is formed. For higher
   coverages the overlayer formed resembles a structure formed by Poisson
   or Stranski-Krastanov growth with small islands. As evaporation
   continues the islands become very large or the sticking coefficient
   drops to zero. Annealing the Ag with more than one monolayer of Ba on
   top shows a large work function decrease of 0.6 eV to an unusually low
   value of 1.9 eV. The lowering of the work function can partly be
   explained by the formation of large clusters. Coadsorption experiments
   with H-2 indicate that the H-2 Sticking coefficient on Ba/Ag(111) is
   constant and that the H-2 adsorbs dissociatively into one binding state.
   From the experiments an inelastic mean free path of 11 +/- 1 angstrom
   for 351 eV electrons and 17 +/- 1 angstrom for 1113 eV and 1119 eV
   electrons is deduced.}},

   found that the Poisson ratio exhibits a negative dip near the transition
   temperature for both neutral and ionic NIPA gels. The dip becomes deeper
   and shifts to a higher temperature as the ionic strength increases. The
   negative Poisson ratio of NIPA gels suggests that the bulk modulus is

Year = {{1993}},
Volume = {{20}},

Abstract = {{Several computer models of quartz were developed and tested. A simple
   model based on a potential energy function, derived in large part from
   quantum mechanical calculations on the molecule H6Si2O7, was found to
   reproduce the compressibility curve for quartz up to pressures of 8 GPa.
   The potential includes quadratic expressions for the SiO bond lengths,
   the OSiO angles and a parameter spanning the SiOSi angle together with
   an exponential OO repulsion term for non co-dimer O atoms. The
   variations in the cell edges and in the SiOSi angle, as a function of
   pressure, parallel observed trends when the bond lengths and angles
   calculated for the molecule are used as regressor values. Poisson ratios
   calculated using the model match those observed. Two configurations for
   quartz related by the Dauphine twin law are generated as minimum energy
   structures of the model with about equal frequencies as observed in
   nature. It is shown that the model, devised for quartz, can also be
   applied to the silica polymorph cristobalite, giving reasonable
   estimates of its compressibility curve, structural parameters and its
   negative Poisson ratio. When the observed bond lengths and angles are
   used as regressor values, the model generates the absolute coordinates
   of the atoms and the cell dimensions for quartz to within 0.005 angstrom
   and those of cristobalite to within 0.001 angstrom, on average, both at
   zero pressure. When applied to coesite, the model yields a zero pressure
   structure that is close to that observed but which is significantly
   softer than observed. The resulting SiO bond lengths are linearly
   correlated with f(s)(O), as observed for coesite, despite the use of a
   single bond length and a single SiOSi angle as regressor values in the
   calculation. When the structures are optimized assuming P1 space group
   symmetry and triclinic cell dimensions, the resulting frameworks of
   silicate tetrahedra exhibit the translational, rotational and reflection
   symmetries observed for quartz, cristobalite and coesite. The fact that
   the resulting frameworks exhibit observed space group symmetries is
   evidence that the symmetry adopted by the silica polymorphs can be
   explained by short ranged forces.}},

Abstract = {{Velocity anisotropy should be taken into account when analyzing the
   amplitude variation with offset (AVO) response of gas sands encased in
   shales. The anisotropic effects on the AVO of gas sands in transversely
   isotropic (TI) media are reviewed. Reflection coefficients in TI media
   are computed using a plane-wave formula based on ray theory. We present
   results of modeling special cases of exploration interest having
   positive reflectivity, near-zero reflectivity, and negative
   reflectivity.
   The AVO reflectivity in anisotropic media can be decomposed into two
   parts; one for isotropy and the other for anisotropy. Zero-offset
   reflectivity and Poisson' s ratio contrast are the most significant
   parameters for the isotropic component while the delta difference
   (DELTAdelta) between shale and gas sand is the most important factor for
   the anisotropic component. For typical values of TI anisotropy in shale
   (positive delta and epsilon), both delta difference (DELTAdelta) and
   epsilon difference (DELTAepsilon) amplify AVO effects. For small angles
   of incidence, DELTAdelta plays an important role in AVO while
   DELTAepsilon dominates for large angles of incidence.
   For typical values of delta and epsilon, the effects of anisotropy in
   shale are: (1) a more rapid increase in AVO for Class 3 and Class 2 gas
   sands, (2) a more rapid decrease in AVO for Class 1 gas sands, and (3) a
   shift in the offset of polarity reversal for some Class 1 and Class 2
   gas sands.}},

Abstract = {{Recent results of theoretical and practical importance prove that the
   two-dimensional (in-plane) effective (average) Young's modulus for an
   isotropic elastic material containing voids is independent of the
   Poisson's ratio of the matrix material. This result is true regardless
   of the shape and morphology of the voids so long as isotropy is
   maintained. The present work uses this proof to obtain explicit
   analytical forms for the effective Young's modulus property, forms which
   simplify greatly because of this characteristic. In some cases, the
   optimal morphology for the voids can be identified, giving the shapes of
   the voids. at fixed volume, that maximize the effective Young's modulus
   in the two-dimensional situation. Recognizing that two-dimensional
   isotropy is a subset of three-dimensional transversely isotropic media,
   it is shown in this more general case that three of the five properties
   independent of Poisson's ratio, leaving only two that depend upon it.
   For three-dimensionally isotropic composite media containing voids, it
   is shown that a somewhat comparable situation exists whereby the
   three-dimensional Young's modulus is insensitive to variations in
   Poisson's ratio, nu(m), over the range 0 less-than-or-equal-to nu(m)
   less-than-or-equal-to 1/2. although the same is not true for negative
   values of nu(m). This further extends the practical usefulness of the
   two-dimensional result to three-dimensional conditions for realistic
   values of nu(m).}},

Abstract = {{Negative Binomial Distribution (NBD) has been widely employed in
   marketing to model purchase incidence. In this paper, we undertake a
   simulation study to examine the sensitivity of NBD when the number of
   purchases in a given period is Poisson or Erlang 2 but the underlying
   heterogeneity is different from gamma. In particular, we allow the
   heterogeneity to follow three other flexible and well-known
   distributions: inverse Gaussian, lognormal and Weibull. All these
   distributions have shapes that are similar to the gamma. Moreover, we
   evaluate the performance of three alternative models namely, the
   Condensed Negative Binomial (CNBD), the Generalized Negative Binomial
   (GNBD) and the Generalized Poisson (GPD).
   Our simulation results indicate that NBD is robust to the violation of
   gamma heterogeneity when the interpurchase time is exponential and the
   coefficient of variation of the heterogeneity distribution is either low
   or moderate. CNBD exhibits similar robustness when the interpurchase
   time is Erlang 2. However, when the coefficient of variation exceeds
   one, all models exhibit extreme sensitivity to variations in the
   heterogeneity distribution for both interpurchase times. Interestingly,
   NBD and CNBD do not appear to be good substitutes for each other. GNBD
   and GPD models are possible alternatives to the NBD model.}},

   is significant scatter of the data for all fibres which is tentatively
   ascribed to filament microtwists coupled with non-circular
   cross-sections, to departure from transverse isotropy, and to various
   fibre inhomogeneities. High modulus carbon fibres exhibit a thermal
   expansion which is higher radially than axially, the latter being often
   negative whereas the anisotropy is less pronounced for the high strength
   carbon fibre and almost nil for polycarbosilane Si-C-O fibre. The

Abstract = {{A one-dimensional continuum model is presented for a dc-glow-discharge
   in an electronegative gas between parallel plates. It is based on the

   positive and negative ions, the local electron energy balance and the
   Poisson equation for the self-consistent electric field. These equations
   are supplemented by suitably chosen boundary conditions and are solved
   by the finite difference procedure HEMODES (HEnyey Method Ordinary
   Differential Equation Solver) which, in particular, can successfully
   handle the singular point occuring if the inertia term in the ion
   momentum balance equation is taken into account. Since not all data
   needed within this treatment for the simulation of realistic
   electronegative gases were available, a fictitious argon-like gas has
   been considered which nevertheless can demonstrate the characteristic
   features of such a discharge. In particular, the influence of variations

Abstract = {{Bond and site percolation on two- and three-dimensional (3D) elastic and
   superelastic percolation networks with central and bond-bending (BB)
   forces are studied. We calculate the force distribution and show that,
   depending on the relative contributions of the central and BB forces,
   its shape can be unimodal or bimodal, both near and away from the
   percolation threshold p(c). The Poisson ratios of various 2D and 3D,
   isotropic and anisotropic BB models are calculated and are shown to take
   on negative values near p(c). Several experimental realizations of this
   peculiar property are given. We then analyze various experimental data
   on elastic and rheological properties of gel polymers near p(c). The
   scaling laws for elastic properties of gel polmers near p(c) and their
   associated critical exponents f are divided into two groups. In one
   group are physical gels in which the contribution of BB forces to the
   elastic energy dominates that of central forces (CF's), and their
   scaling properties are described by the BB model, with f congruent-to
   3.75. In the second group are chemical gels in most of which CF's are
   dominant, with f congruent-to 2. 1. The scaling laws for the viscosity
   of a gelling solution near the gel point can also be divided into two
   groups. In one group are gelling solutions that are close to the Zimm
   regime. We propose that the scaling properties of the viscosity of such
   gels is analogous to the shear modulus of a static superelastic
   percolation network that diverges, as p(c) is approached from below,
   with an exponent tau = nu-beta(p)/2 congruent-to 0.68 in 3D, where nu
   and beta(p) are the critical exponents of the correlation length and the
   strength of percolation networks, respectively. In the second group are
   gelling solutions that are close to the Rouse limit. We propose that the
   scaling law for the divergence of the viscosity of such gels is the same
   as that of the shear modulus of a dynamic superelastic percolation
   network, with tau' = 2tau congruent-to 1.35 in 3D.}},

Abstract = {{The field equations of a small-scale point-plane negative DC corona
   discharge in air have been solved in a particular case by the authors.
   The technique was to use a finite-element method for solving Poisson's
   equation, and an algorithm for finding the charge density from a
   current-continuity relation. A single mobility coefficient was adopted
   and the methods were used alternately until convergence was obtained.
   Boundary conditions for this technique are the potentials of the
   electrodes and the measured current distribution. Geometric convergence
   occurs before arithmetic convergence, with the accuracy of the latter
   being better than 1\% for the electric field (typically 0.5\% everywhere
   except at the tip of the active electrode). The uncertainty in the
   solution because of the unknown charge distributions in the small glow
   region has been accurately quantified by using two extreme models.
   Geometrical and numerical differences between these models have been
   shown to be very small. The known accuracy of the solution has allowed a
   thorough appraisal of the Deutsch assumption which forms the basis of
   many approximate methods. The assumption is shown to be unfounded, and
   we conclude that it should be avoided if accurate numerical solutions
   are being sought for general electrode geometries.}},

Abstract = {{When network station spacing is large relative to event depths,
   constraining focal depths using direct arrivals is difficult. To help
   overcome this problem, we incorporated the SzS, SzP, and PzP Socorro
   magma body reflections into the earthquake location process. To find a
   velocity model appropriate for combining direct and reflected arrivals,
   we jointly inverted for 75 hypocenters and a one-dimensional velocity
   model. We used over 1000 direct arrivals and over 400 reflected
   arrivals, solving for P velocity (Vp) and Poisson's ratio (nu) above the
   approximate base of the seismogenic zone, Vp and nu below the base of
   the seismogenic zone, depth to the upper surface of the magma body, and
   station corrections. High-velocity and low-velocity initial models
   converged to the same solutions without damping. We found that Vp and nu
   may both decrease slightly below about 10-km depth. Magma body depth is
   near 18.75 km. A close fit between observed and modeled reflected phase
   arrival times and an even lateral distribution of positive and negative
   reflected-phase residuals indicate that the magma body upper surface is
   nearly flat.
   In the Socorro area, combining direct and reflected phases reduces
   average focal depth error by more than a factor of 3 and average origin
   time error by a factor of 2 compared with using only direct phases. This
   is because reflected arrivals are more sensitive to changes in focal
   depth than direct arrivals, and combining upgoing (direct) and downgoing
   (reflected) times reduces the trade-off between focal depth and origin
   time. For this method to be successful, phases must be carefully
   identified. To help identity secondary phases, we used relative arrival
   time curves, plotting phase-minus-P times versus S-minus-P times.
   Picking reflection pairs (SzP and SzS, SzP and PzP, or SzS and PzP
   identified on a single seismogram) significantly reduces the chances of
   phase misidentification. The SzP-SzS and SzP-PzP pairs also help prevent
   trade-offs between reflector depth and focal depths.}},

Abstract = {{This research determined the manner of convergence of certain Markov
   processes to their steady state limiting distributions. This article
   looks at linear birth and death processes with birth rate at each state
   determined by the immigration constant a and the natural growth
   multiplier b; with death rate at each state determined by fixed
   execution constant c and the natural declination multiplier d. All
   parameters are nonnegative. There is a reflective barrier at state 0. It
   is shown that when the natural growth multiplier is less than the
   declination parameter a limiting distribution exists, that is, when the
   multiplier difference is negative. We define a modal indicator as the
   ratio of the sum of the death parameters c and d diminished by
   immigration a to the multiplier difference. It is shown that when the
   modal indicator is negative then the mode occurs at state 0. When the
   indicator is an integer then the process is bimodal with the mode at
   that integral value and at the next larger integer. When the indicator
   is not an integer then the mode occurs at the first integral value
   greater than the modal indicator. Additionally, bounds for the birth
   probabilities and the tail probabilities are derived. These equations
   are applied to an example in the area of computer performance analysis.
   The objective of studying the characteristics of the limiting
   distribution is to understand the difficulties involved when simulating
   these processes. The most extensively studied of these types of Markov
   processes is the M/M/1 process (Poisson arrivals to one server having
   exponential service times). This is a simple case of a linear birth and
   death process where b = d = 0. Researchers have suggested speeding
   convergence by initializing the process in a state other than 0. This
   article reveals that zero is a good choice for the M/M/1 process, but it
   is not the best choice for the general linear birth and death process.
   Also, practitioners have devised empirical methods to decide when the
   number of iterations N is sufficient to declare convergence. This
   article presents bounds on the tail probabilities in order to guide the
   selection of N at the onset of simulation. The sense of the theorems
   proved below can be captured by these statements: 1. The natural growth
   multiplier b must be less than the declination parameter d to insure
   convergence. 2. If the modal indicator is relatively large then
   intitializing the process in the modal state might be wise. 3. Large
   values of the declination parameter d relative to the growth multiplier
   b will result in a better behaved process.}},

Abstract = {{Excesses of digestive and respiratory cancers have been reported
   previously in association with exposure to machining fluids, agents in
   widespread use as coolants and lubricants in machining operations.
   Previous studies have had limited power to distinguish the effects of
   the different types of machining fluids in use. In a cohort of over 30
   000 workers employed at two automotive plants in Michigan, mortality
   patterns were studied in relation to exposure to each of the three major
   fluid types - straight oils, soluble oils, and synthetic fluids.
   Standardized mortality ratios were estimated for subgroups of the cohort
   ever exposed to each of the three fluid types, and Poisson regression
   analyses were used to assess trends in risk with duration of exposure.
   The data suggest modest positive associations between exposure to
   straight oils and rectal, laryngeal, and prostatic cancer and a negative
   association between soluble and synthetic fluid exposure and lung

   association. For the pelagic sharks, a clear trend towards intraspecific

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES. The effect of luminance range compression on the visual
   threshold of a target in a computed tomographic (CT) scan was
   investigated in eight experiments.
   METHODS. Both visual increment thresholds of a hot target and visual
   decrement thresholds of a cold target were obtained. Realistic noisy CT
   images simulating a scan reconstruction and partial volume blurring were
   tested as representative of complex medical images. Negative versions,
   high luminance versions, and noise-free versions of these CT images also
   were tested.
   RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS. In all the noisy images, as the luminance range
   of the image was compressed, proportionately smaller physical luminance
   differences between the target and its local background were needed to
   reach visual threshold. However, the thresholds were the same in terms
   of the difference in CT numbers between target and background. Noise in
   terms of CT numbers sets the threshold for a wide range of display
   conditions. In the noise-free CTs, as the luminance range was
   compressed, the luminance differences between the target and background
   needed to reach threshold also decreased, but only marginally. However,
   in terms of CT numbers, the thresholds were increased.}},

Abstract = {{THE Poisson ratio of a solid characterizes its response to uniaxial
   stress. It is defined as the negative ratio of the transverse strain to
   the corresponding axial strain. Normally, this ratio is positive, as
   most solids expand in the transverse direction when subjected to a
   uniaxial compression. Although a negative Poisson ratio is not forbidden
   by thermodynamics, it is rare in crystalline solids: the results of
   recent experiments1 which observed a negative Poisson ratio in
   alpha-cristobalite were therefore unexpected. We have investigated the
   elastic behaviour of alpha-cristobalite and other forms of silica with
   first-principles calculations and classical interatomic potentials. Our
   calculations reproduce the negative Poisson ratio in alpha-cristobalite,
   and predict that alpha-quartz, the most common form of crystalline
   silica, will also exhibit a negative Poisson ratio under large uniaxial
   tension. We attribute the occurrence of a negative Poisson ratio in
   low-density silica polymorphs to the high rigidity of the SiO4
   tetrahedra.}},

Abstract = {{A FAMILY of two-dimensional, two-phase, composite materials with
   hexagonal symmetry is found with Poisson's ratios arbitrarily close to
   -1. Letting kappa{*}, kappa-1, kappa-2 and mu{*}, mu-1, mu-2 denote the
   bulk and shear moduli of one such composite, stiff inclusion phase and
   compliant matrix phase, respectively, it is rigorously established that
   when kappa-1 = kappa-2/r and mu-1 = mu-2/r there exists a constant c
   depending only on kappa-2, mu-2 and the geometry such that
   kappa{*}/mu{*} < c square-root s for all sufficiently small stiffness
   ratios r (specifically for r < 1/9). This implies that the Poisson's
   ratio approaches -1 as r --> 0 and in this limit it is conjectured that
   the material deforms conformally on a macroscopic scale. By introducing
   additional microstructure on a smaller length scale a second family of
   composites is obtained with substantially lower Poisson's ratios, each
   satisfying kappa{*}/mu{*} < c'r. These two families provide conclusive
   proof that isotropic materials with negative Poisson's ratio exist
   within the framework of continuum elasticity. It is also shown that
   elastically isotropic two- and three-dimensional composites with
   Poisson's ratio approaching -1 as r --> 0 can be generated simply by
   layering the component materials together in different directions on
   widely separated length scales.}},

Abstract = {{Some problems of mechanics of disordered (amorphous) solids: the glass -
   liquid transition, plastic deformation in the solid state, the negative
   Poisson coefficient, features of random densest packing of particles of
   various shape - are discussed basing on results of computer simulation
   of stochastic mechanical behavior of a solid consisting of 1000 elastic
   rigid particles. The number of direct physical contacts between
   particles, their distribution in space and decay in the, course of shear
   strain are shown to result in existence of two states - solid glassy and
   liquid ones, the condition of the transition between them and the main
   mechanical properties of a solid: plasticity, strain softening,
   localization of the strain as shear bands. The criterion of the glass -
   liquid transition is proposed and based, and the dependence of the
   critical number of contacts and of the packing density in the transition
   point on the symmetry of particles and the type of contact forces is
   shown. The possibility to apply the geometrical conceptions to the
   theory of the condensated state is discussed with the assumption, that
   any potential of interaction between particles can be separated into two
   components - rigid repulsion and soft attraction being responsible for
   various physical properties: gas - liquid and liquid - glass
   tranzitions, presence of critical points, mechanical behavior of glasses
   and crystals. Features of the structure of isotropic solids
   characterized by the negative Poisson coefficient are discussed. Such
   solids are shown to be a system of lattice sites (or particles) related
   with the potential or construction having the high shear and flexural
   rigidity comparing with normal one. The structure of rigid polymer and
   metallic foams having the negative Poisson coefficient is explained
   basing on the analysis of elastic behavior of thin layers of the foam
   material after the loss of stability. The densest random packing of
   particles depends both no geometrical and mechanical properties and
   corresponds to the point of the transition of the system into the solid
   state.}},

Abstract = {{Zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) regression is a model for count data with
   excess zeros. It assumes that with probability p the only possible
   observation is 0, and with probability 1 - p, a Poisson(lambda) random
   variable is observed. For example, when manufacturing equipment is
   properly aligned, defects may be nearly impossible. But when it is
   misaligned, defects may occur according to a Poisson(lambda)
   distribution. Both the probability p of the perfect, zero defect state
   and the mean number of defects-lambda in the imperfect state-may depend
   on covariates. Sometimes p and lambda are unrelated; other times p is a
   simple function of lambda such as p = 1/(1 + lambda(tau)) for an unknown
   constant-tau. In either case, ZIP regression models are easy to fit. The
   maximum likelihood estimates (MLE's) are approximately normal in large
   samples, and confidence intervals can be constructed by inverting
   likelihood ratio tests or using the approximate normality of the MLE's.
   Simulations suggest that the confidence intervals based on likelihood
   ratio tests are better, however. Finally, ZIP regression models are not
   only easy to interpret, but they can also lead to more refined data
   analyses. For example, in an experiment concerning soldering defects on
   printed wiring boards, two sets of conditions gave about the same mean
   number of defects, but the perfect state was more likely under one set
   of conditions and the mean number of defects in the imperfect state was
   smaller under the other set of conditions; that is, ZIP regression can
   show not only which conditions give lower mean number of defects but
   also why the means are lower.}},

Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{1992}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{73-81}},
Abstract = {{Stability predictions of uniaxially compressed laminates have consisted
   mainly of solutions based on assumptions of free in-plane edges avoiding
   consideration of Poisson's effect in the prebuckling stage.  The paper
   considers a practical problem of uniaxial buckling of rectangular,
   anisotropic laminates with in-plane restrained unloaded edges where a
   transverse in-plane force due to Poisson's effect is predominant to an
   extent that induces premature instability and causes significant
   departure from classical behavior.  Two general classes of laminates,
   namely, (+/- theta)sym and (phi(1), phi(2))sym, are studied under
   various combinations of out-of-plane simple and clamped boundary
   conditions.  A wide variation in Poisson's ratio with respect to the
   fiber orientation is observed that, in turn, results in dramatic changes
   in the buckling as well as postbuckling behavior.  It is clearly shown
   that the classical optimal fiber angles become practically meaningless
   when the effect of in-plane edge restraints is incorporated in the
   analysis.
   For the analysis a computerized Ritz method, in conjunction with
   Gram-Schmidt orthogonal polynomials as coordinate functions, is
   developed, which is capable of modeling a variety of boundary condition,
   viz. simple, clamped, free and their combinations.
   The paper investigates a little known but practical mode of instability,
   highlights the effect of fiber orientation and aspect ratio, explores
   the possibility of controlling buckling by tailoring laminates to
   exhibit negative Poisson's ratio and cautions against improper selection
   of boundary conditions in the design and optimization of composite
   plates.}},

Abstract = {{According to feature integration theory, conjunction search is conducted
   via a serial self-terminating search. However, effects attributed to
   search processes operating on the entire display may actually reflect
   search restricted to elements defined by a single feature. In experiment
   1 this question is addressed in a reaction-time (RT) paradigm by varying
   distractor ratios within an array of fixed size. For trials in which the
   target was present in the array, RT functions were roughly symmetric,
   the shortest RTs being for extreme distractor ratios, and the longest
   RTs being for arrays in which there were an equal number of each
   distractor type. This result is superficially consistent with Zohary and
   Hochstein's interpretation that subjects search for only one distractor
   type and are able to switch search strategy from trial to trial.
   However, negative-trial data from experiment 1 cast doubt on this
   interpretation. In experiment 2 the possible role of `pop out' and of
   distractor grouping in visual conjunction search is investigated.
   Results of experiment 2 suggest that grouping may play a more important
   role than does distractor ratio, and point to the importance of the
   spatial layout of the target and of the distractor elements in visual
   conjunction search. Results of experiment 2 also provide clear evidence
   that groups of spatially adjacent homogeneous elements may be processed
   as a unit.}},

Abstract = {{MATERIALS that expand in the transverse direction under uniaxial

   nature of this behaviour, nu < 0 has been observed for some anisotropic
   crystals 1 and materials comprised of fibrous networks 2,3, when loaded

   Materials of this sort are expected to have interesting mechanical
   properties, such as high energy absorption and fracture resistance,

Abstract = {{The Donnan osmotic pressure of a solution containing charged colloidal
   entities is divided into electrostatic and non-electrostatic
   contributions. The expression adopted for the former contribution is
   obtained from a general thermodynamic treatment of the diffuse double
   layer. Expressions are derived which allow for specific binding and
   which also provide a definition of amounts bound electrostatically. When
   the approximation is made that the electrostatic binding of indifferent
   coions-GAMMA-coions is negligible the equations which result have the
   same form as those that apply to non-interacting uncharged systems and
   can be handled in the same way. The treatment provides a basis for a
   successful but somewhat arbitrary approach developed previously. In
   particular an expression for the activity coefficient of unbound
   counterions and coions is justified. The prediction (based on the
   application of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation to cell models) that
   GAMMA-coions is negative is contradicted by work concerning the
   significance of single ionic chemical potentials.}},

Abstract = {{The transmission and current-voltage characteristics of Ga1-xAlxAs
   superlattice electron-wave quantum-interference filter/emitter negative
   differential resistance devices are analyzed with and without the
   self-consistency requirement. The analysis neglects the scattering
   effects within the superlattice since it is assumed that it is very thin
   (less than the electron coherence length). Thus, the calculated
   characteristics correspond to the ballistic component of the current.
   For the non-self-consistent calculation the single-band effective-mass
   time-independent Schroedinger equation is solved. For the
   self-consistent calculation, the Schroedinger and Poisson equations are
   solved iteratively until a self-consistent electron potential energy and
   electron density are obtained. It is shown that suitably designed
   electron-wave quantum-interference filter/emitters can exhibit strong
   negative differential resistance in the current-voltage characteristics,
   similar to those of resonant tunneling diodes. For low-to-moderate (2-30
   meV) Fermi energies in the conduction band of Ga1-xAlxAs (Si doping
   concentration less or equal to 2 x 10(18) cm-3) and temperatures near 30
   K (in the ballistic transport regime), it is shown that space-charge
   effects are relatively small and result in a slight shift of the
   current-voltage and transmission characteristics toward higher bias
   voltages. In a fashion similar to that occurring in resonant tunneling
   diodes, the self-consistent field in electron-wave filter/emitter
   negative differential resistance devices partially screens the positive
   applied bias. Designs of Ga1-xAlxAs resonant devices with current
   peak-to-valley ratios of approximately 50 as well as nonresonant (not
   exhibiting negative differential resistance) devices are analyzed. The
   corresponding electron charge density distributions are also presented.
   Superlattice electron-wave filter/emitter negative differential
   resistance devices can be used as high-speed switches, oscillators, and
   as monoenergetic emitters in electroluminescent devices and
   photodetectors.}},

Abstract = {{The White Mountain Batholith in central New Hampshire is a major
   plutonic, topographic and gravimetric feature, superimposed on the NE-SW
   trending regional pattern of accreted terranes in northeastern North
   America.  Compressional and shear-wave arrival times from a
   two-dimensional seismic array experiment are used to constrain a
   one-dimensional crustal velocity model and Moho topography for central
   New Hampshire.  Our deployment, a `'piggyback'' on the Ontario-New
   York-New England refraction experiment (ONYNEX), recorded 10 explosive
   sources using 20 three-component digital seismometers.  The crust can be
   modeled as 34.5 km thick, and with three layers having linear gradients
   without midcrust discontinuities.  For this model, P-velocities are
   6.1-6.2 km/s in the upper crust, and 6.2-6.8 km/s in the lower crust. 
   S-velocities are 3.5-3.7 km/s in the upper crust, and 3.7-3.9 km/s in
   the lower crust.  Because Moho reflections comprise our principal
   constraints on lower-crustal velocities, there is a tradeoff between
   lower-crustal velocity and crustal thickness.  In particular, an average
   crustal thickness of 39-40 km, reported elsewhere in New England, is not
   precluded by our data.  The Poisson's ratio for the crust varies between
   0.23-0.26, in the lower range of values reported for crustal minerals. 
   Our dataset is consistent with less-than-or-similar-to 2\% lateral
   variation in the upper crust underlying the New Hampshire and White
   Mountain Plutonic Series, but larger variations deeper than 15 km.  If
   modeled in terms of Moho topography, PmP traveltime residuals and PmP -
   P residuals suggest thicker crust (36-37 km) under the White Mountain
   batholith, with thinner crust (33-34 km) to the east and southwest of
   the White Mountains.  Such topography of the Moho correlates well with
   both the surface elevation and the Bouguer gravity anomaly in the
   region.  Gravity data do not favor the simplest alternative model:  a
   thick low-velocity granitic lower crust beneath the batholith.  Using a
   simplified density model, roughly 30-35\% of the gravity anomaly in the
   White Mountain region can be modeled as the result of the inferred Moho
   depression, requiring only a 5 km low-density root for the White
   Mountain batholith.  The short wavelength of the Moho topography is
   consistent with a very low flexural rigidity for the lithosphere
   (almost-equal-to 10(21) Nt-m), suggesting that the plutons were intruded
   into a weak lithosphere.  A rapid transition from positive to negative
   PmP residuals falls along a line that parallels the onshore extension of
   the Kelvin Seamounts, and may correspond to the `'line of weakness''
   hypothesized by Sykes (1978) to have been tectonically active during the
   opening of the North Atlantic Ocean at 100-200 Ma.}},

Abstract = {{The Nastapoka Arc, on the east coast of Hudson Bay, is almost perfectly
   circular and closely follows the unconformable contact between Archean
   Superior province gneisses and shallowly seaward dipping early
   Proterozoic Nastapoka Group supracrustals.  Its form may be explained by
   flexing of the lithosphere due to loading by thrust sheets from the
   Trans-Hudson orogen to the west.  Such flexing produces a peripheral
   bulge east of the coast which should be reflected in a positive gravity
   anomaly there.  Gravity data averaged around the arc show such a
   positive anomaly, although its precise amplitude is uncertain because of
   local variation in the gravity field.  Lithospheric flexure of the arc
   due to loading can be modeled by superposition of disc-shaped loads
   centered on the arc.  For a lithospheric Young's modulus of 1.0 x 10(11)
   N m-2 and Poisson's ratio 0.25, the present geometry of the arc can be
   reproduced only by reducing the elastic thickness to 20 +/- 2 km.  The
   peripheral bulge predicted for the model yields a gravity anomaly very
   similar to that observed if it is fully imaged at the Moho.  The absence
   of a regional negative gravity anomaly over the arc, despite a great
   thickness of transported rocks present at its center, requires that the
   crust in the region was unusually thin before thrust emplacement.  The
   unusually low elastic thickness required for the model may reflect
   highly fractured crust.  Both features are consistent with the former
   presence of a rifted continental margin in the region, as predicted for
   many models of the Trans-Hudson orogen.}},

Abstract = {{It is rather natural in the context of semiclassical, or first-order
   quantum, corrections to general relativity to consider an effective
   theory in which the Lagrangian consists of the Hilbert-Einstein term,
   linear in curvature, and correction terms quadratic in curvature, with
   coefficients typically of the order of the Planck length squared.  Given
   such a candidate for a semiclassical theory, it is interesting to ask
   whether the simulated quantum effects can help reduce the strength of
   curvature near classical singularities, in particular, those found in
   the interior of black holes.  In this article, I shall examine the
   effects on the Schwarzschild singularity of a particular semiclassical
   model based on the Gauss-Bonnet quadratic combination, in a spacetime
   possessing more than four dimensions.  In this model, the field
   equations are nontrivial and consist of a system of second-order
   differential equations for the metric tensor (any other combination
   would yield fourth-order equations).  The results depend strongly on the
   overall sign of the quadratic term:  for positive coupling, as dictated
   by string theory, the singularity occurs sooner than in the classical
   description; for negative coupling, the model breaks down because the
   radius of the compactified space is forced to collapse to zero for some
   nonvanishing value of the radial coordinate.}},

Abstract = {{Poisson's ratio in materials is governed by the following aspects of the
   microstructure: the presence of rotational degrees of freedom,
   non-affine deformation kinematics, or anisotropic structure. Several
   structural models are examined. The non-affine kinematics are seen to be
   essential for the production of negative Poisson's ratios for isotropic
   materials containing central force linkages of positive stiffness.
   Non-central forces combined with pre-load can also give rise to a
   negative Poisson's ratio in isotropic materials. A chiral microstructure
   with non-central force interaction or non-affine deformation can also
   exhibit a negative Poisson's ratio. Toughness and damage resistance in
   these materials may be affected by the Poisson's ratio itself, as well
   as by generalized continuum aspects associated with the microstructure.}},

Abstract = {{A study of childhood malignancies in North Humberside for 1974-1986 has
   revealed significant spatial aggregations1.  Though no specific reason
   was found, certain geographical areas, tumour groups and putative risks
   were identified for further study.  One possible risk was a tin smelter
   to the west of Hull.  A new method of analysis (Stone's conditional
   Poisson maximum2,3) was used and showed some evidence of increased risk
   close to the smelter.  This was accounted for by the solid tumours
   (primarily central nervous system malignancies) and was not apparent for
   the leukaemias.
   The Poisson maximum method is a special case of isotonic regression; a
   more general isotonic regression method, also due to Stone, Maximum
   Likelihood Ratio (MLR), is also available, and for reasons described
   elsewhere4 we prefer the more general method.  The present study begins
   by applying this to the childhood data and then to data for
   corresponding adult disease (leukaemias and central nervous system
   tumours) in the same area and time period.  In both children and adults
   the results are negative for the leukaemias.  For the remaining tumour
   categories, there is a significant increase in risk close to the
   smelter, but it is not possible to identify any aspect of the smelter or
   features in its vicinity as causative.}},

Abstract = {{The static bulk and shear modulus of poly (N-isopropylacrylamide) /water
   gel (NIPA gel) have been obtained as a function of temperature by
   measuring the change of sample size induced by an applied tension.  It
   is deduced that the method gives the static elastic moduli of gels to a
   good approximation except just above the discontinuous transition
   temperature T(o), where the stress-induced shift of T(o) made the
   estimation of elastic strain impossible.  Two kinds of NIPA gels with
   different polymer concentration and crosslinking density were used as
   samples, of which one undergoes a discontinuous volume phase transition
   and the other a continuous one.  In both gels, the bulk modulus softens
   drastically towards the transition showing that the soft mode of this
   transition is a uniform and isotropic volume-deformation mode.  The
   shear modulus, on the other hand, shows only a small anomaly at the
   transition.  The anomaly exhibited by the Poisson's ratio sigma is quite
   peculiar, i.e., it becomes negative and approaches - 1 towards the
   critical point.  It is shown that the results can be explained fairly
   well on the basis of the Flory-type phenomenological theory extended to

Abstract = {{With the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and versatile primers that
   amplify the whole cytochrome b gene (approximately 1140 bp), we obtained
   17 complete gene sequences representing three orders of hoofed mammals
   (ungulates) and dolphins (cetaceans).  The fossil record of some
   ungulate lineages allowed estimation of the evolutionary rates for
   various components of the cytochrome b DNA and amino acid sequences. 
   The relative rates of substitution at first, second, and third positions
   within codons are in the ratio 10 to 1 to at least 33.  For deep
   divergences (> 5 million years) it appears that both replacements and
   silent transversions in this mitochondrial gene can be used for
   phylogenetic inference.  Phylogenetic findings include the association
   of (1) cetaceans, artiodactyls, and perissodactyls to the exclusion of
   elephants and humans, (2) pronghorn and fallow deer to the exclusion of
   bovids (i.e., cow, sheep, and goat), (3) sheep and goat to the exclusion
   of other pecorans (i.e., cow, giraffe, deer, and pronghorn), and (4)
   advanced ruminants to the exclusion of the chevrotain and other
   artiodactyls.  Comparisons of these cytochrome b sequences support
   current structure-function models for this membrane-spanning protein. 
   That part of the outer surface which includes the Q(o) redox center is
   more constrained than the remainder of the molecule, namely, the
   transmembrane segments and the surface that protrudes into the
   mitochondrial matrix.  Many of the amino acid replacements within the
   transmembrane segments are exchanges between hydrophobic residues
   (especially leucine, isoleucine, and valine).  Replacement changes at
   first and second positions of codons approximate a negative binomial
   distribution, similar to other protein-coding sequences.  At four-fold
   degenerate positions of codons, the nucleotide substitutions approximate
   a Poisson distribution, implying that the underlying mutational spectrum
   is random with respect to position.}},

Abstract = {{Polyriboadenylates of alkali metals were obtained from (1) K+-poly (A)
   (salts I) and (2) H+-poly (A) (salts II) by the ion-exchange method. The
   conductivity of these salts as well as of H+-poly (A) were studied.
   Salts I and II of the same counterion were shown to have significantly
   different conductivity coefficients (f) and polyion conductances
   (lambda-p(o)). The charge density parameter (xi) was 1.3 and 2.5,
   respectively, with lambda-p(o) equal to 44 and 83 ohm-1 cm2 mole-1 for
   poly (A)-I and poly (A)-II salts, respectively. This is credited to the
   difference in the conformations of corresponding polyions. The linear
   dependence of equivalent conductivity on the square root of polymer
   concentration (Kohlrausch coordinates), earlier obtained for DNA, is
   also satisfied for the studied polynucleotides. A comparison of the
   slopes of straight lines in Kohlrausch coordinates for poly (A), simple
   electrolytes, and for earlier studied polyribouridylic acid salts lends
   credence to the concepts, developed by a number of authors, that DNA can
   act as a ``buffer{''} against the ion-ion interaction in concentrated
   electrolyte solutions. Using the approximation that the polyion
   conductance is independent of the counterion nature, parameter f
   (agreeing in this case with Eisenberg parameter-phi) has been shown to
   decrease as the polynucleotide concentration is increased; the decrease
   is caused by the relaxation effect. The transference numbers of
   counterions, which have negative values in poly (A)-II solutions, grow
   with the increase in polymer concentration; the higher the xi, the more
   apparent is this increase. This is explained by the increase in the
   fraction of conductivity along the polyion chains ({''}surface{''}
   conductivity) with the growth of polyelectrolyte concentration.}},

Abstract = {{Continuum representations of micromechanical phenomena in structured
   materials are described, with emphasis on cellular solids.  These
   phenomena are interpreted in light of Cosserat elasticity, a generalized
   continuum theory which admits degrees of freedom not present in
   classical elasticity.  These are the rotation of points in the material,
   and a couple per unit area or couple stress.  Experimental work in this
   area is reviewed, and other interpretation schemes are discussed.  The
   applicability of Cosserat elasticity to cellular solids and fibrous
   composite materials is considered as is the application of related
   generalized continuum theories.  New experimental results are presented
   for foam materials with negative Poisson's ratios.}},

Abstract = {{Many mechanisms have been proposed to explain the piezoelectric response
   of poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF), but none of these are adequate to
   explain why d32 is so much less than d31. Although it has been suggested
   that this difference could relate to the anisotropy of Poisson's ratios,
   direct measurement of the latter show that this explanation is not
   correct. The other viable explanation is that there are changes in
   crystallinity under stress. This possibility is tested in the present
   investigation using broad-line nuclear magnetic resonance measurements
   to estimate the change in crystallinity when drawn oriented samples are
   subjected to a tensile stress applied parallel or perpendicular to the
   draw direction. The results show that the crystallinity increases for a
   stress applied parallel to the draw direction and decreases for a stress
   applied perpendicular to the draw direction. The crystallinity changes
   give a positive contribution to d31 and a negative contribution to d32,
   which can explain the relatively low figure for d32 compared with d31.}},

Abstract = {{We developed an algorithm for simulating the effects of potential bag
   limits.  The algorithm uses statistical distributions to model the
   frequency distribution of catch per trip.  The moment equations of the
   distribution are keyed to stock abundance and the coefficient of fishing
   mortality rate, which allow the model to reflect the dynamics of the
   fishery.  The catch with the bag limit is calculated by censoring the
   simulated distribution.  We establish the conditions under which
   compounded Poisson distributions, such as the negative binomial, can be
   expected to provide adequate models for the catch distributions of
   recreational fisheries.  We also discuss the assumptions that underlie
   the method of censoring catch-per-trip distributions, and, where
   appropriate, suggest alternative models.  An example is developed in
   which we use the negative binomial distribution to model catch per trip
   and the familiar exponential model to simulate the change in stock
   abundance due to fishing mortality.}},

Abstract = {{If a solid body is deformed along one direction, by a uniaxial applied
   stress for instance, then strains will also be induced in perpendicular
   directions.  The negative ratio of the induced strain to the applied
   strain is known as the Poisson ratio.  Analysis of the elasticity tensor
   relating stress and strain within a solid shows that if the induced
   strain is restricted, then a greater stress is required to produce the
   same strain; it appears stiffer.  Many biological materials with a
   mechanical function are subject to forces which are primarily uniaxial. 
   This mechanism appears to be used to maximize the uniaxial load-bearing
   properties of some of these materials.  Muscles are commonly surrounded
   by strong sheets of connective tissue which will constrain the lateral
   expansion of the muscle as it contracts.  This increases the stress in
   the muscle for a given strain, and hence the load it can support. 
   Similarly, cancellous bone is normally surrounded by a shell of much
   stronger compact bone and this effectively increases the stiffness of
   the cancellous bone without the penalty of increasing the mass, as would
   be the case if the same stiffening was produced by increasing the degree
   of calcification.  It also has important implications for the failure of
   bone, which is largely a function of strain rather than stress.}},

Volume = {{107}},

Pages = {{463-469}},
Abstract = {{Sea pens, particularly Pennatula aculeata Danielssen, are major
   components of the megafauna in the Gulf of Maine, USA.  A review of
   three separate collections (National Marine Fisheries Service, Woods
   Hole; University of Maine; Smithsonian Institution), as well as recent
   submersible and remotely operated vehicle survey work, have shown that
   this single species is fairly ubiquitous.  It is, however, more
   prevalent in the eastern part of the Gulf and is almost absent from
   Wilkinson Basin in the west.  The spatial distribution of sea pens was
   photographically documented on four submersible dive transects in the
   eastern and central Gulf of Maine in 1983.  The degree of contagion of
   sea pen populations was evaluated using the variance-to-mean ratio and
   Morisita's index of dispersion.  In all cases these indices were > 1,
   suggesting a contagious distribution.  Both Poisson and negative
   binomial probability distributions were fitted to the data.  The
   negative binomial was the best descriptor of the distributions on three
   transects.  On one transect, neither distributional model had a
   significant fit at the 5\% level.  The effect of quadrat size (7, 3, and
   1.24 m2).  The pattern for the smallest quadrat size showed a
   significant fit to both Poisson and negative binomial distributions,
   while the Poisson distribution did not fit the data for the larger
   quadrats.  The density of sea pens in individual photographs varied from
   0 to 8 m-2 in Georges Basin, but density estimates were slightly
   confounded by the ability of sea pens to withdraw into their burrows,
   completely below the sediment surface.  Behavioral observations in situ
   on Jeffreys Bank in 1986 were made using a manned submersible to observe
   the withdrawal and extension of specified sea pens.  Seventeen sea pens
   were monitored on five dives over 24 h; two specimens withdrew
   completely, and another individual extended from a fully withdrawn
   position.  During the observation period, 88\% of the sea pens remained
   fully extended.}},
