Abstract = {{The discrete meso-scale model developed for simulation of concrete
   behavior with geometry based on Voronoi tessellation is studied. It is
   shown that the model exhibits geometrical bias in a boundary region due
   to modification of the tessellation when the boundary is present. The
   geometrical bias the the boundary layer further influences elastic and
   inelastic model behavior. The boundary layer effects are analyzed by
   simulating concrete prisms under tension (in elastic regime) and
   three-point bending (in inelastic regime). The results demonstrate that
   the the boundary layer becomes stiffer for positive and more compliant
   for negative Poisson's ratio. In inelastic regime, the boundary layer is
   weaker and less ductile compared to the interior of the domain.}},

Abstract = {{Linear actuation is a basic need in robotized manipulation of surgical
   instruments, that must comply with a challenging environment in terms of
   safety, compactness and now often compatibility with imaging modalities
   like CT or MRI. In this paper, we focus on needle manipulation for
   interventional radiology. We propose a needle driver, i.e. a linear
   actuator for needle insertion, based on the inchworm principle combined
   with pneumatic energy. Our first contribution is to propose, model and
   implement the device using a so-called auxetic structure. Its use
   increases achievable displacement under pressure and provides sufficient
   off-axis stiffness to use the actuator without additional guidance.
   Simplified modeling is introduced for the actuator synthesis. Our second
   contribution is to implement the actuator with multimaterial additive
   manufacturing combining rigid and flexible materials to increase
   compactness. As a third contribution, initial assessment of component
   sterilization and compatibility with X-ray and MRI imaging modalities is
   presented.}},

   associated with origami folding, and modal analysis off the flat state
   enables access to the many bifurcating branches of folding. Here,

Abstract = {{Engineers have vested interested in auxetic materials because of their
   negative Poisson's ratio. These materials undergo perpendicular
   expansion under tension. Meanwhile, auxetic textiles that has both
   flexibility and negative Poisson's ratio have great potential in future
   functional materials. In this paper, different flexible re-entrant
   honeycomb structures are manufactured using 3D printing technology. The
   shape change processes were also investigated. The re-entrant honeycomb
   structures exhibits negative Poisson's ratio immediately when stretched.
   The shape change consists of three stages in X1-direction, the same as
   that in X2-direction. A noticeable discovery was that the shape change
   in the X1-direction posed an out-plane change after the first shape
   change stage, while the shape change in X2-direction always remained
   in-plane throughout the entire tension process. The Young's moduli were
   also tested and were consistent with the tendency of the previous works'
   theoretical analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Soft actuators with auxetic, or negative Poisson's ratio (NPR), behavior
   offer a way to create soft robots with novel kinematic behavior. This
   paper presents an original framework for reinforcement of a soft
   actuator using a generalized NPR element, called a Representative
   Auxetic Element (RAE), and an experimental validation of the kinematic
   behavior that it enables. We build a generalized kinematic model that
   enables the design of RAE-patterned actuators and reveal the distinct
   auxetic behavior of RAE actuators with comparable model accuracy to the
   legacy McKibben actuators. A simple, reproducible way of designing and
   fabricating RAE actuators is described and varied prototypes are shown.
   This RAE-based design scheme can be used to create actuators with
   specified kinematics like bending, extension, and radial expansion,
   which can also vary across the actuator's surface both circumferentially
   and axially in a tractable, scalable manner.}},

Abstract = {{We develop a systematic approach, based on convex programming and real
   analysis, for obtaining upper bounds on the capacity of the binary
   deletion channel and, more generally, channels with i.i.d. insertions
   and deletions. Other than the classical deletion channel, we give a
   special attention to the Poisson-repeat channel introduced by
   Mitzenmacher and Drinea (IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, 2006).
   Our framework can be applied to obtain capacity upper bounds for any
   repetition distribution (the deletion and Poisson repeat channels
   corresponding to the special cases of Bernoulli and Poisson
   distributions). Our techniques essentially reduce the task of proving
   capacity upper bounds to maximizing a univariate, real valued, and often
   concave function over a bounded interval. The corresponding univariate
   function is carefully designed according to the underlying distribution
   of repetitions and the choices vary depending on the desired strength of
   the upper bounds as well as the desired simplicity of the function
   (e.g., being only efficiently computable versus having an explicit
   closed-form expression in terms of elementary, or common special,
   functions).
   Among our results, we show that the capacity of the binary deletion
   channel with deletion probability d is at most (1 - d) log phi for d >=
   1/2, and, assuming the capacity function is convex, is at most 1 - d
   log(4/(phi) ford < 1/2, where rp = (1 + root 5)/2 is the golden ratio.
   This is the first nontrivial capacity upper bound for any value of d
   outside the limiting case d > 0 that is fully explicit and proved
   without computer assistance.
   Furthermore, we derive the first set of capacity upper bounds for the
   Poisson-repeat channel. Our results uncover further striking connections
   between this channel and the deletion channel, and suggest, somewhat
   counter-intuitively, that the Poisson-repeat channel is actually
   analytically simpler than the deletion channel and may be of key
   importance to a complete understanding of the deletion channel.
   Finally, we derive several novel upper bounds on the capacity of the
   deletion channel. All upper bounds are maximums of efficiently
   computable, and concave, univariate real functions over a bounded
   domain. In turn, we upper bound these functions in terms of explicit
   elementary and standard special functions, whose maximums can be found
   even more efficiently (and sometimes, analytically, for example for d =
   1/2).
   Along the way, we develop several new techniques of potentially
   independent interest. For example, we develop systematic techniques to
   study channels with mean constraints over the reals. Furthermore, we
   motivate the study of novel probability distributions over non-negative
   integers as well as novel special functions which could be of interest
   to mathematical analysis.}},

Abstract = {{The continuous development of sport technologies constantly demands
   advancements in protective headgear to reduce the risk of head injuries.
   This article introduces new cellular helmet liner designs through two
   approaches. The first approach is the study of energy-absorbing
   biological materials. The second approach is the study of lattices
   comprised of force-diverting compliant mechanisms. On the one hand,
   bio-inspired liners are generated through the study of biological,
   hierarchical materials. An emphasis is given on structures in nature
   that serve similar concussion-reducing functions as a helmet liner.
   Inspiration is drawn from organic and skeletal structures. On the other
   hand, compliant mechanism lattice (CML)-based liners use topology
   optimization to synthesize rubber cellular unit cells with effective
   positive and negative Poisson's ratios. Three lattices are designed
   using different cellular unit cell arrangements, namely, all positive,
   all negative, and alternating effective Poisson's ratios. The proposed
   cellular (bio-inspired and CML-based) liners are embedded between two
   polycarbonate shells, thereby, replacing the traditional expanded

   random variation can be described using the autocorrelation function.
   Autocorrelation functions have been derived here for infinitely long
   polymers consisting of independent and identically distributed
   alternating geometric, negative binomial or Poisson-distributed blocks.
   The Poisson-distributed case represents the ideal case of a perfectly

Abstract = {{Based on lightweight design concepts, lattices are increasingly

   of periodically constructed lattices to characterize their behaviour
   under different loadings considering various material models. A
   thermo-mechanical analysis was done, which is resulting in negative
   CLTE-values (Coefficient of Linear Thermal Expansion). Simulations with
   linear-elastic behaviour were evaluated regarding the tensile,
   compression and shear modulus and the Poisson's ratio. Some of the
   investigated structures behave auxetic. Beside the linear elastic
   behaviour, also the hyper-elastic and visco-elastic behaviour of some
   structures were investigated. Furthermore, elasto-plastic simulations
   were performed where the applied loading was biaxial. As a result the
   initial yield surfaces were presented. The individual RVEs
   (Representative Volume Elements) can be utilized for different areas of
   application dependent on the used materials.}},

Abstract = {{The shock responses of three kinds of honeycomb cores have been
   investigated and analyzed based on explicit dynamics analysis. According
   to the real geometric configuration and the current main manufacturing
   methods of aluminum alloy honeycomb cores, the finite element models of
   honeycomb cores with three different cellular configurations
   (conventional hexagon honeycomb core, rectangle honeycomb core and
   auxetic honeycomb core with negative Poisson's ratio) have been
   established through FEM parametric modeling method based on Python and
   Abaqus. In order to highlight the impact response characteristics of the
   above three honeycomb cores, a 5 mm thick panel with the same mass and
   material was taken as contrast. The analysis results showed that the
   peak values of longitudinal acceleration history curves of the three
   honeycomb cores were lower than those of the aluminum alloy panel in all
   three reference points under the loading of a longitudinal pulse
   pressure load with the peak value of 1 MPa and the pulse width of 1 mu
   s. It could be concluded that due to the complex reflection and
   diffraction of stress wave induced by shock in honeycomb structures, the
   impact energy was redistributed which led to a decrease in the peak
   values of the longitudinal acceleration at the measuring points of
   honeycomb cores relative to the panel.}},

Abstract = {{Lattice truss cores are used to reduce the mass and increase the
   strength of sandwich boards. These panels are typically manufactured
   from metal or carbon composites. As a rule, they do not exhibit auxetic
   properties. Auxetic structures have several extraordinary mechanical
   properties. The aim of this study was to manufacture lattice auxetic
   cores from a biodegradable material and determine their elastic
   properties. The structures were produced from LayWood Olive, a composite
   containing polylactic acid and 40\% wood dust. The cores had comparable
   relative densities, but their geometry and number of cells differed. As
   a result of uniaxial compression in individual lattice truss cores, it
   was shown that the cores whose cells were square in the top view were
   isotropic. In contrast, cores with rectangular cells were strongly
   orthotropic. Moreover, the Poisson's ratio changed depending on the cell
   size and rib angle. Among the cores that exhibited isotropic properties,
   the lowest Poisson's ratio and modulus of elasticity were recorded for
   the structure composed of 49 cells with ribs that were 2 mm thick. The
   highest Poisson's ratio and modulus of linear elasticity were found with
   the orthotropic structure composed of 15 cells with ribs that were 3 mm
   thick. This paper was based on numerical calculations that were verified
   by experimental studies.}},

Abstract = {{Evidence supports vancomycin therapeutic-drug monitoring by area under
   the concentration-time curve (AUC), but data to establish an AUC upper
   limit are limited and published nephrotoxicity thresholds range widely.
   The objective of this analysis was to examine the association between
   initial vancomycin AUC and nephrotoxicity. This was a multicenter,
   retrospective cohort study of adult patients receiving intravenous
   vancomycin from 2014 to 2015. Nephrotoxicity was defined as a serum
   creatinine increase of 0.5 mg/liter and 50\% from baseline on
   consecutive measurements. Vancomycin exposure profile during the initial
   48 h of therapy was estimated using maximum a posteriori probability
   Bayesian estimation. Vancomycin AUC and minimum-concentration (C-min)
   thresholds most strongly associated with nephrotoxicity were identified
   via classification and regression tree (CART) analysis. Predictive
   performances of CART-derived and other candidate AUC thresholds was
   assessed through positive and negative predictive value and receiver
   operating characteristic curves. Poisson regression was used to quantify
   the association between exposure thresholds and nephrotoxicity while
   adjusting for confounders. Among 323 patients included, nephrotoxicity
   was significantly higher in patients with AUCs from 0 to 48 h
   (AUC(0-48)) of >= 1,218 mg . h/liter, AUC(0-24) of >= 677 mg . h/liter,
   AUC(24-48) of >= 683 mg . h/liter, and day 1 C-min (C-min24) of >= 18.8
   mg/liter. Vancomycin exposure in excess of these thresholds was
   associated with a 3-to 4-fold-increased risk of nephrotoxicity in
   Poisson regression. The predictive performance of AUC for nephrotoxicity
   was maximized at daily AUC values between 600 and 800 mg . h/liter.
   Although these data support an AUC range for vancomycin-associated
   nephrotoxity rather than a single threshold, available evidence suggests
   that a daily AUC limit of 700 mg . h/liter is reasonable.}},

Abstract = {{We study a phase-field variational model for the solvation of charged
   molecules with an implicit solvent. The solvation free-energy functional
   of all phase fields consists of the surface energy, solute excluded
   volume and solute-solvent van der Waals dispersion energy, and
   electrostatic free energy. The surface energy is defined by the van der
   Waals-Cahn-Hilliard functional with squared gradient and a double-well
   potential. The electrostatic part of free energy is defined through the
   electrostatic potential governed by the Poisson-Boltzmann equation in
   which the dielectric coefficient is defined through the underlying phase
   field. We prove the continuity of the electrostatics-its potential, free
   energy, and dielectric boundary force-with respect to the perturbation
   of the dielectric boundary. We also prove the -convergence of the
   phase-field free-energy functionals to their sharp-interface limit, and
   the equivalence of the convergence of total free energies to that of all
   individual parts of free energy. We finally prove the convergence of
   phase-field forces to their sharp-interface limit. Such forces are
   defined as the negative first variations of the free-energy functional;
   and arise from stress tensors. In particular, we obtain the force
   convergence for the van der Waals-Cahn-Hilliard functionals with minimal
   assumptions.}},

Title = {{Pore-scale modeling of chloride ion diffusion in cement microstructures}},
Journal = {{CEMENT \& CONCRETE COMPOSITES}},

Volume = {{85}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Understanding the mechanism of chloride ion diffusion in cement is
   significant to improve the reliability of offshore reinforced concrete
   structures. The chloride ionic diffusivity in cement-based
   microstructures is predicted by pore-scale modeling using a modified
   lattice Boltzmann method. Both the Nernst-Planck equation for ion
   diffusion and the Poisson equation for electrodynamic effect are fully
   solved. The predicted effective diffusivities in cement-based
   microstructures with different porosities are in good agreements with
   the experiment data. The results show that the pore size distribution
   and Zeta potential of cement-based microstructures directly influence
   the effective diffusivities of chloride ions. The cement-based
   microstructure with smaller pore size and higher negative Zeta potential
   hinders chloride ions corrosion more effectively. The electrokinetic
   effect on the chloride ionic transport is negligible when the ratio of
   the maximum-probability pore size and the Debye length is higher than 32
   in the cement-based microstructure. For engineering applications, we
   provide a predictive and easy-to-use formula by up-scaling to correlate
   the effective chloride ion diffusivity with electrokinetic effect in
   cement paste. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Equivalent sandwich panels composed of auxetic and conventional
   honeycomb cores and metal facets are analysed and compared for their
   resistance performances against impulsive loadings. The dynamic
   behaviours of these structures are numerically investigated, taking into
   account the rate-dependent effects. The Johnson-Cook model is employed
   to describe the dynamic responses of the composite sandwiches subjected
   to high strain-rate loadings. Analytical models are derived correlating
   unit cell geometrical parameters and crushing strengths of the
   representative panels at different impact velocities. Parametric studies
   are conducted to evaluate the performances of different sandwich panel
   designs under impulsive loadings. In particular, transmitted reaction
   forces and maximum stresses on the protected structure are quantified
   for various design parameters including the geometrical factors and the
   effective Poisson's ratios. A quarter of the panel is symmetrically
   modelled with shell elements and the CONWEP model is used to simulate
   the blast loading. Auxetic panels demonstrate interesting crushing
   behaviour, effectively adapting to the dynamic loading by progressively
   drawing material into the locally loaded zone to thereby enhance the
   impact resistance. Meanwhile, conventional honeycomb panels deform
   plastically without localised stiffness enhancement. (C) 2017 Elsevier

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{328}},
Pages = {{340-364}},

Abstract = {{The application of auxetic composites in practice often relies on a
   compromise between properties as auxetics are mostly too porous (not
   dense enough or not stiff enough) to bear structural loads. Hence, the
   focus of this paper is topological design optimization of new
   functionally graded cellular composites with auxetics using a level set
   method. Firstly, a new hierarchical multiscale formulation is developed
   to account for both the auxetic behavior of the microstructure and the
   stiffness of the macrostructure. The composite, comprising multiple
   layers of periodic microstructures, is tailored to have functionally
   graded properties for stiffness and auxetic behaviors, subject to
   volumetric gradient constraints. Secondly, the microstructures
   underpinning composite layers are topologically designed under the
   consideration of boundary and loading conditions of the macrostructure.
   Finally, a level set method is applied to evolve the shape and topology
   of the microstructure for each layer, with the numerical homogenization
   method to evaluate the effective properties of the microstructures.
   Several numerical examples are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of
   the proposed method. It can be seen that such composites systematically
   gear together the features of the functionally graded materials,
   cellular composites, and metamaterials towards a new kind of man-made
   composites. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Most studies on composites assume that the constituent phases have
   different values of stiffness. Little attention has been paid to the
   effect of constituent phases having distinct Poisson's ratios. This
   research focuses on a concurrent optimization method for simultaneously
   designing composite structures and materials with distinct Poisson's
   ratios. The proposed method aims to minimize the mean compliance of the
   macrostructure with a given mass of base materials. In contrast to the
   traditional interpolation of the stiffness matrix through numerical
   results, an interpolation scheme of the Young's modulus and Poisson's
   ratio using different parameters is adopted. The numerical results
   demonstrate that the Poisson effect plays a key role in reducing the
   mean compliance of the final design. An important contribution of the
   present study is that the proposed concurrent optimization method can
   automatically distribute base materials with distinct Poisson's ratios
   between the macrostructural and microstructural levels under a single
   constraint of the total mass.}},

Abstract = {{Structural, electronic, elastic and piezoelectric properties of pure
   phosphorene under in-plane strain are investigated using
   first-principles calculations based on density functional theory. The
   two critical yielding points are determined along armchair and zigzag
   directions. It is shown that the buckling, the band gap and the charge
   transfer can be controlled under strains. A semiconductor to metallic
   transition is observed in metastable region. Polar plots of Young's
   modulus, Poisson ratio, sound velocities and Debye temperature exhibit
   evident anisotropic feature of phosphorene and indicate auxetic behavior
   for some angles theta. Our calculations show also that phosphorene has
   both in-plane and out-of-plane piezoelectric responses comparable to
   known 2D materials. The findings of this work reveal the great potential
   of pure phosphorene in nanomechanical applications.}},

Pages = {{596-602}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic materials refer to materials that exhibit a negative Poisson's
   ratio. They behave directly opposite to conventional materials by
   becoming wider when stretched and narrower when compressed. The unique
   property of this group of materials has led to them gaining a wider
   range of applications. This paper presents a study on the use of a
   flatbed knitting machine to fabricate and experiment on an arrow-headed
   auxetic tubular fabric. The study used three kinds of yarns: nylon (PA),
   PES, and cotton as the materials for knitting the tubular samples. Three
   variations of an arrow-head design (4x4, 6x6, and 8x8) were also used as
   the three main structural patterns. The results reveal that the 6x6'
   structure gives the best auxetic effect among the three and the nylon
   (PA) yarn had the best auxeticity.}},

Abstract = {{Rationally designed meta-biomaterials present unprecedented combinations
   of mechanical, mass transport, and biological properties favorable for
   tissue regeneration. Here we introduce hybrid meta-biomaterials with
   rationally-distributed values of negative (auxetic) and positive
   Poisson's ratios, and use them to design meta-implants that unlike
   conventional implants do not retract from the bone under biomechanical
   loading. We rationally design and additively manufacture six different
   types of meta-biomaterials (three auxetic and three conventional), which
   then serve as the parent materials to six hybrid meta-biomaterials (with
   or without transitional regions). Both single and hybrid
   meta-biomaterials are mechanically tested to reveal their full-field
   strain distribution by digital image correlation. The best-performing
   hybrid meta-biomaterials are then selected for the design of
   meta-implants (hip stems), which are tested under simulated-implantation
   conditions. Full-field strain measurements clearly show that, under
   biomechanical loading, hybrid meta-implants press onto the bone on both
   the medial and lateral sides, thereby improving implant-bone contact and
   potentially implant longevity.}},

Abstract = {{The microstructure of wood is highly anisotropic, which suggests that
   this material could exhibit unusual elastic properties. A few studies
   have suggested the possibility of auxeticity, or negative Poisson's
   ratio (NPR) in some wood samples. In order to conclusively confirm that
   wood does show NPR, we have used a combination of geometric modelling,
   finite element analysis (FEA) and off-axis compression testing. The
   geometric model indicates that idealised thin-walled wood cell
   structures should generate NPR of -1, FEA suggests that more realistic
   cell arrays can attain NPR, to -0.27, and compression tests show that
   some NPR - to -0.74 - remains in real wood samples. These results could
   help design ``engineeredwood{''} laminates products with tailored
   elastic properties. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The architecture of mechanical metamaterials is designed to harness
   geometry(1-6), nonlinearity(7-11) and topology(11-15) to obtain advanced
   functionalities such as shape morphing(7,9,16-21),
   programmability(18,22,23) and one-way propagation(11,13,14). Although a
   purely geometric framework successfully captures the physics of small
   systems under idealized conditions, large systems or heterogeneous
   driving conditions remain essentially unexplored. Here we uncover strong
   anomalies in the mechanics of a broad class of metamaterials, such as
   auxetics(2,5,24), shape changers(16-21) or topological
   insulators(11-13,15); a non-monotonic variation of their stiffness with
   system size, and the ability of textured boundaries to completely alter
   their properties. These striking features stem from the competition
   between rotation-based deformations-relevant for small systems-and
   ordinary elasticity, and are controlled by a characteristic length scale
   which is entirely tunable by the architectural details. Our study
   provides new vistas for designing, controlling and programming the
   mechanics of metamaterials.}},

Abstract = {{Objective
   To identify the main dietary patterns in type 2 diabetes patients and
   study their association with glycemic indexes.
   Methods
   This is a cross-sectional study carried out in a diabetes treatment
   reference institution located in the city of Fortaleza (CE). Two R24h
   were applied, as well as 12h fast blood glucose tests and anthropometric
   assessments in 188 diabetic patients. The principal components factor
   analysis method was applied together with a Varimax orthogonal rotation
   method to identify dietary patterns. The Poisson Regression and the
   Spearman coefficient were used to test the association with glycemic
   indexes.
   Results
   A hundred eighty eight diabetic patients were evaluated, of which 51.1\%
   patients had decompensated glucose values. Five main dietary patterns
   were identified: traditional Brazilian, energy-dense, infusion and
   wholegrain cereal, sandwich and dairy, and healthy diets, which
   explained 37.2\% of the total variance in intake. A negative correlation
   with glucose was found for the traditional Brazilian diet (p=0.018;
   r=-0.173).
   Conclusion
   Out of the five identified dietary patterns consumed by the type 2
   diabetes patients studied, a higher adherence to the traditional
   Brazilian dietary patterns resulted in lower blood glucose levels.}},

Title = {{Cost-related underuse of medications in older adults: ELSI-Brazil}},
Journal = {{REVISTA DE SAUDE PUBLICA}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{52}},
Number = {{2}},
Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence and factors associated with
   cost-related underuse of medications in a nationally representative
   sample of Brazilians aged 50 years and over.
   METHODS: Among the 9,412 participants of the Brazilian Longitudinal
   Study of Aging (ELSI-Brazil), 6,014 reported using at least one
   medication on regular basis and were included in the analysis. Underuse
   of medications was by stopping taking or reducing the number of tablets
   or the dose of any prescribed medication for financial reasons. The
   theoretical framework used for the selection of the exploratory
   variables included predisposing factors, enabling factors, and factors
   of need. Associations were tested by Poisson regression.
   RESULTS: The prevalence of underuse of medications was 10.6\%. After
   adjustments for relevant covariables, positive and statistically
   significant associations (p < 0.05) with the outcome were found for
   females {[}prevalence ratio (PR) = 1.39], sufficiency of the family
   income for expenses (PR = 1.74 for sometimes and PR 2.42 for never),
   frequency with which the physician explains about the disease and
   treatment (PR = 1.31 for rarely or never), number of medications used
   (PR = 1.39 for 2-4 and 1.53 for 5 or more), fair (PR = 2.02) and poor or
   very poor self-rated health (PR = 2.92), and a previous medical
   diagnosis of depression (PR = 1.69). Negative associations were observed
   for the age groups of 60-79 years (PR = 0.75) and 80 years and over (PR
   = 0.43), socioeconomic status of the household (PR = 0.70, 0.79, and
   0.60 for the second, third, and fourth quartile, respectively), and
   private health plan coverage (PR = 0.79). There were no associations
   between hypertension and self-reported diabetes and underuse of
   medications.
   CONCLUSIONS: Cost-related underuse of medications is multidimensional
   and complex, and it covers socio-demographic characteristics, health
   conditions, and the use of health services. The explanation about the
   disease and its treatment to the patient and the expansion of the
   universal access to pharmaceutical care can minimize the risks of
   underuse.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To describe the prevalence of receipt of pensions and
   associated factors in a nationally representative sample of the
   Brazilian population aged 50 years and over.
   METHODS: We used data from 9,130 participants from the Brazilian
   Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSI-Brazil) baseline survey. The outcome
   variable was receipt of pensions from any source. The exploratory
   variables were age, gender, residence by region and by urban/rural area,
   household arrangements, schooling, household assets, perception of
   income sufficiency, age when started working, number of chronic
   diseases, and functional limitation. The analyses were based on the
   Poisson and binary logistic regressions.
   RESULTS: The prevalence of the receipt of pension was 54.3\%. In the
   multivariate analysis, the following factors showed statistically
   significant (p < 0.05) associations with the outcome: age {[}Prevalence
   Ratio (PR) = 2.59 and 3.24 for 60-69 and 70 years], rural residence (PR
   = 1.23), residence in the Northeast, South and Southeast compared to the
   North (PR ranging from 1.18 to 1.23), living arrangements (PR = 1.07 and
   1.15 for living with one person and living alone), perception of income
   sufficiency (PR = 1.08 and 1.15 for sometimes and always), functional
   limitation (PR = 1.13) and having 1 and >= 2 chronic diseases (PR = 1,09
   and 1,17). Negative association was observed for 5-8 years of education.
   No association between age when the individual started working and the
   outcome was observed. Younger participants (50-59 years old) with >= 2
   diseases or functional limitation were 31\% and 63\% more likely to
   receive pensions, respectively; the strength of these associations
   declined with age.
   CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that health conditions are important
   determinants of early retirement. Discussions to increase age to the
   retirement cannot be separated from those on improvements in the health
   conditions of the Brazilian population.}},

Title = {{Life course and work ability among older adults: ELSI-Brazil}},

Number = {{2}},
Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To examine factors associated with perception of work ability
   in a nationally representative sample of Brazilians aged 50 years and
   over.
   METHODS: We used data from 8,903 participants of the baseline survey of
   the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSI-Brazil). The dependent
   variable was self-rated work ability (good or very good versus fair,
   poor, or very poor). Independent variables included factors that operate
   at the beginning, middle, and current stage of life. Multivariate
   analysis was based on prevalence ratios (PR) and 95\% confidence
   intervals (95\% CI) estimated by Poisson regression.
   RESULTS: Good work ability was reported by 49\% of \textbackslash{}
   participants (49.4\% among men and 48.6\% among women). Results of the
   multivariate analysis showed that, for both men and women, good work
   ability showed positive and statistically significant associations (p <
   0.05) with good health up to 15 years of age (PR = 1.22 and 1.18,
   respectively), educational level >= 8 years (PR = 1.19 and 1.21,
   respectively), and current good self-rated health (PR = 1.88 and 1.94,
   respectively). Negative associations were observed for current age (PR =
   0.99 for each increase of one year among men and women), medical
   diagnosis of depression (PR = 0.70 for men and PR = 0.87 for women), and
   having one or more at least chronic diseases (PR = 0.88 for men and 0.91
   for women). Only for men, positive associations for the age at which
   they started working (PR = 1.14 and 1.12 for 11-17 and = 18 years,
   respectively) and living with a spouse (PR = 1.09) were found.
   CONCLUSIONS: Work ability in older ages is built over the life course,
   particularly by the health conditions in childhood and adolescence, age
   at which men begin working, educational level, and health conditions in
   older ages. Policies aimed at increasing longevity in the labor market
   must take these factors into account.}},

Title = {{Global minimum beryllium hydride sheet with novel negative Poisson's
   ratio: first-principles calculations}},
Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},

Abstract = {{As one of the most prominent metal-hydrides, beryllium hydride has
   received much attention over the past several decades, since 1978, and
   is considered as an important hydrogen storage material. By reducing the
   dimensionality from 3 to 2, the beryllium hydride monolayer is
   isoelectronic with graphene; thus the existence of its two-dimensional
   (2D) form is theoretically feasible and experimentally expected.
   However, little is known about its 2D form. In this work, by a global
   minimum search with the particle swarm optimization method via density
   functional theory computations, we predicted two new stable structures
   for the beryllium hydride sheets, named -BeH2 and -BeH2 monolayers. Both
   structures have more favorable thermodynamic stability than the recently
   reported planar square form (Nanoscale, 2017, 9, 8740), due to the
   forming of multicenter delocalized Be-H bonds. Utilizing the recently
   developed SSAdNDP method, we revealed that three-center-two-electron
   (3c-2e) delocalized Be-H bonds are formed in the -BeH2 monolayer, while
   for the -BeH2 monolayer, novel four-center-two-electron (4c-2e)
   delocalized bonds are observed in the 2D system for the first time.
   These unique multicenter chemical bonds endow both - and -BeH2 with high
   structural stabilities, which are further confirmed by the absence of
   imaginary modes in their phonon spectra, the favorable formation
   energies comparable to bulk and cluster beryllium hydride, and the high
   mechanical strength. These results indicate the potential for
   experimental synthesis. Furthermore, both - and -BeH2 are wide-bandgap
   semiconductors, in which the -BeH2 has unusual mechanical properties
   with a negative Poisson's ratio of -0.19. If synthesized, it would
   attract interest both in experiment and theory, and be a new member of
   the 2D family isoelectronic with graphene.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Men who have sex with men (MSM) have higher rates of
   substance use compared to men who have sex with women. Among MSM, drug
   use is linked to higher-risk sexual behavior and acquisition of HIV and
   other sexually transmitted infections. Objectives: We hypothesize that
   time since first acting on one's same sex attraction, or one's gay age,
   could be predictive of drug using behavior. Methods: We examined this
   question among 176 MSM, aged 18-35, presenting at a public sexual health
   clinic. Behavioral data were captured using interviewer- and
   self-administered surveys and clinical data were extracted from medical
   records. We used modified Poisson regression to examine associations
   between gay age and recent recreational drug use, and separately,
   between gay age and recent marijuana use. Results: In total, 43\% of
   participants reported recent marijuana use and 26\% of participants
   reported recent use of other drugs. The associations between gay age and
   marijuana use and other drug use varied by HIV status. After adjustment
   for biological age, race, and education, a one-year increase in gay age
   was associated with significantly increased drug use among HIV-negative
   men (adjusted prevalence ratio (aPR): 1.08; 95\% confidence interval
   (CI): 1.03-1.14), but we observed no association between gay age and
   drug use among HIV-positive men (aPR: 0.96, 95\% CI: 0.86-1.07). Gay age
   was not associated with marijuana use in HIV-negative (aPR: 1.00, 95\%
   CI: 0.95-1.04) or HIV-positive (aPR: 1.06, 95\% CI: 0.98-1.14) men.
   Conclusions: In summary, HIV-negative MSM who had experienced more time
   since first same-sex experience had significantly increased prevalence
   of recent drug use.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the variability of elastic characteristics (Young's
   modulus and Poisson's ratio) of hexagonal crystals has been studied.
   Analytic expressions for Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio are
   obtained. Stationary values for these elastic characteristics are found.
   Young's modulus has three stationary values, and Poisson's ratio has
   eight stationary values. Numerical analysis of these elastic
   characteristics for hexagonal crystals is given based on the
   experimental data from the Landolt-Bornstein handbook. Global extrema of
   Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio for hexagonal crystals are found.
   Crystals are found in which the maximum values exceeds the upper limit
   for isotropic materials.}},

Abstract = {{This chapter begins with a general discussion of the future needs for
   large space reflectors (lighter, larger, foldable), leading to the
   concept of adaptive thin polymer shell reflector. Next, a comparison
   between an adaptive plate covered with a layer of piezoelectric material
   and a similar spherical shell is conducted to point out the fundamental
   difference of behavior of a shell with double curvature (because of the
   large hoop stiffness). A multi-electrode spherical shell is considered,
   and the relationship between the surface figure error and the electrode
   size, the shell curvature and thickness is derived (for various Zernike
   modes). Then, the control of adaptive shell involving a very large
   number (thousands) of independent electrodes is examined and, based on
   Saint-Venant's principle, a hierarchical control approach is derived to
   solve the ill-conditioning of the Jacobian. Finally, petal
   configurations are considered as away to increase the controllability
   and improve the folding capability. The chapter concludes with a
   reference list.}},

Abstract = {{Equations for solving the deflection and bending moments of rhombic
   plates by exact method are known to be highly tedious. A set of
   simplified equations is developed for design purposes of such simply
   supported plates under uniform load. Curve-fitting from exact data
   allows the deflection and its second derivatives, evaluated at the plate
   centre, to be expressed in greatly simplified and yet sufficiently
   accurate empirical models for thin rhombic plates. Using the simplified
   model, it is shown that the maximum bending moment can be reduced by
   using auxetic materials. By including the effects of shear deformation
   for thick rhombic plates, it is demonstrated that the ratio of
   shear-to-bending deformation decreases as the rhombic plate approaches a
   square shape and as the plate's Poisson's ratio becomes more negative.}},

Abstract = {{During the sound transmission loss test in the standing-wave tube, the
   unavoidable reflected wave from the termination of downstream tube would
   affect the precision measurement of sound transmission loss(TL).
   However, it can be solved by defining the non-reflected boundary
   conditions when modeling based on the finite element method. Then, the
   model has been validated by comparing with the analytical method. Based
   on the present model, the sound insulation performance of two types of
   honeycomb-hole coatings have been analyzed and discussed. Moreover, the
   changes of parameters play an important role on the sound insulation
   performance of honeycomb-hole coating and the negative Poisson's ratio
   honeycomb-hole coating has better sound insulation performance at
   special frequencies. Finally, it is summarized that sound insulation
   performance is the result of various factors that include the impedance
   changes, the waveform transformation and so on.}},

Abstract = {{Dielectric elastomers are commonly implemented in adaptive structures
   due to their unique capabilities for real time control of a structure's
   shape, stiffness, and damping. These active polymers are often used in
   applications where actuator control or dynamic tunability are important,
   making an accurate understanding of the viscoelastic behavior critical.
   This challenge is complicated as these elastomers often operate over a
   broad range of deformation rates. Whereas research has demonstrated
   success in applying a nonlinear viscoelastic constitutive model to
   characterize the behavior of Very High Bond (VHB) 4910, robust
   predictions of the viscoelastic response over the entire range of time
   scales is still a significant challenge. An alternative formulation for
   viscoelastic modeling using fractional order calculus has shown
   significant improvement in predictive capabilities. While fractional
   calculus has been explored theoretically in the field of linear
   viscoelasticity, limited experimental validation and statistical
   evaluation of the underlying phenomena have been considered. In the
   present study, predictions across several orders of magnitude in
   deformation rates are validated against data using a single set of model
   parameters. Moreover, we illustrate the fractional order is material
   dependent by running complementary experiments and parameter estimation
   on the elastomer VHB 4949 as well as an auxetic foam. All results are
   statistically validated using Bayesian uncertainty methods to obtain
   posterior densities for the fractional order as well as the hyperelastic
   parameters.}},

Abstract = {{The emergence of additive manufacturing in combination with the
   advancement of engineering analysis tools has led to a new paradigm in
   the design of materials, in which the organization of matter and
   topology plays a central role. A new class of artificial materials has
   emerged that exhibit static and dynamic properties typically not
   encountered in natural materials and have been named as metamaterials.
   In the current work, we present recent advances made in the field,
   relating to both the static attributes and to the wave propagation
   characteristics of metamaterials under small and large strains. In
   particular, we present a class of anti-auxetic inner material
   architectures with positive and high Poissons ratio values which lead to
   metamaterials of controlled anisotropy. Thereupon, we study the
   influence of the degree of anisotropy on the wave propagation
   characteristics under small strains. Moreover, we analyze the effect of
   geometrical nonlinearities on the propagation of longitudinal and shear
   waves in two-dimensional hexagonal-shaped architectured lattices viewed
   as effective 1D and 2D media, while we showcase the potential of
   non-auxetic architectures to reach auxetic ones through a kinematic
   control in the large strains regime. What is more, we analyze the role
   of the considered nonlinearity in the nature of propagating waves,
   identifying strain thresholds beyond which both supersonic and subsonic
   modes emerge.}},

Abstract = {{Within nowadays research, when it comes to lightweight sandwich panels,
   periodic cellular structures are considered real trendsetters. One of
   the most used type of core in producing sandwich panels is the
   honeycomb. However, due to its relatively high manufacturing cost, this
   structure has limited applications; therefore, research has been earned
   out in order to develop alternative solutions. An example in this sense
   is the ExpaAsym cellular structure, developed at the Transilvania
   University of Brasov; it represents a periodic cellular structure
   manufactured through a mechanically expansion process of a previously
   cut and perforated sheet material. The relative density of the structure
   was proven to be significantly lower than the one of the honeycomb. This
   gives a great advantage to the structure, due to the fact that when the
   internal angle A of the unit cell is 60, after the mechanical expansion
   it results a hexagonal structure. The main objective of this paper is to
   estimate the in-plane Poisson ratios of the structure, in terms of its
   geometrical parameters. it is therefore analytically shown that for
   certain values of the geometric parameters, the in-plane Poisson ratios
   have negative values when the internal angle exceeds 90, which
   determines its auxetic behavior.}},

Abstract = {{The neotropical stink bug Euschistus heros is the predominant and most
   important insect pest affecting soybean cultivation. Knowledge of the
   spatial pattern of the pest in an area is critical to understanding its
   behavior. The objective of this work was to study the spatial
   distribution of E. heros in transgenic soybean cultivars of different
   maturing cycles. The experiments were conducted in the seasons 2013/14
   and 2014/15 in FCAV/UNESP, Jaboticabal, SP. Three fields were selected,
   and each was marked an area of 8.000 m(2) (0.8 ha), with each area
   divided into 80 portions of 100 m(2) (10 m x 10 m). The transgenic
   soybean cultivars of different maturing cycles were: SYN 1365 RR
   (early), M 7908 RR (average), and BRS Valiosa RR (late). Samples were
   taken weekly using a beat sheet, registering the number of nymphs and
   adults of E. heros. To study the dispersion of E. heros, the following
   indices were used: variance/mean ratio, Morisita index, Green
   coefficient, and the exponent k of the negative binomial distribution.
   For studies of special distribution models of E. heros, adjustments of
   Poisson distribution and negative binomial distribution were tested. The
   spatial distribution of nymphs and adults was aggregated for all the
   cultivars studied, indicating that cultivars did not alter the
   distribution behavior of E. heros.}},

Title = {{Theoretical and numerical investigation on in-plane impact performance
   of chiral honeycomb core structure}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY AND MAINTENANCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{95-105}},
Abstract = {{Honeycomb materials have been widely used as energy absorbers in
   structural impact protection and it can be tailored to shrink in the
   vicinity of impact zone, which contributes to better impact resistance.
   The chiral honeycomb is characterized by a non-intuitive negative
   in-plane Poisson's ratio (auxeticity), for the hexagonal chiral
   honeycomb, which exhibits a theoretic value of -1. However, the
   comprehensive study of the performance of chiral honeycomb under impact
   has not been studied to date. In this paper, firstly, the theoretical
   solution of yield stress for chiral honeycomb was obtained in terms of
   quasi-static loading. Thereafter, the in-plane dynamic crushing and
   energy-absorption capabilities of chiral honeycomb were studied
   numerically by means of finite element (FE) method. A comparative study
   between the chiral honeycomb and conventional hexagonal honeycomb was
   also performed to identify the advantages and disadvantages of the two
   materials. In addition, a parametric study was conducted to investigate
   the effects of geometric topologies and impact scenarios on the response
   of chiral honeycomb. The numerical results show that the performance of
   plastic energy dissipation of chiral honeycomb is dependent not only on
   structural parameters but also on crushing velocities. The present study
   is committed to providing an important reference to the application of
   chiral honeycomb in the crashworthiness design.}},

Abstract = {{The structural, elastic, electronic properties and Debye temperature of
   Ni3Ta under different pressures are investigated using the
   first-principles method based on density functional theory. Our
   calculated equilibrium lattice parameters at 0 GPa well agree with the
   experimental and previous theoretical results. The calculated negative
   formation enthalpies and elastic constants both indicate that Ni3Ta is
   stable under different pressures. The bulk modulus B, shear modulus G,
   Young's modulus E and Poisson's ratio are calculated by the
   Voigt-Reuss-Hill method. The bigger ratio of B/G indicates Ni3Ta is
   ductile and the pressure can improve the ductility of Ni3Ta. In
   addition, the results of density of states and the charge density
   difference show that the stability of Ni3Ta is improved by the
   increasing pressure. The Debye temperature Theta(D) calculated from
   elastic modulus increases along with the pressure.}},

Title = {{Regional Differences in Cancer Incidence Trend in Tehran, Iran: A
   Contextual Study on the Effect of Socioeconomic Status at Regional Level}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CANCER MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Background: Cancer is a major public health concern all over the world.
   The aim of the current study is to demonstrate changing trends of cancer
   incidence from 2006 to 2009 in Tehran (capital city of Iran) and
   evaluate the effect of living in different regions according to their
   median socioeconomic status (SES) on cancer cumulative incidence.
   Methods: The incident cases were obtained from the population based
   cancer register of ministry of health and medicine in Iran; we examined
   the annual percent changes (APCs) and overall trends of total cancer
   incidence across regions in Tehran. The age and sex standardized
   incidence rates were computed by the direct method. Poisson regression
   and negative binominal regression model were used to assess the
   existence of trends across 4 consecutive years, as well as the effect of
   living in each region, literacy rate, and employment rate across regions
   on this trend. All the analyses were done by Stata 12.0 software.
   Results: The findings of this study showed downward and nonlinear trend
   during 4 years. The age-standardized incidence rate (ASR) was higher in
   men compared to women in this period. ASRs for overall 4 years were 114
   and 101 per 10,0000 men and women, respectively. Average annual percent
   change based on ASR and regression model for each sex was the same and
   around -5\% and -6\%, respectively. Incidence rate also differed between
   districts so that north and center districts had higher incidence than
   southern parts in both sexes. The lowest rate ratio attributed to
   district 17 and 18 located in south of Tehran and the highest rate ratio
   attributed to district 6 for each sex compared to the baseline district
   16. Results reported the sharp increase of 59\% and 37\% in district 6
   compared to district 16 in men and women, respectively. Better regional
   social status increased the risk of cancer among women. Also, the
   results showed a partially significant interaction with higher decrease
   in annual trend of cancer rate in socially more deprived regions.
   Conclusions: The results showed downward and nonlinear decreasing trend
   during 4 years, especially in regions with lower socioeconomic status.
   Incidence rate also differed between districts so that northern regions
   had higher incidence than southern regions. Spatio-temporal Analysis of
   these cancer rates with adjustment for more regional socio-economic
   characteristics may better explain the disparities in rate of cancer in
   different districts across time.}},

Abstract = {{The present study aimed to identify the response of melon accessions and
   cultivars to salt stress in terms of ion exchange, enzyme activity,
   lipid peroxidation and photosynthetic pigment contents by mixture
   modelling. In mixture modeling, it is expected that the data set
   demonstrates a heterogeneous structure. This heterogeneity is
   characterized as unobservable heterogeneity. The data set's
   heterogeneity produces severe deviations in the parameter assessments
   and the standard deviations. Heterogeneity is overcome when the data set
   separates itself into homogeneous sub-populations. Mixture modeling was
   performed using the Mclust mixture cluster program of the statistical
   software package R 5.2.3. Sub-populations were constructed by evaluating
   genotypes according to studied traits and correlation analysis was
   performed using the SPSS software package. The seedlings of 13 melon
   genotypes were harvested two weeks after salt application (0 mM or 50 mM
   NaCl) when symptoms of salt stress were observed. Nutrient contents and
   ratios (K, Ca, Na, K : Na and Ca : Na); superoxide dismutase (SOD),
   catalase (CAT) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activities malondialdehyde
   (MDA) chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, total chlorophyll and carotenoid
   contents were measured. Mixture modeling and correlation analysis were
   used in evaluating the experimental data sets. Differences in responses
   to salt application were observed among genotypes. While all genotypes
   exhibited negative responses in terms of K : Na ratio, which is an
   important parameter of salt tolerance, the smallest decreases in K : Na
   ratios were observed in the YYU-11 (-57.09\%) and YYU-4 (-58.78\%)
   genotypes, indicating them to be the most tolerant to salt stress. In
   general, enzyme activity decreased in response to salt application,
   although the responses varied among genotypes, especially with regard to
   CAT and APX activity. The YYU-29 genotype was notable as the genotype
   with the highest K : Na ratio (1.79) as well as the smallest change in
   MDA content under salt stress.}},

Abstract = {{Kinematic motion structures having a reconfigurable property appear to
   be a potential candidate for the programmable matter. Motion structures
   with N-fold rotational symmetry show a reconfigurable pattern
   transformation, resulting in providing tunable mechanical properties,
   which deserves to explore more for their unique properties of
   transformation and the corresponding structural behaviors. The objective
   of this work is to synthesize motion structures from a bar-and-joint
   framework, investigating their transformability, linear structural
   properties- modulus and Poisson's ratio, and nonlinear structural
   behaviors with kinematic bifurcation. Two-dimensional (2D) motion
   structures are synthesized by central scissor links with revolute
   joints, connected with binary links in the radial direction. They
   possess an N-fold rotational symmetry (MS-N), and their transformed
   patterns are investigated. Five 2D motion structures- MS-4, MS-6, MS-8,
   MS-10, and MS-12, are generated for investigating their mechanical
   properties together with their transformability. Analytical models of
   the motion structures are constructed for obtaining relative density,
   moduli, Poisson's ratios, volume at each transformed state, and the
   strain energy required to transform from one state to another. This
   study integrates kinematics and structural mechanics, expanding the
   design space of light-weight structural materials with pattern
   transformation.}},

Abstract = {{In this investigation, mechanical behavior of periodic cellular solids
   with diamond-shaped inclusions connected via wavy network were explored.
   Two families of cellular solids within this category were designed based
   on two different geometric constraints. Auxetic effects and snap-through
   instability were observed for each family, respectively. The mechanical
   properties, including the stress-strain behavior, stiffness and
   Poisson's ratio, were systematically quantified via finite element (FE)
   simulations. The parametric space for auxetic effects and snap-through
   instability was numerically identified. This study demonstrates the
   connection and transition between mechanical auxeticity and snap-through
   instability. The materials designed have potential engineering
   applications, such as lightweight supporting and protective foams,
   biomedical devices, smart composites or fabrics with switchable
   properties responsive to external environments.}},

Abstract = {{This study seeks to develop novel multi-material and multi-layer pads
   that are comfortable to wear and effective in protecting body parts that
   are subject to blunt impact. The proposed body protection pad will
   address a safety issue prominent in elderly people, industry workers,
   law enforcement/military personnel, and sport players. Among the
   population of those people, blunt impact due to various causes such as
   falls, bullets, and blast waves reduce quality of life, increase the
   possibility of early death, and cause extremely high medical costs to
   incur. Protector pads represent a promising strategy for reducing impact
   force and preventing injuries in high risk individuals. However,
   clinical efficacy has been limited by poor user compliance. Currently
   available protectors are made of either hard shells or soft thick pads.
   Some of them are made of Non-Newtonian materials that are believed to be
   very efficient but their effectiveness hasn't been proved yet. Even
   though some available protectors can be effective if worn, most people
   who need protection are reluctant to wear bulky and heavy garments or
   rigid shells. Therefore, it is important to develop new body protectors
   that best combine each individual's requirements of wearing comfort
   (flexible, light weight), ease of fitting (customized), ensured
   protection, and cost-effectiveness.
   The authors brought up many different design ideas and the most
   promising ones were selected and their effectiveness is investigated in
   detail. One of those pads utilizes dome shape top layer and thin fabric
   membrane component, such as Kevlar, that is very strong in tension but
   flexible in bending. Such design will make the pads excellent in
   dissipating shock energy and converting normal shock force to lateral
   direction to minimize the shock force transmitted to the body parts.
   Through computational simulations, these pads were proved to be very
   flexible in bending and torsion while strong and rigid in compression.
   In addition, suitable materials were identified, and it has been
   verified that such materials can be used to design a viable product(s)
   that is thin, light, and flexible for wearing comfort but strong in
   normal impact direction to protect the body.
   This paper reports a parametric study using computational analyses
   (finite element analyses) conducted for dome-shaped structures with
   various materials such as thermoplastic polyurethane (Ninjaflex (R) and
   Semiflex (R)), polyethylene, resin polyester, polylactic acid (PLA),
   resin epoxy, epoxy S glass, and epoxy E-glass. Parametric 3D CAD models
   of the dome-shape structures were created with various combinations of
   layers such as dome shell only, dome with fabric (such as Kevlar)
   membrane, dome with fabric membrane and solid filler, and dome with
   fillers of auxetic structure. Then, key structural characteristics of
   protectors such as normal (compression), bending, and torsional
   stiffness were evaluated through static analyses of FEA models. Then,
   impact/shock analyses were conducted using multiphysics finite-element
   analysis models to validate the results obtained from the static
   analyses. Advanced additive manufacturing techniques (3D printers) were
   used to build prototypes of the pads for tests. Dimensions and materials
   of the multi layer pads are optimized for light weight and flexibility
   while keeping excellent shock absorption capability. The mechanism for
   ideal input force distribution or shunting are explained and suggested
   for designing protectors using various combinations of materials and
   layers to reduce the risk of injury. The results show that the dome
   shape structure can be an effective component of optimized body
   protection pads using a combination of various materials.}},

Title = {{Expanded polytetrafluoroethylene as an auxetic material: effect of

Abstract = {{The effect of extension ratio on the structure and property of expanded
   polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) has been decisively studied. ePTFE is
   unique with its porous fibrillar network structure connected by nodes
   and also with its degree of orientation which increases with increases
   in extension ratio. It is found that the Poisson's ratio of ePTFE is
   negative, and it is reduced dramatically with increased extension ratio.
   At the extension ratio of 30, the Poisson's ratio reaches - 10.00. By
   changes of extension ratio from 1 to 10, the segmental mobility of
   polymer chains becomes harder, and the dynamic glass transition
   temperature (T-g) is increased. Broad glass transition regions are
   revealed in tan delta versus temperature curves in
   polytetrafluoroethylene specimens stretched 20-(S20) and 30-fold (S30).
   As the extension ratio is increased, the thermal conductivity of the
   specimens is decreased. The thermal conductivity coefficient is dropped
   to 0.051 W m(-1) K owing to the appearance of more pores and low degree
   of crystallinity at higher extension ratio. The properties of ePTFE
   modified by carbonyl iron powder (CIP) have been investigated. CIP has
   affected the structure and properties of modified ePTFE. CIP-modified
   ePTFE also exhibits a negative Poisson's ratio which is larger than
   ePTFE at the same extension ratio. The modified ePTFE reveals higher
   thermal conductivity coefficient than ePTFE itself.}},

Abstract = {{The article details a sampling scheme which can lead to a reduction in
   sample size and cost in clinical and epidemiological studies of
   association between a count outcome and risk factor. We show that
   inference in two common generalized linear models for count data,
   Poisson and negative binomial regression, is improved by using a ranked
   auxiliary covariate, which guides the sampling procedure. This type of
   sampling has typically been used to improve inference on a population
   mean. The novelty of the current work is its extension to log-linear
   models and derivations showing that the sampling technique results in an
   increase in information as compared to simple random sampling.
   Specifically, we show that under the proposed sampling strategy the
   maximum likelihood estimate of the risk factor's coefficient is improved
   through an increase in the Fisher's information. Asimulation study is
   performed to compare the mean squared error, bias, variance, and power
   of the sampling routine with simple random sampling under various
   data-generating scenarios. We also illustrate the merits of the sampling
   scheme on a real data set from a clinical setting of males with chronic
   obstructive pulmonary disease. Empirical results from the simulation
   study and data analysis coincide with the theoretical derivations,
   suggesting that a significant reduction in sample size, and hence study
   cost, can be realized while achieving the same precision as a simple
   random sample.}},

Journal = {{SCIENCE ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Modern fabrication techniques, such as additive manufacturing, can be
   used to create materials with complex custom internal structures. These
   engineered materials exhibit a much broader range of bulk properties
   than their base materials and are typically referred to as metamaterials
   or microstructures. Although metamaterials with extraordinary properties
   have many applications, designing them is very difficult and is
   generally done by hand. We propose a computational approach to discover
   families of microstructures with extremal macroscale properties
   automatically. Using efficient simulation and sampling techniques, we
   compute the space of mechanical properties covered by physically
   realizable microstructures. Our system then clusters microstructures
   with common topologies into families. Parameterized templates are
   eventually extracted from families to generate new microstructure
   designs. We demonstrate these capabilities on the computational design
   of mechanical metamaterials and present five auxetic microstructure
   families with extremal elastic material properties. Our study opens the
   way for the completely automated discovery of extremal microstructures
   across multiple domains of physics, including applications reliant on
   thermal, electrical, and magnetic properties.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose The purpose of this paper is to study the effect of the relative
   density and geometric parameters on the homogenised in-plane elasticity
   modulus of a cellular honeycomb structure using analytical and numerical
   approaches.
   Design/methodology/approach In this work, the mechanical behaviour of a
   new design of the honeycomb is analysed through a refined analytical
   model that is developed based on the energy theorems by considering the
   shearing and stretching effects in addition to bending.
   Findings By taking into account the various deformation mechanisms
   (MNT), the obtained results show that the values of elasticity modulus
   are the same for low relative densities, but the difference becomes
   remarkable for higher densities. Moreover, it is difficult to judge the
   effect of the relative density and anisotropy of the cellular structure
   on the values of the homogenised elasticity modulus without considering
   all the three deformation mechanisms in the analytical model. It is
   shown that conventional models overestimate the elasticity modulus,
   especially for high relative densities.
   Originality/value In this paper, a refined model that takes into account
   the three deformation mechanisms (MNT) is developed to predict the
   in-plane elasticity modulus of a honeycomb cellular material. It is
   shown that analytical models that describe the anisotropic behaviour of
   honeycomb cells can be improved by considering the three deformation
   mechanisms, which are bending, stretching, and shearing deformations.}},

Year = {{2018}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Aims: We aimed to re-assess the previously shown but recently disputed
   association between HbA1c and severe hypoglycemia.
   Methods: 52 Patients with T1D and IAH participated in an earlier
   reported randomized, crossover trial with two 16-week intervention
   periods comparing continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) with
   self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG). In this previous study, time
   spent in normoglycemia (the primary outcome), was improved by 9.6\% (p <
   0.0001). We performed post-hoc analyses using a zero-inflated Poisson
   regression model to assess the relationship between severe hypoglycemia
   and HbA1c, glucose variability and duration of diabetes.
   Results: During SMBG use, HbA1c and the number of severe hypoglycemic
   events were negatively associated (OR : 0.20 {[}95\% CI 0.09 to 0.44]).
   During CGM use, this relationship showed an odds ratio of 0.65 (95\% CI
   0.42 to 1.01). There was no significant relationship between glucose
   variability or duration of diabetes and severe hypoglycemia.
   Conclusions: In patients with T1D and IAH, treated with standard SMBG, a
   negative association exists between HbA1c and the number of severe
   hypoglycemic events. Thus, reaching target HbA1c values still comes with
   a higher risk of severe hypoglycemia. CGM weakens this association,
   suggesting CGM enables patients to reach their target HbA1c more safely.

   been shown to be associated with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). We
   sought to explore risk factors which may affect the 12-month turnover of
   AKs in organ transplant recipients (OTRs). The number of incident AKs,
   regressed AKs and net change in AK counts were calculated. Negative
   binomial regression and Poisson regression models were used to estimate
   rate ratios (RR) for these 3 outcomes. Among 150 renal and 89 liver
   OTRs, those who spent > 50\% of a typical weekday in the sun had a lower
   rate of AK regression than those who spent minimal time in the sun
   during a typical weekday. Age, parents' country of origin, hair colour,
   skin cancer history and recent AK treatment were all significantly
   associated with AK turnover. Clinically, these risk factors may be used
   to monitor OTRs at increased risk of SCC.}},

Abstract = {{Four types of three-dimensional (3-D) metallic metamaterials with
   tailorable thermo-mechanical properties are designed. For the first
   three types, the structure-property relations are studied by adjusting
   design parameters including two length parameters, one angle parameter
   and two material combinations. For the fourth type, one additional angle
   parameter is involved. It is shown that each of the four types of
   metamaterials designed exhibits the cubic symmetry and thus needs three
   independent elastic constants to characterize its elastic behavior and
   one coefficient of thermal expansion to describe its isotropic thermal
   expansion. The effects of the design parameters on the effective
   Poisson's ratio (PR), coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), Young's
   modulus, shear modulus and the relative density are systematically
   investigated for each of the four types of designed metamaterials by
   using unit cell-based finite element simulations that incorporate
   periodic boundary conditions. It is found that 3-D metallic
   metamaterials with positive, near-zero or negative PR and CTE can be
   obtained by tailoring the bi-material lattice structures and material
   combinations. Also, it is revealed that metamaterial \# 1 can achieve
   both a negative PR and a non-positive CTE while maintaining a high
   stiffness and a low relative density (and thus a lightweight). The good
   tunability of thermo-mechanical properties of the four types of
   metamaterials provides an avenue of enabling the expansion of Ashby's
   material chart to produce more material options for engineering
   applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A continuum approach for the large strain finite element analysis of
   auxetic materials}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{135}},
Pages = {{441-457}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic materials are materials which present negative Poisson ratios.
   This unusual behavior is due to their particular microstructures. It is
   frequent that during large deformation processes in auxetic foams, the
   value of the Poisson ratio also presents large variations, with
   transitions from auxetic to conventional behavior. In this paper we
   present a procedure to perform large strain finite element analysis of
   energy-conservative isotropic auxetic materials from a continuum
   perspective. Two possible approaches are used. The first one is based on
   uncoupled WYPiWYG hyperelasticity. This decomposition permits a simple
   analysis of the behavior using also infinitesimal bi-linear models. The
   second approach is a novel procedure for coupled hyperelasticity based
   on classical invariants. This latter procedure is amenable for obtaining
   the stored energy of highly compressible foams, including coupling terms
   and generic invariants, as for example those used by the analytical
   Blatz-Ko model or the hyperelastic model of Ciambella and Saccomandi,
   which was explicitly developed for auxetic foams. The applicability and
   efficiency of the method is shown through fmite element analyses of
   auxetic foams at large strains using the continuum approach. (C) 2017

Title = {{Modeling excess zeros and heterogeneity in count data from a complex

   sub-Saharan Africa}},
Journal = {{STATISTICAL METHODS IN MEDICAL RESEARCH}},

Abstract = {{Purpose
   To show a novel application of a weighted zero-inflated negative
   binomial model in modeling count data with excess zeros and
   heterogeneity to quantify the regional variation in HIV-AIDS prevalence
   in sub-Saharan African countries.
   Methods
   Data come from latest round of the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS)
   conducted in three countries (Ethiopia-2011, Kenya-2009 and Rwanda-2010)
   using a two-stage cluster sampling design. The outcome is an aggregate
   count of HIV cases in each census enumeration area of each country. The
   outcome data are characterized by excess zeros and heterogeneity due to
   clustering. We compare scale weighted zero-inflated negative binomial
   models with and without random effects to account for zero-inflation,
   complex survey design and clustering. Finally, we provide marginalized
   rate ratio estimates from the best zero-inflated negative binomial
   model.
   Results
   The best fitting zero-inflated negative binomial model is scale weighted
   and with a common random intercept for the three countries. Rate ratio
   estimates from the final model show that HIV prevalence is associated
   with age and gender distribution, HIV acceptance, HIV knowledge, and its
   regional variation is associated with divorce rate, burden of sexually
   transmitted diseases and rural residence.
   Conclusions
   Scale weighted zero-inflated negative binomial with proper modeling of
   random effects is shown to be the best model for count data from a
   complex survey design characterized by excess zeros and extra
   heterogeneity. In our data example, the final rate ratio estimates show
   significant regional variation in the factors associated with HIV
   prevalence indicating that HIV intervention strategies should be
   tailored to the unique factors found in each country.}},

   interpreted as a DIS or semielasticity in the same manner as continuous
   coefficients, which has been overlooked by some empirical researchers.
   Then we show how interaction terms can be easily transformed into a DIS
   and derive the asymptotic distribution of this estimator. We illustrate
   the discrepancy between the interaction term coefficient and the DIS
   using an empirical example evaluating the relationship between
   employment, private health insurance and physician office visits. Our
   results can be applied in treatment effect models when the outcome

Abstract = {{Auxetics expand laterally when uniaxially stretched. In many cases, this
   behaviour has been attributed to the interplay between the geometry of
   the system and its deformation mechanism. This work revisits a class of
   2D motifs, the so-called chiral honeycombs, which are closely associated
   with auxetic behaviour. More specifically, we show that systems based on
   this motif, particularly those having a Poisson's ratio of -1, can be
   engineered with specific constraints that limit the in-plane expansion,
   with the result that on inducing deformation of the systems, these veer
   out-of-plane to form dome-like structures. This effect is demonstrated
   in simple prototypes and it is shown through a simplified mathematical
   model that the extent of curvature can be controlled through the various
   parameters that describe such structures.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) was used for impact
   loading of an auxetic lattice (structure with negative Poissons ratio)
   at a given strain-rate. High strength aluminum and polymethyl
   methacrylate bars instrumented with foil strain-gauges were used for
   compression of an additively manufactured missing-rib auxetic lattice.
   All experiments were observed using a high-speed camera with frame-rate
   set to approx. 135.000 fps. High-speed images were synchronized with the
   strain-gauge records. Dynamic equilibrium in the specimen was analyzed
   and optimized pulse-shaping was introduced in the selected experiments.
   Longitudinal and lateral in-plane displacements and strains were
   evaluated using digital image correlation (DIC) technique. DIC results
   were compared with results obtained from strain-gauges and were found to
   be in good agreement. Using DIC, it was possible to analyze in-plane
   strain distribution in the specimens and to evaluate strain dependent
   Poissons ratio of the auxetic structure.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we explore a new class of electric motor-driven compliant
   actuators based on handed shearing auxetic cylinders. This technique
   combines the benefits of compliant bodies from soft robotic actuators
   with the simplicity of direct coupling to electric motors. We
   demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique by creating linear
   actuators, a four degree-of-freedom robotic platform, and a soft robotic
   gripper. We compare the soft robotic gripper against a state of the art
   pneumatic soft gripper, finding similar grasping performance in a
   significantly smaller and more energy-efficient package.}},

Abstract = {{With the proliferation of flexible displays and the advances in smart
   materials, it is now possible to create interactive devices that are not
   only flexible but can reconfigure into any shape on demand. Several
   Human Computer Interaction (HCI) and robotics researchers have started
   designing, prototyping and evaluating shape-changing devices, realising,
   however, that this vision still requires many engineering challenges to
   be addressed. On the material science front, we need breakthroughs in
   stable and accessible materials to create novel, proof-of-concept
   devices. On the interactive devices side, we require a deeper
   appreciation for the material properties and an understanding of how
   exploiting material properties can provide affordances that unleash the
   human interactive potential. While these challenges are interesting for
   the respective research fields, we believe that the true power of
   shape-changing devices can be magnified by bringing together these
   communities. In this paper we therefore present a review of advances
   made in shape-changing materials and discuss their applications within
   an HCI context.}},

Title = {{The effect of fluid and solid properties on the auxetic behavior of
   porous materials having rock-like microstructures}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOLIDS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{130}},
Pages = {{211-219}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Materials with a negative Poisson's Ratio (PR), known as auxetics,
   exhibit the counterintuitive behavior of becoming wider when uniaxially
   stretched and thinner when compressed. Though negative PR is
   characteristic of polymer foams or cellular solids, tight as well as
   highly porous rocks have also been reported to exhibit negative PR. The
   paper proposes a novel auxetic structure based on pore-space
   configuration observed in rocks. We developed a theoretical auxetic 3D
   model consisting of rotating rigid bodies. To alleviate the mechanical
   assumption of rotating bodies, the theoretical model was modified to
   include crack-like features being represented by intersecting, elliptic
   cylinders. We then used a 3D printer to create a physical version of the
   modified model, whose PR was tested. We also numerically explored how
   the compressibility of fluids located in the pore-space of the modified
   model as well as how the elastic properties of the material from which
   the model is made of affect its auxetic behavior. We conclude that for a
   porous medium composed of a single material saturated with a single
   fluid (a) the more compliant the fluid is and (b) the lower the PR of
   the solid material, the lower the PR value of the composite material.

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{35}},

Pages = {{21-27}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Background: The association between physician-directed goals of care
   discussions (GOCDs) and the use of aggressive interventions in
   terminally ill patients has not been well characterized in the
   literature. We examined the associations between the timing of
   physician-directed GOCDs in terminally ill patients and the use of
   aggressive interventions, probability of dying in the inpatient setting,
   and intensive care unit (ICU) utilization.
   Methods: This retrospective cohort study included patients admitted to
   our urban community hospital in 2015 who had a terminal diagnosis on
   admission and either died on an inpatient unit or were discharged to
   hospice. The primary independent variable was the number of days from
   admission to GOCD, expressed as a proportion of the patient's length of
   stay (LOS). We used robust variance Poisson and zero-inflated negative
   binomial regression, as appropriate, to estimate the associations
   between goals of care timing and risk of having an intervention, risk of
   dying in the inpatient setting, odds of ICU admission, and ICU LOS.
   Results: A total of 197 cases were included. After adjusting for age,
   language, gender, insurance, dementia, and decision maker (patient
   versus surrogate decision maker), later GOCD was significantly
   associated with greater risk of having an aggressive intervention (risk
   ratio {[}RR] = 1.04, 95\% confidence interval {[}CI] = 1.02-1.06),
   greater risk of death as an inpatient (RR = 1.04, 95\% CI = 1.02-1.06),
   and greater odds of ICU admission (odds ratio = 1.19, 95\% CI =
   1.02-1.39).
   Conclusion: Later GOCDs were associated with greater risk of aggressive
   interventions and death as an inpatient and greater odds of ICU
   admission. Goals of care discussion should be done routinely and early
   during the hospitalization of terminally ill patients.}},

Volume = {{328}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a computational framework for computational
   design and additive manufacturing of free-form periodic metasurfaces.
   The proposed scheme rests on the level-set-based topology approach and
   the conformal mapping theory. A metamaterial with pre-specified
   performance is created using a level-set-based topology optimization
   method. The achieved unit cell is further mapped to the 3D quad meshes
   on a free-form surface by applying the conformal mapping method which
   can preserve the local shape and angle during the mapping. With embedded
   geometric information, the proposed level-set-based optimization methods
   not only can act as a motivator for design synthesis, but also can be
   seamlessly hooked with additive manufacturing without the need of CAD
   reconstructions. The current computational framework provides a solution
   to increasing applications involving innovative metamaterial designs on
   free-form surfaces for different fields of interests. The performance of
   the proposed scheme is illustrated through two benchmark examples where
   a negative-Poisson's-ratio unit cell pattern, and a stiff and light
   inner structure are mapped to 3D free-form surfaces and fabricated
   through additive manufacturing. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Temporal trends in educational inequalities in non-communicable diseases
   in Korea, 2007-2015}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2017}},

Abstract = {{Background
   Socioeconomic inequalities in non-communicable diseases are known to
   exist; however there is a paucity of research describing the secular
   trends in these inequalities. To this end, the current study aims to
   explore the recent time trends in social patterning of selected
   non-communicable diseases among Korean adults between 2007 and 2015.
   Methods
   Using data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination
   Survey (KNHANES), temporal trends in socioeconomic inequalities in
   diabetes, arthritis, asthma and depressive symptoms were assessed across
   three time points. Respondents were adults aged 20 years or over (N =
   47,091, 20,180 men and 26,911 women). Socioeconomic circumstance was
   assessed based on highest level of educational attainment. We estimated
   prevalence ratios with 95\% confidence intervals using Poisson
   regression with robust variance estimation (adjusted for age, smoking
   status, alcohol consumption, obesity, and physical activity) separately
   for men and women. The magnitude of the inequalities was computed using
   the relative index of inequality (RII).
   Results
   In men, diabetes was not associated with educational attainment, while
   there was evidence of a negative association in women across surveys.
   Similar inverse associations were found with arthritis and depressive
   symptoms, but these associations were less clear for asthma. RII showed
   a non-significant increasing trend in educational disparities in
   depressive symptoms. Meanwhile, relative inequalities in diabetes,
   arthritis and asthma have narrowed. These trends were, in general, more
   pronounced in women.
   Conclusions
   The findings of this study indicate higher burden of selected NCDs among
   the lower educational groups, particularly among women. In addition, our
   results indicated some improvements in inequalities in diabetes,
   arthritis and asthma in recent years. These findings have important
   implications for understanding the causes of social patterning of NCDs
   and for the targeting of effective interventions.}},

Abstract = {{We discuss the origin of Warburg's impedance in unsupported electrolytic
   cells containing only one group of positive and one group of negative
   ions. Our analysis is based on the Poisson-Nernst-Planck model, where
   the generation-recombination phenomenon is neglected. We show that to
   observe Warburg-like impedance the diffusion coefficient of the positive
   ions has to differ from that of the negative ones, and furthermore the
   electrodes have to be not blocking. We assume that the nonblocking
   properties of the electrodes can be described by means of an Ohmic
   model, where the charge exchange between the cell and the external
   circuit is described by means of an electrode conductivity. For
   simplicity we consider a symmetric cell. However, our analysis can be
   easily generalized to more complicated situations, where the cell is not
   symmetric and the charge exchange is described by the Chang-Jaffe model,
   or by a linearized version of the Butler-Volmer equation. Our analysis
   allows justification of the expression for Warburg's impedance proposed
   previously by several groups, based on wrong assumptions.}},

Abstract = {{The well-known idea of ``structure determines properties{''} can be
   understood profoundly in the case of hexagonal zinc dicyanometalate.
   Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we show the uniaxial
   negative thermal expansion (NTE) and negative linear compressibility
   (NLC) properties of Zn{[}Au(CN)(2)](2). The temperature dependence of
   phonon frequencies within the quasi harmonic approximation (QHA) is
   investigated. The abnormal phonon hardening (frequency increase on
   heating) is detected in the ranges of 0-225, 320-345, and 410-430
   cm(-1), which can be indicative of the unusual physical properties of
   Zn{[}Au(CN)(2)](2). Due to the significance of low-energy phonon
   frequencies in Zn{[}Au(CN)(2)](2), in this work, the corresponding
   vibrational mode of the lowest-frequency optical phonon at the zone
   center is analyzed. The specific topology of a springlike framework that
   will produce the effects of a compressed spring on heating and an
   extended spring under hydrostatic pressure is identified and leads to
   the coexistence of uniaxial-NTE and NLC behaviors in Zn{[}Au(CN)(2)](2).
   The. distinguishing phonon group velocity along the a axis and c axis
   facilitates different responses for both the axes under temperature and
   hydrostatic pressure field. Through an analysis and visualization of the
   spatial dependence of elastic tensors, it is found that a negative
   Poisson's ratio (NPR) is presented in all projection planes due to the
   specific topology.}},

Abstract = {{The prevalence of fusions of the transmembrane protease, serine 2, gene
   (TMPRSS2) with the erythroblast transformation-specific-related gene
   (ERG), or TMPRSS2: ERG, in prostate cancer varies by race. However, such
   somatic aberration and its association with prognostic factors have
   neither been studied in a West African population nor been
   systematically reviewed in the context of racial differences. We used
   immunohistochemistry to assess oncoprotein encoded by the ERG gene as
   the established surrogate of ERG fusion genes among 262 prostate cancer
   biopsies from the Ghana Prostate Study (2004-2006). Poisson regression
   with robust variance estimation provided prevalence ratios and 95\%
   confidence intervals of ERG expression in relation to patient
   characteristics. We found that 47 of 262 (18\%) prostate cancers were
   ERG-positive, and being negative for ERG staining was associated with
   higher Gleason score. We further conducted a systematic review and
   meta-analysis of TMPRSS2: ERG fusions in relation to race, Gleason
   score, and tumor stage, combining results from Ghana with 40 additional
   studies. Meta-analysis showed the prevalence of TMPRSS2: ERG fusions in
   prostate cancer to be highest in men of European descent (49\%),
   followed by men of Asian (27\%) and then African (25\%) descent. The
   lower prevalence of TMPRSS2: ERG fusions in men of African descent
   implies that alternative genomic mechanisms might explain the
   disproportionately high prostate cancer burden in such populations.}},

Abstract = {{The elastic tensor of any triangular (2D) lattice material is given with
   respect to the geometry and the mechanical properties of the links
   between the nodes. The links can bear central forces (tensional
   material, for example with hinged joints), momentums (flexural
   materials) or a combination of the two. The symmetry class of the
   stiffness tensor is detailed in any case by using the invariants of
   Forte and Vianello. A distinction is made between the trivial cases
   where the elasticity symmetry group corresponds to the microstructure's
   symmetry group and the non-trivial cases in the opposite case.
   Interesting examples of isotropic auxetic materials (with negative
   Poisson's ratio) and non-trivial materials with isotropic elasticity but
   anisotropic fracturation (weak direction) are shown. The proposed set of
   equations can be used in an engineering process to create a 2D

Abstract = {{Topology optimization is a methodology for assigning material or void to
   each point in a design domain in a way that extremizes some objective
   function, such as the compliance of a structure under given loads,
   subject to various imposed constraints, such as an upper bound on the
   mass of the structure. Geometry projection is a means to parameterize
   the topology optimization problem, by describing the design in a way
   that is independent of the mesh used for analysis of the design's
   performance; it results in many fewer design parameters, necessarily
   resolves the ill-posed nature of the topology optimization problem, and
   provides sharp descriptions of the material interfaces. We extend
   previous geometric projection work to 3 dimensions and design unit cells
   for lattice materials using inverse homogenization. We perform a
   sensitivity analysis of the geometric projection and show it has smooth
   derivatives, making it suitable for use with gradient-based optimization
   algorithms. The technique is demonstrated by designing unit cells
   comprised of a single constituent material plus void space to obtain
   light, stiff materials with cubic and isotropic material symmetry. We
   also design a single-constituent isotropic material with negative
   Poisson's ratio and a light, stiff material comprised of 2 constituent
   solids plus void space.}},

Title = {{Pressure-induced hydrogen bond symmetrization of InOOH and its elastic
   properties}},
Journal = {{ACTA PHYSICA SINICA}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{66}},
Number = {{23}},
Month = {{DEC 5}},
Abstract = {{Pressure-induced hydrogen bond symmetrization of InOOH as well as its
   effects on the elastic properties is investigated by first-principles
   simulation. The results indicate that the hydrogen bond in InOOH
   symmetrized at about 18 GPa, resulting in the pressure derivative of the
   b/c axial ratio changing from negative to positive. While the a/c axial
   ratio increases with the increasing pressure over a range of 0-40 GPa,
   its pressure derivative does not change significantly across the
   hydrogen bond symmetrization.
   In the text, `A-InOOH' denotes the asymmetric hydrogen bond phase and
   `S-InOOH' refers to the symmetric hydrogen bond phase. The compressional
   and off-diagonal elastic constants, bulk modulus B, Poisson's ratio
   upsilon, B/G (G represents shear modulus) and longitudinal wave velocity
   V P increase with the increasing pressure in both A-InOOH and S-InOOH.
   These properties of A-InOOH are significantly smaller than those of
   S-InOOH, and therefore they increase abnormally during the hydrogen bond
   symmetrization, such as a 20\%-40\% increase of the bulk modulus. Shear
   modulus G and Young's modulus E increase with the increasing pressure in
   A-InOOH, but decrease with the increasing pressure in S-InOOH, implying
   that hydrogen bond symmetrization would change their pressure evolution
   trends obviously. Shear elastic constant C-44 and shear wave velocity VS
   decrease with the increasing pressure in both A-InOOH and S-InOOH, and
   more quickly in the latter, indicating that the structure change of
   hydrogen bond would change their pressure evolution rates. The Young's
   moduli along the {[}100], {[}010] and {[}001] directions increase with
   the increasing pressure in A-InOOH, while decrease with the increasing
   pressure in S-InOOH, and those along the {[}110], {[}(1) over bar 10],
   {[}(1) over bar(1) over bar0] and {[}1 (1) over bar0] directions always
   increase with the increasing pressure over a range of 0-40 GPa. The
   anisotropy and toughness of InOOH increase with the increasing pressure
   in both A-InOOH and S-InOOH, and the hydrogen bond symmetrization
   results in abnormal increase. In the materials containing hydrogen
   bonds, the effects of hydrogen bond symmetrization on different
   compressional elastic constants depend on the hydrogen bond projection
   on corresponding axes: the bigger the projection, the more significant
   the effect is.
   InOOH has an obviously smaller bulk modulus than delta-AlOOH. The
   dominant reason is that the In 3+ radius (0.81 angstrom, 1 angstrom =
   0.1 nm) is larger than Al3+ radius (0.50 angstrom), resulting in the
   weaker interaction between Al3+ and O-2 than that between Al3 + and O-2.
   In addition, InOOH has more vacancies than delta-AlOOH. Combining with
   previous investigations on other rutile-distorted M OOH (M = Al, Ga, Fe,
   Cr), we can infer that the axial ratios, elastic properties and wave
   velocities of all M OOH materials have similar pressure evolutions to
   those of InOOH, and the hydrogen bond symmetrization has similar effects
   on the properties of MOOH.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To assess the association between cerebral microbleeds
   (CMBs) and future spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) risk in
   ischemic stroke patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF)
   taking oral anticoagulants.
   Methods: This was a meta-analysis of cohort studies with.50 patients
   with recent ischemic stroke and documented AF, brain MRI at baseline,
   long-term oral anticoagulation treatment, and >= 6 months of follow-up.
   Authors provided summary-level data on stroke outcomes stratified by CMB
   status. We estimated pooled annualized ICH and ischemic stroke rates
   from Poisson regression. We calculated odds ratios (ORs) of ICH by CMB
   presence/absence, >= 5 CMBs, and CMB topography (strictly lobar, mixed,
   and strictly deep) using random-effects models.
   Results: We established an international collaboration and pooled data
   from 8 centers including 1,552 patients. The crude CMB prevalence was
   30\% and 7\% for >= 5 CMBs. Baseline CMB presence (vs no CMB) was
   associated with ICH during follow-up (OR 2.68, 95\% confidence interval
   {[}CI] 1.19-6.01, p = 0.017). Presence of >= 5 CMB was related to higher
   future ICH risk (OR 5.50, 95\% CI 2.07-14.66, p = 0.001). The pooled
   annual ICH incidence increased from 0.30\% (95\% CI 0.04-0.55) among
   CMB-negative patients to 0.81\% (95\% CI 0.17-1.45) in CMB-positive
   patients (p = 0.01) and 2.48\% (95\% CI 1.2-6.2) in patients with >= 5
   CMBs (p = 0.001). There was no association between CMBs and recurrent
   ischemic stroke.
   Conclusions: The presence of CMB on MRI and the dichotomized cutoff of
   >= 5 CMBs might identify subgroups of ischemic stroke patients with AF
   with high ICH risk and after further validation could help in risk
   stratification, in anticoagulation decisions, and in guiding randomized
   trials and ongoing large observational studies.}},

   which including the Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) and GGA+U
   as exchange correlation potential. The structural properties were
   calculated in order to determine the most stable structure and the most
   stable magnetic phase. Through our structural investigations, we have
   concluded that these three binaries doesn't exhibit a magnetic nature,
   certified by nonmagnetic stable phase in nonmagnetic state. The
   structural obtained results are presented as, lattice constant (a), bulk
   modulus (B), and its first pressure derivative (B'). The elastic
   aggregates properties including elastic constants (C-ij), Young's
   modulus (E), shear modulus (G), Poisson's ratio (upsilon), Keinman
   parameter (zeta), and anisotropy factor (A). All the compounds are
   characterized as brittle and anisotropic materials. The electronic
   structure of these compounds is described by the exhibition of total and
   partial densities of states (TDOS and PDOS) and band structures. All the
   compounds are confirmed as metallic materials. The negative values of
   formation (E-f) reveal that all the compounds are thermodynamically

Abstract = {{With the consideration of the randomness of complex geologic parameters
   for ultra-deep wells, an uncertainty analysis method is presented for
   the extrusion load on casing in ultra-deep wells through complex
   formation at a certain confidence level. Based on the extrusion load
   model for casing in ultra-deep wells and the prerequisite of integrity
   of formation-cement ring-casing, the probability and statistics theory
   are introduced and the sensitivity analysis on the uncertainty of
   extrusion load on casing is conducted. The distribution types of each
   formation parameters are determined statistically. The distribution type
   and distribution function of the extrusion load on casing are derived.
   Then, the uncertainty analysis of the extrusion load on casing is
   carried out on several ultra-deep wells in Shanqian block as case study.
   Several conclusions are made regarding to the field trial result. The
   randomness of formation elasticity modulus and formation Poisson's ratio
   are the main influence factors. The equivalent density profile of
   extrusion load on casing in ultra-deep wells is a confidence interval
   with a certain confidence level, rather than a single curve; the higher
   the confidence level is, the larger the bandwidth of the confidence
   interval of equivalent density profile becomes, and the larger the range
   of uncertainty interval becomes. Compared with the result of uncertainty
   analysis, an error exists in the result of traditional single valued
   calculation method. The error varies with different casing program and
   can be either positive or negative. The application of uncertainty
   analysis of extrusion load on casing provides proof for the accurate
   determination of casing collapse safety factor. Thus, the over
   engineering design or under engineering design as a result of tradition
   casing design will be avoided.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper uniaxial tension of two-dimensional auxetic cellular
   structures is studied experimentally. Various samples were made by the
   laser cutting method from nonauxetic polyethylene terephthalate (PET-A
   amorphous) planes of size 112.5 x 24 x 0.7 mm with central area of 28 x
   24 x 0.7 mm. The transverse size of elements of hexagons was equal to
   sample thickness. The samples were subjected to monotonous uniaxial
   tension until the last moment when they still remained plane. Comparison
   of mechanical properties of the defect-free cellular structures
   consisting of concave hexagons with straight elements and concave
   hexagons in which part of straight elements is replaced with curvilinear
   elements is given as a result of experimental analysis. Cellular
   structure with straight elements showed lower value of Poisson's ratio
   in comparison with cellular structure with curvilinear elements.
   Influence of defects on mechanical properties of cellular structure with
   curvilinear elements is studied. We conclude that for the considered
   samples of cellular structure with curvilinear elements at uniaxial
   tension, loss of one horizontal element (near the center of the sample)
   changes effective mechanical properties much less than for the case of
   same structure with one vertical element being absent. As a result,
   tensile force -displacement diagram for four samples was calculated from
   the experimental data.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a finite-element analysis of honeycomb and

   which is optimized with respect to selected parameters. It is shown that
   some distributions of each phase in the composite material result in the
   counter-intuitive mechanical behaviour of the structures. In particular,
   negative values of effective Poisson's ratio, i.e., effective
   auxeticity, can be obtained for a hexagonal honeycomb, whereas
   re-entrant geometry can be characterized by positive values. Topology
   optimization by means of the method of moving asymptotes (MMA) and solid
   isotropic material with penalization (SIMP) was used to determine the

Abstract = {{IMPORTANCE Intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD) is an important
   cause of stroke; however, little is known about racial differences in
   ICAD prevalence and its risk factors.
   OBJECTIVE To determine racial differences in ICAD prevalence and the
   risk factors (both midlife and concurrent) associated with its
   development in a large. US community-based cohort. DESIGN, SETTING, AND
   PARTICIPANTS Analysis of 1752 black and white participants recruited
   from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) cohort study who
   underwent 3-dimensional intracranial vessel wall magnetic resonance
   imaging from October 18,2011 to December 30, 2013; data analysis was
   performed from October 18,2011 to May 13,2015.
   EXPOSURES Midlife and concurrent cardiovascular risk factors.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Intracranial plaque presence, size (maximum
   normalized wall index) and number were assessed by vessel wall magnetic
   resonance imaging. Midlife and concurrent vascular risk factor
   associations were determined by Poisson regression (plaque presence),
   negative binominal regression (plaque number), and linear regression
   (plaque size), and compared between races.
   RESULTS Of the 1752 study participants (mean {[}SD] age, 77.6 {[}5.3]
   years; range, 67-90 years). 1023 (58.4\%) were women and 518 (29.6\%)
   were black. Black men had the highest prevalence (50.9\% vs 35.9\% for
   black women, 35.5\% for white men. and 30.2\% for white women; P < .001)
   and the highest frequency (22.4\% vs 12.1\% for black women, 10.7\% for
   white men, and 8.7\% for white women; P < .01) of multiple plaques.
   Prevalence increased with age. reaching 50\% before ages 68, 84, and 88
   years in black men, white men, and white women, respectively (ICAD
   prevalence remained <50\% in black women). Midlife hypertension and
   hyperlipidemia were associated with 29\% (prevalence ratio {[}PR], 1.29;
   95\% CI, 1.08-1.55) and 18\% (PR, 1.18; 95\% CI, 0.98-1.42),
   respectively, increased ICAD prevalence with no significant differences
   between races. Midlife hypertension was also associated with larger
   plaques (1.11 higher mean maximum normalized wall index; 95\% CI,
   0.21-2.01), Midlife smoking and diabetes were associated with increased
   risk of ICAD in black individuals (102\% {[}PR, 2.02; 95\% CI,
   1.12-3.63] and 57\% {[}PR, 1.57; 95\% CI, 1.13-2.19], respectively), but
   not in white participants (P < .05 interaction by race).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The prevalence of ICAD was highest in black
   men. Midlife smoking and diabetes were strongly associated with
   late-life ICAD in blacks only, whereas midlife hypertension and
   hyperlipidemia were associated with late-life ICAD in both races. These
   associations may help to explain racial differences in US stroke rates
   and offer insight into preventive risk-factor management strategies.}},

Abstract = {{The compressibility properties of systems consisting of generic rotating
   rigid triangles are analyzed and discussed. It is shown that these
   systems which are usually associated with auxeticity can exhibit
   strongly anisotropic properties for certain conformations, which may
   give rise to the anomalous property of negative linear compressibility
   (NLC), that is, the system with particular geometry will expand along
   one direction when loaded hydrostatically. It is also shown that through
   carefully choosing the geometric features (i.e. the dimensions and the
   alignment of the rotating triangles as well as the angles between them)
   and the direction along which the linear compressibility is measured,
   one may control the magnitude and range of the NLC. All this provides a
   novel but effective method of manufacturing the systems which can be
   tailored to achieve particular values of NLC to fit particular practical
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials have a negative Poisson's ratio, which can enhance
   other properties. Greater indentation resistance and energy absorption,
   as well as synclastic curvature, could lend auxetic materials well to
   protective sports equipment and clothing. Sheets of foam often form
   padding within protective equipment, but producing large homogenous
   auxetic foam samples is challenging. The aim of this work was to
   investigate techniques to fabricate large thin sheets of auxetic foam,
   to facilitate future production and testing of prototype sports
   equipment utilizing this material. A mold was developed to fabricate
   sheets of auxetic foam - with planar dimensions measuring 350x350mm -
   using the thermo-mechanical process. The mold utilized through-thickness
   rods to control lateral compression of foam. Sheets of auxetic foam
   measuring 10x350x350mmd were fabricated and characterized. Each sheet
   was cut into nine segments, with density measurements used to determine
   how evenly the foam had been compressed during fabrication. Specimens
   cut from corner and centre segments were subject to quasi-static
   extension up to 30\% to obtain stress versus strain relationships, with
   Digital Image Correlation used to determine Poisson's ratio. Specimens
   cut from the corner tended to have a marginally higher density, lower
   stiffness and more consistent negative Poisson's ratio compared to those
   from the centre, indicating some inconsistency in the conversion
   process. Future work could look to improve fabrication techniques for
   large thin homogenous sheets of auxetic foam.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICA STATUS SOLIDI B-BASIC SOLID STATE PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{254}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The present paper concerns two methods: IMD (isotropic material design)
   and YMD (Young modulus material design) concerning Pareto optimal
   distributions of the material and its isotropic properties. The merit
   function is the weighted sum of compliances corresponding to n
   independent loading conditions. The unit cost of the design is assumed
   as equal to the trace of the elastic moduli tensor C. In the IMD method,
   the design variables are the bulk and shear moduli. In the YMD method,
   the Poisson ratio is assumed as given, possibly non-uniformly
   distributed in the design domain, the Young modulus being the only
   design variable. Both the methods reduce to the auxiliary minimization
   problem involving statically admissible stress fields corresponding to
   the subsequent loading conditions. The integrand is expressed by a norm
   of the collection of these stresses, hence has linear growth. The
   numerical method proposed refers to the primal formulation: it is based
   on piece-wise polynomial approximation of the set of statically
   admissible stresses. The exemplary Pareto optimal solutions show that
   admitting negative values of Poisson's ratio may contribute to a
   decrease of the total compliances.}},

   shown that by varying the type of substitution and the length of the

   can be specifically designed to exhibit negative Poisson's ratio, and
   that the stiffness can be controlled in an independent manner from the
   Poisson's ratios. This is significant as it highlights the fact that

Abstract = {{We investigate auxetic isotropic elastic materials with the Poisson's
   ratio of exactly -1 and isotropic materials with the Poisson's ratio of
   near 0.5 (incompressible). In both cases the energy is not positive
   definite, which can lead to the material instability. In incompressible
   materials, the instability manifests itself in the emergence of
   non-uniform displacement distribution. Investigation of the behavior of
   such materials with respect to damage or crack accumulation is based on
   the notion that during the instantaneous process of fracture formation,
   the fracture acts as a negative stiffness element; after the fracture is
   formed, it immediately turns into a conventional fracture with usual
   positive stiffness. We demonstrate that the cracks formed due to tensile
   or combined tensile and shear fracturing of the material are capable of
   momentarily bringing the Poisson's ratio of nearly incompressible
   material to 0.5, which instantaneously turns the material into unstable.
   On the other hand, the formation of shear cracks leads to reduction in
   the Poisson's ratio bringing the material away from the point of
   instability. Opposite to this, cracks of all kinds do not change the
   Poisson's ratio in extreme auxetics (the Poisson's ratio equal to -1).
   Thus the auxetic materials remain stable with respect to fracture
   formation.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel three-dimensional (3D) cellular structure with
   negative Poisson's ratio was designed by alternating cuboid surface
   indents on the vertical ribs of the unit cells. The Poisson's ratio and
   Young's modulus of structures with different geometric parameters were
   determined using the finite element method (FEM) as a function of these
   parameters. Samples with identical geometric variables were fabricated
   via 3D printing, and their through-thickness direction Poisson's ratios
   were measured and compared with simulation results. Results showed that
   the Poisson's ratio of the 3D cellular structures can be tuned from
   positive to negative and can reach a minimal value of -0.958. Good
   agreement was found between the experimental results and the simulation.
   This lattice structure is considerably stiffer than re-entrant negative
   Poisson's ratio foam with the same solid phase. The design concept
   developed here can be optimized for specific applications via geometric
   parameters manipulation.}},

Abstract = {{Soft materials with an embedded stiffer layer are increasingly used in
   medical and sports engineering. A detailed understanding of the
   mechanical behavior of such a material system under localised load and
   resistance to indentation is very important. In this work, the
   deformation of an isotropic soft matrix with a buried stiffer thin layer
   under a circular flat indenter was investigated through finite element
   (FE) modeling. A practical approach in simulating the indentation
   resistance of such a system (soft matrix with a buried thin stiffer
   layer) is evaluated. The numerical result is correlated with the data
   based on analytical approaches for both homogeneous materials and
   elastic half space with an embedded stiffer layer. The influence of
   Poisson's ratio and auxeticity of the matrix on the deformation and
   indentation stiffness of the material system under different conditions
   (indenter size, sheet thickness, and embedment depth) were established
   and main influences of the Poisson's ratio on the material deformation
   and stresses are discussed. The result shows that the influence of
   matrix auxeticity on indentation resistance is highly depth dependent,
   with over 30\% enhancement of the indentation resistance being predicted
   for materials with matrix of a negative Poisson's ratio.}},

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{254}},

Abstract = {{An exploration by analytical method has been made herein for a
   mechanism-based structure that involves a two-dimensional array of rings
   and a three-dimensional array of double-rings, with short fixed rods and
   long sliding rods attached at the outer and inner surfaces of the rings,
   respectively. Based on the theory of thin rings, effective Poisson's
   ratio and effective coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) models have
   been obtained for single-ring structures, pole-loaded double-ring
   structures, and equator-loaded double-ring structures. Results establish
   a very strong correlation between these effective properties with the
   ring radius and rod lengths. In addition, the analysis of four of the
   double-ring structures reveals that the sign of Poisson's ratio is
   dependent on the direction of loading. An example application is
   demonstrated herein in which positive thermal expansion rings, used in
   conjunction with rigid rods, enable the design of an overall zero
   thermal expansion structure (i.e., minimal thermal stress) with tunable
   negative thermal expansion internal microstructure for use as sieve.
   Finally, it is herein shown that, by judicious positioning of the short
   fixed rods and/or long sliding rods, one may possibly obtain various
   combinations of positive and negative CTEs with positive and negative
   Poisson's ratio.}},

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{254}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials are solids that exhibit negative Poisson's ratio. The
   effect of material auxeticity (i.e., negativity of Poisson's ratio) is
   investigated herein on the maximum deflection of sectorial plates with
   Simply-Supported straight edges and Free curve edge (SSF). To aid the
   designer, an accurate and conveniently executable semi-empirical model
   has been developed herein, which is valid for the entire range of
   Poisson's ratio of isotropic solids and for the plate's sectorial angle
   from 30 to 90 degrees. Results from exact solution reveal that the
   maximum deflection reduces sharply with the reduction of Poisson's ratio
   from positive to mildly negative, but deflection reduction is marginal
   when the sectorial plate's Poisson's ratio changes from moderately
   negative to highly negative value. It is therefore suggested that (a)
   the use of auxetic materials is useful to limit the extent of SSF
   sectorial plate deflection, and that (b) the use of the developed
   semi-empirical model herein as a design equation gives greatly
   simplified but highly accurate maximum deflection prediction for SSF
   plates made from both conventional (positive Poisson's ratio) and
   auxetic (negative Poisson's ratio) materials.}},

Abstract = {{The shear deformation characteristics of a simply supported and
   uniformly loaded regular hexagonal plate is investigated herein,
   including cases when the plate is made from auxetic materials.
   Specifically, the shear correction factor for such a plate is obtained
   by matching its maximum deflections between the Mindlin and Reddy plate
   theories after a convenient Kirchhoff theory model has been proposed.
   Results show that the shear deformation is suppressed if the plate
   material is auxetic; for example, the extent of shear deformation is
   conserved even if the plate thickness is doubled, provided that the
   Poisson's ratio reduces from 0.5 to -1. When benchmarked against other
   plate shapes, the shear deformation for the hexagonal plate is
   comparable with those of square and equilateral triangular plates.
   Therefore, the design principles that incorporate shear deformation in
   thick square plates and in thick equilateral triangular plates can be
   extended to thick hexagonal plates, and this validity applies for both
   conventional and auxetic plate materials.}},

Title = {{On the Use of Auxetics in Footwear: Investigating the Effect of Padding

Journal = {{PHYSICA STATUS SOLIDI B-BASIC SOLID STATE PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{254}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Although high heels are known to affect the biomechanics of human
   movement, most notably by increasing forefoot plantar pressure, it is
   commonly worn due to the influence of fashion. To deal with the
   resulting clinical issues, some prescriptions include the use of
   cushioning pads to redistribute the plantar loads and increase comfort.
   This preliminary study has sought to investigate whether auxetic foam
   would be a good candidate for the redistribution of plantar loafing in
   the forefoot when compared to a more traditional material. From the
   results obtained, it was shown that auxetic foam demonstrated a decrease
   in forefoot peak plantar pressure while a commercial product, a material
   traditionally used for plantar cover paddings, increased pressure in the
   region of the second-fourth Metatarsophalangeal Joint. This demonstrates
   the potential for auxetic materials to become the material of choice for
   such applications, especially since it can be further remodeled until
   its properties can produce a significant forefoot pressure reduction.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICA STATUS SOLIDI B-BASIC SOLID STATE PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{254}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents an experimental study of tensile and deformation
   behavior of an auxetic plied yarn structure. The basic configuration of
   the plied structure formed with two soft yarns and two stiff yarns was
   firstly introduced. Based on this 4-ply helix structure, six kinds of
   yarn samples were made by different combinations of soft yarns, stiff
   yarns and twist levels. These yarn samples were first tested and the
   effects of different design parameters were analyzed. Apart from the
   tensile test, changes in the internal structure of two samples upon
   stretching were also studied through microscopic examination. Finally,
   double helix yarn and 6-ply auxetic yarn were made for a comparative
   purpose to investigate the effect of helical structure. The study shows
   that all of the 4-ply auxetic yarn samples exhibit negative Poisson's
   ratio (NPR) throughout the entire tensile process, and the magnitude of
   NPR gets larger with a smaller soft yarn diameter, a higher tensile
   modulus of stiff yarn and a lower twist level. The study also shows that
   auxetic behavior inside the 4-ply structure is generated by the
   interplay between the soft yarns and stiff yarns and 4-ply auxetic yarns
   have the advantages to produce immediate auxetic effect upon stretching.}},

Abstract = {{Tissue engineering is replete with methods for inducing and mediating
   cell differentiation, which are crucial for ensuring proper regrowth of
   desired tissues. In this study, we developed a 3D-printed, non-positive
   Poisson's Ratio (NPPR) scaffold intended for future use in
   stretch-mediated cell differentiation applications, such as in muscle
   and tendon regeneration. We utilized dynamic optical projection
   stereolithography (DOPsL) to fabricate multi-layered, cell-laden NPPR
   scaffolds these scaffolds can not only support aggregate cell growth,
   but can also be printed with locally-tunable force-displacement
   properties at length scales appropriate for tissue interaction. These
   NPPR multilayered mesh scaffolds can be embedded into highly elastic
   hydrogels in order to couple a reduced NPPR behavior to a normally
   Positive Poisson's Ratio (PPR) solid bulk material. This hybrid
   structure may potentially enable induced `auxetic' behavior at the
   single-cell scale while tuning the Poisson's Ratio to a more isolated
   value. This would be uniquely suited for providing stretch-mediated
   effects for various cell-types within the tendon-to-muscle tissue

Abstract = {{Jounce bumpers in automotive suspension are key components that can
   improve the noise, vibration, and harshness performance of entire
   vehicle. Traditional jounce bumper made of polyurethane usually cannot
   satisfy the mechanical performances required by noise, vibration, and
   harshness optimization. In addition, the application of hyperelastic
   material influenced the efficiency and reliability of numerical
   calculations of polyurethane jounce bumper. In this paper, an
   engineering negative Poisson's ratio structure was introduced and
   applied on the jounce bumper. The negative Poisson's ratio jounce bumper
   can be mainly defined by few structure parameters. The finite element
   analysis of the negative Poisson's ratio jounce bumper was conducted
   applied explicit method. The influences of loading velocity and material
   densities on computational time and numerical results were researched.
   The results indicated that enlargements of material densities and
   loading velocity can improve the computational efficiency and have
   limited influence on reliability. Furthermore, a negative Poisson's
   ratio jounce bumper prototype was manufactured and tested to verify the
   numerical results. It was proved that the finite element analysis of the
   negative Poisson's ratio jounce bumper was reliable both in
   load-displacement curve and deformation shapes. Compared to the
   traditional jounce bumper, the negative Poisson's ratio jounce bumper
   can achieve similar mechanical behavior but with a smoother
   load-displacement curve, which is beneficial to the vehicle's noise,
   vibration, and harshness performance.}},

Title = {{BP5 monolayer with multiferroicity and negative Poisson's ratio: a
   prediction by global optimization method}},
Journal = {{2D MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{4}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Based on global optimization Cuttlefish algorithm, we predict a stable
   two-dimensional (2D) phase of boron phosphide with 1:5 stoichiometry,
   i.e. boron pentaphosphide (BP5) monolayer, which has a lower formation
   energy than that of the commonly believed graphitic phase (g-BP). BP5
   monolayer is a multiferroic material with coupled ferroelasticity and
   ferroelectricity. The predicted reversible strain is up to 41.41\%,
   which is the largest one among all reported ferroelastic materials. Due
   to the non-centrosymmetric structure and electronegativity differences
   between boron and phosphorus atoms, an in-plane spontaneous polarization
   of 1.63 x 10(-10) C m(-1) occurs in BP5. Moreover, the recently hunted
   negative Poisson's ratio property, is also observed in BP5. As an
   indirect semiconductor with a band gap of 1.34 eV, BP5 displays
   outstanding optical and electronic properties, for instance strongly
   anisotropic visible-light absorption and high carrier mobility. Finally,
   we demonstrate that AlN (0 1 0) surface could be a suitable substrate
   for epitaxy growth of BP5 monolayer. Due to the rich and extraordinary
   properties of BP5, it's considered to be a potential nanomaterial for
   designing electromechanical or optoelectronic devices, such as
   nonvolatile memory with conveniently readable/writeable capability.}},

Abstract = {{Metallic glasses (MGs) possess large elastic limit and high strength,
   but unfortunately they are of limited commercial utility due to their
   macroscopic brittle nature. Here, we report that a chiral nanolattice
   can be used to design large-scale MGs with negative Poisson's ratio,
   large elastic deformation capability, extensive hardening, and large
   ductility. Furthermore, the mechanical behaviors of the metallic glass
   chiral nanolattice (MGCN) can be significantly altered through changing
   the thickness and length of the ligaments in the nanolattice. An
   exceptional combination of high strength and ductility is observed for
   MGCN with thin and long ligaments, wherein the sample density is only
   twice that of water. The deformation mechanism that characterizes the
   chiral topology is a combination of rotation of the nodes with bending
   and extension of the ligaments, leading to the extraordinary mechanical
   behaviors. The present study not only offers a potential solution to
   mitigating the brittleness of MGs, but also provides some guidelines in
   designing large-scale MG meta-materials for prospective applications in
   the fields of acoustics and energy absorption.}},

Abstract = {{We utilized molecular statics (MS) simulations to investigate the

   results show that the SLBP has a negative in-plane Poisson's ratio in
   the zigzag direction when the applied strain along the armchair
   direction exceeds 0.018. We show that the interplay between bond
   stretching and bond rotating modes determines the in-plane Poisson's
   ratio behavior. While the bond stretching mode always tends to increase
   the in-plane auxeticity, the bond rotating mode might increase or
   decrease the in-plane auxeticity. Furthermore, we show that graphite
   also exhibits an in-plane negative Poisson's ratio at finite strains due
   to a similar mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{Effective Young's modulus and Poisson's ratios of two-layered
   cylindrical hollow tubes made of cubic crystals (auxetics and
   nonauxetics) are considered. An analysis of longitudinal tension of
   stretching tubes is performed within the framework of
   curvilinear-anisotropic elasticity and Saint-Venant's approximation.
   Analytical dependences of effective Young's modulus on the compliance
   coefficients of the initial crystals and layer thickness as ratio of
   composites auxetics-nonauxetics are obtained. Deviations from the rule
   of mixtures predictions which increase with increasing Young's modulus
   of initial nonauxetics are demonstrated. It is found that effective
   Poisson's ratios of two-layered tubes depend on the ratio of their
   thicknesses, the dimensionless combinations of compliance coefficients
   and a dimensionless radial distance. An effect of tube components on
   negativeness of effective Poisson's ratio of the composite
   auxetics-nonauxetics proved to be strongly dependent on the value of
   Young's modulus for nonauxetic component. It is shown that effective
   Poisson's ratios for some characteristics of the initial crystals and
   ratios of layer thicknesses may fall outside the limits on Poisson's
   ratios of isotropic materials. It is shown that many two-layered tubes
   composed of pairs of nonauxetics can have large negative effective
   Poisson's ratios.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes an in-plane negative area compressibility (NAC)
   material not due to Lifshitz mode, but due to all around in-plane
   pressure. The NAC system consists of an array of two-dimensional
   material in the form of n-sided polygon with n/2 number of connecting
   rods, where n is an even number. Two types of NAC microstructural
   geometries are introduced herein: 8-sided polygon in square array and
   6-sided polygon in hexagonal array. The polygons are permitted to change
   in shape - and hence change in area - at constant side lengths with
   accompanying translational motion of the connecting rods, thereby
   changing the overall area of the cell. Results reveal that negative
   compressibility is observed in the square array NAC when the material
   shape is in between a regular octagon and a square, and in the hexagonal
   array NAC when the material shape is in between a regular hexagon and an
   equilateral triangle.}},

Abstract = {{All types of thin-walled tube with different configurations were studied
   to determine their crashworthiness performances. A novel single-cell
   tapered elliptical tube is proposed in this paper. First, the
   crashworthiness performance of the single-cell tapered elliptical tube
   subjected to different oblique impacts was compared with those of other
   tubes with different configurations (straight, tapered, and multi-cell
   tapered) and different cross-sections (square, rectangular, and
   circular). It can be found that the single-cell tapered elliptical tube
   shows a better crashworthiness performance at multiple loading angles by
   comparing the specific energy absorption values and minimizing the peak
   crushing force. Second, to simplify the optimization process, the radial
   basis function model combined with the design-of-experiments method was
   utilized. Third, to determine the ideal radial rate f, the taper angle
   and the thickness t of the wall of the single-cell tapered elliptical
   tube, this paper adopted the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II
   to maximize the specific energy absorption and to minimize the peak
   crushing force. When determining the effect of the uncertainty in the
   loading angle, two different weighting-factor cases (case 1 and case 2)
   can be considered. In both cases, the optimized single-cell tapered
   elliptical tube has a better crashworthiness performance than tubes with
   other different cross-sections do. The design has a great influence on
   the optimization results. In comparison with the original single-cell
   tapered elliptical tube, in case 1, the composite specific energy
   absorption index under multiple oblique loading of the optimal tube
   increases by 12.81\% and the peak crushing force at 0 degrees decreases
   by 16.66\% and, in case 2, the specific energy absorption index under
   multiple oblique loading increases by 11.8\% and the peak crushing force
   at 0 degrees decreases by 12.83\%.}},

Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{26}},

Abstract = {{Customarily, in-plane auxeticity and synclastic bending behavior (i.e.
   out-of-plane auxeticity) are not independent, being the latter a
   manifestation of the former. Basically, this is a feature of
   three-dimensional bodies. At variance, two-dimensional bodies have more
   freedom to deform than three-dimensional ones. Here, we exploit this
   peculiarity and propose a two-dimensional honeycomb microstructure with
   out-of-plane auxetic behavior opposite to the in-plane one. With a
   suitable choice of the lattice constitutive parameters, in its continuum
   description such a structure can achieve the whole range of values for
   the bending Poisson coefficient, while retaining a membranal Poisson
   coefficient equal to 1. In particular, this structure can reach the
   extreme values, -1 and +1, of the bending Poisson coefficient.
   Analytical calculations are supported by numerical simulations, showing
   the accuracy of the continuum formulas in predicting the response of the
   discrete structure.}},

Abstract = {{The main objective of this study was to fabricate poly (e-caprolactone)
   (PCL)-based auxetic nanofiber membranes and characterize them for their
   mechanical and physicochemical properties. As a first step, the PCL
   nanofibers were fabricated by electrospinning with two different
   thicknesses of 40 pm (called PCL thin membrane) and 180 pm (called PCL
   thick membrane). In the second step, they were tailored into auxetic
   patterns using femtosecond laser cut technique. The physicochemical and
   mechanical properties of the auxetic nanofiber membranes were studied
   and compared with the conventional electrospun PCL nanofibers
   (non-auxetic nano fiber membranes) as a control. The results showed that
   there were no significant changes observed among them in terms of their
   chemical functionality and thermal property. However, there was a
   notable difference observed in the mechanical properties. For instance,
   the thin auxetic nanofiber membrane showed the magnitude of elongation
   almost ten times higher than the control, which clearly demonstrates the
   high flexibility of auxetic nanofiber membranes. This is because that
   the auxetic nanofiber membranes have lesser rigidity than the control
   nanofibers under the same load which could be due to the rotational
   motion of the auxetic structures. The major finding of this study is
   that the auxetic PCL nanofiber membranes are highly flexible (10-fold
   higher elongation capacity than the conventional PCL nanofibers) and
   have tunable mechanical properties. Therefore, the auxetic PCL nanofiber
   membranes may serve as a potent material in various biomedical
   applications, in particular, tissue engineering where scaffolds with
   mechanical cues play a major role.}},

Abstract = {{Considering the infection heterogeneity of different types of edges
   (lines and edges in the triangle in a network), we formulate and analyze
   an novel SIS model with cluster based mean-field approach for a network.
   We mainly focus on how network clustering influences network structure
   and the disease spreading over the network. In networks with double
   poisson distributions, power law-poisson distribution, poisson-power law
   distributions and double power law distributions, we find that cluster
   is positive(the clustering coefficient is increasing on the expected
   number of triangles) when the average degree of lines is fixed and the
   moment of triangles is less than some threshold. Once the moment of
   triangles exceeds that threshold, cluster will become negative(the
   clustering coefficient is decreasing on the expected number of
   triangles). For the disease, clustering always increases the basic
   reproduction number of the disease in networks with whether positive
   cluster or negative cluster. It is different from existing results that
   cluster always promotes the disease spread in the homogeneous or
   heterogeneous network.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Cooling may reduce infarct size and improve neurological
   outcomes in patients with ischaemic stroke. In phase II trials, cooling
   awake patients with ischaemic stroke has been shown to be feasible and
   safe, but the effects in functional outcomes has not yet been
   investigated in an adequately sized randomised clinical trial.
   Methods/design: The EuroHYP-1 trial is a multinational, randomised,
   superiority phase III clinical trial with masked outcome assessment
   testing the benefits and harms of therapeutic cooling in awake adult
   patients with acute ischaemic stroke. The outcomes dealt with here
   include the primary outcome the Rankin score (mRS) at day 91 +/-14 days
   after randomisation. The secondary and exploratory outcomes at day 91
   +/-14 days unless otherwise stated encompassing: (1) death or
   dependency, defined as mRS score > 2; (2) death; (3) National Institutes
   of Health Stroke Score; (4) brain infarct size at 48 +/-24 hours; (5)
   EQ-5D-5 L score, and (6) WHODAS 2.0 score. Other outcomes are: the
   primary safety outcome serious adverse events; and the incremental
   cost-effectiveness, and cost utility ratios. The analysis sets include
   (1) the intention-to-treat population, and (2) the per protocol
   population. The sample size is estimated to 800 patients (5\% type 1 and
   20\% type 2 errors). All analyses are adjusted for the
   protocol-specified stratification variables (nationality of centre), and
   the minimisation variables. In the analysis, we use ordinal regression
   (the primary outcome), logistic regression (binary outcomes), general
   linear model (continuous outcomes), and the Poisson or negative binomial
   model (rate outcomes).
   Discussion: Major adjustments compared with the original statistical
   analysis plan encompass: (1) adjustment of analyses by nationality; (2)
   power calculations for the secondary outcomes; (3) to address the
   multiplicity problem using of a fixed-sequence testing procedure
   starting with the primary outcome followed by the secondary outcomes
   ordered according to falling power; (4) assignment of worst possible
   score to patients who are not alive at the planned date of measurement
   of the continuous scores; (5) improved imputations; (6) outline of a
   supplementary exploratory analysis of the temperature measurements and
   time to death; and (7) substantial reduction of sample size.}},

   of the Poisson's ratio in auxetic directions as well as appearance of a
   negative Poisson's ratio in formerly non-auxetic directions. A measure
   of auxeticity was introduced to estimate quantitatively an enhancement

Title = {{Micro-spatial distribution of malaria cases and control strategies at
   ward level in Gwanda district, Matabeleland South, Zimbabwe}},
Journal = {{MALARIA JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{NOV 21}},
Abstract = {{Background: Although there has been a decline in the number of malaria
   cases in Zimbabwe since 2010, the disease remains the biggest public
   health threat in the country. Gwanda district, located in Matabeleland
   South Province of Zimbabwe has progressed to the malaria pre-elimination
   phase. The aim of this study was to determine the spatial distribution
   of malaria incidence at ward level for improving the planning and
   implementation of malaria elimination in the district.
   Methods: The Poisson purely spatial model was used to detect malaria
   clusters and their properties, including relative risk and significance
   levels at ward level. The geographically weighted Poisson regression
   (GWPR) model was used to explore the potential role and significance of
   environmental variables {[}rainfall, minimum and maximum temperature,
   altitude, Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Normalized Difference
   Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI),
   rural/urban] and malaria control strategies {[}indoor residual spraying
   (IRS) and long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs)] on the spatial
   patterns of malaria incidence at ward level.
   Results: Two significant clusters (p < 0.05) of malaria cases were
   identified: (1) ward 24 south of Gwanda district and (2) ward 9 in the
   urban municipality, with relative risks of 5.583 and 4.316,
   respectively. The semiparametric-GWPR model with both local and global
   variables had higher performance based on AICc (70.882) compared to
   global regression (74.390) and GWPR which assumed that all variables
   varied locally (73.364). The semiparametric-GWPR captured the spatially
   non-stationary relationship between malaria cases and minimum
   temperature, NDVI, NDWI, and altitude at the ward level. The influence
   of LLINs, IRS and rural or urban did not vary and remained in the model
   as global terms. NDWI (positive coefficients) and NDVI (range from
   negative to positive coefficients) showed significant association with
   malaria cases in some of the wards. The IRS had a protection effect on
   malaria incidence as expected.
   Conclusions: Malaria incidence is heterogeneous even in low-transmission
   zones including those in pre-elimination phase. The relationship between
   malaria cases and NDWI, NDVI, altitude, and minimum temperature may vary
   at local level. The results of this study can be used in planning and
   implementation of malaria control strategies at district and ward
   levels.}},

Abstract = {{Protecting building, critical infrastructure and military vehicles from
   Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) has become a critical task. This
   study aims to examine the performance of a new protective system
   utilizing auxetic honeycomb-cored sandwich panels for mitigation of
   shock loads from close-in and contact detonations of high explosives.
   Both field blast tests and drop weight tests were performed using the
   proposed sandwiches as a shield for concrete panels in combination with
   conventional steel protective plates. The combined shield was found to
   be effective in protecting reinforced concrete structures against severe
   impact and close-in blast loadings. The honeycomb core with re-entrant
   hexagonal cells shows evident auxetic characteristics which contribute
   substantially to outstanding force mitigation and blast-resistance
   performances of such sandwich panels. Numerical simulations showed good
   agreement with the experimental results. The proposed auxetic panels
   were found to perform better than conventional honeycomb panels of the
   same size, areal density and material. Both were found to boost the
   energy absorption of the monolithic steel plate by a factor of 2.5 by
   changing its deformation pattern under close-in blast loading. In
   addition, a combination of the steel plate and an auxetic sandwich panel
   has aerial specific energy absorption (ASEA) higher than either of them,
   showing great potential for the development of lightweight blast
   protection of civil, mining, military, nuclear infrastructure and
   vehicles. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Directions dependence of the elastic properties of a 3D augmented

Abstract = {{In this paper, a 3D augmented re-entrant cellular structure (ARCS) is
   proposed and its Poisson's ratios and elastic properties can bemodulated
   in a wide range. Based on the classical beam theory, the elastic
   properties on the principle directions are obtained as functions of the
   structural parameters and then are verified by finite element method
   (FEM) simulations. Compared with the classical 3D re-entrant cellular
   structure (RCS), the Young's moduli of the new 3D structure on the
   principal directions show a significant increase, and the Poisson's
   ratio can be tunable with the control of the internal parameters of
   cellular structure. In addition, the elastic properties on off-axis
   directions are obtained by analytical solutions, which show that the
   Young's moduli on the off-axis directions are much lower than the
   principle ones. In addition, the shear moduli also show strong
   dependence on the loading directions. Moreover, by stretching in the
   principal directions, the ARCS expands in all vertical directions when
   the moduli ratio is below 0.5. However, stretching in the off-axis
   directions, the Poisson's ratios are no longer negative in its vertical
   directions. The results suggest a possible approach to design new
   auxetic materials with tunable Poisson's ratios for engineering
   applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Fluctuations in the incidence of type 1 diabetes in the United States
   from 2001 to 2015: a longitudinal study}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{NOV 8}},
Abstract = {{Background: While the United States has the largest number of children
   with type 1 diabetes mellitus, less is known regarding adult-onset
   disease. The present study utilizes nationwide data to compare the
   incidence of type 1 diabetes in youth (0-19 years) to that of adults
   (20-64 years).
   Methods: In this longitudinal study, the Clinformatics (R) Data Mart
   Database was used, which contains information from 61 million
   commercially insured Americans (years 2001-2015). Incidence rates and
   exact Poisson 95\% confidence intervals were calculated by age group,
   sex, census division, and year of diagnosis. Changes in rates over time
   were assessed by negative binomial regression.
   Results: Overall, there were 32,476 individuals who developed type 1
   diabetes in the cohort. The incidence rate was greatest in youth aged
   10-14 years (45.5 cases/100,000 person-years); however, because
   adulthood spans over a longer period than childhood, there was a greater
   number of new cases in adults than in youth (n = 19,174 adults; n =
   13,302 youth). Predominance in males was evident by age 10 and persisted
   throughout adulthood. The male to female incidence rate ratio was 1.32
   (95\% CI 1.30-1.35). The incidence rate of type 1 diabetes in youth
   increased by 1.9\% annually from 2001 to 2015 (95\% CI 1.1-2.7\%; P <
   0.001), but there was variation across regions. The greatest increases
   were in the East South Central (3.8\%/year; 95\% CI 2.0-5.6\%; P <
   0.001) and Mountain divisions (3.1\%/year; 95\% CI 1.6-4.6\%; P <
   0.001). There were also increases in the East North Central (2.7\%/year;
   P = 0.010), South Atlantic (2.4\%/year; P < 0.001), and West North
   Central divisions (2.4\%/year; P < 0.001). In adults, however, the
   incidence decreased from 2001 to 2015 (-1.3\%/year; 95\% CI -2.3\% to
   -0.4\%; P = 0.007). Greater percentages of cases were diagnosed in
   January, July, and August for both youth and adults. The number of new
   cases of type 1 diabetes (ages 0-64 years) in the United States is
   estimated at 64,000 annually (27,000 cases in youth and 37,000 cases in
   adults).
   Conclusions: There are more new cases of type 1 diabetes occurring
   annually in the United States than previously recognized. The increase
   in incidence rates in youth, but not adults, suggests that the
   precipitating factors of youth-onset disease may differ from those of
   adult-onset disease.}},

Abstract = {{Elastic properties of model crystalline systems, in which the particles

   was investigated. It has been shown that the hard sphere nanolayers
   introduced into Yukawa crystals allow one to control the elastic
   properties of the system. It has been also found that the introduction
   of the Yukawa monolayers to the hard sphere crystal induces auxeticity
   in the direction, while maintaining the negative Poisson's ratio in the
   direction, thus expanding the partial auxeticity of the system to an
   additional important crystallographic direction.}},

Abstract = {{An explicit surface potential and subthreshold current model for novel
   Dual Metal Gate (DMG) Asymmetric Vacuum (AV) as gate dielectric Schottky
   Barrier (SB) Cylindrical Gate All Around (CGAA) MOSFET with the
   incorporation of localized charges (N-f) is developed to provide
   excellent immunity against threshold voltage (V-th) degradation due to
   hot carriers. Hot carrier induced Localized Charges (LC) either positive
   or negative leads to degrade the threshold of the device. The major
   advantage of the proposed DMG-AV-SB-CGAA MOSFET is that it mitigates the
   ambipolar behavior thus offering very good on current to off Current
   ratio; and also reduces the electron temperature which leads to less hot
   carrier generation thus lesser degradation in Vth and improved Hot
   Carrier reliability.
   The surface potential is determined for three different regions by
   solving 1-D Poisson's and 2-D Laplace equation through separation of
   variable method to facilitate an optimal model for calculating the
   subthreshold drain current from Si-SiO2 interface boundary. The
   developed model results are in good agreement with that of ATLAS-TCAD
   simulation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This work intents to put forth the results of a classical molecular
   dynamics study to investigate the temperature dependent elastic
   constants of monolayer hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) between 100 and
   1000 K for the first time using strain fluctuation method. The
   temperature dependence of out-of-plane fluctuations (ripples) is
   quantified and is explained using continuum theory of membranes. At low
   temperatures, negative in-plane thermal expansion is observed and at
   high temperatures, a transition to positive thermal expansion has been
   observed due to the presence of thermally excited ripples. The decrease
   of Young's modulus, bulk modulus, shear modulus and Poisson's ratio with
   increase in temperature has been analyzed. The thermal rippling in h-BN
   leads to strong anharmonic behaviour that causes large deviation from
   the isotropic elasticity. A detailed study shows that the strong thermal
   rippling in large systems is also responsible for the softening of
   elastic constants in h-BN. From the determined values of elastic
   constants and elastic moduli, it has been elucidated that 2D h-BN sheets
   meet the Born's mechanical stability criterion in the investigated
   temperature range. The variation of longitudinal and shear velocities
   with temperature is also calculated from the computed values of elastic
   constants and elastic moduli. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{An extensive investigation of work function modulated trapezoidal
   recessed channel MOSFET}},

Abstract = {{The concept of silicon on insulator (SOI) and grooved gate help to
   lessen the short channel effects (SCEs). Again the work function
   modulation along the metal gate gives a better drain current due to the
   uniform electric field along the channel. So all these concepts are
   combined and used in the proposed MOSFET structure for more improved
   performance. In this work, trapezoidal recessed channel silicon on
   insulator (TRC-SOI) MOSFET and work function modulated trapezoidal
   recessed channel silicon on insulator (WFM-TRC-SOI) MOSFET are compared
   with DC and RF parameters and later linearity of both the devices is
   tested. An analytical model is formulated by using a 2-D Poisson's
   equation and develops a compact equation for threshold voltage using
   minimum surface potential. In this work we analyze the effect of
   negative junction depth and the corner angle on various device
   parameters such as minimum surface potential, sub-threshold slope (SS),
   drain induced barrier lowering (DIBL) and threshold voltage. The
   analysis interprets that the switching performance of WFM-TRC-SOI MOSFET
   surpasses TRC-SOI MOSFET in terms of high I-on/I-off ratio and also the
   proposed structure can minimize the short channel effects (SCEs) in RF
   application. The validity of proposed model has been verified with
   simulation result performed on Sentaurus TCAD device simulator. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with the deformation of a chiral elastic bar
   subjected to a thermal field. The bar is composed of two different
   materials welded together along the surface of separation. The behavior
   of chiral materials is of interest for the investigation of bones and
   auxetic materials. We study the deformation of isotropic chiral
   materials by using the equilibrium theory of Cosserat thermoelasticity.
   The temperature variation is assumed to be a polynomial in the axial
   coordinate. It is shown that a plane thermal field, in contrast with the
   result predicted by the theory of achiral materials, produces torsional
   effects. The solution of the problem could be used to investigate the
   behavior of bone implants and other compound cylinders. The method is
   applied to the case of a circular bar reinforced by a longitudinal
   circular rod.}},

Abstract = {{Since diplomatic relations were established between China and Korea, the
   two countries have expanded their relationships, especially in trading
   commodities and services. However, in recent years, as tariff levels
   have fallen, China has sought to implement other protectionist
   mechanisms. The use of non-tariff measures has added another dimension
   to international trade activities that need to be better understood. The
   paper analyses the impacts that two forms of non-tariff measures,
   technical barriers to trade (TBT) and sanitary and phytosanitary
   measures, have on Korean exports to China. To measure the impacts, we
   use an adapted version of the gravity model and the Poisson
   pseudo-maximum likelihood method. The results show that Chinese sanitary
   and phytosanitary measures, estimated using both the coverage ratio and
   the frequency index, have positive correlations with Korean agricultural
   exports; however, Chinese TBT measures, when estimated by the coverage
   ratio, were found to depress Korean manufacturing exports and exports as
   a whole. However, using the frequency index, Chinese TBT measures were
   found to have a statistically insignificant negative impact on Korean
   exports to China.}},

   indentation}},
Journal = {{MECHANICS OF MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{114}},
Pages = {{107-118}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Spherical indentation has a unique deformation pattern and shows a
   different deformation behavior compared with other kinds of
   indentations. In this paper, a special feature of the loading curve for
   spherical indentation was found, the loading curve transforms from
   concavity to convexity. The traditional Meyer's law failed to cover the
   transition phenomenon accurately, so a cubic-polynomial empirical model
   was proposed based on experiment results and theoretical analysis.
   Comparison results proved that this model gave a good description to the
   both loading curve and tangent slope curve of spherical indentation.
   Further study was conducted using the proposed model and finite element
   simulation method. Parameters including hardening index(n), elastic
   modulus(E) to yield stress(Y) ratio, Poisson's ratio(v), indenter
   radius(R) and friction coefficient(mu) were analyzed on their influence
   on the shape of loading curve. It was found that n had a decisive
   influence to the concavity-convexity transition phenomenon. When n <=
   0.1 the quadratic coefficient C-2 will be negative and the
   concavity-convexity transition phenomenon will never occur. When n >
   0.1, the loading curve transforms from concavity to convexity. Further
   studies found that two deformation patterns i.e. vertical indenting and
   radial expansion were the reason of the concavity convexity transition
   phenomenon. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Mechanical metamaterials exhibit properties and functionalities that
   cannot be realized in conventional materials. Originally, the field
   focused on achieving unusual (zero or negative) values for familiar
   mechanical parameters, such as density, Poisson's ratio or
   compressibility, but more recently, new classes of metamaterials -
   including shape-morphing, topological and nonlinear metamaterials - have
   emerged. These materials exhibit exotic functionalities, such as pattern
   and shape transformations in response to mechanical forces,
   unidirectional guiding of motion and waves, and reprogrammable stiffness
   or dissipation. In this Review, we identify the design principles
   leading to these properties and discuss, in particular, linear and
   mechanism-based metamaterials (such as origami-based and kirigami-based
   metamaterials), metamaterials harnessing instabilities and frustration,
   and topological metamaterials. We conclude by outlining future
   challenges for the design, creation and conceptualization of advanced

Abstract = {{Lattice structures are used in the design of metamaterials to achieve
   unusual physical, mechanical, or biological properties. The properties
   of such metamaterials result from the topology of the lattice
   structures, which are usually three-dimensionally (3D) printed. To
   incorporate advanced functionalities into metamaterials, the surface of
   the lattice structures may need to be ornamented with
   functionality-inducing features, such as nano-patterns or electronic
   devices. Given our limited access to the internal surfaces of lattice
   structures, free-form ornamentation is currently impossible. We present
   lattice structures that are folded from initially flat states and show
   that they could bear arbitrarily complex surface ornaments at different
   scales. We identify three categories of space-filling polyhedra as the
   basic unit cells of the cellular structures and, for each of those,
   propose a folding pattern. We also demonstrate ``sequential
   self-folding{''} of flat constructs to 3D lattices. Furthermore, we
   folded auxetic mechanical metamaterials from flat sheets and measured
   the deformation-driven change in their negative Poisson's ratio.
   Finally, we show how free-form 3D ornaments could be applied on the
   surface of flat sheets with nanometer resolution. Together, these
   folding patterns and experimental techniques present a unique platform
   for the fabrication of metamaterials with unprecedented combination of
   physical properties and surface-driven functionalities.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the variability of the shear modulus of hexagonal

Title = {{Design and characterization of rounded reentrant honeycomb patterns for
   lightweight and rigid auxetic structures}},
Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In the past decades, auxetic structures have received great attention
   because of their unique properties and outstanding performance over the
   traditional materials. However, the inherent porosity significantly
   reduce the moduli of the structures, making auxetic structures
   inappropriate for load-bearing components. This paper introduces a
   rounded re-entrant honeycomb (RH) pattern, in which the rounded corners
   stiffen the traditional RH pattern by suppressing the hinging mechanism.
   Four design parameters were identified to define a rounded RH unit cell,
   and the effect of each of them on structure properties was numerically
   studied. The results demonstrated the extended tunable range of
   mechanical properties and the possibility of building lightweight and
   stiffer structures, as well as significantly improved tensile and shear
   moduli. It is also noticed that the Poisson's ratio shifts towards
   positive as the radius of the rounded corner increases. Several design
   strategies were proposed for achieving different design goals. The
   proposed rounded RH pattern could be an alternative for the existing RH
   pattern design, especially in the applications requesting for the
   lightweight and rigid auxetic structure.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Moran eigenvector spatial filtering (MESF) is a novel methodology in the
   spatially varying coefficients tradition promoted in spatial statistics,
   quantitative geography, and statistical ecology that deals with spatial
   autocorrelation in georeferenced data. Its Moran Coefficient based
   estimators exhibit statistical properties of unbiasedness, efficiency,
   and consistency. Evidence is accumulating that it also exhibits
   robustness, or good performance with georeferenced data drawn from not
   only normal, but also at least Poisson and binomial, probability
   distributions. This paper further explores this performance. In doing
   so, it addresses the sensitivity of MESF results to changing: (1) the
   employed spatial weights matrix specification for constructing MESF
   synthetic variates, in space, space-time, and spatial flows network
   structures; (2) the design of Monte Carlo simulation experiments; (3)
   cross-validation type imputation estimators; (4) the nature of embedded
   geographical dependence to include negative spatial autocorrelation (SA)
   components; and, (5) the SA index (e.g., the Geary Ratio) basis of
   eigenvector spatial filter (ESF) estimators. Empirical illustrations

Abstract = {{The unique structure of negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) materials
   provides a good energy absorption capacity that has found wide
   application in automotive and aeronautics industries. The present work
   proposes a novel NPR energy absorption structure installed between the
   bumper and anti-collision beam of automobiles for improving pedestrian
   lower leg protection. The performance of the proposed NPR structure
   based on tibia acceleration, knee bending angle, and knee shear
   displacement is evaluated by comparison with the performance of a
   conventional energy absorption structure. The performance of the
   proposed structure is further improved by conducting multi-objective
   design optimization with consideration for the perturbation induced by
   parameter uncertainties. For optimization, a parametric model of the NPR
   structure is first established based on the relationships between
   parameters. To promote computational efficiency, an optimal Latin
   hypercube sampling technique and the dual response surface method are
   combined to build surrogate models between responses and inputs. A
   multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm and six sigma
   criteria are then applied to obtain the optimal design parameters of the
   structure. The optimization results are validated by comparisons with
   the results of multi-objective deterministic optimization. The
   comparison results show that the proposed NPR energy absorption
   structure improves pedestrian lower leg protection significantly, and
   its performance is further improved by the proposed multi-objective
   robust design optimization. This study serves as a good example of the
   safety promotion provided by applying NPR structures with enhanced
   energy absorption capacity in vehicles.}},

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{72}},
Pages = {{237-246}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The mechanical and solvent transport properties of model whey protein
   hydrogels were characterized by mechanical indentation. Using
   cylindrical indenters with a large size range, 0.2-6 mm, it is confirmed
   that most of the force relaxation measured during indentation is
   poroelastic in nature, i.e. due to solvent transport. An additional,
   smaller, viscoelastic relaxation is observed with a relaxation time of
   similar to 10 s. A new microindentation apparatus was built to test
   hydrogels using small indenters, resulting in constant solvent
   diffusivities and permeabilites with indenter sizes 0.2-1 mm, at roughly
   similar to 4.10(-10) m(2)/s and similar to 5.10(-18) m(2) respectively,
   regardless of the swelling conditions considered. Relaxations, however,
   do not reach constant force values at very long times, increasing the
   uncertainty of the poroviscoelastic analysis. Despite this, the auxetic
   behaviour of whey protein hydrogels is highly likely, as inferred from
   consistent drained Poisson's ratios lower than 0. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The behavior of the f-electrons in the lanthanides and actinides governs
   important macroscopic properties but their pressure and temperature

   electron offers a case study with its iso-structural volume collapse
   from the gamma-phase to the alpha-phase ending in a critical point
   (p(C), V-C, T-C), unique among the elements, whose mechanism remains
   controversial. Here, we present longitudinal (c(L)) and transverse sound
   speeds (c(T)) versus pressure from higher than room temperature to T-C
   for the first time. While c(L) experiences a non-linear dip at the
   volume collapse, c(T) shows a step-like change. This produces very
   peculiar macroscopic properties: the minimum in the bulk modulus becomes
   more pronounced, the step-like increase of the shear modulus diminishes
   and the Poisson's ratio becomes negative-meaning that cerium becomes
   auxetic. At the critical point itself cerium lacks any compressive
   strength but offers resistance to shear.}},

Abstract = {{High-luminosity modern accelerators, like the Relativistic Heavy Ion
   Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) and Large Hadron
   Collider (LHC) at European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN),
   inherently have event pile-up scenarios which significantly contribute
   to physics events as a background. While state-of-the-art tracking
   algorithms and detector concepts take care of these event pile-up
   scenarios, several offline analytical techniques are used to remove such
   events from the physics analysis. It is still difficult to identify the
   remaining pile-up events in an event sample for physics analysis. Since
   the fraction of these events is significantly small, it may not be as
   serious of an issue for other analyses as it would be for an
   event-by-event analysis. Particularly when the characteristics of the
   multiplicity distribution are observable, one needs to be very careful.
   In the present work, we demonstrate how a small fraction of residual
   pile-up events can change the moments and their ratios of an
   event-by-event net-proton multiplicity distribution, which are sensitive
   to the dynamical fluctuations due to the QCD critical point. For this
   study, we assume that the individual event-by-event proton and
   antiproton multiplicity distributions follow Poisson, negative binomial,
   or binomial distributions. We observe a significant effect in cumulants
   and their ratios of net-proton multiplicity distributions due to pile-up
   events, particularly at lower energies. It might be crucial to estimate
   the fraction of pile-up events in the data sample while interpreting the
   experimental observable for the critical point.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the effects of Ti substitutional additions on the
   mechanical and electrochemical corrosion behavior of beta-Ta5Si3 were
   investigated through both theoretical calculation and experiment.
   Initially, first-principles calculations, based on density functional
   theory, were used to guide compositional design, according to the
   calculation of mechanical parameters (for example, bulk modulus, shear
   modulus, Young's modulus, the shear modulus/bulk modulus ratio and
   Poisson's ratio). This analysis showed that optimum mechanical
   performance may be achieved through Ta atoms in the Ta20Si12 unit cell
   being replaced by two Ti atoms. Subsequently, both the binary
   beta-TasSi(3) coating and the optimized Ti-alloyed beta-Ta5Si3 coating
   (i.e., beta-(Ta0.902Ti0.098)(5)Si-3) were deposited onto Ti-6AI-4V
   substrates using a double cathode glow discharge plasma method. Both
   as-deposited coatings exhibited a tetragonal crystal structure with fine
   equiaxed grains similar to 4 nm in diameter. The mechanical properties
   of the coatings were determined by both nanoindentation and Vickers
   indentation techniques, and their electrochemical corrosion behavior was
   examined by potentiodynamic polarization, electrochemical impedance
   spectroscopy (EIS) and Mott-Schottky analysis in naturally aerated 0.9
   wt.\% NaCl solution at 37 degrees C. These investigations showed that
   the addition of Ti significantly improved the damage resistance of
   beta-Ta5Si3, with little negative impact on its corrosion resistance.

Abstract = {{Metallic aerogels have attracted intense attention due to their superior
   properties, such as high electrical conductivity, ultralow densities,
   and large specific surface area. The preparation of metal aerogels with
   high efficiency and controllability remains challenge. A 3D freeze
   assembling printing technique integrated with drop-on-demand inkjet
   printing and freeze casting are proposed for metallic aerogels
   preparation. This technique enables tailoring both the macrostructure
   and microstructure of silver nanowire aerogels (SNWAs) by integrating
   programmable 3D printing and freeze casting, respectively. The density
   of the printed SNWAs is controllable, which can be down to 1.3 mg
   cm(-3). The ultralight SNWAs reach high electrical conductivity of 1.3 S
   cm(-1) and exhibit excellent compressive resilience under 50\%
   compressive strain. Remarkably, the printing methodology also enables
   tuning aerogel architectures with designed Poisson's ratio (from
   negative to positive). Moreover, these aerogel architechtures with
   tunable Poisson's ratio present highly electromechanical stability under
   high compressive and tensile strain (both strain up to 20\% with fully
   recovery).}},

Abstract = {{Objective: This study aimed to investigate the influence of depressive
   and anxiety symptoms in young mothers on their perception in relation to
   their children's oral health-related quality of life (COHRQoL).
   Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out in Pelotas, Southern
   Brazil, and it was nested in a cohort of adolescent mothers having their
   prenatal care in public health service, starting in 2008. When the
   children were aged 24-36 months, they and their mothers were interviewed
   and submitted to clinical examination by a trained team. Socioeconomic,
   educational, behavioural and psychological assessments were collected in
   the interview and oral examination investigated caries and gingival
   bleeding (in mothers) and caries and dental trauma (in children).
   Maternal perception of impact on COHRQoL was evaluated by Early
   Childhood Oral Health Impact Scale (ECOHIS). The outcome in the present
   study was the occurrence of impact on COHRQoL (ECOHIS >= 2), that is the
   presence of at least one ECOHIS item reported as occasionally (score 2),
   often (score 3) or very often (score 4). Analysis was conducted using
   Poisson regression with robust variance and obtained prevalence ratios
   (PR) and respective 95\% confidence intervals (CI).
   Results: This study comprised 537 mother-child dyads. After adjustment,
   higher scores of COHRQoL remained significantly associated with
   depressive symptoms (PR=1.80, 95\% CI: 1.36-2.38) and maternal anxiety
   symptoms (PR=2.28, 95\% CI: 1.72-3.00). Mothers with anxiety symptoms or
   depressive symptoms had a prevalence of impact 91\% higher when compared
   with mothers without any symptoms (PR=1.91; CI 95\% 1.35-2.68), and
   mothers with both symptoms had almost 2.5 times higher risk of
   perception of negative impact on COHRQoL (PR=2.48; CI 95\% 1.78-3.45).
   Conclusion: Poorer COHRQoL was associated with maternal depression and
   anxiety symptoms.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The adherence of the heart to physical laws, such as
   Laplace's Law, may act as a measure of the organ's relative efficiency.
   Allometric relationships were investigated to assess the heart's
   efficiency concerning end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes, cardiac
   pressurization energy, cardiac output and mass.
   Methods: Data to generate allometric relationships was obtained using a
   literature search, identifying heart and lung data across different
   mammalian and bird species. Statistical analysis was carried out using
   ordinary least squares (OLS) estimation.
   Results: Near isometric relationships exist between body mass and seven
   parameters indicating no ``efficiency of size{''} with scaling of the
   heart, and size-matching of the heart to the lungs and whole body. Even
   though there was equal efficiency in pressurization energy generation,
   cardiac output was maximally efficient in small mammals < 10 kg and
   birds; the human heart reached only 71\% efficiency. This loss in
   cardiac efficiency with increasing body mass can be explained by the
   aortic cross-section that scales following the three-quarter allometry
   law, compared to end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes that scale
   isometrically. The heart is therefore throttled by a relatively small
   aorta at large body size.
   Conclusions: Mammalian and avian hearts operate at similar efficiencies,
   demonstrating a high degree of symmorphosis, however cardiac output
   efficiency decreases in larger animals due to a relatively negative
   aortic cross-section allometry. This work has a myriad of potential
   applications including explaining cardiac dysfunction in athletes,
   patient-prosthesis mismatch in aortic valve replacement and why heavy
   exercise is associated with a worse prognosis than mild or moderate
   exercise.}},

Abstract = {{Plane-wave theory for fluid-embedded isotropic plates is often used in
   ultrasonic guided-wave applications, and to estimate wall thickness,
   corrosion, or sound velocities in plates and pipes. In such structures,
   measured ultrasonic transmission through the solid material is affected
   by acoustic beam diffraction effects, and the results may deviate from
   plane-wave descriptions, which are insufficient to describe the complex
   effects that occur. When exciting a fluid-embedded steel plate with a
   pulsed ultrasonic beam at normal incidence, resonance frequency
   downshift, axial sound pressure level increase, and beam narrowing have
   been observed, for measured resonance peaks in the frequency regions of
   certain leaky Lamb mode branches of the plate. In the ranges of other
   leaky Lamb mode branches, the observed effects are different.
   Measurements, finite element, and angular spectrum modeling are used to
   indicate a close connection between these beam diffraction phenomena and
   the backward wave characteristics of certain leaky Lamb mode pairs, in
   the frequency and Poisson's ratio regions around coincidence of two Lamb
   mode cutoff frequencies of similar symmetry. In particular, such
   observations made for the steel plate's fundamental
   thickness-extensional (TE) mode appear to be caused by acoustic beam
   excitation of the backward wave regions of the S--2(vl) and S-2(vl)
   leaky Lamb modes.}},

   Microstructures Appearing in the Least Compliant Continuum Bodies}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The paper discusses the problem of manufacturability of the minimum
   compliance designs of the structural elements made of two kinds of
   inhomogeneous materials: the isotropic and cubic. In both the cases the
   unit cost of the design is assumed as equal to the trace of the Hooke
   tensor. The Isotropic Material Design (IMD) delivers the optimal
   distribution of the bulk and shear moduli within the design domain. The
   Cubic Material Design (CMD) leads to the optimal material orientation
   and optimal distribution of the invariant moduli in the body made of the
   material of cubic symmetry. The present paper proves that the varying
   underlying microstructures (i.e., the representative volume elements
   (RVE) constructed of one or two isotropic materials) corresponding to
   the optimal designs constructed by IMD and CMD methods can be recovered
   by matching the values of the optimal moduli with the values of the
   effective moduli of the RVE computed by the theory of homogenization.
   The CMD method leads to a larger set of results, i.e., the set of pairs
   of optimal moduli. Moreover, special attention is focused on proper
   recovery of the microstructures in the auxetic sub-domains of the
   optimal designs.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: We aimed to examine the impact of weather on hospital admissions
   with bronchiolitis in Australia and New Zealand.
   Methods: We collected data for inpatient admissions of infants aged 2-12
   months to seven hospitals in four cities in Australia and New Zealand
   from 2009 until 2011. Correlation of hospital admissions with minimum
   daily temperature, wind speed, relative humidity and rainfall was
   examined using linear, Poisson and negative binomial regression analyses
   as well as general estimated equation models. To account for possible
   lag between exposure to weather and admission to hospital, analyses were
   conducted for time lags of 0-4 weeks.
   Results: During the study period, 3876 patients were admitted to the
   study hospitals. Hospital admissions showed strong seasonality with
   peaks in wintertime, onset in autumn and offset in spring. The onset of
   peak incidence was preceded by a drop in temperature. Minimum
   temperature was inversely correlated with hospital admissions, whereas
   wind speed was directly correlated. These correlations were sustained
   for time lags of up to 4 weeks. Standardised correlation coefficients
   ranged from -0.14 to -0.54 for minimum temperature and from 0.18 to 0.39
   for wind speed. Relative humidity and rainfall showed no correlation
   with hospital admissions in our study.
   Conclusion: A decrease in temperature and increasing wind speed are
   associated with increasing incidence of bronchiolitis hospital
   admissions in Australia and New Zealand.}},

Abstract = {{The dynamic modelling of a simply-supported thin laminated plate subject
   to in-plane excitation is established based on the classic shear theory
   and von Karman nonlinear theory. The method of multiple scales is used
   to determine an approximate solution for the system. According to
   solvability conditions, the nonlinear modulation equations arising from
   the principal parametric resonances are obtained and two possible
   nontrivial solutions are performed. To analyze the nonlinear dynamic
   response of the plate embedded with auxetic layers, 5-layered sandwich
   plate, in which two auxetic elastic layers are alternatively sandwiched
   between three positive Poisson's ratio (PPR) elastic ones, is presented.
   The natural frequency of model (m, n) shows an increase with respect to
   the absolute value of Poisson's ratio. Particularly, the
   amplitude-frequency responses of the laminated plate subject to
   principal parametric resonance are analyzed for different values of
   Poisson's ratio. Moreover, it can be found that for model (m, n), there
   must be some certain value or interval of negative Poisson's ratio
   (NPR), which, results in zero response effect, in other words, the
   in-plane excitation will be ineffective for this model when the
   Poisson's ratio just lies at such a value or interval. Furthermore, it
   can also be observed that the certain interval of Poisson's ratio
   becomes wider with the increase of damping. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, impact testing of auxetic structures filled with strain
   rate sensitive material is presented. Two dimensional missing rib, 2D
   re-entrant honeycomb, and 3D re-entrant honeycomb lattices are
   investigated. Structures are divided into three groups according to type
   of filling: no filling, low expansion polyurethane foam, and ordnance
   gelatine. Samples from each group are tested under quasi-static loading
   and dynamic compression using Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar. Digital
   image correlation is used for assessment of in-plane displacement and
   strain fields. Ratios between quasi-static and dynamic results for
   plateau stresses and specific energy absorption in the plateau are
   calculated. It is found out that not only the manufactured structures,
   but also the wrought material exhibit strain rate dependent properties.
   Evaluation of influence of filling on mechanical properties shows that
   polyurethane increases specific absorbed energy by a factor of 1.05-1.4,
   whereas the effect of gelatine leads to increase of only 5-10\%.
   Analysis of the Poisson's function reveals influence of filling on
   achievable (negative) values of Poisson's ratio, when compared to
   unfilled specimens. The results for the Poisson's function yielded
   apparently different values as the assessed minima of quasi-static
   Poisson's ratio in small deformations are constrained by a factor of 15.}},

Abstract = {{Collapsibility deals with the conditions under which a conditional (on a

   equals the marginal measure of association. In this paper, we discuss
   the average collapsibility of certain well-known measures of
   association, and also with respect to a new measure of association. The
   concept of average collapsibility is more general than collapsibility,
   and requires that the conditional average of an association measure
   equals the corresponding marginal measure. Sufficient conditions for the
   average collapsibility of the association measures are obtained. Some
   interesting counterexamples are constructed and applications to linear,
   Poisson, logistic and negative binomial regression models are discussed.
   An extension to the case of multivariate covariate W is also analyzed.
   Finally, we discuss the collapsibility conditions of some dependence
   measures for survival models and illustrate them for the case of linear
   transformation models.}},

Title = {{Unprecedented mechanical response of the lattice thermal conductivity of
   auxetic carbon crystals}},
Journal = {{CARBON}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{122}},
Pages = {{374-380}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Lattice thermal conductivity (kappa) of bulk materials usually increases
   under compression and decreases under tension, while there are still
   some unusual systems, exhibiting reduced kappa when compressed. However,
   to date it has never been reported for a bulk material, whose kappa is
   substantially enhanced under tensile strain. In this paper, we have
   studied thermal transport of three auxetic carbon crystals: cis-C,
   trans-C and hin-C for short, and their strain responses by performing
   first-principles calculations. It is intriguing to find that their kappa
   are much lower than those of their allotropes, and further decrease
   abnormally under compression. More strikingly, kappa of trans-C (cis-C)
   anomalously increases with tensile strain up to 7\% (6\%) with maximum
   kappa of almost 7 (5) times larger than the unstrained value. The
   abnormal strain dependent kappa are attributed to the dominant role of
   the enhancement of phonon lifetime under stretching, which can be
   further explained from the unique atomic structure of the main chain of
   polydiacetylene in trans-C and cis-C. The weakening of phonon
   anharmonicity is reflected by the enhancement of root mean-square
   displacement values. The reported giant augmentation of kappa may
   inspire intensive research on auxetic carbon crystals as potential
   materials for emerging nanoelectronic devices. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{In the current work, we elaborate two-dimensional metamaterials of
   controlled anisotropy. To that scope, we employ diamond and
   octagon-shaped planar lattices with and without inner links. Using a
   dedicated homogenization technique, we derive closed-form expressions
   for the lattice's effective mechanical properties. We analyse the effect
   of the lattice's configuration on the metamaterial's effective static
   properties, identifying configurations with mechanical attributes
   desirable for morphing, biomedical and mechanical engineering
   applications. We thereafter compute the lattice's wave propagation
   characteristics, deriving a link between the metamaterials' static and
   dynamic properties. In particular, we analyse the longitudinal and shear
   wave phase velocity dependence on the lattice's geometric configuration.
   Thereupon, we identify architectural arrangements for which the phase
   velocity vanishes in certain propagation directions, exhibiting wave
   propagation isolation characteristics. We demonstrate that the detected
   isolation features can systematically arise for lattice architectural
   designs that yield highly anisotropic static properties (thus high
   material moduli ratios) and anti-auxetic material behaviours (thus
   non-negative Poisson's ratio values). (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Chiral structures consisting of circular ring nodes and tangentially
   connected ligaments are engineered systems that exhibit excellent
   flexibility, vibration attenuation, impact resistance performance, etc.
   In this paper, we proposed an innovative hierarchical anti-tetrachiral
   structures based on the auxetic deformation behaviors of
   anti-tetrachiral unit cell at different structural hierarchical levels.
   The in-plane mechanical properties of hierarchical anti-tetrachiral
   metastructures are deduced from strain energy analysis, experimental and
   finite element analysis (FEA) comparisons are employed for verification.
   The in-plane mechanical properties of hierarchical anti-tetrachiral
   metastructures can be remarkably enhanced and manipulated through
   combining the auxetic deformation behaviors of chiral structures and the
   mechanical benefits of structural hierarchy, and its tunable mechanical
   properties can be designed within very large range of modulus and
   Poisson's ratio value. Finally, an innovative hierarchical
   anti-tetrachiral stent is proposed, and the interaction between stent
   and artery vessel are studied, demonstrating the promising industrial
   application potential of hierarchical chiral metastructures. The
   proposed chiral geometry represents a new family of chiral hierarchical
   structures, and the extent of auxeticity and its in-plane mechanical
   properties can be tuned through manipulating node ring size and shape,
   length and thickness, and the hierarchy level, thus achieving desired
   extreme mechanical properties. It is believed that this work can greatly
   expand the potential applications of chiral metamaterials in conformable
   and stretchable electronics, biomedical devices, electronic skin,
   stents, and reconfigurable soft robotics, etc. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{In this work, an analytical model of a 3D re-entrant auxetic cellular
   structure has been established based on energy method. In the model the
   overlapping of the struts as well as axial extension or compression
   (mostly neglected in former studies) were taken into consideration to
   make the model applicable when the struts are relative stubby which is
   common in engineering designs. Analytical solutions for the modulus and
   Poisson's ratios of the cellular structure in all principal directions
   were deduced. To validate the analytical model in present study,
   numerical calculations using brick elements were performed on unit cell
   models with periodic boundary conditions, and comparisons of the present
   model with analytical formulae and experimental results available in
   former literatures were also conducted. The results show that when the
   struts are slender enough, the bending of the struts play decisive role
   on the deformation of the structure and other mechanisms can be ignored;
   while when the struts become relative stubby, all the mechanisms
   including bending, shearing and axial loading need to be considered; The
   often-ignored axial extension or compression term may even play decisive
   role on determining the lateral Poisson's ratio of the structure when
   the struts are relative stubby. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Elastic properties of two novel auxetic 3D cellular structures}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOLIDS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{124}},
Pages = {{46-56}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Based on a 2D cross chiral structure, two novel 3D cross chiral
   structures (structure-1 and structure-2) with negative Poisson's ratios
   were proposed in this paper. Structure-1 could be evolved into
   structure-2 by adding a star structure. Analytical models of the two
   auxetic cellular structures were established based on the Timoshenko
   beam theory. The Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of the cellular
   structures were obtained in all principal directions, which were
   verified by finite element method (FEM). Structure-1 exhibits
   anisotropic auxetic behavior while structure-2 shows uniform auxetic
   behavior in all three principal directions with all on-axis Poisson's
   ratios closer to the limit of-1. Additionally, the extra addition of
   star structure can enhance the Young's modulus of structure-2
   significantly in the case of same relative density, compared to
   structure-1. Moreover, the effect of parameter variation on elastic
   properties of two structures and the comparison with other classical 3D
   auxetic structures were also thoroughly studied and discussed in detail.
   These results are expected to eventually contribute to the advance of
   research and the application of new 3D auxetic structures in the future.

Title = {{User Participation and Engagement With the See Me Smoke-Free mHealth
   App: Prospective Feasibility Trial}},
Journal = {{JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{5}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Background: The See Me Smoke-Free (SMSF) mobile health (mHealth) app was
   developed to help women quit smoking by targeting concerns about body
   weight, body image, and self-efficacy through cognitive behavioral
   techniques and guided imagery audio files addressing smoking, diet, and
   physical activity. A feasibility trial found associations between SMSF
   usage and positive treatment outcomes. This paper reports a detailed
   exploration of program use among eligible individuals consenting to
   study participation and completing the baseline survey (participants)
   and ineligible or nonconsenting app installers (nonparticipants), as
   well as the relationship between program use and treatment outcomes.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to determine whether (1)
   participants were more likely to set quit dates, be current smokers, and
   report higher levels of smoking at baseline than nonparticipants; (2)
   participants opened the app and listened to audio files more frequently
   than nonparticipants; and (3) participants with more app usage had a
   higher likelihood of self-reported smoking abstinence at follow up.
   Methods: The SMSF feasibility trial was a single arm, within-subjects,
   prospective cohort study with assessments at baseline and 30 and 90 days
   post enrollment. The SMSF app was deployed on the Google Play Store for
   download, and basic profile characteristics were obtained for all app
   installers. Additional variables were assessed for study participants.
   Participants were prompted to use the app daily during study
   participation. Crude differences in baseline characteristics between
   trial participants and nonparticipants were evaluated using t tests
   (continuous variables) and Fisher exact tests (categorical variables).
   Exact Poisson tests were used to assess group-level differences in mean
   usage rates over the full study period using aggregate Google Analytics
   data on participation and usage. Negative binomial regression models
   were used to estimate associations of app usage with participant
   baseline characteristics after adjustment for putative confounders.
   Associations between app usage and self-reported smoking abstinence were
   assessed using separate logistic regression models for each outcome
   measure.
   Results: Participants (n=151) were more likely than nonparticipants
   (n=96) to report female gender (P<.02) and smoking in the 30 days before
   enrollment (P<.001). Participants and nonparticipants opened the app and
   updated quit dates at the same average rate (rate ratio {[}RR] 0.98;
   95\% CI 0.92-1.04; P=.43), but participants started audio files (RR
   1.07; 95\% CI 1.00-1.13; P<.04) and completed audio files (RR 1.11; 95\%
   CI 1.03-1.18; P<.003) at significantly higher rates than
   nonparticipants. Higher app usage among participants was positively
   associated with some smoking cessation outcomes.
   Conclusions: This study suggests potential efficacy of the SMSF app, as
   increased usage was generally associated with higher self-reported
   smoking abstinence. A planned randomized controlled trial will assess
   the SMSF app's efficacy as an intervention tool to help women quit
   smoking.}},

Abstract = {{The aero-structural design of an adaptive vortex generator for
   repeatable, elastic, deployment and retraction from an aerodynamically
   clean surface is presented. A multidisciplinary objective function,
   containing geometrically nonlinear finite element analysis and large
   eddy simulation, is used to derive the optimal adaptive geometry for
   increasing the momentum of the near-wall fluid. It is found that the
   rapid increase of in-plane membrane stress with deflection is a
   significant limitation on achievable deformation of a continuous skin
   with uniform section. Use of a 2D auxetic lattice structure in place of
   the continuous skin allows for significantly larger deformations and
   thus a significant improvement in performance. The optimal deformed
   geometry is replicated statically and the effect on the boundary layer
   is validated in a wind tunnel experiment. The lattice structure is then
   manufactured and actuated. The deformed geometry is shown to compare
   well with the FEA predictions. The surface is re-examined post actuation
   and shown to return to the initial position, demonstrating the
   deformation is elastic and hence repeatable.}},

Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{26}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{This paper proposes a three-dimensional (3D) lattice meta-material made
   by extending the existing two-dimensional enhanced auxetic model to a 3D
   one. With narrow ribs embedded into every cell of the typical 3D
   re-entrant honeycomb (TRH), the new structure can also be considered as
   an enhanced design of the TRH. A combination of theoretical and
   numerical analysis is carried out to gain a deeper understanding of the
   elastic behavior of the new 3D structure and its dependence on the
   geometric parameters. The new structure is proved analytically and
   numerically to exhibit a negative Poisson's ratio, while its Young's
   modulus is significantly improved compared to that of the TRH. It is
   remarkable that the Young's modulus of the new structure increases
   linearly with the relative density while an approximate square relation
   is found between that of the THR and the relative density, which reveals
   that the dominated deformation model of the micro-structures has been
   changed by the embedded ribs from bending to stretching. The present
   layout may be promising for some special applications due to its
   superior performance and may provide a new concept for the optimization
   design of 3D auxetic materials, whose stiffness is relatively low.}},

Volume = {{87}},

Abstract = {{Poisson's ratio (PR) is defined as the negative ratio between the
   lateral strain and the longitudinal strain of a material under tensile
   or compressive loading condition. Auxetic fabrics are those having a
   negative PR, which means that when their longitudinal strain is
   positive, their lateral strain is also positive, and vice versa. In this
   work, tensile and forming properties of auxetic warp-knitted spacer
   fabrics were investigated and compared with those of the conventional
   warp-knitted spacer fabrics. Both uniaxial tensile tests and
   hemispherical compression experiments were conducted, and the
   relationships of the tensile and forming properties with the auxetic
   effect were discussed in terms of different fabric structural
   parameters. The results show that the auxetic warp-knitted spacer
   fabrics have a prolonged low stress stage in the wale direction,
   indicating that they are more prone to undergo deformation along the
   wale direction, and fabric with a longer low stress stage has a better
   auxetic effect. The results also show that the formability of auxetic
   warp-knitted spacer fabrics is much better than that of conventional
   warp-knitted spacer fabrics, due to the much low forming energies
   required under hemispherical compression, which can be affected by many
   factors such as auxetic effect, fabric thickness and stiffness, yarn
   materials and the structure of the spacer layer. When all other
   parameters are similar, auxetic fabric with a better auxetic effect will
   have better formability. The study has provided useful information for
   the design and application of this type of nonconventional spacer
   fabrics.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents innovative work undertaken to evaluate the auxetic
   composite materials developed using weft-knitted fabrics with negative
   Poisson's ratio (NPR) produced from high-tenacity filaments of
   para-aramid (p-AR) and polyamide. The aim of this study is to develop
   polymeric composite materials reinforced with auxetic knitted fabrics
   and to evaluate the degree of transference of the auxetic behavior from
   the fibrous reinforcement to the composite produced. The results show
   that the NPR values remained in the composites. Regardless of the type
   of resin used, either epoxy or polyester, the highest values were
   obtained for samples produced with p-AR auxetic knitted fabrics. The NPR
   composites developed within this work present great potential for
   applications in industrial areas, including personal protection
   products, such as bulletproof vests, helmets, knee, and elbow
   protectors, and in all other areas where energy absorption is a key
   factor to be considered.}},

Abstract = {{Stretchable energy storage systems are essential for the realization of
   implantable and epidermal electronics. However, high-performance
   stretchable supercapacitors have received less attention because
   currently available processing techniques and material structures are
   too limited to overcome the trade-off relationship among electrical
   conductivity, ion-accessible surface area, and stretchability of
   electrodes. Herein, we introduce novel 2D reentrant cellular structures
   of porous graphene/CNT networks for omni-directionally stretchable
   supercapacitor electrodes. Reentrant structures, with inwardly protruded
   frameworks in porous networks, were fabricated by the radial compression
   of vertically aligned honeycomb-like rGO/CNT networks, which were
   prepared by a directional crystallization method. Unlike typical porous
   graphene structures, the reentrant structure provided structure-assisted
   stretchability, such as accordion and origami structures, to otherwise
   unstretchable materials. The 2D reentrant structures of graphene/CNT
   networks maintained excellent electrical conductivities under biaxial
   stretching conditions and showed a slightly negative or near-zero
   Poisson's ratio over a wide strain range because of their structural
   uniqueness. For practical applications, we fabricated all-solid-state
   supercapacitors based on 2D auxetic structures. A radial compression
   process up to 1/10th densified the electrode, significantly increasing
   the areal and volumetric capacitances of the electrodes. Additionally,
   vertically aligned graphene/CNT networks provided a plentiful surface
   area and induced sufficient ion transport pathways for the electrodes.
   Therefore, they exhibited high gravimetric and areal capacitance values
   of 152.4 F g(-1) and 2.9 F cm(-2), respectively, and had an excellent
   retention ratio of 88\% under a biaxial strain of 100\%. Auxetic
   cellular and vertically aligned structures provide a new strategy for
   the preparation of robust platforms for stretchable energy storage
   electrodes.}},

Abstract = {{A one-dimensional nanostructure with sp(3)-hybridized carbon atoms,

   structure calculations and reactive molecular dynamics simulations.
   Thermochemical analysis based on homodesmotic reactions showed that the
   formation of poly{[}5]asterane is more favorable than that of
   polytriangulane and comparable to that of polytwistane. A plane-wave DFT
   approach gave a computed Young's modulus of about 0.84 TPa, which is
   quite promising and comparable to those of other sp(3)-hybridized
   nanothreads. Simulations of the desorption of hydrogen atoms from PA
   showed a high activation energy (E-a approximate to 52kcalmol(-1)),
   which again indicates substantial chemical stability. Interestingly, PA
   was shown to exhibit auxetic behavior (negative Poisson's ratio). Thus,
   PA is advocated as a new mechanically and chemically stable nanothread
   with exotic auxetic behavior.}},

Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{176}},
Pages = {{195-204}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{A contrast in Poisson ratio is a possible strategy to enhance the
   stiffness of composite structures. In solid materials Poisson ratio is
   hardly tailorable unless cellular architectures are considered. Here, we
   first investigated the effect of a single re-entrant inclusion acting as
   a defect into a regular (non-re-entrant) honeycomb lattice. Building on
   this, we generated regular patterns of re-entrant inclusions into a
   regular hexagonal cellular matrix and we characterized the apparent
   stiffness and Poisson ratio of the obtained structures. We also explored
   the role of the intrinsic material properties of the inclusion as well
   as of its closest environment on the interplay between the deformations
   of different phases in the lattice. Our main finding is that a small
   fraction of re-entrant inclusions (around 12\%) is sufficient to
   generate a substantial augmentation in stiffness (300\%) at constant
   overall relative density and without inducing strong anisotropy.
   Eventually, we fabricated by 3D polyjet printing bi-material composite
   architectures to demonstrate the superior mechanical behavior obtained
   exploiting the Poisson effect. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Background: Morbidity and mortality fromcardiovascular diseases have
   decreased since the 1970s inmostWestern societies. However, it is
   unclear if this positive trend can also be found in younger women
   suffering from acute coronary syndrome (ACS).
   Methods: This is a prospective single center registry study including
   11.015 women and men hospitalized for a first ACS between the years 2001
   and 2010. We analyzed ACS rates according to sex and age group using
   Poisson regression in order to assess temporal trends.
   Results: Overall ACS hospitalization rates per 100.000 inhabitants
   increased by 31\% between 2001 and 2010 (Rate Ratio (RR) of 1.31, 95\%
   CI 1.20-1.43; p < 0.001) with a similar increase in men (RR 1.29, p <
   0.00001) andwomen (RR 1.35, p < 0.0001). Analyses of age-specific ACS
   rates showed a significant increase in ACS hospitalization rates only
   for the age groups 70-79 years (p = 0.003) and 80+ years (p < 0.00001).
   None of the age matched subgroups showed a sex related significant
   difference in trend for ACS hospitalization rates. Temporal trends for
   recorded risk factors showed a significant increase in smoking (p =
   0.03), and a trend to increased obesity prevalence (p = 0.06) in females
   in the age group 60-69 years.
   Conclusions: In contrast to other studies, we found no evidence for a
   particular increase in the number of younger women referred for a first
   ACS during the years 2001 and 2010. Potential negative effects of
   smoking and obesity on ACS incidence may be delayed to women older than
   70 years. (C) 2017 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Results of examination of experimental data on non-linear elasticity of
   rocks using experimentally determined pressure dependences of P- and
   S-wave velocities from various literature sources are presented.
   Overall, over 90 rock samples are considered. Interpretation of the data
   is performed using an effective-medium description in which cracks are
   considered as compliant defects with explicitly introduced shear and
   normal compliances without specifying a particular crack model with an a
   priori given ratio of the compliances. Comparison with the experimental
   data indicated abundance (similar to 80 \%) of cracks with the
   normal-toshear compliance ratios that significantly exceed the values
   typical of conventionally used crack models (such as penny-shaped cuts
   or thin ellipsoidal cracks). Correspondingly, rocks with such cracks
   demonstrate a strongly decreased Poisson ratio including a significant
   (similar to 45 \%) portion of rocks exhibiting negative Poisson ratios
   at lower pressures, for which the concentration of not yet closed cracks
   is maximal. The obtained results indicate the necessity for further
   development of crack models to account for the revealed numerous
   examples of cracks with strong domination of normal compliance.
   Discovering such a significant number of naturally auxetic rocks is in
   contrast to the conventional viewpoint that occurrence of a negative
   Poisson ratio is an exotic fact that is mostly discussed for artificial
   structures.}},

Abstract = {{Exposure to childhood religious affiliations where the majority of
   members discourage homosexuality may have negative psychological impacts
   for Black men who have sex with men. This study tested the hypothesis
   that exposures to these environments during childhood were associated
   with adulthood human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/sexually transmitted
   infection (STI) behavioral risk and HIV infection, because these
   exposures influenced HIV/STI risk by undermining race/sexual identity
   congruence and increasing internalized homophobia and interpersonal
   anxiety. Structural equation modeling as well as logistic and Poisson
   regressions were performed using baseline data from HIV Prevention
   Trials Network 061 (N = 1,553). Childhood religion affiliations that
   were more discouraging of homosexuality were associated with increased
   likelihood of HIV infection; however, the association was no longer
   significant after adjusting for age, income, and education. Having a
   childhood religion affiliation with high prevalence of beliefs
   discouraging homosexuality was associated with increased numbers of
   sexual partners (adjusted odds ratio = 4.31; 95\% confidence interval
   {[}3.76, 4.94], p <.01). The hypothesized path model was largely
   supported and accounted for 37\% of the variance in HIV infection;
   however, interpersonal anxiety was not associated with HIV/STI risk
   behaviors. Structural interventions are needed that focus on developing
   affirming theologies in religious institutions with Black men who have
   sex with men congregants.}},

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional (3D) printing of active materials is a rapidly growing
   research area over the last few years. Numerous works have shown
   potential to revolutionize the field of four-dimensional (4D) printing
   and active self-deploying structures. Conventional manufacturing
   technologies restrict the geometric complexity of active structures. 3D
   printing allows the fabrication of complex active structures with no
   assembly required. In this study, we propose active 3D printed auxetic
   meta-materials that are capable of achieving area changes up to 200\%.
   With these meta-materials, we design geometrically complex active
   structures that can be programmed into versatile shapes and recover
   their original shape given an external stimulus. We simulate the
   proposed metamaterials based on thermoviscoelastic material properties
   obtained by experimental characterization. A reduced beam model is
   constructed to predict forces and deformations of complex active
   structures. Excellent correlation is found between finite element
   simulation and experimental data from a 3-point bending test.
   Rectilinear tiling of the proposed meta-materials achieves the desired
   shape transformation. To demonstrate versatile programming, a selected
   meta-material is tiled into a complex contour, programmed into an
   arbitrary shape, and recovers as predicted. Simulation results verify
   this behavior. Such programmability in conjunction with 3D printing may
   be further exploited for applications such as biomedical devices, civil
   structures, and aerospace.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we propose the concept that a device based on mechanical
   metamaterials can be used to induce and control its own rotational
   motion as a result of internal deformations due to the conversion of
   translational degrees of freedom into rotational ones. The application
   of a linear force on the structural units of the system may be
   fine-tuned in order to obtain a desired type of rotation. In particular,
   we show, how it is possible to maximise the extent of rotation of the
   system through the alteration of the geometry of the system. We also
   show how a device based on this concept can be connected to an external
   body in order to rotate it which result may potentially prove to be very
   important in the case of applications such as telescopes employed in
   space. (C) 2017 Author(s).}},

Abstract = {{This work is devoted to the experimental determination of Poisson's
   ratio at temperatures of 20-1000A degrees C, which was carried out on
   cylindrical samples of a single-crystal heat-resistant nickel alloy with
   crystallographic orientations of (CGOs) {[}001], {[}011], and {[}111].
   The modulus of elasticity for the samples of these orientations has also
   been determined. It has been established that, in samples of
   heat-resistant nickel singlecrystal alloy with CGO {[}011], Poisson's
   ratio can vary from negative to positive values depending on the
   azimuthal orientation, i.e., on the crystallographic directions that lie
   in the plane perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the sample. To
   control the azimuthal CGO of cylindrical samples {[}011], a special
   metallographic procedure was developed based on the determination of the
   dendritic structure on the butt ends of these samples using etching. The
   data on the azimuthal orientation were subsequently used to place a
   sensor in order to determine the transverse deformation in these

Abstract = {{By applying the kinetic theory of the Valsove-Poisson model and the
   reductive perturbation technique, a Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation is
   derived for small but finite amplitude ion acoustic waves in multi-ion
   plasma composed of positive and negative ions along with the fraction of
   electrons. A correspondent equation is also derived from the basic set
   of fluid equations of adiabatic ions and isothermal electrons. Both
   kinetic and fluid KdV equations are stationary solved with different
   nature of coefficients. Their differences are discussed both
   analytically and numerically. The criteria of the fluid approach as a
   limiting case of kinetic theory are also discussed. The presence of
   negative ion makes some modification in the solitary structure that has
   also been discussed with its implication at the laboratory level.

Abstract = {{Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) and peripheral hemoglobin oxygen saturation
   (SpO(2)) both predict clinical severity in sickle cell disease (SCD),
   while reticulocytosis is associated with vasculopathy, but there are few
   data on mechanisms. HbF, SpO(2) and routine clinical and laboratory
   measures were available in a Tanzanian cohort of 1175 SCD individuals
   aged >= 5 years and the association with SpO(2) (as response variable
   transformed to a Poisson distribution) was assessed by negative binomial
   model with age and sex as covariates. Increase in HbF was associated
   with increased SpO(2) (rate ratio, RR = 1.19; 95\% confidence intervals
   {[}CI] 1.04, 1.37 per natural log unit of HbF; p = 0.0004). In
   univariable analysis, SpO(2) was inversely associated with age,
   reticulocyte count, and log (total bilirubin) and directly with pulse,
   SBP, hemoglobin, and log(HbF). In multivariable regression log(HbF) (RR
   1.191; 95\% CI 1.04, 1.37; p = 0.013), pulse (RR 1.01; 95\% CI 1.00,
   1.01; p = 0.026), SBP (RR 1.008; 95\% CI 1.00, 1.02; p = 0.014), and
   hemoglobin (1.120; 95\% CI 1.05, 1.19; p = 0.001) were positively and
   independently associated with SpO(2) while reticulocyte count (RR 0.985;
   95\% CI 0.97, 0.99; p = 0.019) was independently inversely associated
   with SpO(2). In SCD, improving SpO(2), in part through cardiovascular
   compensation and associated with reduced reticulocytosis, may be a
   mechanism by which HbF reduces disease severity. (C) 2017 Published by

Abstract = {{A regression model for overdispersed count data based on the complex
   biparametric Pearson (CBP) distribution is developed. It is compared
   with the generalized Poisson regression model, the negative binomial
   regression model and the zero inflated Poisson regression model, which
   are based on the generalized Poisson (CBP), negative binomial (NB) and
   zero inflated Poisson (ZIP) distributions, respectively. It is shown
   that the CBP distribution is more adequate than the GP, NB and ZIP
   distributions when the overdispersion is not related to a higher
   frequency of 0, but to other low values greater than 0, so it may be
   appropriate for overdispersed cases in which there are external reasons
   that raise the number of low values different from 0. Firstly, we study
   the shape and the parameters of the CBP distribution and we compare it
   with the Poisson, GP, NB and ZIP distributions by means of the
   probability of 0, the skewness and curtosis coefficients and the
   Kullback-Leibler divergence. Furthermore, we present an application
   example where the aforementioned performance is shown by the number of
   public educational facilities by municipality in Andalusia (Spain).
   Secondly, we describe two regression models based on the CBP
   distribution and the estimation method for their parameters. Thirdly, we
   carry out a simulation study that reveals the performance of the
   regression models proposed. Finally, one application in the field of
   sport illustrates that these models can provide more accurate fits than
   those provided by other usual regression models for count data.}},

Title = {{Determinants of The Grade A Embryos in Infertile Women; Zero-Inflated
   Regression Model}},

Year = {{2017}},

Abstract = {{Objective: In assisted reproductive technology, it is important to
   choose high quality embryos for embryo transfer. The aim of the present
   study was to determine the grade A embryo count and factors related to
   it in infertile women.
   Materials and Methods: This historical cohort study included 996
   infertile women. The main outcome was the number of grade A embryos.
   Zero-Inflated Poisson (ZIP) regression and Zero-Inflated Negative
   Binomial (ZINB) regression were used to model the count data as it
   contained excessive zeros. Stata software, version 13 (Stata Corp,
   College Station, TX, USA) was used for all statistical analyses.
   Results: After adjusting for potential confounders, results from the
   ZINB model show that for each unit increase in the number 2 pronuclear
   (2PN) zygotes, we get an increase of 1.45 times as incidence rate ratio
   (95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.23-1.69, P=0.001) in the expected
   grade A embryo count number, and for each increase in the cleavage day
   we get a decrease 0.35 times (95\% CI: 0.20-0.61, P=0.001) in expected
   grade A embryo count.
   Conclusion: There is a significant association between both the number
   of 2PN zygotes and cleavage day with the number of grade A embryos in
   both ZINB and ZIP regression models. The estimated coefficients are more
   plausible than values found in earlier studies using less relevant
   models.}},

Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{175}},
Pages = {{46-57}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{We combine 3D printing technique, numerical analysis, and experiments to
   design a new class of sandwich composites that exhibit various bending
   behaviors. These programmed sandwich structures contain 3D printed core
   materials with truss, conventional honeycomb, and re-entrant honeycomb
   topologies. Three-point bending tests are performed to investigate the
   bending behavior of these sandwich composites with two types of carbon
   fiber reinforced polymer face sheets. Under bending deformation,
   sandwich composites with truss core materials provide highest flexural
   stiffness and strength that are desirable in structural components. The
   sandwich composites with re-entrant honeycomb core exhibit a sequential
   snap-through instability which significantly enhances the energy
   absorption abilities. Our experimental and numerical results indicate
   that architected core structures can be utilized to tailor the bending
   properties as well as failure mechanisms. These findings offer new
   insights into the study of nonlinear mechanical response of sandwich
   structures, which can benefit a wide range of industries and
   applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   Stress Corrosion Cracking susceptibility}},

Abstract = {{Most studies on Intergranular Stress Corrosion Cracking (IGSCC) in Light
   Water Reactor environment consider the macroscopic applied stress as the
   relevant mechanical parameter to characterize crack initiation. Progress
   in understanding, modeling, and forecasting IGSCC could be made by
   correlating crack initiation susceptibility to the stress field at crack
   initiation sites. Through finite element method (FEM) calculations, the
   present article assesses this stress field in polycrystalline 316
   stainless steel and identifies key parameters controlling local stress
   intensification. It is in particular shown that the auxetic behavior
   (i.e., negative Poisson's ratio) of 316 single crystals in some
   orientations plays an important role. FEM calculation results are used
   to set up a preliminary expression that can be used to rank IGSCC
   initiation sensitivity of components made of the same fcc alloy (i.e.,
   austenitic stainless steels, Ni-based alloys) from their surface
   texture. Further work is in progress to integrate influence of grain
   boundary triple junctions and validate the whole approach against
   experimental SCC data. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY INTERFACE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{14}},

Abstract = {{The coefficient of determination R-2 quantifies the proportion of
   variance explained by a statistical model and is an important summary
   statistic of biological interest. However, estimating R-2 for
   generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) remains challenging. We have
   previously introduced a version of R-2 that we called R-2 GLMM for
   Poisson and binomial GLMMs, but not for other distributional families.
   Similarly, we earlier discussed how to estimate intra-class correlation
   coefficients (ICCs) using Poisson and binomial GLMMs. In this paper, we
   generalize our methods to all other non-Gaussian distributions, in
   particular to negative binomial and gamma distributions that are
   commonly used for modelling biological data. While expanding our
   approach, we highlight two useful concepts for biologists, Jensen's
   inequality and the delta method, both of which help us in understanding
   the properties of GLMMs. Jensen's inequality has important implications
   for biologically meaningful interpretation of GLMMs, whereas the delta
   method allows a general derivation of variance associated with
   non-Gaussian distributions. We also discuss some special considerations
   for binomial GLMMs with binary or proportion data. We illustrate the
   implementation of our extension by worked examples from the field of
   ecology and evolution in the R environment. However, our method can be
   used across disciplines and regardless of statistical environments.}},

Abstract = {{In this research, first-principles calculations were carried out within
   the density functional theory (DFT) framework, using LDA and GGA, in
   order to study the structural, elastic, electronic and thermal
   properties of InAs in the zinc-blende structure. The results of the
   structural properties (a, B-0, B'(0)) agree with the theoretical and
   experimental results reported by other authors. Additionally, the
   elastic properties, the elastic constants (C-11, C-12 and C-44), the
   anisotropy coefficient (A) and the predicted speeds of the sound (V-1,
   V-2 and V-s2) are in agreement with the results reported by other
   authors. In contrast, the shear modulus (G), the Young's modulus (Y) and
   the Poisson's ratio (v) show some discrepancy with respect to the
   experimental values, although, the values obtained are reasonable. On
   the other hand, it is evident the tendency of the LDA and GGA approaches
   to underestimate the value of the band-gap energy in semiconductors. The
   thermal properties (V, B-0, theta(D)yC(V)) of InAs, calculated using the
   quasi-harmonic Debye model, are slightly sensitive as the temperature
   increases. According to the stability criteria and the negative value of
   the enthalpy of formation, InAs is mechanically and thermodynamically
   stable. Therefore, this work can be used as a future reference for
   theoretical and experimental studies based on InAs.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the effective elastic constants of several 2D and 3D
   frame-like periodic cellular solids with different unit-cell topologies
   are analytically derived using the homogenization method based on
   equivalent strain energy. The analytical expressions of strain energy of
   a unit cell under different strain modes are determined using a generic
   symbolic object-oriented finite element (FE) program written in MATLAB.
   The obtained analytical expressions of the strain energy are then used
   to symbolically compute the effective elastic constants that include
   Young's moduli, Poisson's ratios, and shear moduli. The obtained
   analytical effective elastic constants are numerically verified using
   results from an ordinary numerical FE program. The obtained closed-form
   effective elastic constants are also compared with some existing
   solutions from the literature. This study demonstrates that symbolic
   computation platforms can be properly used to provide efficient
   methodologies for finding useful analytical solutions of mechanical
   problems. Without the symbolic object-oriented FE program in this study,
   elaborate and tedious analytical analysis has to be manually performed
   for each different unit cell. The symbolic object-oriented FE program
   provides analytical analysis of unit cells that is accurate and fast.
   The object-oriented programming technique allows the symbolic FE program
   in this study to be efficiently implemented.}},

Title = {{Extracting shear and normal compliances of crack-like defects from
   pressure dependences of elastic-wave velocities}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROCK MECHANICS AND MINING SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{97}},
Pages = {{122-133}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{We present a differential formulation of effective-medium model in which
   the normal and shear compliances of the high-compliance porosity are
   explicitly decoupled. This feature of the decoupled-compliance model (DC
   model) is in contrast to conventional models in which such defect's
   properties are implicitly assumed and are subject to strong limitations
   defined by the used particular crack model. Comparison with the DC model
   makes it possible to reveal such implicit assumptions in the
   conventional models. Furthermore, for the conventional cracks, our
   approach gives the same results as the conventional models. The ability
   of the DC model to incorporate arbitrary defect properties in terms of
   their normal-to-shear compliance ratio (q-ratio) is used to formulate an
   analogue of Hashin-Shtrikman constraints on the range of feasible
   crack-induced variations in the moduli. Comparison of the DC model with
   experimental pressure dependences of elastic-wave velocities in rocks
   makes it possible to extract the q-ratio for real crack-like defects.
   These results demonstrate that properties of real cracks usually
   noticeably differ from those of popular crack models such as cracks with
   free faces (e.g., penny-shape) or pure shear cracks. We discuss an
   example of sandstone with pronouncedly negative Poisson's ratio that is
   due to the fact that the ratio of normal-to-shear compliances of voids
   in this rock (q similar to 7-8) is significantly higher than for the
   conventional cracks (q similar to 2). Ability of the DC model to
   accurately extrapolate pressure dependences of the moduli from
   relatively low pressures to several times greater is demonstrated,
   including the cases, for which the conventional models give huge errors.
   The introduced parameter q the ratio of normal-to-shear compliances of
   voids provides additional insight into properties of real crack-like
   defect in rocks.}},

Abstract = {{Two kinds of innovative re-entrant and hexagonal cell honeycomb sandwich
   structures filled with reactive powder concrete were proposed, and the
   ballistic resistance and energy absorption of the sandwich structures
   were investigated by numerical simulations. The deformation and failure
   modes of the different structures were analyzed and evaluated in detail.
   The honeycomb sandwich structures filled with reactive powder concrete
   prisms improved the capacity of ballistic resistance and energy
   absorption significantly, compared to the normal reactive powder
   concrete plates and sandwich structures without reactive powder concrete
   prisms. The analysis shows that the auxetic re-entrant cell honeycomb
   sandwich structures have a better ballistic performance than the
   hexagonal cell honeycomb sandwich structures. The sandwich structures
   were subjected to impact by three kinds of projectiles: flat,
   hemispherical and conical nosed. The ballistic limit of the flat nosed
   projectile is the highest, while the impact performance of the conical
   and hemispherical nosed projectiles is obviously different from the flat
   nosed projectile, especially in a relative high velocity range. The
   sharper nose leads to a higher value of exit velocity and mass loss. In
   addition, effects of different design parameters on ballistic resistance
   were also studied by changing the thickness of honeycomb cell and face
   plates. Results indicate that the thickness of honeycomb walls and face
   plates have significant effect on the ballistic resistance and energy
   absorption in a relative low velocity range, while there are no big
   differences when the initial impact velocity exceeds 400m/s.}},

Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{175}},
Pages = {{101-110}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic materials exhibit many superior properties but drawback in low
   stiffness owe to the substantial porosity. Some narrow-ribs enhanced
   auxetic honeycombs have been designed for improving the in plane
   stiffness. For these narrow-ribs enhanced auxetic structures, local
   buckling likely appears as the reinforcing walls are designed in low
   thickness for superior auxeticy. In this paper, a novel narrow ribs
   enhanced auxetic honeycomb is designed by embedding rhombus into each
   cell of the normal re-entrant hexagonal honeycomb (NRHH). Analytical
   model is built to investigate the elastic behaviors of the new proposed
   honeycomb under uniaxial compression, in which the incremental method is
   firstly introduced for post-local-buckling analysis. Numerical
   simulations are carried out to verify the analytical results. It is
   interesting that bilinear elastic characteristic is found for the
   stress-strain and transverse strain-longitudinal strain curves of the
   new proposed honeycomb on account of the local budding. Parameters
   studies are performed and the new proposed honeycomb is proved to
   exhibit superior mechanical properties compared to other narrow-ribs
   enhanced honeycombs. Significantly, the incremental method brought
   forward in the present paper for the local buckling analysis can be
   popularized to other honeycombs enhanced with narrow-ribs. Thus, the
   bilinear elastic characteristic is a general feature for these
   honeycombs. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Application of auxetic materials in automobile and biomedical
   engineering is widely reported and their usage in civil engineering is
   emerging. This paper reports the manufacturing and characterising of
   cementitious polymer mortar auxetic foam composites suitable for wall
   rendering. The deformation behaviour of the composites with the high
   negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) auxetic foam embedded in polymer cement
   mortar matrix has been experimentally evaluated and compared to the
   commonly used mortar composites containing fiberglass mesh layers (that
   exhibits positive Poisson's ratio). It is shown that the auxetic
   embedded polymer cement composite outperformed other composites through
   elimination of delamination and minimisation of brittleness. The auxetic
   foams used in this research were manufactured from the inexpensive open
   cell polyurethane foam through a thermo-mechanical process and
   characterised through lab tests; the maximum Poisson's ratio determined
   was 1.5. Sixty composite specimens tested under axial compression
   exhibited a maximum NPR of 0.11. The results were validated numerically.
   The numerical model was then used to examine the effectiveness of the
   relative thickness of the auxetic foam layers and the polymer cement
   matrix for maximising the NPR of the composites. The results show that
   through auxetic material embedment, delamination and brittleness
   suffered by the cementitious composites could be eliminated. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{The effect of in-plane strain on monolayer InSe has been systematically
   investigated by using first-principles calculations. It is found that
   monolayer InSe exhibits superior mechanical flexibility, which can
   sustain a tensile strain up to 27\% in the armchair direction. More
   importantly, a new phase with inversion symmetry denoted as phase-II is
   obtained when the tensile strain increases over 25\% along the zigzag
   direction, which is predicted to be metallic and thermodynamically
   stable at room temperature. And the phase-II InSe could show an
   out-of-plane negative Poisson's ratio after the uniaxial tensile strain
   is larger than 5\%. Moreover, both uniaxial and biaxial compressive
   strains can trigger the indirect-to-direct band gap transition in the
   pristine monolayer InSe and its band gap decreases monotonously with the
   applied tensile strain, which offers an effective method to tune the
   electronic properties of monolayer InSe for its promising application in
   electronics and optoelectronics.}},

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 22}},
Abstract = {{Auxetics comprise a rare family of materials that manifest negative
   Poisson's ratio, which causes an expansion instead of contraction under
   tension. Most known homogeneously auxetic materials are porous foams or
   artificial macrostructures and there are few examples of inorganic
   materials that exhibit this behavior as polycrystalline solids. It is
   now possible to accelerate the discovery of materials with target
   properties, such as auxetics, using high-throughput computations, open
   databases, and efficient search algorithms. Candidates exhibiting
   features correlating with auxetic behavior were chosen from the set of
   more than 67 000 materials in the Materials Project database. Poisson's
   ratios were derived from the calculated elastic tensor of each material
   in this reduced set of compounds. We report that this strategy results
   in the prediction of three previously unidentified homogeneously auxetic
   materials as well as a number of compounds with a near-zero homogeneous
   Poisson's ratio, which are here denoted ``anepirretic materials{''}.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials exhibiting a negative Poisson's ratio are of great
   research interest due to their unusual mechanical responses and a wide
   range of potential deployment. Efforts have been devoted to exploring
   novel 2D and 3D auxetic structures through rational design,
   optimization, and taking inspiration from nature. Here we report a 3D
   architected lattice system showing a negative Poisson's ratio over a
   wide range of applied uniaxial stretch. 3D printing, experimental tests,
   numerical simulation, and analytical modeling are implemented to
   quantify the evolution of the Poisson's ratio and reveal the underlying
   mechanisms responsible for this unusual behavior. We further show that
   the auxetic behavior can be controlled by tailoring the geometric
   features of the ligaments. The findings reported here provide a new
   routine to design architected metamaterial systems exhibiting unusual
   properties and having a wide range of potential applications.}},

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{61}},
Pages = {{123-130}},
Month = {{AUG 16}},
Abstract = {{There are two polar contemporary approaches to the constitutive modeling
   of arterial wall with anisotropy induced by collagen fibers. The first
   one is based on the angular integration (AI) of the strain energy on a
   unit sphere for the analytically defined fiber dispersion. The second
   one is based on the introduction of the generalized structure tensors
   (GST). AI approach is very involved computationally while GST approach
   requires somewhat complicated procedure for the exclusion of compressed
   fibers.
   We present some middle ground models, which are based on the use of 16
   and 8 structure tensors. These models are moderately involved
   computationally and they allow excluding compressed fibers easily. We
   use the proposed models to study the role of the fiber dispersion in the
   constitutive modeling of the arterial wall. Particularly, we study the
   auxetic effect which can appear in anisotropic materials. The effect
   means thickening of the tissue in the direction perpendicular to its
   stretching. Such an effect was not observed in experiments while some
   simple anisotropic models do predict it. We show that more accurate
   account of the fiber dispersion suppresses the auxetic effect in a
   qualitative agreement with experimental observations. (C) 2017 Elsevier

Abstract = {{An important feature that drives the auxetic behaviour of the
   star-shaped auxetic structures is the hinge-functional connection at the
   vertex connections. This feature poses a great challenge for
   manufacturing and may lead to significant stress concentrations. To
   overcome these problems, we introduced smoothed petal-shaped auxetic
   structures, where the hinges are replaced by smoothed connections. To
   accommodate the curved features of the petal-shaped auxetics, a
   parametrisation modelling scheme using multiple NURBS patches is
   proposed. Next, an integrated shape design frame work using isogeometric
   analysis is adopted to improve the structural performance. To ensure a
   minimum thickness for each member, a geometry sizing constraint is
   imposed via piece-wise bounding polynomials. This geometry sizing
   constraint, in the context of isogeometric shape optimization, is
   particularly interesting due to the non-interpolatory nature of NURBS
   basis. The effective Poisson ratio is used directly as the objective
   function, and an adjoint sensitivity analysis is carried out. The
   optimized designs smoothed petal auxetic structures are shown to achieve
   low negative Poisson's ratios, while the difficulties of manufacturing
   the hinges are avoided. For the case with six petals, an in-plane
   isotropy is achieved. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This work investigated the elastic and electronic properties of
   hexagonal Al5Mo and Al5W intermetallics using the first-principle
   method. In both phases, the structural, elastic and electronic
   properties showed the substantial pressure dependent behaviors. For
   formation enthalpies, they were both negative to indicate their
   stability at the ground state thermodynamically. In comparison, Al5Mo
   has the superior stability over Al5W owing to its more negative Hi.
   Elastically, the calculated elastic constants can satisfy Born's
   criteria from 0 to 40 GPa, suggesting their mechanical stability. With
   the increasing pressures, the elastic constants exhibited linearly
   rising tendencies. Using elastic constants, the bulk modulus (B), shear
   modulus (G) and Young's modulus (E) were derived using the
   Voigt-Reuss-Hill method. All these moduli displayed the increasing
   behaviors with the growing pressures. The analysis of BAG ratio and
   Poisson's ratio indicated that the Al5Mo and Al5W should be brittle at
   0-40 GPa. Electronically, both compounds were suggested to possess
   metallic behavior through the DOS (density of states) analysis. Under
   pressures, the shapes of peaks and pseudogaps showed few changes,
   suggesting Al5Mo and Al5W has kept structurally stable up to 40 GPa. (C)

Journal = {{PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},

Volume = {{19}},

Pages = {{19377-19385}},
Month = {{AUG 7}},
Abstract = {{Above their `percolation threshold', intrinsically conducting polymer
   (ICP) based composites exhibit an increase or decrease in conductivity
   with strain. However, in this study we report an increase in
   conductivity and an associated insulator-to-conductor transition
   observed in certain conducting polymer composites below their
   percolation threshold under uniaxial tensile strain, thereby shifting
   the percolation to lower volume fractions. The `auxetic behaviour'
   possible in certain types of ` hierarchical' microstructures is shown to
   be responsible for such changes in the polyaniline (PANI) composites
   studied. Using percolation models, the size and shape of the `conducting
   units' that contribute to the percolation and its changes with strain
   were predicted. These conducting units are secondary and tertiary `
   hierarchical structures' formed by the agglomeration of primary units of
   nano-rods (10 nm). An increase in the aspect ratio of these ` conducting
   units' is necessary for lowering the percolation threshold, which is
   possible in tertiary rod-like assemblies of PANI and not in secondary
   rod-like or platelet-like hierarchical structures. `Auxetic behaviour'
   or a negative Poisson's ratio results in the expansion of the
   agglomerates and increase in the aspect ratio. This demonstrates the
   possibility of ` auxetic behaviour' contributing to changes in
   conductivity, which has not been reported before and could be used for
   novel applications.}},

   equation structural model has been developed which allows the
   probability of bagging game to be simultaneously entered into the travel

   travel cost, and a Negative Binomial distribution is used to deal with
   the issue of overdispersion. Likelihood ratio tests and non-nested model
   selection tests have been adopted to choose the model which best fits
   the data. The results show that a Negative Binomial structural model is
   the best and the probability of bagging game has a significant effect on
   the travel cost model. The welfare per hunting day is around \$300. (C)

Title = {{Effect of faults on stress path evolution during reservoir
   pressurization}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GREENHOUSE GAS CONTROL}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{63}},
Pages = {{412-430}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Fluid injection operations, such as CO2 storage and enhanced oil
   recovery (EOR), imply reservoir pressurization, which changes the
   effective and total stresses due to poroelastic effects. These stress
   changes control the geo-mechanical stability of discontinuities like
   faults and fractures. Though the effect of these pre-existing
   discontinuities on stress path is sometimes neglected, the stress state
   is altered around them. We investigate the effect of a fault on the
   stress path evolution when pressurizing a reservoir using an in-house
   hybrid FEM-DEM code called ``MDEM{''}. Simulation results indicate that
   the stress path is affected by the presence of faults considered to
   deform elastically, especially in the vicinity of the fault in the
   reservoir-caprock interfaces. The stress path perturbation is caused by
   the shear deformation of the fault plane, which is different in the
   reservoir and the caprock sections. Actually, the magnitude and the
   extension of the stress path perturbation around a fault become larger
   for faults with lower shear stiffness. The upper hanging wall and the
   lower footwall of the fault in the reservoir-caprock interface
   experience a higher stress path in the horizontal and the vertical
   directions. Furthermore, the stress paths decrease (negative in the
   vertical direction) in the upper footwall and the lower hanging wall in
   the reservoir-caprock interfaces. The fault effect on the stress path
   increases as the aspect ratio of the reservoir becomes lower. Moreover,
   the results indicated that both the caprock and the reservoir in the
   footwall experience a greater change for lower Poisson's ratio of the
   caprock.
   These stress changes are independent of the in situ stress regime as
   long as the fault deforms elastically. However, the impact of the stress
   path perturbation on the stability of the reservoir and the caprock is
   different in a compressional (reverse faulting) and an extensional
   (normal faulting) stress regimes. The stress state becomes less stable
   in the vicinity of the fault in the reservoir and in the caprock in a
   compressional stress regime than in an extensional stress regime.
   Therefore, a compressional stress regime leads to a less stable
   situation due to the fault effect on the evolution of the stress path.
   Overall, the presence of faults alters the stress state around them,
   which may lead to a stress state that is closer to failure conditions
   than predicted by models that do not explicitly include faults.}},

Abstract = {{The occurrence of a negative dynamic mass density is a striking property
   of metamaterials. It appears when an inner local resonance is present.
   Results coming from an asymptotic theory are recalled briefly, showing
   the scaling of physical properties leading to inner resonance in elastic
   composites containing homogeneous soft inclusions, with negligible
   scattering of waves traveling through the matrix. This appears for a
   large contrast of elastic properties between matrix and inclusion. The
   frequency-dependent dynamic mass density depends on the resonance
   frequencies of the inner inclusions and on their related participation
   factors. Having solved the dynamic elasticity problem, these physical
   quantities are provided in the case of homogeneous cylindrical and
   spherical inclusions. It is shown that numerous resonance frequencies do
   not contribute to the dynamic mass density or have small participation
   factors, which simplifies significantly the physics involved in the
   concerned inner resonance phenomena. Finally, non-dimensional resonance
   frequencies and participation factors are given for both cases of
   inclusions as functions of the Poisson's ratio, defining completely the
   dynamic mass density. (C) 2017 Acoustical Society of America.}},

Title = {{Stress field models from Maxwell stress functions: southern California}},
Journal = {{GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{210}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{951-963}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The lithospheric stress field is formally divided into three components:
   a standard pressure which is a function of elevation (only), a
   topographic stress anomaly (3-D tensor field) and a tectonic stress
   anomaly (3-D tensor field). The boundary between topographic and
   tectonic stress anomalies is somewhat arbitrary, and here is based on
   the modeling tools available. The topographic stress anomaly is computed
   by numerical convolution of density anomalies with three tensor Green's
   functions provided by Boussinesq, Cerruti and Mindlin. By assuming
   either a seismically estimated or isostatic Moho depth, and by using
   Poisson ratio of either 0.25 or 0.5, I obtain four alternative
   topographic stress models. The tectonic stress field, which satisfies
   the homogeneous quasi-static momentum equation, is obtained from
   particular second derivatives of Maxwell vector potential fields which
   are weighted sums of basis functions representing constant tectonic
   stress components, linearly varying tectonic stress components and
   tectonic stress components that vary harmonically in one, two and three
   dimensions. Boundary conditions include zero traction due to tectonic
   stress anomaly at sea level, and zero traction due to the total stress
   anomaly on model boundaries at depths within the asthenosphere. The
   total stress anomaly is fit by least squares to both World Stress Map
   data and to a previous faulted-lithosphere, realistic-rheology dynamic
   model of the region computed with finite-element program Shells. No
   conflict is seen between the two target data sets, and the best-fitting
   model (using an isostatic Moho and Poisson ratio 0.5) gives minimum
   directional misfits relative to both targets. Constraints of computer
   memory, execution time and ill-conditioning of the linear system (which
   requires damping) limit harmonically varying tectonic stress to no more
   than six cycles along each axis of the model. The primary limitation on
   close fitting is that the Shells model predicts very sharp shallow
   stress maxima and discontinuous horizontal compression at the Moho,
   which the new model can only approximate. The new model also lacks the
   spatial resolution to portray the localized stress states that may occur
   near the central surfaces of weak faults; instead, the model portrays
   the regional or background stress field which provides boundary
   conditions for weak faults. Peak shear stresses in one registered model
   and one alternate model are 120 and 150 MPa, respectively, while peak
   vertically integrated shear stresses are 2.9 x 10(12) and 4.1 x 10(12) N
   m(-1). Channeling of deviatoric stress along the strong Great Valley and
   the western slope of the Peninsular Ranges is evident. In the
   neotectonics of southern California, it appears that deviatoric stress
   and long-term strain rate have a negative correlation, because regions
   of low heat flow are strong and act as stress guides, while undergoing
   very little internal deformation. In contrast, active faults lie
   preferentially in areas with higher heat flow, and their low strength
   keeps deviatoric stresses locally modest.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we investigate the evolution of magnetic domains with time
   in magnetic auxetic systems using the Ising model. We show that the
   mechanical deformation of the structure affects the way how domains
   evolve and that their rate of growth does not follow a well-known power
   law associated with the Ising model for systems corresponding to a
   specific distance between Ising spins. We also show that the variation
   in the rate of deformation of the system leads to completely different
   results in terms of the change in size of magnetic domains and domain
   energy. This means that upon changing the speed used to deform the
   system, it is possible to control the growth of magnetic domains and
   hence control the magnetic properties of the whole system. This may
   prove to be very important in the case of potential applications such as
   magnetic freezers where the magnetocaloric effect resulting with a
   change in temperature could be affected by the rate of deformation of
   the discussed auxetic structure.}},

Abstract = {{Graphyne (GY) and graphdiyne (GDY) are two-dimensional one-atom-thick
   carbon allotropes highly considered to substitute graphene in electronic
   applications because of the prediction of non-null band-gap. There are
   multiple configurations of GY structures not yet fully investigated in
   literature. In this work, by means of classical molecular dynamics
   simulations, the Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio and linear thermal
   expansion coefficient (TEC) of all originally proposed seven types of
   GYs and corresponding GDYs are calculated. The dependence of these
   properties with the density of the structure is investigated for the
   first time. Quadratic increasing of the TEC of GY and GDY structures
   with density was found. The elastic modulus of GYs and GDYs were shown
   to be more sensitive to their density than general porous materials. In
   particular, non-symmetric structures are much softer along the armchair
   direction than along zigzag direction, implying that the elasticity
   along armchair direction of GY and GDY structures are similar to that of
   porous gels materials. Values larger than unity were found for the
   Poisson's ratio of some non-symmetric GYs and GDYs. A simple honeycomb
   mechanical model is shown to capture the observed values of Poisson's
   ratio of GYs and GDYs.}},

Abstract = {{This investigation examines the transient deformation and heat
   generation of a solid polyurethane subjected to dynamic compression. A
   special method is presented to prepare the solid polyurethane from raw
   materials which are commonly used to make polyurethane foams. Testing
   methods including infrared spectrum, differential scanning calorimetry,
   quasi-static and dynamic compression were applied to study the basic
   physical properties of the solid polyurethane. High-speed optical and
   infrared imaging systems are used to obtain visual and thermo-graphic
   images during impact tests. Under quasi-static compression, the solid
   polyurethane presents a good performance in toughness. This is confirmed
   by its Poisson's ratio. Under impact compression, the adiabatic heat
   generation are identified statistically. Temperature distribution
   confirms the fact of transient heat generation in specimens. Adiabatic
   self heating mechanism provides a consideration to understand the
   negative strain-rate effect and post yield softening effect found in the
   solid polyurethane. Mechanical properties including quasi-static and
   dynamic responses are related with the composition of molecular and
   structure of polymer. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the inverse problem of retrieving aerosol extinction

   and the data are related through the exponential of a linear operator,
   the unknown is non-negative and the data follow the Poisson

   solve the resulting linear inverse problem, but neglect to take into
   account the noise statistics. In this study we show that proper
   modelling of the noise distribution can improve substantially the
   quality of the reconstructed extinction profiles. To achieve this goal,
   we consider the non-linear inverse problem with non-negativity
   constraint, and propose two iterative algorithms derived using the
   Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. We validate the algorithms with synthetic
   and experimental data. As expected, the proposed algorithms out-perform
   standard methods in terms of sensitivity to noise and reliability of the

Abstract = {{Introduction The ability to detect safety concerns from spontaneous
   adverse drug reaction reports in a timely and efficient manner remains
   important in public health.
   Objective This paper explores the behaviour of the Sequential
   Probability Ratio Test (SPRT) and ability to detect signals of
   disproportionate reporting (SDRs) in the Singapore context.
   Methods We used SPRT with a combination of two hypothesised relative
   risks (hRRs) of 2 and 4.1 to detect signals of both common and rare
   adverse events in our small database. We compared SPRT with other
   methods in terms of number of signals detected and whether labelled
   adverse drug reactions were detected or the reaction terms were
   considered serious. The other methods used were reporting odds ratio
   (ROR), Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN) and Gamma
   Poisson Shrinker (GPS).
   Results The SPRT produced 2187 signals in common with all methods, 268
   unique signals, and 70 signals in common with at least one other method,
   and did not produce signals in 178 cases where two other methods
   detected them, and there were 403 signals unique to one of the other
   methods. In terms of sensitivity, ROR performed better than other
   methods, but the SPRT method found more new signals. The performances of
   the methods were similar for negative predictive value and specificity.
   Conclusions Using a combination of hRRs for SPRT could be a useful
   screening tool for regulatory agencies, and more detailed investigation
   of the medical utility of the system is merited.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To analyze the association between chronic hepatitis C virus
   (HCV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections with type 2 diabetes in
   HIV-infected patients.
   Methods: HIV-1-infected patients enrolled in ICONA, a prospective cohort
   study involving 42 tertiary care centers in Italy, were selected with
   the following characteristics: for the diabetes incidence analysis, all
   patients with available CMV IgG results (first available test =
   baseline) and without type 2 diabetes were followed until onset of type
   2 diabetes, last available clinical follow-up, death or September 30,
   2014, whichever occurred first; for the prevalence analysis, all ICONA
   patients were analyzed at their last follow-up visit. Main outcome
   measures were the new onset of type 2 diabetes (incidence analysis) and
   the prevalence of type 2 diabetes at last follow-up.
   Results: During 38,062 person-years of follow-up (PYFU) in 6505
   individuals, we observed 140 cases of incident type 2 diabetes
   (Incidence rate 3.7, 95\% CI: 3.1 to 4.3, per 1000 PYFU). In a
   multivariable Poisson regression model, HCV-antibody (Ab) +/HCV RNA+
   patients {[}adjusted relative rate versus HCV-Ab negative 1.73 (95\% CI:
   1.08 to 2.78)] but not HCV Ab+RNA- or CMV IgG+ patients, had a higher
   risk of diabetes. Among 12,001 patients, 306 (2.5\%) prevalent cases of
   type 2 diabetes were detected. HCV Ab+RNA+ status was independently
   associated with prevalent diabetes (adjusted Odds Ratio vs HCV Ab- 2.49;
   95\% CI: 1.08 to 5.74), whereas HCV-Ab+/HCV RNA- and CMV IgG+ status
   were not.
   Conclusion: In HIV-infected individuals, active HCV replication but not
   prior HCV exposure or latent CMV infection is associated with incident
   and prevalent type 2 diabetes.}},

   periodic cellular lattice structures with auxetic elastic behavior is a
   recent and promising solution in the design of piezoelectric sensors. In
   the present work, periodic anti-tetrachiral auxetic lattice structures,

   mechanical and piezoelectrical response are investigated. The equivalent
   piezoelectric properties are obtained adopting a first order
   computational homogenization approach, generalized to the case of
   electromechanical coupling, and various polarization directions are
   adopted. Two examples of in-plane and out-of-plane strain sensors are
   proposed as design concepts. Moreover, a piezo-elastodynamic dispersion
   analysis adopting the Floquet-Bloch decomposition is performed. The
   acoustic behavior of the periodic piezoelectric material with auxetic

Abstract = {{The arts of origami and kirigami inspired numerous examples of macro
   scale hierarchical structures with high degree of reconfigurability and
   multiple functionalities. Extension of kirigami and origami patterning
   to micro-, meso-, and nanoscales enabled production of nanocomposites
   with unusual combination of properties, transitioning these art forms to
   the toolbox of materials design. Various subtractive and additive
   fabrication techniques applicable to nanocomposites and out-of-plane
   deformation of patterns enable a technological framework to negotiate
   often contradictory structural requirements for materials properties.
   Additionally, the long searched possibility of patterned
   composites/parts with highly predictable set of properties/functions
   emerged. In this review, we discuss foldable/ stretchable composites
   with designed mechanical properties, as exemplified by the negative
   Poisson's ratio, as well as optical and electrical properties, as
   exemplified by the sheet conductance, photovoltage generation, and light
   diffraction. Reconfiguration achieved by extrinsic forces and/or
   intrinsic stresses enables a wide spectrum of technological applications
   including miniaturized biomedical tools, soft robotics, adaptive optics,
   and energy systems, extending the limits of both materials engineering
   concepts and technological innovation.}},

Abstract = {{Searching and designing two-dimensional (2D) materials with unique
   topological structures and physical and chemical properties is extremely
   significant in the field of materials science. Here we report the design
   of 2D MnBx (x = 1, 2, 3, 6) monolayers containing quasi-planar
   hypercoordinate motifs by means of density functional theory (DFT)
   computations and particle swarm optimization technique. These systems
   exhibit high cohesive energy as well as good kinetic and thermal
   stability, indicating that the MnBx monolayers can be prepared in
   experiments. Bond order analyses suggest that the abundance of
   multi-center bonds contributes to the stability of MnBx monolayers.
   Among them, MnB3 monolayer has nonmagnetic ground state while others
   exhibit ferromagnetic metallic properties. Moreover, MnB6 monolayer
   exhibits high spin polarization and negative Poisson's ratio, which
   endows MnB6 with many special applications to cushioning and
   nanoelectronics. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   addition, the cation distribution obtained from calculated inversion
   parameter indicate that in the smaller particles, more amount of Fe2+ on
   the tetrahedral sites can be related to higher stress induced in the
   FcP-NPs compared to the FC-NPs. The saturation magnetization of the
   FcP-NPs is almost two times bigger than the saturation magnetization of
   the FC-NPs. It could be attributed to the decrease in the negative
   interaction on the octahedral site and also the magnetic moment on the
   tetrahedral site of the FcP-NPs. The increase in force constants of the
   FC-NPs determined by infrared spectra analysis compared to FcP-NPs
   suggests the strengthening of their interatomic bonding. The values of
   shear and longitudinal wave velocities obtained from force constants
   have been used to determine the values of Young's modulus, rigidity
   modulus, bulk modulus, and Debye temperature. By comparison of the
   elastic results of FC-NPs with the FcP-NPs, we can observe that the
   elastic properties of the F-NPs have been improved by synthesis method,
   while Poisson's ratio almost remains constant. In addition, using the
   values of the compliance s(ij) obtained from elastic stiffness
   constants, the values of Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio along the
   oriented direction {[}hkl] have been calculated for the samples.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the causal relationship between climate and criminal
   behaviour. Considering the characteristics of integer-valued time series
   of criminal incidents, we propose a modified Granger causality test
   based on the generalized auto-regressive conditional heteroscedasticity
   type of integer-valued time series models to analyse the relationship
   between the number of crimes and the temperature as an environmental
   factor. More precisely, we employ the Poisson, negative binomial and
   log-linear Poisson integer-valued generalized auto-regressive
   conditional heteroscedasticity models and particularly adopt a Bayesian
   method for our analysis. The Bayes factors and posterior probability of
   the null hypothesis help to determine the causality between the
   variables considered. Moreover, employing an adaptive Markov chain Monte
   Carlo sampling scheme, we estimate model parameters and initial values.
   As an illustration, we evaluate our test through a simulation study and,
   to examine whether or not temperature affects crime activities, we apply
   our method to data sets categorized as sexual offences, drug offences,
   theft of motor vehicles, and domestic-violence-related assault in
   Ballina, New South Wales, Australia. The result reveals that more sexual
   offences, drug offences and domestic-violence-related assaults occur
   during the summer than in other seasons of the year. This evidence
   strongly advocates a causal relationship between crime and temperature.}},

Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Smart materials in auxetic form present a great potential for various
   medical applications due to their unique deformation mechanisms along
   with durable infrastructure. Both analytical and finite element (FE)
   models are extensively used in literature to characterize mechanical
   response of auxetic structures but these structures are mostly thick
   enough to be considered as bulk material and 3D inherently. Auxetic
   plates in very thin form, a. e. foil, may bring numerous advantages such
   as very light design and better biodegradability when needed. However,
   there is a gap in literature on mechanical characterization of auxetic
   thin plates. In this study, structural analysis of very thin auxetic
   plates under uniaxial loading is investigated using both FE method and
   experimental method. 25 mu m thick stainless steel (316L) plates are
   fabricated with reentrant texture for three different unit cell
   dimensions and tested under uniaxial loading using universal testing
   machine. 25 and 50 mu m thick sheets with same cell dimensions were
   analyzed using implicit transient FE model including strain hardening
   and failure behaviors. FE results cover all the deformation schemes seen
   in actual tests and total deformation level matches with test results.
   Effect of plate thickness and cell geometry on auxetic behavior is
   discussed in detail using FE results. Finally, based on FE analysis
   results, an optimum geometry for prolonged auxetic behavior, high
   flexibility and high durability is suggested for future potential
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{The cotton boll weevil Anthonomus grandis Boheman (Coleoptera:
   Curculionidae) is the main pest in cotton crop around the world,
   directly affecting cotton production. In order to establish a sequential
   sampling plan, it is crucial to understand the spatial distribution of
   the pest population and the damage it causes to the crop through the
   different developmental stages of cotton plants. Therefore, this study
   aimed to investigate the spatial distribution of adults in the
   cultivation area and their oviposition and feeding behavior throughout
   the development of the cotton plants. The experiment was conducted in
   Maracaju, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil, in the 2012/2013 and 2013/2014
   growing seasons, in an area of 10,000 m(2), planted with the cotton
   cultivar FM 993. The experimental area was divided into 100 plots of 100
   m(2) (10 x 10 m) each, and five plants per plot were sampled weekly
   throughout the crop cycle. The number of flower buds with feeding and
   oviposition punctures and of adult A. grandis was recorded throughout
   the crop cycle in five plants per plot. After determining the
   aggregation indices (variance/mean ratio, Morisita's index, exponent k
   of the negative binomial distribution, and Green's coefficient) and
   adjusting the frequencies observed in the field to the distribution of
   frequencies (Poisson, negative binomial, and positive binomial) using
   the chi-squared test, it was observed that flower buds with punctures
   derived from feeding, oviposition, and feeding + oviposition showed an
   aggregated distribution in the cultivation area until 85 days after
   emergence and a random distribution after this stage. The adults of A.
   grandis presented a random distribution in the cultivation area.}},

Abstract = {{We present effects of intrinsic twist and material orthotropy on
   extension-twist-inflation coupling in circular tubes about their
   stress-free state. Simple analytical expressions for coupling
   stiffnesses corresponding to extension-twist, twist-inflation and
   extension-inflation couplings are obtained. We show that the sign of the
   extension-twist coupling stiffness, which governs initial
   overwinding/unwinding in tubes during their extension, is not just
   dependent on the tube's intrinsic twist but also on two other
   parameters: ratio of the Young's moduli in the lateral surface of
   orthotropic tube and the excess of the Poisson's ratio from an isotropy
   condition. By tuning these two parameters, one can generate the
   counter-intuitive overwinding as reported earlier in the case of DNA.
   Similarly, we show that even with positive Poisson's ratio, an
   intrinsically twisted tube could inflate on being stretched. We also
   present a scheme to obtain all the relevant stiffnesses of chiral
   single-walled carbon nanotubes from a ``one-atom unit cell{''}
   calculation. These stiffnesses, when plotted vs. the nanotube's
   chirality, exhibit interesting periodicity which has its origin in the
   6-fold symmetry of graphene. This trend is captured in the continuum
   model for a nanotube when it is assumed to be comprised of three
   families of parallel fibers on its lateral surface.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICS AND PHYSICS OF SOLIDS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{105}},
Pages = {{25-53}},

Abstract = {{This work provides a rigorous analysis of the effective response, i.e.,
   average magnetization and magnetostriction, of magnetoelastic composites
   that are subjected to overall magnetic and mechanical loads. It
   clarifies the differences between a coupled magnetomechanical analysis
   in which one applies a Eulerian (current) magnetic field and an
   electroactive one where the Lagrangian (reference) electric field is
   usually applied. For this, we propose an augmented vector potential
   variational formulation to carry out numerical periodic homogenization
   studies of magnetoelastic solids at finite strains and magnetic fields.
   We show that the developed variational principle can be used for
   bottom-up design of microstructures with desired magnetomechanical
   coupling by properly canceling out the macro-geometry and specimen shape
   effects. To achieve that, we properly treat the average Maxwell stresses
   arising from the medium surrounding the magnetoelastic representative
   volume element (RVE), while at the same time we impose a uniform average
   Eulerian and not Lagrangian magnetic field. The developed variational
   principle is then used to study a large number of ideal as well as more
   realistic two-dimensional microstructures. We study the effect of
   particle volume fraction, particle distribution and particle shape and
   orientation upon the effective magnetoelastic response at finite
   strains. We consider also unstructured isotropic microstructures based
   on random adsorption algorithms and we carry out a convergence study of
   the representativity of the proposed unit cells. Finally, three-phase
   two-dimensional auxetic microstructures are analyzed. The first consists
   of a periodic distribution of voids and particle chains in a polymer
   matrix, while the second takes advantage of particle shape and chirality
   to produce negative and positive swelling by proper change of the
   chirality and the applied magnetic field. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Rapidly decreasing cost of next-generation sequencing has led to the
   recent availability of large-scale RNA-seq data, that empowers the
   analysis of gene expression variability, in addition to gene expression
   means. In this paper, we present the MDSeq, based on the coefficient of
   dispersion, to provide robust and computationally efficient analysis of
   both gene expression means and variability on RNA-seq counts. The MDSeq
   utilizes a novel reparametrization of the negative binomial to provide
   flexible generalized linear models (GLMs) on both the mean and
   dispersion. We address challenges of analyzing large-scale RNA-seq data
   via several new developments to provide a comprehensive toolset that
   models technical excess zeros, identifies outliers efficiently, and
   evaluates differential expressions at biologically interesting levels.
   We evaluated performances of the MDSeq using simulated data when the
   ground truths are known. Results suggest that the MDSeq often
   outperforms current methods for the analysis of gene expression mean and
   variability. Moreover, the MDSeq is applied in two real RNA-seq studies,
   in which we identified functionally relevant genes and gene pathways.
   Specifically, the analysis of gene expression variability with the MDSeq
   on the GTEx human brain tissue data has identified pathways associated
   with common neurodegenerative disorders when gene expression means were
   conserved.}},

   Utilizing first-principles calculations, we have systematically
   investigated the structural stability and the physical properties of
   this (SiH)(2)O sheet. We have found a dynamically stable structure
   because it is a puckered one with bent Si-O-Si connections, which leads
   to an anisotropic elastic behaviour with negative Poisson ratios. The
   (SiH)(2)O sheet has a strain-tunable direct band gap whose valence and
   conduction band edges straddle the redox potentials of water even in the
   presence of stress (either tensile or compressive). The calculated
   carrier mobilities are prominently anisotropic: in its zigzag direction
   the electron mobility reaches a high value of 5.39 x 10(3) cm(2) V-1
   s(-1), while the hole mobility remains small. These different carrier
   mobilities permit fast charge separation and transfer, which is crucial
   for efficient solar-to-electric energy conversion for photovoltaic and
   water splitting applications. Similar to phosphorene, a typical linear
   dichroism phenomenon is also present in the (SiH)(2)O sheet. Due to its
   outstanding electronic properties, the (SiH)(2)O sheet is a promising
   material in the fields of nano-electronics, sustainable energy and fuel

   cores}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{400}},
Pages = {{227-247}},
Month = {{JUL 21}},
Abstract = {{The flexural-wave attenuation performance of traditional
   constraint-layer damping in a sandwich beam is improved by using
   periodic constrained-layer damping (PCLD), where the monolithic
   viscoelastic core is replaced with two periodically alternating
   viscoelastic cores. Closed-form solutions of the wave propagation
   constants of the infinite periodic sandwich beam and the forced response
   of the corresponding finite sandwich structure are theoretically
   derived, providing computational support on the analysis of attenuation
   characteristics. In a sandwich beam with PCLD, the flexural waves can be
   attenuated by both Bragg scattering effect and damping effect, where the
   attenuation level is mainly dominated by Bragg scattering in the
   band-gaps and by damping in the pass-bands. Affected by these two
   effects, when the parameters of periodic cores are properly selected, a
   sandwich beam with PCLD can effectively reduce vibrations of much lower
   frequencies than that with traditional constrained-layer damping. The
   effects of the parameters of viscoelastic periodic cores on band-gap
   properties are also discussed, showing that the average attenuation in
   the desired frequency band can be maximized by tuning the length ratio
   and core thickness to proper values. The research in this paper could
   possibly provide useful information for the researches and engineers to
   design damping structures. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Satisfaction, discomfort, obligations, and concerns in population-based
   breast cancer screening: cross-sectional study in a Danish population}},
Journal = {{BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{JUL 14}},
Abstract = {{Background: Potential barriers to breast cancer screening adherence
   include patient satisfaction, as well as pain, feeling obliged to
   participate, and other concerns that might compromise the level of
   satisfaction.
   The present study aimed to assess the overall satisfaction of Danish
   citizens with their breast cancer screening experiences, as well as
   their level of discomfort, concerns, and feelings of obligation to
   participate. Furthermore, we analyzed the associations between overall
   satisfaction and the remaining outcomes.
   Methods: Questionnaires were mailed to 3000 women in the Central Denmark
   Region who received screening examination results in the fall of 2013.
   The questionnaire assessed satisfaction (overall, telephone hot-line,
   and web-based self-service), discomfort (pain and boundaries of
   modesty), concerns (at invitation, while waiting for results, and after
   receiving results), and feelings of obligation to participate.
   Background information was retrieved from Statistics Denmark.
   Pearson's chi-square test was used to test differences in outcomes and
   demographic characteristic distributions between respondents and
   non-respondents and highly satisfied vs. less satisfied participants.
   Prevalence ratios (PR) with 95\% CI were assessed using Poisson
   regression with robust variance, to estimate associations between
   satisfaction and the remaining outcomes.
   Results: Among the participants, 70.3\% and 29.4\%, respectively,
   reported really good and good impressions of the screening program.
   Lower satisfaction was associated with feeling pain (prevalence ratio
   (PR), 0.82), feeling that modesty boundaries were transgressed (PR,
   0.79), experiencing screening-induced concerns (PR, 0.84), and feeling
   obliged to participate (PR, 0.96). Of the participants, 36.2\% and
   12.9\%, respectively, felt very much and moderately obliged to
   participate. A total of 72.6\% reported no screening-induced concerns,
   including 73.3\% of those with negative screening results and 38.1\% of
   those with positive screening results.
   Conclusions: Overall satisfaction with breast cancer screening was very
   high, but discomfort, feelings of obligation, and concerns were
   associated with lower satisfaction levels. A continuing focus on high
   service in breast cancer screening is important for achieving the
   highest benefit from the program. This includes initiatives to employ
   the least painful techniques, to respect the patients' modesty as much
   as possible, and to deliver fast screening results and thus minimize
   concerns among women awaiting results.}},

Title = {{Actomyosin and vimentin cytoskeletal networks regulate nuclear shape,
   mechanics and chromatin organization}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 12}},
Abstract = {{The regulation of nuclear state by the cytoskeleton is an important part
   of cellular function. Actomyosin stress fibres, microtubules and
   intermediate filaments have distinct and complementary roles in
   integrating the nucleus into its environment and influencing its
   mechanical state. However, the interconnectedness of cytoskeletal
   networks makes it difficult to dissect their individual effects on the
   nucleus. We use simple image analysis approaches to characterize nuclear
   state, estimating nuclear volume, Poisson's ratio, apparent elastic
   modulus and chromatin condensation. By combining them with cytoskeletal
   quantification, we assess how cytoskeletal organization regulates
   nuclear state. We report for a number of cell types that nuclei display
   auxetic properties. Furthermore, stress fibres and intermediate
   filaments modulate the mechanical properties of the nucleus and also
   chromatin condensation. Conversely, nuclear volume and its gross
   morphology are regulated by intracellular outward pulling forces exerted
   by myosin. The modulation exerted by the cytoskeleton onto the nucleus
   results in changes that are of similar magnitude to those observed when
   the nucleus is altered intrinsically, inducing chromatin decondensation
   or cell differentiation. Our approach allows pinpointing the
   contribution of distinct cytoskeletal proteins to nuclear mechanical
   state in physio- and pathological conditions, furthering our

Abstract = {{The first contact-mode triboelectric self-powered strain sensor using an
   auxetic polyurethane foam, conductive fabric, and polytetrafluroethylene
   (PTFE) is fabricated. Utilizing the auxetic properties of the
   polyurethane foam, the auxetic polyurethane foam would expand into the
   PTFE when the foam is stretched, causing contact electrification. Due to
   a larger contact area between the PTFE and the foam as the foam is
   stretched, this device can serve effectively as a strain sensor. The
   sensitivity of this method is explored, and this sensor has the highest
   sensitivity in all triboelectric nanogenerator devices that are used
   previously as a strain sensor. Different applications of this strain
   sensor are shown, and this sensor can be used as a human body monitoring
   system, self-powered scale to measure weight, and a seat belt to measure
   body movements inside a car seat.}},

Journal = {{INSURANCE MATHEMATICS \& ECONOMICS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{75}},
Pages = {{48-57}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{This paper extends the well-known Lee-Carter model used for forecasting
   mortality rates by utilizing a new class of time series models, known as
   Generalized Autoregressive Score (GAS) or Dynamic Conditional Score
   (DCS) models. This framework can be used to derive a wide range of
   non-Gaussian time series models with time varying coefficients and has
   shown to be very successful in financial applications. In this paper we
   propose five probability models (Poisson, binomial, negative binomial,
   Gaussian and beta) based on the GAS framework to estimate the Lee-Carter
   parameters and dynamically forecast the mortality rates using a single
   unified step. The models are applied to the mortality rates time series
   for the male population of the United States, Sweden, Japan and the UK.
   Diagnostic tests are performed on quantile residuals, model selection is
   made via AIC and predictive accuracy of the models is compared using the
   Diebold-Mariano test. We conclude that, amongst the proposed models, the
   negative binomial extension of the Lee-Carter model is the most
   appropriate for forecasting mortality rates. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Background: Auxetics, a special class of materials, tend to expand both
   in the radial and longitudinal directions when a unidirectional tensile
   force is applied. Recently, studies have come up with new designs for
   auxetic vascular and nonvascular stents which are deployed with
   commercial balloon catheters. There are some inherent limitations
   associated with a unidirectional application of expansion force in the
   effective deployment of stents. This work proposed a solution to some of
   these limitations through the use of a biaxial mode of a predetermined
   strain-based expansion mechanism.
   Method: The design incorporated a pressure-activated crank-slider
   mechanism. Fabrication of a prototype for experimental verification was
   carried out through milling and high-speed lathe machining. The testing
   of the device employed the use of auxetic stents, fabricated from a
   biocompatible polymer. A finite element study is presented to
   extrapolate experimental results to a broader range of operation and
   working conditions.
   Results and conclusions: The expansion mechanism is similar in operation
   to the opening of an umbrella. The length of the connected auxetic stent
   increases when internal hydraulic pressure is applied. The degree of
   linear expansion in 1 direction influences the expansion of auxetic
   stent in the lateral direction. As the device exerts pressure
   longitudinally, a larger amount of the force is distributed on the unit
   cells/hinges which ultimately results in an increased expansion of the
   stent.}},

Abstract = {{The Phase stability, electronic structure, elastic properties and

   and formation enthalpy show that these compounds are thermodynamically
   stable, and Ru-Ir alloys tend to exist in the form of Ru5Ir15, Ru6Ir14

   the highest hardness, and Ru8Ir12 compound has the maximal elastic

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES : Endoscopic surveillance is recommended for patients with
   Barrett's esophagus (BE). However, it remains unclear if all BE patients
   benefit from long-term surveillance. We investigated the risk of
   esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) in BE patients in relation to number of
   successive endoscopies, years of follow-up, and calendar year.
   METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of male veterans with
   newly diagnosed BE during 20042009 with follow-up until 30 September
   2011. EAC was verified using detailed structured electronic medical
   records reviews. We used Poisson regression to determine incidence
   rates, rate ratios (RR), and corresponding 95\% confidence intervals
   (CI) for EAC according to number of successive endoscopies, years of
   follow-up independent of number of follow-up endoscopies, and calendar
   year of BE diagnosis.
   RESULTS: Among 28,561 male patients with BE, 406 developed EAC during
   140,499 person-years of follow-up (median 4.9 years). EAC incidence
   rates increased with each additional endoscopy following a previous
   negative endoscopy (RR per additional endoscopy, 1.43; 95\% CI,
   1.25-1.64). Compared to the EAC incidence rate at the 1st follow-up EGD,
   the EAC incidence rate at the 5th follow-up EGD was ninefold higher
   (adjusted RR, 8.82; 95\% CI, 4.90-15.9). EAC incidence was highest at
   the first year of follow-up (5.34 per 1,000 person-years); however, EAC
   rates starting from the second follow-up year increased during
   successive years of follow up. Compared to the EAC incidence rate in the
   2nd year of follow-up, the EAC incidence rate was 1.5-fold higher in
   EGDs conducted >= 5 years after the index BE date (adjusted RR, 1.49;
   95\% CI, 1.07-2.10). In contrast, we found no significant change in EAC
   incidence rates by calendar year.
   CONCLUSIONS: Persistence of non-neoplastic BE on multiple consecutive
   endoscopies was not associated with lower EAC risk. These findings argue
   against discontinuation of endoscopic surveillance in patients with
   persistent nondysplastic BE after multiple negative endoscopies.}},

Title = {{A fourth order PDE based fuzzy c-means approach for segmentation of
   microscopic biopsy images in presence of Poisson noise for cancer
   detection}},

Abstract = {{Background and objective: For cancer detection from microscopic biopsy
   images, image segmentation step used for segmentation of cells and
   nuclei play an important role. Accuracy of segmentation approach
   dominate the final results. Also the microscopic biopsy images have
   intrinsic Poisson noise and if it is present in the image the
   segmentation results may not be accurate. The objective is to propose an
   efficient fuzzy c-means based segmentation approach which can also
   handle the noise present in the image during the segmentation process
   itself i. e. noise removal and segmentation is combined in one step.
   Methods: To address the above issues, in this paper a fourth order
   partial differential equation (FPDE) based nonlinear filter adapted to
   Poisson noise with fuzzy c-means segmentation method is proposed. This
   approach is capable of effectively handling the segmentation problem of
   blocky artifacts while achieving good tradeoffbetween Poisson noise
   removals and edge preservation of the microscopic biopsy images during
   segmentation process for cancer detection from cells.
   Results: The proposed approach is tested on breast cancer microscopic
   biopsy data set with region of interest (ROI) segmented ground truth
   images. The microscopic biopsy data set contains 31 benign and 27
   malignant images of size 896 x768. The region of interest selected
   ground truth of all 58 images are also available for this data set.
   Finally, the result obtained from proposed approach is compared with the
   results of popular segmentation algorithms; fuzzy c-means, color
   k-means, texture based segmentation, and total variation fuzzy c-means
   approaches.
   Conclusions: The experimental results shows that proposed approach is
   providing better results in terms of various performance measures such
   as Jaccard coefficient, dice index, Tanimoto coefficient, area under
   curve, accuracy, true positive rate, true negative rate, false positive
   rate, false negative rate, random index, global consistency error, and
   variance of information as compared to other segmentation approaches
   used for cancer detection. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) structure has outstanding performances in
   lightweight and energy absorption, and it can be widely applied in
   automotive industries. By combining the front anti-collision beam, crash
   box and NPR structure, a novel NPR bumper system for improving the
   crashworthiness is first proposed in the work. The performances of the
   NPR bumper system are detailed studied by comparing to traditional
   bumper system and aluminum foam filled bumper system. To achieve the
   rapid design while considering perturbation induced by parameter
   uncertainties, a multi-objective robust design optimization method of
   the NPR bumper system is also proposed. The parametric model of the
   bumper system is constructed by combining the full parametric model of
   the traditional bumper system and the parametric model of the NPR
   structure. Optimal Latin hypercube sampling technique and dual response
   surface method are combined to construct the surrogate models. The
   multi-objective robust optimization results of the NPR bumper system are
   then obtained by applying the multi-objective particle swarm
   optimization algorithm and six sigma criteria. The results yielded from
   the optimizations indicate that the energy absorption capacity is
   improved significantly by the NPR bumper system and its performances are
   further optimized efficiently by the multi-objective robust design
   optimization method.}},

Abstract = {{We assessed the association between marijuana use and retention in HIV
   care through a retrospective cohort study of patients engaged in care at
   a large HIV clinic in 2011 and 2012. Two different retention outcomes
   were assessed: not meeting the Institute of Medicine's (IOM) retention
   definition (>2 provider visits >90 days apart in a calendar year) and
   no-show visits. Any marijuana use and frequency of marijuana use were
   obtained from a substance use screening questionnaire administered at
   each clinic visit. Modified Poisson regression was used to estimate risk
   ratios and 95\% confidence intervals for the association between
   marijuana use and retention outcomes. Marijuana use was reported by 17\%
   of 1791 patients and 21\% were not retained (IOM definition). Marijuana
   use was not associated with the IOM retention outcome, but was
   associated with missing the next scheduled appointment. A non-linear
   dose-response was observed for frequency of marijuana use and missed
   visits, with daily users having the highest risk compared to non-users.
   Daily marijuana use had a negative impact on HIV clinic attendance.
   Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms by which
   marijuana use affects this outcome to inform targeted interventions.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Women who inject drugs and who also exchange sex are at
   increased risk for HIV infection, but data on this population in the
   United States remain sparse.
   Methods: This study assessed the prevalence of exchanging sex for money
   or drugs among women who inject drugs using data from the 2009 US
   National HIV Behavioral Surveillance (NHBS) system. Prevalence of being
   HIV-positive (testing positive in NHBS), HIV-positive-unaware (reporting
   being HIV-negative or unknown status but testing positive in NHBS), and
   risk behaviors and use of services were compared between women who did
   and did not exchange sex. The association between exchange sex and being
   HIV-positive-unaware of the infection was examined using multivariate
   Poisson models with robust standard errors.
   Results: Among 2305 women who inject drugs, 39\% reported receiving
   things like money or drugs from >= 1 male partners in exchange for oral,
   vaginal, or anal sex in the previous 12 months. Women who exchanged sex
   were more likely to be unemployed, homeless, lack health insurance, have
   multiple condomless vaginal or anal sex partners, and receptively share
   syringes. In multivariate analysis, exchange sex was associated with
   being HIV-positive-unaware (adjusted prevalence ratio 1.97, 95\%
   confidence intervals: 1.31 to 2.97).
   Conclusions: Prevalence of exchange sex was high in this population.
   Women who exchange sex were more likely to be socially disadvantaged,
   report sexual and injection risk, and be HIV-positive-unaware. They
   represent an important group to reach with HIV prevention, testing, and
   care services.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: We assessed prevalence of suicidal ideation and plans among
   illicit drug users and their association with contextual factors, by
   gender.
   Methods: Cross-sectional study. In a sample of 511 illicit drug users
   recruited during spring 2012 in drug treatment and prevention facilities
   in Catalonia (Spain), the prevalence of suicidal ideation/plans in the
   last 12 months was assessed. Poisson regression was used to examine
   associations between suicidal ideation/plans and various factors
   (socio-demographic, psychological, illegal drug market activities and
   marginal income generation activities, which included any reported sex
   work, stealing, peddling, begging or borrowing on credit from a dealer).
   Results: The average age was 37.9 years (standard deviation: 8.62);
   76.3\% were men. Suicidal ideation/plans were reported by 30.8\% of men
   and 38.8\% of women, with no significant differences by age or gender.
   Recent aggression (male prevalence ratio {[}PR] = 2.2; female PR= 1.4),
   psychological treatment (male PR= 1.2; female PR= 1.3) and
   illegal/marginal income generation activities (male PR= 1.5; female PR =
   1.1) were associated with suicidal ideation/plans. Men who trafficked
   were more likely to have suicidal ideation/plans (PR= 1.3), while prison
   history was positive for women (PR= 1.8) and negative for men (PR= 0.7).
   Conclusions: Prevalence of suicidal ideation/plans was high among
   illicit drug users recruited from healthcare facilities. Besides
   psychological variables, participation in illegal market activities and
   crime ought to be considered in drug users' suicidal prevention. Suicide
   risk needs to be evaluated in drug treatment facilities and
   psychological status and context contemplated. (C) 2017 SESPAS.

Abstract = {{Recently, two-dimensional (2D) transition metal nitrides have triggered
   an enormous interest for their tunable mechanical, optoelectronic, and
   magnetic properties, significantly enriching the family of 2D materials.
   Here, by using a broad range of first-principles calculations, we report
   a systematic study of 2D rectangular materials of titanium mononitride
   (TiN), exhibiting high energetic and thermal stability due to in-plane
   d-p orbital hybridization and synergetic out-of-plane electronic
   delocalization. The rectangular TiN monolayer also possesses enhanced
   auxeticity and ferroelasticity with an alternating order of Possion's
   Ratios, stemming from the competitive interactions of intra- and
   inter-Ti-N chains. Such TiN nanosystem is a n-type metallic conductor
   with specific tunable pseudogaps. Halogenation of TiN monolayer
   downshifts the Fermi level, achieving the optical energy gap up to 1.85
   eV for TiNCl(Br) sheet. Overall, observed electronic features suggest
   that the two materials are potential photocatalysts for water splitting
   application. These results extend emerging phenomena in a rich family 2D
   transition-metal-based materials and hint for a new platform for the
   next-generation functional nanomaterials.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a 1D fluid model is developed to study the
   characteristics of a discharge in argon with small admixtures of oxygen
   at atmospheric pressure. This model consists of a series of equations,
   including continuity equations for electrons, positive ions, negative
   ions and neutral particles, the energy equation, and the Poisson
   equation for electric potential. Special attention has been paid to the
   electron energy dissipation and the mechanisms of electron heating,
   while the admixture of oxygen is in the range of 0.1\%-0.6\%. It is
   found that when the oxygen-to-argon ratio grows, the discharge is
   obviously divided into three stages: electron growth, electron reduction
   and the electron remaining unchanged. Furthermore, the cycle-averaged
   electric field, electron temperature, electron Ohmic heating, electron
   collisionless heating, electron energy dissipation and the net electron
   production are also studied in detail, and when the oxygen-toargon ratio
   is relatively larger (R = 0.6\%), double value peaks of electron Ohmic
   heating appear in the sheath. According to the results of the numerical
   simulation, various oxygen-to-argon ratios result in different amounts
   of electron energy dissipation and electron heating.}},

   material are calculated in terms of element mutual energies. By this
   method, no sensitivity information is required to find the optimal
   topology for the considered design objectives: bulk modulus, shear
   modulus, and negative Poisson's ratio. The proposed method is validated

Abstract = {{Non-linear dynamic behavior of sandwich plates with shape memory alloy
   (SMA) reinforced face sheets and soft auxetic (negative Poisson ratio)
   cores is investigated in the present article. Plates with stiff or
   traditional cores may be regarded as special cases. One of superiorities
   of the present work is considering the localized and instantaneous
   changes of martensite volume fraction of the individual particles of the
   SMA wires, through proposing a constitutive law and a cyclic
   phase-transformation tracing algorithm that are appropriate for pursuing
   the cyclic loading events and the relevant nested hysteretic
   pseudoelastic loops due to the plate vibration. Another novelty is
   incorporation of the core auxeticity and transverse compliance, through
   an efficient global-local layerwise plate theory. An updating iterative
   approach is employed to solve the resulting non-linear time-dependent
   finite element formulation. Results confirm the vibration attenuation
   due to the loss in the stored energy of the plate that is consumed by
   the SMA wires during the phase transformation. Moreover, the auxeticity
   of the core has led to significant stiffening in both the core and plate
   and consequently, reductions in the lateral deflections of the plate.

Number = {{13}},
Pages = {{3510-3525}},

Abstract = {{We develop a projected Nesterov's proximal-gradient (PNPG) approach for
   sparse signal reconstruction that combines adaptive step size with
   Nesterov's momentum acceleration. The objective function that we wish to
   minimize is the sum of a convex differentiable data-fidelity (negative
   log-likelihood (NLL)) term and a convex regularization term. We apply
   sparse signal regularization where the signal belongs to a closed convex
   set within the closure of the domain of the NLL; the convex-set
   constraint facilitates flexible NLL domains and accurate signal
   recovery. Signal sparsity is imposed using the l(1)-norm penalty on the
   signal's linear transform coefficients. The PNPG approach employs a
   projected Nesterov's acceleration step with restart and a duality-based
   inner iteration to compute the proximal mapping. We propose an adaptive
   step-size selection scheme to obtain a good local majorizing function of
   the NLL and reduce the time spent backtracking. Thanks to step-size
   adaptation, PNPG converges faster than the methods that do not adjust to
   the local curvature of the NLL. We present an integrated derivation of
   the momentum acceleration and proofs of O(k-2) objective function
   convergence rate and convergence of the iterates, which account for
   adaptive step size, inexactness of the iterative proximal mapping, and
   the convex-set constraint. The tuning of PNPG is largely application
   independent. Tomographic and compressed-sensing reconstruction
   experiments with Poisson generalized linear and Gaussian linear
   measurement models demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental sampling has been identified as an effective procedure to
   verify correct implementation of food safety control systems in catering
   establishments. At the same time characterization of microbial
   distribution of environmental contamination could potentially address
   effective fit-for-purpose sampling procedures. In this study 1202
   environmental samples from three types of food catering establishments
   located in Madrid, Spain were monitored for presence of mesophilic
   bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia
   coli. Samples corresponded to food-contact utensils, handlers' contact
   utensils and food handlers, using 3MTm PetrifilmTM count plates.
   Contamination routes were identified through the calculation of Spearman
   correlation coefficients. Further, characterization of statistical
   distributions of microbial contamination and suggestion of sampling
   procedures were also performed. Results showed that 53.0\% of the
   samples were positive for at least one of the bacterial group studied
   and 328 among those (27.1\%) with counts between 1 and 15 CHI/plate.
   Enterobacteriaceae were present in 62.1\% of food handlers' samples as
   well as E. coli and S. aureus (7.5\% and 26.6\%, respectively).
   Contamination routes from food handlers to handlers'-utensils was
   identified in a bidirectional way, being it subsequently spread to
   utensils in contact with foods. Finally, it was shown that the selection
   of the microbial distribution significantly affected significantly the
   number of samples needed to detect positives above a certain microbial
   level. As expected, when negative results are present (high zero counts
   or left censored data), Poisson-log normal distributions can describe
   properly the distribution of microbial contamination. However, log
   normal distributions presented better fit for samples with higher
   microbial counts and right-censored data (mesophilic bacteria) so that
   they can be used to describe contamination at high levels. The data and
   results generated in this study could be of high relevance to food
   safety authorities to appropriately address environmental sampling
   procedures in catering establishments. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   properties. In the living world microorganisms are commonly used for
   preparing porous food by fermentation; here carbon nanotubes, graphene

   such microorganisms during the gelling of the silicone matrix results in
   bionic composites with buckled/collapsed cells that infer, as
   rationalized with an analytical model and excluded in a abiotic
   experimental comparison, auxetic properties. During stretching it is
   found that the Poisson's ratio of such composites changes sign, from
   negative to positive, and the variation of the electrical resistance is
   negative. In addition to the conductivity increment, a general increment
   of the stretchability and damage resistance with respect to the
   composites prepared by abiotic process is observed. Bionic composites,
   even if in their infancy, can thus be multifunctional and superior to

Abstract = {{We develop mechanical and numerical homogenization models for the large
   strains response of auxetic structures in order to derive their
   effective elastic response accounting for large changes of the geometry.
   We construct a strain driven nonlinear scheme for the computation of the
   stress-strain relation of these repetitive networks over a reference
   representative unit cell (abbreviated as RUC). Homogenization schemes
   are developed to evaluate the effective nonlinear mechanical response of
   periodic networks prone to an auxetic behavior, in both planar and 3D
   configurations, which are substituted by an effective micropolar
   continuum at the intermediate mesoscopic level. The couple stress part
   of the homogenized constitutive law takes into account the impact of the
   local rotations at the mesoscopic level and allows computing the bending
   response. This methodology is applied to four planar auxetic periodic
   lattices (the re-entrant hexagonal honeycomb and alternative honeycomb
   topologies, including the arrowhead, Milton and hexachiral structures),
   and to the 3D re-entrant and pyramid-shaped lattices. We have
   considering successively the in-plane and out-of-plane responses of
   these structures. The transition to an auxetic behavior is shown to be
   triggered by the imposed strain over the unit cell boundary. The
   computed evolutions of Poisson's ratio versus the imposed stretch
   traduce an enhanced auxetic response as the stretch is increased. A
   satisfactory agreement is obtained between the homogenized stress strain
   responses and the responses computed numerically by finite element
   simulations performed over a repeating unit cell. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

   Structures with Fully Mechanically Controllable Thermal Transports}},
Journal = {{ADVANCED MATERIALS INTERFACES}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{JUN 9}},
Abstract = {{Graphene is considered as an ideal material candidate for
   next-generation electronic devices due to its high carrier mobility
   while the associated thermal management has become a critical barrier.
   Designing graphene whose thermal transport properties can be tuned
   through external fields is highly desired. Here, an auxetic graphene
   (AG) and a contractile graphene (CG) are created and a conceptual design
   of thermal controllable graphene heterostructures is demonstrated by
   tailoring them together. Using computational simulations, it is shown
   that the thermal conductivity of graphene heterostructures can be
   regulated by patterning AG and CG unit cells with different interface
   properties under a uniaxial tensile strain. Analyses of both mechanical
   deformation and vibrational spectra indicate that the thermal transport
   properties of graphene heterostructures are highly dependent on their
   mechanical stress distribution, and also rely on the interfaces that are
   parallel with the directions of mechanical loadings. Theoretical models
   that integrate the contributions of mechanical loading and
   patterned-interfaces are developed to quantitatively describe the
   thermal conductivity of graphene heterostructures. Good agreement of
   thermal conductivity between theoretical predictions and extensive
   simulations is obtained. These designs and findings are expected to pave
   a new route to seek interface-mediated stretchable thermal electronics
   with mechanically controllable performance.}},

Abstract = {{The single-layer black phosphorus is characterized by its puckered

   combined with the bond stretching and angle bending interactions, is
   able to provide a good description for the mechanical properties of
   single-layer black phosphorus. We also propose a nonlinear angle-angle

Abstract = {{The mechanical behavior of a two-dimensional structure with negative
   Poisson` s ratio (auxetic structure) was experimentally studied. The
   concave hexagon (re-entrant honeycomb) with straight sides is often an
   element of auxetic structures. In this paper, a new design of a concave
   hexagon in which a part of straight elements is replaced with
   curvilinear elements is suggested. The sample (110 x 20 x 0.7 mm plate
   with the central part of 26.2 x 20 x 0.7 mm) was made by the laser
   cutting method from nonauxetic polyethyleneterephthalate (PET-a
   amorphous) plates. The transverse size of elements of hexagons is equal
   to sample thickness. The sample was subjected to a monotonous uniaxial
   tension until the last moment when it still maintained its planarity. As
   a result of experimental data processing the tensile force -
   displacement diagram was calculated. Variability of Poisson` s ratio
   depending on engineering deformations was studied. The analysis showed
   that auxetic structure at tension attained the maximum longitudinal
   deformation (before loss of stability) of 99 \%, and the maximum
   transverse deformation of 59 \%. Elastic deformations reached 2 \%.
   Poisson's ratio defined by analogy with elastic small deformations
   varies in the range from -0.19 to -0.60 with an increase of longitudinal
   and transverse deformations.}},

Abstract = {{The prediction of earthquakes remains challenging. An unconventional
   idea that earthquakes can be predicted is proposed, based on the
   mechanics of the double block system (DBS). The central point of the
   mechanics of DBS lies in the measurement of the forces acting on the
   surface separating the two blocks, the relation of which should obey
   Newton's laws (referred to as Newton's forces). A Newton's force
   monitoring system (NFMS), consisting of in situ measurement, remote
   sensing and indoor monitoring, has been developed. The key instrument of
   the NFMS is the constant-resistance and large-deformation (CRLD) bolt
   incorporated with a negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) structure, referred
   to as CRLD bolt or NPR bolt, because of its unconventional performance
   that makes measurement of the Newton's forces possible in
   seismically-active faults. The basic analytical and experimental work on
   formulating the DBS and NPR cable is outlined. The methods and
   techniques of the NFMS are presented. The validity of the mechanics of
   DBS and the applicability of the NRMS were verified by indoor
   experiments on Wenchuan and Longmen mountain active faults. Among many
   successful applications of NFMS to forecasting landslides, one field
   case in Nanfen open pit iron mines is presented; four field cases of the
   application of NFMS in registering the activities of the seismically
   active faults are also presented.}},

Title = {{Analogies across auxetic models based on deformation mechanism}},
Journal = {{PHYSICA STATUS SOLIDI-RAPID RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{This paper reviews 2D auxetic models, including 3D deformation models
   with 2D auxetic behavior, from mechanism perspective instead of
   geometrical perspective. On this basis, auxetic models across different
   geometrical groups can be regrouped into clusters that exhibit analogy
   in deformation mechanism. Factors that are taken into consideration
   include the identification of corresponding (i) rotation and
   non-rotation units, as well as (ii) linkages/joints between rotation and
   non-rotation units and non-linkages/non-joints across various auxetic
   models. As a result, five clusters of auxetic models have been
   identified, in which auxetic models within each cluster are analogous to
   each other. The identified clusters are those that exhibit: ( a) double
   periodicity in the rotation direction of their rotating units, (b)
   synchronized rotation direction of their rotation units, (c) single
   periodicity in the rotation direction of their rotating units, (d)
   random rotation of their rotation units, and (e) non-rotation of units.
   Results from this analogy identification place auxetic models in a
   systematic representation and will enrich future development of auxetic
   models, particularly those that do not fall within these five clusters.
   It is proposed that future work includes 3D auxetic models as well as
   ordering of analogous auxetic models according to their joints or
   linkage geometries. (C) 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA, Weinheim}},

   Composite Materials under Compression}},
Journal = {{POLYMERS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{It is well known that elastic instabilities induce pattern
   transformations when a soft cellular structure is compressed beyond
   critical limits. The nonlinear phenomena of pattern transformations make
   them a prime candidate for controlling macroscopic or microscopic
   deformation and auxetic properties of the material. In this present
   work, the novel mechanical properties of soft cellular structures and
   related hydrogel-elastomer composites are examined through experimental
   investigation and numerical simulations. We provide two reliable
   approaches for fabricating hydrogel-elastomer composites with rationally
   designed properties and transformed patterns, and demonstrate that
   different geometries of the repeat unit voids of the periodic pattern
   can be used to influence the global characteristics of the soft
   composite material. The experimental and numerical results indicate that
   the transformation event is dependent on the boundary conditions and
   material properties of matrix material for soft cellular structures;
   meanwhile, the deformation-triggered pattern of matrix material affects
   the pattern switching and mechanical properties of the
   hydrogel-elastomer material, thus providing future perspectives for
   optimal design, or serving as a fabrication suggestion of the new
   hydrogel-elastomer composite material.}},

Abstract = {{Objective
   To compare clinical features, treatments and outcomes in men with
   non-metastatic prostate cancer (PCa) according to whether they were
   referred for symptoms or elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level.
   Patients and Methods
   This study used data from the South Australia Prostate Cancer Clinical
   Outcomes Collaborative database; a multi-institutional clinical registry
   covering both the public and private sectors. We included all
   non-metastatic cases from 1998 to 2013 referred for urinary/prostatic
   symptoms or elevated PSA level. Multivariate Poisson regression was used
   to identify characteristics associated with symptomatic presentation and
   compare treatments according to reason for referral. Outcomes (i.e.
   overall survival, PCa-specific survival, metastasis-free survival and
   disease-free survival) were compared using multivariate Cox proportional
   hazards and competing risk regression.
   Results
   Our analytical cohort consisted of 4 841 men with localized PCa.
   Symptomatic men had lower-risk disease (incidence ratio {[}IR] 0.70,
   95\% confidence interval {[}CI] 0.61-0.81 for high vs low risk), fewer
   radical prostatectomies (IR 0.64, CI: 0.56-0.75) and less radiotherapy
   (IR 0.86, CI: 0.77-0.96) than men presenting with elevated PSA level.
   All-cause mortality (hazard ratio {[}HR] 1.31, CI: 1.16-1.47),
   disease-specific mortality (HR 1.42, CI: 1.13-1.77) and risk of
   metastases (HR 1.36, CI: 1.13-1.64) were higher for men presenting with
   symptoms, after adjustment for other clinical characteristics; however,
   risk of disease progression did not differ (HR 0.90, CI: 0.74-1.07)
   amongst those treated curatively. Subgroup analyses indicated poorer PCa
   survival for symptomatic referral among men undergoing radical
   prostatectomy (HR 3.4, CI: 1.3-8.8), those aged >70 years (HR 1.4, CI:
   1.0-1.8), men receiving private treatment (HR 2.1, CI: 1.3-3.3), those
   diagnosed via biopsy (HR 1.3, CI: 1.0-1.7) and those diagnosed before
   2006 (HR 1.6, CI: 1.2-2.7).
   Conclusion
   Our results suggest that symptomatic presentation may be an independent
   negative prognostic indicator for PCa survival. More complete assessment
   of disease grade and extent, more definitive treatment and increased
   post-treatment monitoring among symptomatic cases may improve outcomes.
   Further research to determine any pathophysiological basis for poor
   outcomes in symptomatic men is warranted.}},

Abstract = {{Composites with auxetic effect have been drawing more attention in
   recent years due to their unique features and wide applications. In this
   study, a kind of novel multilayer orthogonal structural composite with
   auxetic effect was fabricated for energy absorption and impact
   resistance. Non-auxetic composite with the same raw materials but with
   different reinforcement structure was also fabricated for comparison in
   order to better understand the effect of reinforced structure on the
   deformation mechanism and mechanical responses of the composites. Since
   the quasi-static compressive properties and Poisson's ratio effect of
   composites had been investigated previously, this paper only focused on
   the study of the low velocity drop-weight impact tests of composites
   under impact energies from 7.25 J to 65.25 J. It was shown that both
   auxetic and non-auxetic composites were strain rate sensitive from 34.23
   s(-1) to 111.48 s(-1), but they exhibited totally different mechanical
   responses due to different deformation and damage mechanism. Pull out
   tests demonstrated that strong interfacial bonding between the
   reinforcements and matrix could ensure the desired deformation of
   structural reinforcements and auxetic effect of the composite. It was
   also concluded that the auxetic composite had better energy absorption
   performance in medium strain range. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a level set-based robust topology optimization (RTO)
   method for computational design of metamaterials under hybrid
   uncertainties, e.g. auxetics with negative Poisson's ratio, where the
   Young's modulus of the solid is described as a random variable while the
   Poisson's ratio is regarded as an interval variable. Firstly, the robust
   objective function is formulated by a combination of interval mean and
   interval variance of the deterministic objective function. Secondly, the
   interval mean and interval variance are computed by a hybrid uncertain
   analysis approach, termed as Polynomial Chaos-Chebyshev Interval (PCCI)
   method. Thirdly, the design sensitivities of the robust objective
   function are obtained after the implementation of the PCCI method.
   Finally, a powerful parametric level set method (PLSM) in conjunction
   with the numerical homogenization method is applied to achieve the
   robust topological design for the auxetic microstructure. Several
   numerical cases are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
   proposed method for the robust topology optimization problems. This
   method is non-intrusive and general, and can be easily extended to a
   range of design problems of micro-structured metamaterials. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{Limited data are available on the real-world effectiveness of newer oral
   disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) in multiple sclerosis. The purpose of
   this study was to retrospectively compare the real-world effectiveness
   of dimethyl fumarate (DMF), fingolimod, teriflunomide, and injectable
   DMTs in routine clinical practice based on US claims data.
   Patients newly-initiating DMF, interferon beta (IFN beta), glatiramer
   acetate (GA), teriflunomide, or fingolimod in 2013 were identified in
   the Truven MarketScan Commercial Claims Databases (N = 6372). Relapse
   episodes were identified based on a published claim-based algorithm and
   used to determine the annualized relapse rate (ARR) for the year before
   and after initiating therapy. Poisson and negative binomial regression
   was used to determine the adjusted incidence rate ratio (IRR) for each
   therapy relative to DMF.
   Significant ARR reductions in the year after initiating therapy were
   reported for DMF and fingolimod (P < 0.0001). Compared with DMF, the
   adjusted IRR (95\% CI) for relapse in the year after initiating therapy
   was 1.27 (1.10-1.46) for IFN beta, 1.34 (1.17-1.53) for GA, 1.23
   (1.05-1.45) for teriflunomide, and 1.03 (0.88-1.21) for fingolimod.
   Results were consistent across subgroup and sensitivity analyses.
   These real-world data suggest DMF and fingolimod have similar
   effectiveness and demonstrate superior effectiveness to IFN beta, GA,
   and teriflunomide.

Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{More and more researches have been focused on auxetic composite
   materials and a number of composite structures have been fabricated,
   synthesized or theoretically predicted. Since their structures are
   complex, their mechanical behavior is very difficult to be
   characterized. The purpose of the present paper is to systematically
   investigate the negative Poisson's ratio effect of a novel
   three-dimensional auxetic orthogonal textile composite under
   compression. Firstly, a set of equations are derived for the theoretical
   calculation of the Poisson's ratio of the composite under uniaxial
   compression via an analytical analysis. Secondly, a finite element model
   (FEM) is created by ANSYS Parameter Design Language and is verified by
   experiment. The deviation between the simulation and experimental
   results are carefully discussed. Thirdly, the effects of geometry
   parameters and material properties on the negative Poisson's ratio
   behavior of the composite are discussed based on the FEM simulated
   results. At last, a general basis is concluded. It is expected that the
   outcomes of this study could be useful to guide the design and
   fabrication of auxetic textile composites with required negative
   Poisson's ratio behavior.}},

Abstract = {{When a solid object is stretched, in general, it shrinks transversely.
   However, the abnormal ones are auxetic, which exhibit lateral expansion,
   or negative Poisson ratio. While graphene is a paradigm 2D material,
   surprisingly, graphene converts from normal to auxetic at certain
   strains. Here, we show via molecular dynamics simulations that the
   normal-auxeticity mechanical phase transition only occurs in uniaxial
   tension along the armchair direction or the nearest neighbor direction.
   Such a characteristic persists at temperatures up to 2400 K. Besides
   monolayer, bilayer and multi-layer graphene also possess such a
   normal-auxeticity transition. This unique property could extend the
   applications of graphene to new horizons.}},

Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{MAY 30}},
Abstract = {{Background: Little information on the prevalence of Kaposi's sarcoma
   associated herpesvirus (KSHV) among HIVnegative individuals is available
   from Asia.
   Methods: In the present study, we report findings from a new survey of
   KSHV in 983 HIV-negative male migrants from Shanghai and their
   combination with previous similar surveys of 600 female migrants, 600
   female sex-workers (FSW), 1336 sexually transmitted infection (STI)
   clinic male patients, 439 intravenous drug-users (IVDU), and 226 men
   having sex with men (MSM) from China. KSHV-specific antibodies against
   latent and lytic antigens were assessed using Sf9 and BC3 monoclonal
   immunofluorescence assay. Age-adjusted prevalence ratios (PR) and 95\%
   confidence interval (95\% CI) for KSHV-positivity were estimated using
   Poisson regression.
   Results: In total, 4184 HIV-negative participants were included. KSHV
   prevalence ranged from 9.8\% (95\% CI: 7.9\%-11.7\%) in male migrants to
   32.3\% (95\% CI: 24.1\%-34.1\%) in MSM. IVDU show intermediate level
   (17.5\%, 95\% CI: 14.1\%-21.4\%). KSHV was associated with syphilis (PR
   = 2.03, 95\% CI: 1.38-2.98) in MSM but not in other groups. An
   association with human herpes virus 2 was also found among MSM (PR = 1.
   83, 95\%: 1.22-2.75) but not in migrant workers or FSW.
   Conclusions: KSHV prevalence in HIV-negative heterosexuals, FSW, and STI
   male patients from China is approximately 10\%, but 2-and 3-fold higher
   in IVDU and MSM, respectively. Associations of KSHV with STIs among MSM
   only suggest that sexual transmission of the virus is important in MSM
   but not in heterosexuals.}},

   transition metal dichalcogenides}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{MAY 25}},
Abstract = {{Materials with a negative Poisson's ratio, also known as auxetic
   materials, exhibit unusual and counterintuitive mechanical
   behaviour-becoming fatter in cross-section when stretched. Such
   behaviour is mostly attributed to some special re-entrant or hinged
   geometric structures regardless of the chemical composition and
   electronic structure of a material. Here, using first-principles
   calculations, we report a class of auxetic single-layer two-dimensional
   materials, namely, the 1T-type monolayer crystals of groups 6-7
   transition-metal dichalcogenides, MX2 (M = Mo, W, Tc, Re; X = S, Se,
   Te). These materials have a crystal structure distinct from all other
   known auxetic materials. They exhibit an intrinsic in-plane negative
   Poisson's ratio, which is dominated by electronic effects. We attribute
   the occurrence of such auxetic behaviour to the strong coupling between
   the chalcogen p orbitals and the intermetal t(2g)-bonding orbitals
   within the basic triangular pyramid structure unit. The unusual auxetic
   behaviour in combination with other remarkable properties of monolayer
   two-dimensional materials could lead to novel multi-functionalities.}},

Abstract = {{Experimental study was performed to investigate fracture and impact
   properties of novel Auxetic Kevlar laminated composites. For comparison,
   standard Kevlar woven composites with and without polyurethane treatment
   were also considered in this study. For these three composites, short
   nylon fibers of two different fiber lengths and three different fiber
   densities were flocked between laminates. Vacuum infusion process along
   with optimized compaction was employed to fabricate composites. The
   double cantilever beam configuration was used to investigate the
   fracture properties. The Auxetic Kevlar composites showed a significant
   improvement of 225\% in fracture toughness compared to regular woven
   Kevlar composites. Furthermore, the initiation toughness was increased
   by 577\% with the application of flocking in Auxetic Kevlar. During
   impact testing, the Auxetic Kevlar reinforced composites showed a
   significant reduction in damaged area compared to woven counterpart. On
   the other hand, the reduction in damaged area influenced the reduction
   in impact energy absorption. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Using density functional theory combined with a semi-empirical van der
   Waals dispersion correction, we have investigated the stability of
   lattice defects including boron vacancy, substitutional and interstitial
   X (X=H, C, B, N, O) and Sigma 5 tilt grain boundaries in borophene and
   their influence on the anisotropic mechanical properties of this
   two-dimensional system. The pristine borophene has significant in-plane
   Young's moduli and Poisson's ratio anisotropy due to its strong and
   highly coordinated B-B bonds. The concentration of B vacancy and Sigma 5
   grain boundary could be rather high given that their formation energies
   are as low as 0.10 eV and 0.06 eV/angstrom respectively. In addition,
   our results also suggest that borophene can react easily with H-2, O-2
   and N-2 when exposed to these molecules. We find that the mechanical
   properties of borophene are remarkably degraded by these defects. The
   anisotropy in Poisson's ratio, however, can be tuned by some of them.
   Furthermore, the adsorbed H or substitutional C may induce remarkably
   negative Poisson's ratio in borophene, and the substitutional C or N can
   significantly increase the Poisson's ratio by contrast.}},

Title = {{Optical spatial solitons in supercooled aqueous solutions}},
Journal = {{ACTA PHYSICA SINICA}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{66}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{MAY 5}},
Abstract = {{In recent years, nonlocal spatial solitons have attracted a great deal
   of attention. Optical spatial solitons result from the suppression of
   beam diffraction by the light-induced perturbed refractive index. For
   spatial nonlocal solitons, the light-induced perturbed refractive index
   of medium depends on the light intensity nonlocally, namely, the
   perturbed refractive index at a point is determined not only by the
   light intensity at that point but also by the light intensity in its
   vicinity. Such a spatial nonlocality may originate from heat transfer,
   like the nonlocal bright solitons in lead glass and dark solitons in
   liquids or gases. The perturbed refractive index. Delta n of lead glass
   or liquid is direct proportional to the light-induced temperature
   perturbation Delta t, i.e. Delta n = beta(1). Delta t. The proportional
   coefficient beta(1) is positive (negative) for lead glass (liquid), and
   the light-induced temperature perturbation. Delta t is determined by the
   Poisson equation del(2)(Delta t) = -DI, where I is the light intensity
   and D is a coefficient. In this paper, we investigate another type of
   thermal nonlinear effect, in which the perturbed refractive index. Delta
   n depends on the light-induced temperature perturbation. Delta t in a
   new way that Delta n = beta(1)Delta t + beta(2)(Delta t)(2). It has been
   indicated previously that the refractive index of a supercooled aqueous
   solution depends on the temperature, specifically n(t) = n(0) -
   beta(2)(t - t(0))(2), where n(0) = 1 : 337733 for 501 nm light wave,
   t(0) = -0.1 degrees C and beta(2) = 3 x 10(-6) K-2. So for t < t(0), the
   refractive index of aqueous solution increases with temperature rising,
   while t > t(0), it decreases with temperature increasing. In this paper,
   we use the numerical simulation method to investigate the propagation
   and interaction properties of optical solitons propagating in a
   supercooled aqueous solution, whose temperature on boundary is
   maintained at some value below t(0), with the aqueous solution placed in
   a thermostatic chamber. Obviously, the inner temperature of the solution
   rises, owing to absorbing some optical energies of the light beam
   propagating in it, and as a consequence the inner refractive index
   changes according to n(t) = n(0) - beta(2)(t - t(0))(2). For a soliton
   with a low power, the inner temperature t of the solution is always kept
   below t(0), so the refractive index at a point with a higher t is larger
   than that at another point with a lower t. In this case, the solution
   behaves as a self-focusing medium. A soliton with a higher power has a
   narrower beam width and a larger propagation constant, and the soliton
   takes a bell shape. However, for a soliton with a rather high power, the
   temperature in the core will be higher than t(0) while the temperature
   in the periphery is still below t(0). Therefore, the part of the
   solution in the core behaves as a self-defocusing medium while the part
   in the periphery behaves as a self-focusing medium. For such a case, the
   higher the power of the soliton, the larger the radius of the core is
   and the larger the beam width of the soliton, so the soliton takes a
   crater shape with a saturated propagation constant. Finally we also
   investigate the interaction between two solitons in a supercooled
   aqueous solution.
   For two neighboring beams with a rather high total power, they cannot
   maintain their individualities any more during the interaction, but
   merge into an expanding crater.}},

Abstract = {{By means of comprehensive density functional theory (DFT) computations,
   we designed a new two-dimensional (2D) structure of silicon, namely,
   tetra-silicene. In tetra-silicene, each silicon atom binds with four
   neighboring Si atoms to form a 2D network composed of only tetragons.
   Our DFT computations demonstrate that tetra-silicene is of rather high
   experimental feasibility, as indicated by its considerable cohesive
   energy, all positive modes in the phonon spectrum, and the well
   maintained structure after 10 ps first-principles molecular dynamics
   simulations at 500 K. Tetra-silicene has rather intriguing mechanical
   properties featured with unusual negative Poissons ratios. Remarkably,
   different from hexagonal silicene (hexa-silicene) which is semi-metallic
   without a band gap, tetra-silicene is semiconducting with an appreciable
   indirect band gap of 0.19 eV, and it has a considerable carrier mobility
   of 1639.07 cm(2) V-1 s(-1). Encouragingly, our simulations suggest that
   tetra-silicene can be flexibly produced from hexa-silicene via
   mechanical conversion. Once synthesized, tetra-silicene would find many
   important applications in electronics and mechanical devices.}},

Journal = {{BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH}},

Abstract = {{Background: Prevention interventions for people living with HIV/AIDS are
   an important component of HIV programs. We report the results of a pilot
   evaluation of a four-hour, clinic-based training for healthcare
   providers in South Africa on HIV prevention assessments and messages.
   This pre/post pilot evaluation examined whether the training was
   associated with providers delivering more prevention messages.
   Methods: Seventy providers were trained at four public primary care
   clinics with a high volume of HIV patients. Pre- and post-training
   patient exit surveys were conducted using Audio-Computer Assisted
   Structured Interviews. Seven provider appropriate messaging outcomes and
   one summary provider outcome were compared pre- and post-training using
   Poisson regression.
   Results: Four hundred fifty-nine patients pre-training and 405
   post-training with known HIV status were interviewed, including 175 and
   176 HIV positive patients respectively. Among HIV positive patients,
   delivery of all appropriate messages by providers declined
   post-training. The summary outcome decreased from 56 to 50\%; adjusted
   rate ratio 0.92 (95\% CI = 0.87-0.97). Sensitivity analyses adjusting
   for training coverage and time since training detected fewer declines.
   Among HIV negative patients the summary score was stable at 32\% pre-
   and post-training; adjusted rate ratio 1.05 (95\% CI = 0.98-1.12).
   Conclusions: Surprisingly, this training was associated with a decrease
   in prevention messages delivered to HIV positive patients by providers.
   Limited training coverage and delays between training and post-training
   survey may partially account for this apparent decrease. A more targeted
   approach to prevention messages may be more effective.}},

Abstract = {{Technological progress allows for an ever-faster acquisition of
   hyperspectral data, challenging the users to keep up with interpreting
   the recorded data. Matrix factorization, the representation of data sets
   by bases (or loads) and coefficient (or score) images is long used to
   support the interpretation of complex data sets. We propose in this
   publication Simplex Volume Maximization (SiVM) for the analysis of X-ray
   fluorescence (XRF) imaging data sets. SiVM selects archetypical data
   points that represents the data set and thus provides easily
   understandable bases, preserves the non-negative character of XRF data
   sets and has low demands concerning computing resources. We apply SiVM
   on an XRF data set of Hans Memling's Portrait of a man from the
   Lespinette family from the collection of the Mauritshuis (The Hague, NL)
   and discuss capabilities and shortcomings of SiVM. (C) 2017 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The dynamic crushing behavior of the opencell aluminum foam with
   negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) was investigated using the finite-element
   (FE) method. The plateau stress, the specific energy absorption, and the
   deformation modes are determined using the FE models. The results
   indicate that the plateau stress and specific energy absorption (SEA) of
   NPR open-cell foam under impact loading are less than the conventional
   foam with the same relative density, and the deformation pattern of NPR
   open-cell foam material is completely different from the conventional
   foam material. The NPR open-cell foam material is not suitable for
   energy absorption under lowvelocity impact, but the negative Poisson's
   ratio effect on deformation modes becomes smaller with the impact
   velocity increasing. The length-to-height ratio which is defined for a
   cell having certain geometric characteristics is a key parameter to
   design the NPR foams materials.}},

Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MECHANICS A-SOLIDS}},

Abstract = {{Elastic longitudinal tension of thin two-layered plate composed of
   materials having positive and negative Poisson's ratios (auxetics and
   nonauxetics) is considered. Isotropic materials and crystals with cubic
   fourfold symmetry axis coinciding with the direction of tension are
   analyzed. The analytical dependences for effective Poisson's ratios of
   the plates on the ratio of layer thicknesses, Poisson's ratios and
   Young's moduli ratios of initial joined materials are derived. It was
   found that effective Poisson's ratio do not follow the rule of mixtures.
   Violation is particularly essential for the strong initial isotropic
   auxetics and incompressible isotropic nonauxetics. Derivation of general
   formulas for effective Poisson's ratios and effective Young's modulus of
   two -layered plates from cubic crystals is given. The derived formula
   for effective Young's modulus in the limit of initial isotropic
   materials coincides with formulas obtained previously in the literature.
   We show several examples of cubic crystals, auxetics-nonauxetics such
   that effective Poisson's ratios of two-layered plates may substantially
   exceed Poisson's ratios of the initial crystals. Effective Young's
   modulus may also exceed Young's moduli of both initial crystals. (C)

Title = {{Predicting stem borer density in maize using RapidEye data and

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{57}},

Abstract = {{Average maize yield in eastern Africa is 2.03 t ha(-1) as compared to
   gibbal average of 6.06 t ha(-1) due to biotic and abiotic constraints.
   Amongst the biotic production constraints in Africa, stem borers are the
   most injurious. In eastern Africa, maize yield losses due to stem borers
   are currently estimated between 12\% and 21\% of the total production.
   The objective of the present study was to explore the possibility of
   RapidEye spectral data to assess stem borer larva densities in maize
   fields in two study sites in Kenya. RapidEye images were acquired for
   the Bomet (western Kenya) test site on the 9th of December 2014 and on
   27th of January 2015, and for Machakos (eastern Kenya) a RapidEye image
   was acquired on the 3rd of January 2015. Five RapidEye spectral bands as
   well as 30 specttal vegetation indices (SVIs) were utilized to predict
   per field maize stem borer larva densities using generalized linear
   models (GLMs), assuming Poisson ('Po') and negative binomial ('NB')
   distributions. Root mean square error (RMSE) and ratio prediction to
   deviation (RPD) statistics were used to assess the Models performance
   using a leave one -out cross-validation approach. The Zero-inflated NB
   ('ZINB') models outperformed the `NB' models and stem borer larva
   densities could only be predicted during the mid growing season in
   December and early January in both study sites, respectively
   (RMSE=0.69-1.06 and RPD = 8.25-19.57). Overall, all models performed
   similar when all the 30 SVIs (non-nested) and only the significant
   (nested) SVIs were used. The models developed could improve decision
   making regarding controlling maize stem borers within integrated pest
   management (IPM) interventions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Sandwich panels with auxetic lattice cores confined between metallic
   facets are proposed for localised impact resistance applications. Their
   performance under localised impact is numerically studied, considering
   the rate-dependent effects. The behaviour of the composite structure
   material at high strain rates is modelled with the Johnson-Cook model.
   Parametric analyses are conducted to assess the performance of different
   designs of the hybrid composite structures. The results are compared
   with monolithic panels of equivalent areal mass and material in terms of
   deformations and plastic energy dissipation. Design parameters
   considered for the parametric analyses include the auxetic unit cell
   effective Poisson's ratio, thickness of the facet, material properties
   and radius of the unit cell's struts. Significant reduction in
   computational time is achieved by modelling a quarter of the panel, with
   shell elements for facets and beam elements for the auxetic core. With
   projectile impacts up to 200m/s, the auxetic composite panels are found
   to be able to absorb a similar amount of energy through plastic
   deformation, while the maximum back facet displacements are reduced up
   to 56\% due to localised densification and plastic deformation of the
   auxetic core.}},

Abstract = {{The microstructure of the manmade auxetic materials always involve
   inherited porosity and sharp corners, where the stress concentration
   occurred. We have proposed a novel kind of non-porous smooth curve sheet

   qualitative and quantitative agreements between the tensile experiments
   and numerical analysis of array model. Using the experimentally
   validated finite element model, the parametric study on the evolution of
   the macroscopic Poisson's ratio, the stress concentration factor on the
   geometry parameters and the parental material properties were
   investigated. This one phase auxetic smooth curve sheet, which is simple
   to manufacture and assemble into 3D structures, may be used in a variety

Abstract = {{The fluid-Poisson equations coupled with the Monte Carlo method were
   used to simulate the spatio-temporal behavior of a needle-like argon
   electron-beam plasma. Based on the Monte Carlo simulation, three coupled
   parameters characterizing the electron beam propagation for initial
   energies above several keV were expressed using a universal
   dimensionless shape function given in terms of the beam range multiplied
   by a normalized coefficient. Therefore, a single run of the Monte Carlo
   code was sufficient for the simulations over a wide range of conditions.
   The spatial potential as a function of space and time was studied from
   the fluid-Poisson equations. The results indicate that the time
   evolution of the spatial potential was influenced by the presence of the
   slowed-down electrons and the flying beam electrons, whereas the
   potential in quasi-equilibrium was mainly determined from the spatial
   distribution of the secondary electron. The potential in
   quasi-equilibrium was positive near the beam entrance and most negative
   along the tip of the beam range, which was a result of ambipolar
   diffusion. When the enclosing boundary surfaces were moved within the
   beam range, the potential was nearly positive everywhere. The
   calculation on the diffusion-drift flux indicated that the net current
   of the secondary electrons flowing back to the incident plane in
   quasi-equilibrium balanced the incident beam current, which was the
   so-called return current in the three-dimensional space. Published by
   AIP Publishing.}},

Abstract = {{We present a shape memory polymer (SMP) honeycomb with tuneable and
   shape morphing mechanical characteristics. Kirigami (Origami with

   hinges that create the shape change and the deployment actuation. To
   create a large volumetric deployment, the Kirigami open honeycomb
   configuration has been designed by setting an initial three-dimensional
   re-entrant auxetic (negative Poisson's ratio) configuration, while the
   final honeycomb shape assume a convex (positive Poisson's ratio) layout.
   A model was developed to predict the shape change of the structure, and

   Application to Insulin Secretagogues}},
Journal = {{EPIDEMIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{459-468}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Background: Drug-drug interactions with insulin secretagogues are
   associated with increased risk of serious hypoglycemia in patients with
   type 2 diabetes. We aimed to systematically screen for drugs that
   interact with the five most commonly used secretagogues-glipizide,
   glyburide, glimepiride, repaglinide, and nateglinide-to cause serious
   hypoglycemia.
   Methods: We screened 400 drugs frequently coprescribed with the
   secretagogues as candidate interacting precipitants. We first predicted
   the drug-drug interaction potential based on the pharmacokinetics of
   each secretagogue-precipitant pair. We then performed
   pharmacoepidemiologic screening for each secretagogue of interest, and
   for metformin as a negative control, using an administrative claims
   database and the self-controlled case series design. The overall rate
   ratios (RRs) and those for four predefined risk periods were estimated
   using Poisson regression. The RRs were adjusted for multiple estimation
   using semi-Bayes method, and then adjusted for metformin results to
   distinguish native effects of the precipitant from a drug-drug
   interaction.
   Results: We predicted 34 pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions with the
   secretagogues, nine moderate and 25 weak. There were 140 and 61
   secretagogue-precipitant pairs associated with increased rates of
   serious hypoglycemia before and after the metformin adjustment,
   respectively. The results from pharmacokinetic prediction correlated
   poorly with those from pharmacoepidemiologic screening.
   Conclusions: The self-controlled case series design has the potential to
   be widely applicable to screening for drug-drug interactions that lead
   to adverse outcomes identifiable in healthcare databases. Coupling
   pharmacokinetic prediction with pharmacoepidemiologic screening did not
   notably improve the ability to identify drug-drug interactions in this
   case.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we investigate the deformation mechanism of auxetic
   hierarchical rotating square systems through a dynamics approach. We
   show how their deformation behaviour, hence their mechanical properties
   and final configuration for a given applied load, can be manipulated
   solely by altering the resistance to rotational motion of the hinges
   within the system. This provides enhanced tunability without necessarily
   changing the geometry of the system, a phenomenon which is not typically
   observed in other non-hierarchical unimode auxetic systems. This gives
   this hierarchical system increased versatility and tunability thus
   making it more amenable to be employed in practical application which
   may range from smart filtration to smart dressings.}},

   from the Fukushima health management survey}},
Journal = {{BMC PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{17}},

Abstract = {{Background: Socioeconomic status (SES) and lifestyle-related factors are
   determinants of subjective health. However, changes in SES are
   inevitable in times of natural disaster, while lifestyle-related factors
   remain modifiable. The aim of this study was to use a cross-sectional
   approach to examine lifestyle-related factors that may attenuate the
   negative impact of disaster-induced changes in SES on poor subjective
   health.
   Methods: We analyzed 33,350 men and women aged 20-64 years who were
   living in evacuation zones due to the radiation accident in Fukushima,
   Japan. Disaster-induced changes in SES were defined by living
   arrangements and working conditions. Using Poisson regression analysis
   adjusted for confounders (model 1) and lifestyle-related factors as
   intermediate variables (model 2), we compared the prevalence ratios
   (PRs) of poor subjective health of participants who did not undergo
   disaster-induced changes in SES (did not become unemployed, income did
   not decrease, and living in relative's home/own home) with that of
   participants who did undergo disaster-induced changes in SES (became
   unemployed, decreased income, or lived in an evacuation shelter,
   temporary housing, or rental housing/apartment). We calculated the
   percentage of excess risks explained by lifestyle-related factors as
   follows: ((PRmodel (1) - PRmodel 2)/(PRmodel 1-1)) x 100.
   Results: Disaster-induced changes in SES were significantly associated
   with poor subjective health. The PRs (95\% CIs) among participants who
   underwent disaster-induced changes in SES were 2.02 (1.81-2.24) for men
   and 1.80 (1. 65-1.97) for women. After adjusting for lifestyle-related
   factors, we found that the PRs in men and women were remarkably
   attenuated, decreasing to 1.56 (1.40-1.73) and 1.43 (1.31-1.55),
   respectively. Controlling for lifestyle-related factors resulted in PR
   attenuation by 45.1\% (men) and 46.3\% (women). Satisfaction of sleep
   and participation in recreation and community activity particularly
   contributed to this attenuation.
   Conclusions: While disaster-induced changes in SES are unavoidable,
   lifestyle-related factors have the potential to attenuate the impact of
   these changes on poor subjective health.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a quantitative optimization of a modified re-entrant
   negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) structure whose overhanging struts were
   replaced with inclined ones to avoid the support structures which were
   generally required in the selective laser melting (SLM) process was
   carried out using finite element analysis (FEA) method. Poisson's ratios
   of models with inclined links of different strut inclination angles were
   calculated. The optimal simulated inclination angle of struts was 9
   degrees and the corresponding optimum re-entrant angle was 79 degrees
   while the thickness of the strut was 0.9 mm. The influence of fillet
   radii on Poisson's ratio and stress concentration was also discussed and
   the Poisson's ratio decreased and the stress concentration phenomenon
   remitted to some extent with increased fillet radii. In order to verify
   the improvement of the manufacturability of structures with inclined
   links, AlSi10Mg specimens were fabricated by SLM process using different
   scanning speeds and compression tests were also developed.
   Experimentally obtained results and simulation predicted ones were in
   good agreement. Therefore, the custom-tailor service could be
   accomplished in this way and the modified NPR structure with better
   surface quality could be obtained. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The elastic wave propagation is investigated in a beam lattice material
   characterized by a square periodic cell with anti-tetrachiral
   microstructure. With reference to the Floquet-Bloch spectrum, focus is
   made on the band structure enrichments and modifications which can be
   achieved by equipping the cellular microstructure with tunable local
   resonators. By virtue of its composite mechanical nature, the so-built
   inertial meta-material gains enhanced capacities of passive
   frequency-band filtering. Indeed the number, placement and properties of
   the inertial resonators can be designed to open, shift and enlarge the
   band gaps between one or more pairs of consecutive branches in the
   frequency spectrum. In order to improve the meta-material performance,
   several nonlinear optimization problems are formulated. The largest
   among the band gap amplitudes in the low-frequency range is selected as
   suited objective function. Proper inequality constraints are introduced
   to restrict the admissible solutions within a compact set of mechanical
   and geometric parameters, including only physically realistic properties
   of both the lattice and the resonators. The optimization problems
   related to full and partial band gaps are solved by using a globally
   convergent version of the numerical method of moving asymptotes,
   combined with a quasi Monte Carlo multi-start technique. The optimal
   solutions are numerically computed, discussed and compared from, the
   qualitative and quantitative viewpoints, bringing to light the limits
   and potential of the meta-material performance. The clearest trends
   emerging from the numerical analyses are pointed out and interpreted
   from the physical viewpoint. Finally, some specific recommendations
   about the microstructural design of the meta-material are synthesized.

Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},

Volume = {{120}},
Pages = {{317-327}},
Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{The auxetic foams composed of highly porous thermoplastic polyurethane
   (TPU) exhibit an attractive behaviour of withstanding a large volume
   reduction upon the cyclic compressive loading. A family of
   three-dimensional (3D) artificial metamaterials via Bucklicrystals
   consisting of an array of elastomeric spherical shells with periodical
   lattice patterns were proposed to mimic the buckling-induced auxetic
   behaviour as TPU foams. Layer-by-layer deposition of the desirable
   materials to manufacture parts known as additive manufacturing enables
   to create complex geometries and provides the broad freedom in design
   and manufacturing. In this work, selective laser sintering offered a
   unique capability to fabricate tailorable and flexible 3D soft
   metamaterials using TPU powders. An effective method was proposed to
   systematically evaluate the TPU powders and optimize the fabrication
   process, in order to overcome the challenges of sintering the
   duel-segment TPU. The laser-sintered Bucklicrystals were highly
   recoverable undergoing repeated compressions, and they retained the
   auxetic properties over a wide range of applied deformations. The
   fabrication of 3D soft metamaterials is not constrained by existing
   manufacturing principles and the laser-sintered Bucklicrystals of TPU
   are highly valuable to various engineering applications, such as
   mechanical and acoustic energy absorbers, actuators and
   vibration-resistant dampers. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The conventional hood with single material and stiffener structural form
   conceals some limitations on pedestrian protection and lightweight, not
   satisfying the requirements of structural strength, pedestrian
   protection and lightweight contradictory with each other at the same
   time. In this paper, a novel type hood is proposed to develop sandwich
   structure using architected cellular material with negative Poisson's
   ratio (NPR) configuration based on the decoupling thought of structural
   strength and energy absorption. Core-layer aluminum alloy material with
   NPR is used to meet the requirement of impact energy absorption, inner
   and outer skin using carbon fiber is selected to achieve high structural
   stiffness needed. This paper starts from the relations between geometric
   parameters of core-layer architected cellular material and mechanical
   properties, on this basis, the optimal geometric parameters can be
   expected using the multiobjective optimization method. Eventually, the
   optimal novel hood can be obtained using three layer thicknesses as
   optimization variables, minimum HIC value and minimum mass as
   objectives. It should be noted that global stiffness of the novel hood
   is not less than that of conventional hood, and entire thickness of the
   novel hood is not larger than conventional hood and impact intrusion of
   novel hood is less than safe distance between hood and engine. Based on
   limitations above, optimal layer thicknesses of architected cellular
   structure can be achieved. Then, the novel hood is compared with the
   conventional hood. The results show that the average HIC value of
   corresponding collision points in the novel hood decreases by 45\%. In
   addition, bending stiffness of the novel hood achieved increases by
   33\%, and torsional stiffness increases by 67\%. While the weight is
   reduced, 18.95\% exactly. Thus, the novel hood proposed in this paper
   demonstrates outstanding performance in terms of pedestrian protection,
   structural stiffness enhancement and weight reduction.}},

Abstract = {{To investigate the performance of gypsum rock softened by water in the
   tunneling, gypsum rocks from Lower Triassic Jialing River Group were
   immersed by fresh water within different times for softening tests. The
   variations of uniaxial compressive strength, shear strength, elastic
   modulus and Poisson's ratio of gypsum rocks with increasing immersion
   time were analyzed. The study indicated that, with the increase of the
   immersion time, the uniaxial compressive strength, shear strength and
   elastic modulus of gypsum rock exhibited a decline trend as a negative
   exponent, while Poisson's ratio presented a linear increase trend under
   certain conditions. On the basis of damage mechanics, a softening damage
   evolution equation was deduced by considering time effect of gypsum
   rock. The relationship between the brittleness coefficient and
   softening-damage variable was revealed, and the softening-depth model at
   different immersion time was established. This study can be used to
   identify the softening area of surrounding rock caused by groundwater in
   the tunneling through gypsum layer.}},

Abstract = {{Acoustic properties of an auxetic foam were measured to validate a
   previously proposed lower bound for Poisson's ratio, nu >= 1/5, inferred
   from classical two-parameter elasticity theory. This limit differs from
   the commonly reported lower limit of -1 for isotropic materials in the
   linear elastic range. For a foam measured to have a value of nu > 0.2,
   agreement was found between the measured flexural resonance frequency of
   a disk sample and the theoretical value. On the other hand, for an
   auxetic sample (nu < 0), the prediction from the two-parameter theory
   was significantly in error. Thus, for materials having nu < 1/5 (auxetic
   foams, as well as very hard solids such as diamond, germanium, and fused
   quartz), the equations of classical elasticity are invalid.}},

Abstract = {{We study ``chromatin gels{''}, model systems for chromatin, to

   near a miscibility threshold due to the cooperative assembly and
   disassembly of nucleosomes. The Poisson's ratio becomes more negative
   with an increasing number of RNAP because the disassembly rate of
   nucleosomes increases. In contrast, the chromatin gel shows a positive
   Poisson's ratio far from the miscibility threshold because the assembly
   of nucleosomes is arrested by the expiration of freely diffusing histone

Abstract = {{The boll weevil, Anthonomus grandis grandis Boheman (Coleoptera:
   Curculionidae), is one of the most important pests of cotton production
   worldwide. The objective of this work was to develop a sequential
   sampling plan for the boll weevil. The studies were conducted in
   Maracaju, MS, Brazil, in two seasons with cotton cultivar FM 993.A
   10,000-m(2) area of cotton was subdivided into 100 of 10- by 10-m plots,
   and five plants per plot were evaluated weekly, recording the number of
   squares with feeding + oviposition punctures of A. grandis in each
   plant. A sequential sampling plan by the maximum likelihood ratio test
   was developed, using a 10\% threshold level of squares attacked. A 5\%
   security level was adopted for the elaboration of the sequential
   sampling plan. The type I and type II error used was 0.05, recommended
   for studies with insects. The adjustment of the frequency distributions
   used were divided into two phases, so that the model that best fit to
   the data was the negative binomial distribution up to 85 DAE (Phase I),
   and from there the best fit was Poisson distribution (Phase II). The
   equations that define the decision-making for Phase I are S-0 = -5.1743
   + 0.5730N and S-1 - 5.1743 + 0.5730N, and for the Phase II are S-0 =
   -4.2479 + 0.5771N and S-1 = 4.2479 + 0.5771N. The sequential sampling
   plan developed indicated the maximum number of sample units expected for
   decision-making is similar to 39 and 31 samples for Phases I and II,
   respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional carbon diamond-like phases consisting of sp

   molecules, are studied by methods of molecular dynamics modeling. For
   eight cubic and one hexagonal diamond-like phases on the basis of four
   types of fullerene-like molecules, equilibrium configurations are found
   and the elastic constants are calculated. The results obtained by the
   method of molecular dynamics are used for analytical calculations of the
   elastic characteristics of the diamond- like phases with the cubic and
   hexagonal anisotropy. It is found that, for a certain choice of the
   dilatation axis, three of these phases have negative Poisson's ratio,
   i.e., are partial auxetics. The variability of the engineering
   elasticity coefficients (Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, shear
   modulus, and bulk modulus) is analyzed.}},

Abstract = {{The elastic properties of a zeolitic metal-azolate framework, Zn(mtz) 2
   (MAF-7, mtz = 3-methyl- 1,2,4-triazolate), have been examined from the
   view point of the first principles calculations and experiments. Our
   results demonstrate that the three independent elastic constants of
   MAF-7 are about 5.0-73.3\% higher than those of ZIF-8, though they are
   isomorphic. The electron-donating effect of the nitrogen atom at the
   2-position in mtz-ring dominantly accounts for such a prominent
   difference. The detailed analysis of the full elastic tensors reveals
   that the volume moduli, shear moduli, and Poisson's ratios of MAF-7 are
   about 3.4\% to 20.1\%, 3.2\% to 20.6\%, and 30.3\% to 12.3\% higher than
   those of ZIF-8. The underlying structural reasons were discussed to
   explain the anisotropic difference of those properties. Moreover, the
   conclusion deduced from first-principle calculations was also been
   verified by nanoindentation and high-pressure synchrotron X-ray
   diffraction measurements.}},

Abstract = {{Some researchers have hypothesised that meteorological factors may have
   an impact on acute cerebrovascular diseases. The aim of this study was
   to determine an impact of some meteorological factors on occurrence of
   acute cerebrovascular events in the middle-aged Kaunas population.
   Kaunas stroke register data were used. Data on meteorological factors
   for the time period from 2000 to 2010 were obtained from the Lithuanian
   Hydrometeorological Service Kaunas Meteorological Station. We analysed
   4038 cases with stroke. Ischemic strokes composed 80.4\% and
   haemorrhagic strokes-19.6\%. According to Poisson regression analysis,
   significant negative correlation between ischemic, haemorrhagic and all
   types of stroke and ambient air temperature was found (beta coefficient
   -0.007, -0.016, -0.009, p < 0.001, respectively). Results of ARIMA
   showed that ambient temperature of the day of stroke onset was
   associated with the occurrence of ischemic, haemorrhagic and all types
   of stroke: when temperature was lower, the risk of stroke was higher
   (-0.006, -0.003, -0.009, p < 0.001, respectively). Low temperature on
   the event day and 1 and 2 days before the event was associated with
   higher incidence of haemorrhagic stroke in women. Low ambient
   temperature on the event day increased incidence of haemorrhagic stroke
   in subjects 55-64 years. High wind speed on the event day was associated
   with higher incidence of ischemic stroke in older subjects.
   Meteorological factors may have some impact on the risk of acute
   cerebrovascular events. Health care providers should focus on preventive
   measures, which can reduce these risks.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Background Social features of neighbourhood environments may influence
   smoking by creating a stressful environment or by buffering stress
   through social cohesion. However, the association of the overall
   neighbourhood social environment (NSE) with smoking, and the association
   of specific neighbourhood social factors with change in smoking
   behaviour over time, has rarely been examined.
   Methods This study included 5856 adults aged 45-84 years from the
   Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (2000-2012, average follow-up: 7.8
   years). Outcomes included current smoking status and smoking intensity
   (average number of cigarettes smoked per day among baseline smokers).
   NSE was assessed as a composite score composed of aesthetic quality,
   safety and social cohesion scales (derived from neighbourhood surveys).
   Generalised linear mixed models evaluated the association of baseline
   NSE (composite score and individual scales) with current smoking
   (modified Poisson models) and smoking intensity (negative binomial
   models) cross-sectionally and longitudinally.
   Results Each SD increase in baseline NSE composite score was associated
   with 13\% lower prevalence of smoking at baseline (adjusted prevalence
   ratio (aPR) 0.87 (95\% CI 0.78 to 0.98). Neighbourhood safety and
   aesthetic quality were similarly associated with lower smoking
   prevalence (aPR 0.87 (0.78 to 0.97) and aPR 0.87 (0.77 to 0.99),
   respectively) but the association with social cohesion was weaker or
   null. No significant associations were observed for smoking intensity
   among baseline smokers. Baseline NSE was not associated with changes in
   smoking risk or intensity over time.
   Conclusions Results suggest that neighbourhood social context influences
   whether older adults smoke, but does not promote smoking cessation or
   reduction over time.}},

Title = {{Gender-Specific Determinants and Patterns of Online Health Information
   Seeking: Results From a Representative German Health Survey}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Background: Online health information-seeking behavior (OHISB) is
   currently a widespread and common behavior that has been described as an
   important prerequisite of empowerment and health literacy. Although
   demographic factors such as socioeconomic status (SES), age, and gender
   have been identified as important determinants of OHISB, research is
   limited regarding the gender-specific motivational determinants of OHISB
   and differences between women and men in the use of online resources for
   health information purposes.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to identify gender-specific
   determinants and patterns of OHISB by analyzing data from a
   representative German sample of adults (N=1728) with special attention
   to access and frequency of use as well as topics and sources of OHISB.
   Methods: We employed a 2-step analysis, that is, after exploring
   differences between users and nonusers of online health information
   using logistic regression models, we highlighted gender-specific
   determinants of the frequency of OHISB by applying zero-truncated
   negative binomial models.
   Results: Age (odds ratio, OR for females=0.97, 95\% CI 0.96-0.99) and
   degree of satisfaction with one's general practitioner (GP) (OR for
   males=0.73, 95\% CI 0.57-0.92) were gender-specific determinants of
   access to OHISB. Regarding the frequency of OHISB, daily Internet use
   (incidence rate ratio, IRR=1.67, 95\% CI 1.19-2.33) and a strong
   interest in health topics (IRR=1.45, 95\% CI 1.19-1.77) were revealed to
   be more important predictors than SES (IRR for high SES=1.25, 95\% CI
   0.91-1.73).
   Conclusions: Users indicate that the Internet seems to be capable of
   providing a valuable source of informational support and patient
   empowerment. Increasing the potential value of the Internet as a source
   for health literacy and patient empowerment requires need-oriented and
   gender-specific health communication efforts, media, and information
   strategies.}},

Title = {{On material design by the optimal choice of Young's modulus distribution}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOLIDS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{110}},
Pages = {{315-331}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{This paper concerns the problem of optimal distribution of Young's
   modulus within an elastic and isotropic body with prescribed, not
   necessarily uniform, distribution of Poisson's ratio. The merit function
   is the total compliance corresponding to a given single load case. The
   unit cost of the design is assumed as the trace of Hooke's tensor, which
   is proportional to Young's modulus here. The problem thus formulated is
   a constrained version of the isotropic material design problem, in which
   both bulk and shear elastic moduli of isotropy are design variables. In
   contrast to the latter approach, the optimal material is either
   nonsingular or degenerates to a void. The optimal distribution of
   Young's modulus is determined by a solution to an auxiliary minimization
   problem with the integrand of linear growth. The problem dual to the
   latter assumes the form similar to that known from the theory of Michell
   trusses. The proposed numerical approach focuses on solving the former
   auxiliary problem. The case studies comprise selected optimal designs
   corresponding to the isotropic material optimization and Young's modulus
   optimization developed in this paper. The exemplary optimal solutions
   show that admitting negative values of Poisson's ratio may contribute to
   a decrease of the total compliance, thus leading to better designs. (C)

   Finite-Element Method}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{143}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, a recently developed type of lower-order mixed finite
   elements is extended to model porous materials based on the
   microdilatation theory. These mixed finite elements are based on
   assuming independent linear generalized strain fields and collocating
   them with the generalized strains derived from primal variables
   (mechanical displacements and change in matrix volume fraction) at some
   cleverly chosen points within each element. This mixed formulation is
   very effective in alleviating the shear locking problem that regular
   lower-order finite elements suffer from. Hence the accuracy of the
   predicted mechanical fields (such as displacements and stresses), as
   well as the fields coupled with them (such as change in matrix volume
   fraction, which is also called microdilatation), is improved over
   regular finite-element formulation. The mixed-collocation formulation is
   also superior over other types of previously published hybrid-mixed
   finite-element formulations in that it avoids the
   Ladyzenskaja-Babuska-Brezzi (LBB) stability conditions completely
   because it does not include any Lagrange multipliers. The paper also
   presents some numerical examples that help in providing more insight on
   the effect of porosity-related parameters used in microdilatation theory
   on the behavior of porous materials. Finally, the paper defines two
   limits on the coupling number; the first considers the positive
   definiteness of the stored energy density, whereas the second sets the
   limit between auxetic (having negative Poisson's ratio) and nonauxetic
   material behavior. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

   the applicability to on-line subcriticality monitoring. The results show
   that the area-ratio method robustly and accurately monitors
   subcriticality in shallow subcritical states with negative reactivity of
   up to a few dollars; however, this method faces problems with temporal
   fluctuations, spatial dispersion, and sensitivity to the proton-beam
   current with increasing depth of subcriticality. On the other hand, it
   is shown that the -fitting method alleviates such problems in deep
   subcritical states. Moreover, a proposed fitting technique using the
   maximum-likelihood estimation method based on the Poisson distribution
   is robust enough to be applicable to on-line subcriticality monitoring
   for negative reactivity levels of up to roughly nine dollars.}},

Abstract = {{Certain behaviors of some material are characterized by the periodic bar

   theoretic connected model that describes the stability, rigidity
   property of these rhombic tiling materials in two dimensions. Cables,
   struts or rods are placed as bracing elements between opposite pairs of
   diagonal joints, to prevent the rhombic tiling from the rotation of the
   bars around their common joint. We characterize the rigidity of the
   finite parts of the rhombic bracing structure in the plane. The results
   of this paper are based on the theorem of the rigidity of
   one-dimensional tensegrity framework from Recski and Shai. We have
   applied our results to describe some auxetic type structures that were
   mentioned earlier in the scientific literature. We also introduce the
   model as a possible candidate for the mechanical information processing
   system in a repetitive bar and joint structure.}},

Abstract = {{Background. We determined temporal trends (1985-2011) in hepatitis C
   virus (HCV) incidence and associated behavioral exposures for people who
   inject drugs (PWID) from the United States (Boston, Baltimore, and San
   Francisco), Canada (Montreal), the Netherlands (Amsterdam), and
   Australia (Sydney and Melbourne).
   Methods. Using population-based cohort data from HCV-negative PWID, we
   calculated overall and within-city HCV incidence trends, HCV rates by
   study enrollment period (1985-2011), and temporal trends in exposure
   behaviors. Poisson regression models estimated trends in HCV incidence
   over calendar- time. Survival models identified risk factors for HCV
   incidence across cities and estimated independent effects of city and
   calendar period on HCV infection risk.
   Results. Among 1391 initially HCV-negative participants followed
   prospectively (1644.5 person-years of observation {[}PYO]), 371 HCV
   incident infections resulted in an overall incidence of 22.6 per 100 PYO
   (95\% confidence interval {[}CI], 20.4-25.0). Incidence was highest and
   remained elevated in Baltimore (32.6/100 PYO), San Francisco (24.7/100
   PYO), and Montreal (23.5/100 PYO), lowest in Melbourne and Amsterdam
   (7.5/100 PYO and 13.1/100 PYO, respectively), and moderate (21.4/100
   PYO) in Sydney. Higher rates of syringe and equipment sharing and lower
   prevalence of opioid agonist therapy were associated with HCV incidence
   in cities with the highest incidence. Risk for infection dropped by 18\%
   for every 3-year increase in calendar-time (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.8
   {[}95\% CI,.8-. 9]) in the multivariable model.
   Conclusions. Differences in prevention strategies and injecting contexts
   may explain the ongoing high HCV incidence in these North American
   cities and emphasize the need for scale-up of opioid agonist therapy and
   increased coverage of needle and syringe programs in North America.}},

Abstract = {{Westudied the mechanical response of a recently developed new class of
   mechanical metamaterials based on the paper art of cutting, kirigami.
   Specially, the geometrical and structural design of representative cut
   units, via combined line cut, cut-out, and hierarchy of the structure,
   was explored for achieving both extreme stretchability and/or
   compressibility in kirigami metamaterials through experiments, alongside
   geometrical modeling and finite element simulations. The kirigami design
   was tested on constituent materials including non-stretchable copy
   papers and highly stretchable silicone rubber to explore the role of
   constituent material properties. The cut unit in the shape of solid
   rectangles with the square shape as a special case was demonstrated for
   achieving the extreme stretchability via rigid rotation of cut units. We
   found that compared to the square cut units, the theoretically predicted
   maximum stretchability via unit rotation in rectangle units (aspect
   ratio 2:1) increased dramatically from about 41\% to 124\% for the level
   1 cut structure without hierarchy, and from about 62\% to 156\% for the
   level 2 hierarchical cut structure, which was validated by both
   experiments and simulations. To demonstrate the achievement of both
   extreme stretchability and compressibility, we replaced the solid square
   cut units with porous squares and re-entrant lattice shapes in silicone
   rubber based metamaterials. We found that a porous structure can enable
   an extreme compressibility of as high as 81\%. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

   evidence from urban heat islands}},
Journal = {{GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Biological effects of climate change are expected to vary
   geographically, with a strong signature of latitude. For ectothermic
   animals, there is systematic latitudinal variation in the relationship
   between climate and thermal performance curves, which describe the
   relationship between temperature and an organism's fitness. Here, we ask
   whether these documented latitudinal patterns can be generalized to
   predict arthropod responses to warming across mid-and high temperate
   latitudes, for taxa whose thermal physiology has not been measured. To
   address this question, we used a novel natural experiment consisting of
   a series of urban warming gradients at different latitudes.
   Specifically, we sampled arthropods from a single common street tree
   species across temperature gradients in four US cities, located from
   35.8 to 42.4 degrees latitude. We captured 6746 arthropods in 34
   families from 111 sites that varied in summer average temperature by
   1.7- 3.4 degrees C within each city. Arthropod responses to warming
   within each city were characterized as Poisson regression coefficients
   describing change in abundance per degrees C for each family. Family
   responses in the two midlatitude cities were heterogeneous, including
   significantly negative and positive effects, while those in
   high-latitude cities varied no more than expected by chance within each
   city. We expected high-latitude taxa to increase in abundance with
   warming, and they did so in one of the two high-latitude cities; in the
   other, Queens (New York City), most taxa declined with warming, perhaps
   due to habitat loss that was correlated with warming in this city. With
   the exception of Queens, patterns of family responses to warming were
   consistent with predictions based on known latitudinal patterns in
   arthropod physiology relative to regional climate. Heterogeneous
   responses in midlatitudes may be ecologically disruptive if interacting
   taxa respond oppositely to warming.}},

Abstract = {{Background Cancer screening has contributed to downward trends in cancer
   mortality, but is also associated with adverse effects, which highlights
   the importance of promoting the participation based on informed
   decisions.
   Objectives We aimed to describe the use of cancer screening (either in
   organized programmes or as opportunistic screening), awareness of
   organized programmes and perception of its potential benefits and
   adverse effects, depicting possible sex differences.
   Design and methods We evaluated 1624 Portuguese-speaking dwellers, aged
   between 16 and 79 years, through face-to-face interviews. To quantify
   sex differences, adjusted prevalence ratios and respective 95\%
   confidence intervals were computed using Poisson regression.
   Results Among eligible age groups, the lifetime prevalence of screening
   for breast and cervical cancers was 89.8 and 71.9\%, respectively. The
   prevalence was 23.7\% for colorectal cancer and no significant sex
   differences were observed. Prostate cancer screening was reported by
   63.8\% of men. Over half of the participants referred that cancers such
   as prostate, skin, lung and stomach should be screened for, in addition
   to those for which organized programmes are recommended. Reassurance by
   negative results was identified as the main potential benefit of
   screening by nearly one-third of men and women. Anxiety while waiting
   for results was the most mentioned potential adverse effect (60.4\%);
   men refer less often this and financial costs, although statistical
   significance of these results was borderline.
   Conclusions This study provides a benchmark to plan and monitor the
   effects of awareness-raising interventions, as well as for international
   comparisons across countries with different cancer prevention and
   control structures.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Improved life expectancy in high HIV prevalence populations
   has been observed since antiretroviral therapy (ART) scale-up. However,
   it is unclear if the benefits are sustained, and the mortality among
   HIV-positive individuals not (yet) on ART is not well described. We
   assessed temporal change in mortality over 9 years in rural Malawi.
   Methods: Within a demographic surveillance site in northern rural
   Malawi, we combined demographic, HIV and ART uptake data. We calculated
   life expectancy using Kaplan-Meier estimates, and compared mortality
   rates and rate ratios using Poisson regression, by period of ART
   availability (July 2005-June 2008, July 2008-June 2011 and July
   2011-June 2014).
   Results: Among 32 664 individuals there were 1424 deaths; 1930
   individuals were known HIV-positive, of whom 1382 started ART. Overall,
   life expectancy at age 15 years increased by 10 years within 5 years of
   ART introduction, and plateaued. Age-standardized adult mortality rates
   declined from 11.3/1000 to 7.5/1000 person-years between the first and
   last time period. In July 2011-June 2014 compared with July 2005-June
   2008, mortality declined in HIV-positive individuals on ART (rate ratio
   adjusted (aRR) for age, sex, location and education, 0.3; 95\%
   confidence interval (CI) 0.2-0.5) and in those not (yet) on ART (aRR
   0.3; 95\% CI 0.1-0.5) but not in HIV-negative individuals (aRR 1.1; 95\%
   CI 0.7-1.9).
   Conclusions: Total population adult life expectancy increased toward
   that of HIV-negative individuals by 2011 and remained raised. The
   reduction in all-cause and HIV-related mortality in HIV-positive
   individuals not (yet) on ART suggests ART uptake is occurring at an
   earlier disease stage, particularly in women.}},

Abstract = {{It is shown that some of the orthotropic models reported in the
   literature for the mechanical response of elastic arteries and which
   assume a separable dependence on the I4, I4, I6 invariants predict
   curious and unexpected behaviour in simple tension. Specifically it is
   shown that the out-of-plane stress response can be stiffer than the
   in-plane over a moderate range of strain and that when the in-plane
   response is much stiffer than the out-of plane, as might be expected for
   a fibre-reinforced material, it is accompanied by a large auxetic
   response in the out-of-plane direction. This mechanical response for
   this class of orthotropic materials seems counterintuitive and it is
   hypothesised that it could be due to their well-known inability to fully
   recover the linear theory, on restriction to infinitesimal deformations.
   A generalisation of these models that is fully compatible with the
   linear theory is proposed. An alternative strategy of assuming that the
   fibres cannot support compression is shown not to be a universal remedy.}},

Title = {{Serial QuantiFERON testing and tuberculosis disease risk among young

Abstract = {{Background The value of quantitative interferon-gamma release assay
   results for predicting progression from Mycobacterium tuberculosis
   infection to active disease is unknown. We aimed to investigate the
   relation between QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT) conversion
   interferon-gamma values and risk of subsequent active tuberculosis
   disease and of QFT reversion.
   Methods We analysed data from a reported vaccine efficacy trial of the
   tuberculosis vaccine MVA85A in South Africa. QFT negative, HIV
   uninfected young children aged 18-24 weeks were enrolled. We stratified
   participants by quantitative QFT result (interferon-gamma < 0.35 IU/mL,
   0.35-4.00 IU/mL, and > 4.00 IU/mL) at the intermediate study visit (day
   336) and determined risk of progression to active tuberculosis disease
   over the subsequent 6-24 months. No QFT differences were observed
   between placebo and MVA85A groups at day 336 or end of study; therefore,
   both groups were included in analyses. Study clinicians were not masked
   to QFT values, but strict case definitions were used that excluded QFT
   results. We used generalised additive models to evaluate the
   quantitative relation between day 336 QFT value and subsequent disease
   risk, and we compared disease rates between QFT strata using a
   two-sample Poisson test.
   Findings Among 2512 young children with QFT tests done at day 336, 172
   (7\%) were positive; 87 (7\%) of 1267 in placebo group and 85 (7\%) of
   1245 in the MVA85A group (p=1.00). Compared with QFT non-converters
   (tuberculosis disease incidence 0.7 per 100 person-years {[}95\% CI
   0.4-1.1]), children with QFT conversion at interferon-gamma values
   between 0.35-4.00 IU/mL did not have significantly increased risk of
   disease (2.5 per 100 person-years {[}95\% CI 0.4-9.4]; incidence rate
   ratio (IRR) 3.7 (95\% CI 0.4-15.8; p=0.23). However, QFT conversion at
   interferon-gamma values higher than 4.00 IU/mL was associated with
   substantially increased disease incidence (28.0 per 100 person-years
   {[}95\% CI 14.9-45.7]) compared with non-converters (IRR 42.5 {[}95\% CI
   17.2- 99.7]; p < 0.0001), and compared with children with
   interferon-gamma values between 0.35-4.00 IU/mL (IRR 11.4 {[}95\% CI
   2.4-107.2]; p=0.00047). Among 91 QFT converters who were given a repeat
   test, 53 (58\%) reverted from positive to negative. QFT reversion risk
   was inversely associated with interferon-gamma value at QFT conversion
   and was highest with interferon-gamma values less than 4.00 IU/mL (47
   {[}77\%] of 61).
   Interpretation In young children, tuberculosis disease risk was not
   significantly increased, and QFT reversion was common, following QFT
   conversion at interferon-gamma values up to 10 times the recommended
   test threshold (0.35 IU/mL). By contrast, QFT conversion at very high
   interferon-gamma values (> 4.00 IU/mL) warrants intensified diagnostic
   and preventive intervention because of the extremely high risk of
   tuberculosis disease in these young children.

Abstract = {{The computation of the dispersion relations for dissipative periodic
   lattices having the attributes of metamaterials is an actual research
   topic raising the interest of researchers in the field of acoustics and
   wave propagation phenomena. We analyze in this contribution the impact
   of wave damping on the dispersion features of periodic lattices, which
   are modeled as beam-lattices. The band diagram structure and damping
   ratio are computed for different repetitive lattices, based on the
   homogenized continuum response of the initially discrete lattice
   architecture, modeled as Kelvin-Voigt viscoelastic beams. Three of these
   lattices (reentrant hexagonal, chiral diamond, hexachiral lattice) are
   auxetic meta materials, since they show negative Poisson's ratio. The
   effective viscoelastic anisotropic continuum behavior of the lattices is
   first computed in terms of the homogenized stiffness and viscosity
   matrices, based on the discrete homogenization technique. The dynamical
   equations of motion are obtained for an equivalent homogenized
   micropolar continuum evaluated based on the homogenized properties, and
   the dispersion relation and damping ratio are obtained by inserting an
   harmonic plane waves Ansatz into these equations. The comparison of the
   acoustic properties obtained in the low frequency range for the four
   considered lattices shows that auxetic lattices attenuate waves at lower
   frequencies compared to the classical hexagonal lattice. The diamond
   chiral lattice shows the best attenuation properties of harmonic waves
   over the entire Brillouin zone, and the hexachiral lattice presents
   better acoustic properties than the reentrant hexagonal lattice. The
   range of validity of the effective continuum obtained by the discrete
   homogenization has been assessed by comparing the frequency band
   structure of this continuum with that obtained by a Floquet-Bloch
   analysis. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study
   the effect of rippling on the Poisson's ratio of graphene. Due to the
   atomic scale thickness of graphene, out-of-plane ripples are generated
   in free standing graphene with topological defects (e.g. heptagons and
   pentagons) to release the in-plane deformation energy. Through MD
   simulations, we have found that the Poisson's ratio of rippled graphene
   decreases upon increasing its aspect ratio eta (amplitude over
   wavelength). For the rippled graphene sheet eta = 0.188, a negative
   Poisson's ratio of -0.38 is observed for a tensile strain up to 8\%,
   while the Poisson's ratio for eta = 0.066 is almost zero. During
   uniaxial tension, the ripples gradually become flat, thus the Poisson's
   ratio of rippled graphene is determined by the competing factors of the
   intrinsic positive Poisson's ratio of graphene and the negative
   Poisson's ratio due to the de-wrinkling effect. Besides, the rippled
   graphene exhibits excellent fracture strength and toughness. With the
   combination of its auxetic and excellent mechanical properties, rippled
   graphene may possess potential for application in nano-devices and
   nanomaterials.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Antiretroviral therapy (ART) may interfere with replication
   of hepatitis B virus (HBV), raising the hypothesis that HBV infection
   might be prevented by ART. We investigated the incidence and risk
   factors associated with HBV among HIV-infected adults in Rakai, Uganda.
   Methods: We screened stored sera from 944 HIV-infected adults enrolled
   in the Rakai Community Cohort Study between September 2003 and March
   2015 for evidence of HBV exposure. Serum from participants who tested
   anti-hepatitis B core-negative (497) at baseline were tested over 3-7
   consecutive survey rounds for incident HBV. Poisson incidence methods
   were used to estimate incidence of HBV with 95\% confidence intervals
   (CIs), whereas Cox proportional regression methods were used to estimate
   hazard ratios (HRs).
   Results: Thirty-nine HBV infections occurred over 3342 person-years,
   incidence 1.17/ 100 person-years. HBVincidence was significantly lower
   with ARTuse: 0.49/100 personyears with ART and 2.3/100 person-years
   without ART {[}adjusted HR (aHR) 0.25, 95\% CI 0.1-0.5, P<0.001], and
   with lamivudine (3TC) use: 0.58/100 person-years) with 3TC and 2.25/100
   person-years without 3TC (aHR 0.32, 95\% CI 0.1-0.7, P = < 0.007). No
   new HBV infections occurred among those on tenofovir-based ART. HBV
   incidence also decreased with HIV RNA suppression: 0.6/100 person-years
   with 400 copies/ml or less and 4.0/100 person-years with more than 400
   copies/ml (aHR, 6.4, 95\% CI 2.2-19.0, P< 0.001); and with age: 15-29
   years versus 40-50 years (aHR 3.2, 95\% CI 1.2-9.0); 30-39 years versus
   40-50 years (aHR 2.1, 95\% CI 0.9-5.3).
   Conclusion: HBV continues to be acquired in adulthood among HIV-positive
   Ugandans and HBV incidence is dramatically reduced with HBV-active ART.
   In addition to widespread vaccination, initiation of ART may prevent HBV
   acquisition among HIV-positive adults in sub-Saharan Africa. Copyright

Title = {{The incidence of diabetes mellitus and diabetic retinopathy in a

   Kenya}},
Journal = {{BMC ENDOCRINE DISORDERS}},
Year = {{2017}},

Abstract = {{Background: The epidemic rise of diabetes carries major negative public
   health and economic consequences particularly for low and middle-income
   countries. The highest predicted percentage growth in diabetes is in the
   sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) region where to date there has been no data on
   the incidence of diabetic retinopathy from population-based cohort
   studies and minimal data on incident diabetes. The primary aims of this
   study were to estimate the cumulative six-year incidence of Diabetes
   Mellitus (DM) and DR (Diabetic Retinopathy), respectively, among people
   aged >= 50 years in Kenya.
   Methods: Random cluster sampling with probability proportionate to size
   were used to select a representative cross-sectional sample of adults
   aged >= 50 years in 2007-8 in Nakuru District, Kenya. A six-year follow-
   up was undertaken in 2013-14. On both occasions a comprehensive
   ophthalmic examination was performed including LogMAR visual acuity,
   digital retinal photography and independent grading of images. Data were
   collected on general health and risk factors. The primary outcomes were
   the incidence of diabetes mellitus and the incidence of diabetic
   retinopathy, which were calculated by dividing the number of events
   identified at 6-year follow- up by the number of people at risk at the
   beginning of follow-up. Age-adjusted risk ratios of the outcomes (DM and
   DR respectively) were estimated for each covariate using a Poisson
   regression model with robust error variance to allow for the clustered
   design and including inverse-probability weighting.
   Results: At baseline, 4414 participants aged >= 50 years underwent
   complete examination. Of the 4104 non-diabetic participants, 2059 were
   followed-up at six-years (50 . 2\%). The cumulative incidence of DM was
   estimated at 61 . 0 per 1000 (95\% CI: 50 . 3-73 . 7) in people aged >=
   50 years. The cumulative incidence of DR in the sample population was
   estimated at 15 . 8 per 1000 (95\% CI: 9 . 5-26 . 3) among those without
   DM at baseline, and 224 . 7 per 1000 (116.9-388.2) among participants
   with known DM at baseline. A multivariable risk factor analysis
   demonstrated increasing age and higher body mass index to be associated
   with incident DM. DR incidence was strongly associated with increasing
   age, and with higher BMI, urban dwelling and higher socioeconomic
   status. Conclusions: Diabetes Mellitus is a growing public health
   concern with a major complication of diabetic retinopathy. In a
   population of 1 . 6 million, of whom 150,000 are >= 50 years, we
   estimated that 1650 people aged >= 50 develop DM per year, and 450
   develop DR. Strengthening of health systems is necessary to reduce
   incident diabetes and its complications in this and similar settings.}},

Abstract = {{We perform molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the Poisson's
   ratio of graphene oxide. We find that the Poisson's ratio can be
   effectively tuned by increasing the degree of oxidation of graphene
   oxide. More specifically, the Poisson's ratio decreases linearly from
   positive to negative with increasing oxidation, turning negative at room
   temperature for a degree of oxidation of 0.27, and reaching a value of
   -0.567 for fully oxidized graphene. The oxidation dependence of the
   Poisson's ratio is attributed to the tension-induced suppression of the
   ripples resulting from the oxidation, whose amplitude increases with
   increasing oxidation. Finally, we also demonstrate the temperature
   dependence of the Poisson's ratio in the graphene oxide.}},

Abstract = {{Transition metal carbides include a wide variety of materials with
   attractive properties that are suitable for numerous and diverse
   applications. A most recent experimental advance could provide a path
   toward the successful synthesis of large-area and high-quality ultrathin
   Mo2C membranes with superconducting properties. In the present study, we
   used first-principles density functional theory calculations to explore
   the mechanical and optical response of singlelayer and free-standing
   Mo2C. Uniaxial tensile simulations along the armchair and zigzag
   directions were conducted and we found that while the elastic properties
   are close along various loading directions, the nonlinear regimes in
   stress-strain curves are considerably different. We found that Mo2C
   sheets present negative Poisson's ratio and thus can be categorized as
   an auxetic material. Our simulations also reveal that Mo2C films retain
   their metallic electronic characteristic upon uniaxial loading. We found
   that for Mo2C nanomembranes the dielectric function becomes anisotropic
   along in-plane and out-of-plane directions. Our findings can be useful
   for the practical application of Mo2C sheets in nanodevices.}},

Title = {{Generalised count distributions for modelling parity}},
Journal = {{DEMOGRAPHIC RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{36}},
Pages = {{745-758}},
Month = {{MAR 14}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND
   Parametric count distributions customarily used in demography - the
   Poisson and negative binomial models - do not offer satisfactory
   descriptions of empirical distributions of completed cohort parity. One
   reason is that they cannot model variance-to-mean ratios below unity,
   i.e., underdispersion, which is typical of low-fertility parity
   distributions. Statisticians have recently revived two generalised count
   distributions that can model both over-and underdispersion, but they
   have not attracted demographers' attention to date.
   OBJECTIVE
   The objective of this paper is to assess the utility of these
   alternative general count distributions, namely the
   Conway-Maxwell-Poisson and gamma count models, for the modeling of
   distributions of completed parity.
   METHODS
   Simulations and maximum-likelihood estimation are used to assess their
   fit to empirical data from the Human Fertility Database (HFD).
   RESULTS
   The results show that the generalised count distributions offer a
   dramatically improved fit compared to customary Poisson and negative
   binomial models in the presence of underdispersion, without performance
   loss in the case of equidispersion or overdispersion.
   CONCLUSIONS
   This gain in accuracy suggests generalised count distributions should be
   used as a matter of course in studies of fertility that examine
   completed parity as an outcome.
   CONTRIBUTION
   This note performs a transfer of the state of the art in count data
   modelling and regression in the more technical statistical literature to
   the field of demography, allowing demographers to benefit from more
   accurate estimation in fertility research.}},

Abstract = {{Cell nuclei experience and respond to a wide range of forces, both in
   vivo and in vitro. In order to characterize the nuclear response to
   physical stress, we developed a microfluidic chip and used it to apply
   mechanical stress to live cells and measure their nuclear deformability.
   The device design is optimized for the detection of both nucleus and
   cytoplasm, which can then be conveniently quantified using a
   custom-written Matlab program. We measured nuclear sizes and strains of
   embryonic stem cells, for which we observed negative Poisson ratios in
   the nuclei. In addition, we were able to detect changes in the nuclear
   response after treatment with actin depolymerizing and chromatin
   decondensing agents. Finally, we showed that the device can be used for
   biologically relevant high-resolution confocal imaging of cells under
   compression. Thus, the device presented here allows for accurate
   physical phenotyping at high throughput and has the potential to be
   applied to a range of cell types.}},

Title = {{An association between decreasing incidence of invasive non-typhoidal
   salmonellosis and increased use of antiretroviral therapy, Gauteng
   Province, South Africa, 2003-2013}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Abstract = {{Background
   HIV-infected persons are at increased risk of opportunistic infections,
   including invasive nontyphoidal Salmonella (iNTS) infections;
   antiretroviral therapy (ART) reduces this risk. We explored changing
   iNTS incidence associated with increasing ART availability in South
   Africa.
   Methods
   Laboratory-based surveillance for iNTS was conducted in Gauteng
   Province, South Africa, with verification using the National Health
   Laboratory Service's Central Data Warehouse (CDW), between 2003 and
   2013. Isolates were serotyped at the Centre for Enteric Diseases. CDW
   data on patient numbers obtaining HIV viral load measurements provided
   estimates of numbers of HIV-infected patients receiving ART. A Poisson
   regression model was used to measure the changing incidence of iNTS
   infection from 2003 to 2013. The correlation between the incidence of
   iNTS and ART use from 2004 to 2013 was determined using Pearson's
   correlation coefficient.
   Results
   From 2003-2013, the incidence of iNTS per 100,000 population per year
   decreased from 5.0 to 2.2 (p < .001). From 2004 to 2013, the incidence
   per 100,000 population of HIV viral load testing increased from 75.2 to
   3,620.3 (p < .001). The most common serotypes causing invasive disease
   were Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (Salmonella Typhimurium),
   and Salmonella Enteritidis: 2,469 (55.4\%) and 1,156 (25.9\%) of 4,459
   isolates serotyped, respectively. A strong negative correlation was
   observed between decreasing iNTS incidence and increasing ART use from
   2004 to 2013 (r = -0.94, p < .001). Similarly, decreasing incidence of
   invasive Salmonella Typhimurium infection correlated with increasing ART
   use (r = -0.93, p <.001). Incidence of invasive Salmonella Enteritidis
   infection increased, however (r = 0.95, p <.001). Between 2003 and 2004,
   fewer adult men than women presented with iNTS (male-to- female rate
   ratio 0.73 and 0.89, respectively). This was reversed from 2005 through
   2013 (ranging from 1.07 in 2005 to 1.44 in 2013). Adult men accessed ART
   less (male-to-female rate ratio ranging from 0.61 {[}2004] to 0.67
   {[}2013]).
   Conclusions
   The incidence of iNTS infections including Salmonella Typhimurium
   decreased significantly in Gauteng Province in association with
   increased ART utilization. Adult men accessed ART programs less than
   women, translating into increasing iNTS incidence in this group.
   Monitoring iNTS incidence may assist in monitoring the ART program.
   Increasing incidence of invasive Salmonella Enteritidis infections needs
   further elucidation.}},

Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{117}},
Pages = {{72-83}},
Month = {{MAR 5}},
Abstract = {{Honeycomb structures have been used extensively in lightweight sandwich
   structure and impact energy absorption applications. Recently the
   research has been carried out on auxetic honeycombs that have negative
   Poisson's ratio (NPR). Auxetic structures are attractive for various
   engineering applications because of their unique mechanical properties,
   volume change control and excellent impact energy absorption
   performance. In this study, novel design and performance improvement of
   new auxetic-strut structures were presented. A comparative study of
   in-plane uniaxial compression loading behavior of regular honeycomb,
   re-entrant auxetic honeycomb, locally reinforced auxetic-strut structure
   and a hybrid structure of combining regular honeycomb and auxeticstrut
   structure was conducted on 3D printed samples. The deformation and
   failure modes of the different cells were studied and their performance
   was also discussed. The new auxetic-strut structure showed better
   mechanical properties than the honeycomb and auxetic structure. For
   example, the compressive strength of the auxeticstrut design is similar
   to 300\% more than that of honeycomb structure and similar to 65\% more
   than that of auxetic structure. With lower values of the Poisson's
   ratio, the new design can absorb more energy when compared to the other
   structures. Hybrid structure of auxetic-strut and honeycomb cells allows
   us tailor the deformation paths to provide desired failure modes. (C)

Title = {{Model based heritability scores for high-throughput sequencing data}},
Journal = {{BMC BIOINFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{18}},
Month = {{MAR 2}},
Abstract = {{Background: Heritability of a phenotypic or molecular trait measures the
   proportion of variance that is attributable to genotypic variance. It is
   an important concept in breeding and genetics. Few methods are available
   for calculating heritability for traits derived from high-throughput
   sequencing.
   Results: We propose several statistical models and different methods to
   compute and test a heritability measure for such data based on linear
   and generalized linear mixed effects models. We also provide methodology
   for hypothesis testing and interval estimation. Our analyses show that,
   among the methods, the negative binomial mixed model (NB-fit), compound
   Poisson mixed model (CP-fit), and the variance stabilizing transformed
   linear mixed model (VST) outperform the voom-transformed linear mixed
   model (voom). NB-fit and VST appear to be more robust than CP-fit for
   estimating and testing the heritability scores, while NB-fit is the most
   computationally expensive. CP-fit performed best in terms of the
   coverage of the confidence intervals. In addition, we applied the
   methods to both microRNA (miRNA) and messenger RNA (mRNA) sequencing
   datasets from a recombinant inbred mouse panel. We show that miRNA and
   mRNA expression can be a highly heritable molecular trait in mouse, and
   that some top heritable features coincide with expression quantitative
   trait loci.
   Conclusions: The models and methods we investigated in this manuscript
   is applicable and extendable to sequencing experiments where some
   biological replicates are available and the environmental variation is
   properly controlled. The CP-fit approach for assessing heritability was
   implemented for the first time to our knowledge. All the methods
   presented, as well as the generation of simulated sequencing data under
   either negative binomial or compound Poisson mixed models, are provided
   in the R package HeritSeq.}},

Abstract = {{Macroscopic safety models establish a relationship between crashes and
   the contributing factors in a defined spatial unit. Negative binomial
   (NB) and Bayesian negative binomial models with conditional
   autoregressive prior (CAR) are techniques widely used to establish this
   relationship. However, these models do not account for unobserved
   heterogeneity and their output is global and fixed irrespective of the
   spatial unit of the analysis. There is a timely need to understand how
   variations in spatial units affect unobserved heterogeneity. This study
   uses two advanced modeling techniques, the random parameter negative
   binomial (RPNB) and the semi-parametric geographically weighted Poisson
   regression (S-GWPR), to investigate whether explanatory variables found
   to be significant and random in one spatial aggregation will remain
   significant and random when another spatial aggregation is used. The key
   finding is that variations in spatial units do have an impact on
   unobserved heterogeneity. We also found that variations in spatial units
   have a greater impact on unobserved heterogeneity in the RPNB models
   compared to the S-GWPR models. We found that the S-GWPR model performs
   better than the RPNB model with the lowest value of mean absolute
   deviation (MAD) and Akaiki information criterion (AIC) but the two
   modeling techniques produce similar results in terms of the sign of the
   coefficients across the selected spatial units of analysis. Overall, the
   study provides a methodological basis for assessing the impact of
   spatial units on unobserved heterogeneity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Purpose: The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to evaluate the
   impact of untreated caries in different stages on the oral health
   related quality of life (OHRQoL) of one- to three-year-olds and their
   families. Methods: The mothers of 308 children answered the Brazilian
   version of the Early Childhood Oral Health Impact Scale to determine
   their perceptions of the OHRQoL of their children. The mothers also
   answered a questionnaire addressing demographic and socioeconomic
   characteristics of their families. The children were submitted to a
   clinical examination for the diagnosis of dental caries using
   International Caries Detection and Assessment System criteria. Data
   analysis involved descriptive statistics, Kruskal-Wallis and
   Mann-Whitney tests, and hierarchically adjusted Poisson regression
   models. Results: The prevalence of untreated caries was 643 percent.
   Among the children with caries, 53.5 percent exhibited the severe stage
   of the condition. Negative impact on OHRQoL was significantly associated
   with severe stage of caries (prevalence ratio {[}PR] equals 2.80, 95
   percent confidence interval {[}Cl] equals 1.90 to 4.12, P<0.001), and a
   younger age for the mother (PR equals 1.69, 95 percent Cl equals 1.27 to
   2.25, P<0.001). Conclusion: Untreated caries in advanced stages was
   associated with a poorer quality of life among one- to three-year-olds

Journal = {{ACTA MATERIALIA}},

Volume = {{126}},
Pages = {{426-437}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Large sheets of polyurethane open-cell foam were compressed (or
   stretched) using pins and a conversion mould whilst undergoing thermal
   softening and controlled cooling. Sheets (final dimensions 355 x 344 x
   20 mm) were fabricated with uniform triaxial compression, with and
   without through thickness pins, and also with different compression
   regimes (uniform triaxial compression or through thickness compression
   and biaxial planar tension) in opposing quadrants. The samples
   fabricated under uniform triaxial compression with and without pins
   exhibited similar cell structure and mechanical properties. The sheets
   fabricated with graded compression levels displayed clearly defined
   quadrants of differing cell structure and mechanical properties. The
   graded foam quadrants subject to triaxial compression displayed similar
   cell structure, tangent moduli and negative Poisson's ratio responses to
   the uniform foams converted with a similar level of triaxial
   compression. The graded foam quadrants subject to through-thickness
   compression and biaxial planar tension displayed a slightly re-entrant
   through-thickness cell structure contrasting with an in-plane structure
   resembling the fully reticulated cell structure of the unconverted
   parent foam. This quadrant of graded foam displayed positive and
   negative Poisson's ratios in tension and compression, respectively,
   accompanied by high and low in plane tangent modulus, respectively. The
   strain-dependent mechanical properties are shown to be fully consistent
   with expectations from honeycomb theory. The triaxially compressed
   quadrants of the graded sheet exhibited 4 times lower peak acceleration
   than quadrants with through-thickness compression and biaxial planar
   tension in 6 J impact tests using a steel hemispherical drop mass. (C)

Abstract = {{BackgroundPeople residing outside the capital cities have poorer oral
   health than their city counterparts. Health workforce shortages and
   stability issues can have negative health effects on rural populations.
   There has been an increasing proportion of women entering the dental
   practitioner workforce in Australia. This study investigated whether
   dental practitioners who have a rural background are more likely to work
   in a rural area than those who do not have a rural background; and
   whether the gender of dental practitioners plays a role.
   MethodsA self-administered questionnaire was sent to a sample of dental
   practitioners via their professional dental associations. Practice
   location was assigned as either urban' or rural' using the Australian
   Standard Geographical Classification - Remoteness Area categories and
   measured with demographic characteristics of the respondents. Prevalence
   ratios (PR) were estimated using Poisson regression with robust standard
   errors.
   ResultsParticipants with a rural background were more than twice as
   likely (male PR = 2.23, 95\% confidence interval (CI) = 0.79-6.26;
   female PR = 2.82, 95\% CI = 1.35-5.87) to practise in a rural area than

Abstract = {{Background and purpose: Falls are common in people with Parkinson's
   disease (PD) but few data exist on fall-related hospitalizations in this
   group. This population-based study compared fall-related hospital
   admissions, injury rates and consequences in people with and without PD,
   and determined whether PD was an independent predictor of fall-related
   hospital length of stay.
   Methods: This was a retrospective study using probabilistic linkage of
   hospital data in people aged 65 years hospitalized for a fall between 1
   July 2005 and 31 December 2013 in New South Wales, Australia. Rates of
   hospital admissions and injuries per person admitted over the study
   period were compared between people with and without PD using Poisson or
   negative binomial regression. Multilevel linear modelling was used to
   analyse length of stay by clustering individuals and adjusting for
   possible confounders.
   Results: There were 342 265 fall-related hospital admissions in people
   aged 65 years during the study period, of which 8487 (2.5\%) were for
   people with PD. Sixty-seven per cent of fall-related PD admissions were
   associated with injury and 35\% were associated with fracture. People
   with PD had higher rate ratios for fall admissions (1.63, 95\%
   confidence interval 1.59-1.67) and injury (1.47, 95\% confidence
   interval 1.43-1.51) and longer median length of stay {[}9 (interquartile
   range 1-27) vs. 6 (interquartile range 1-20) days in people without PD;
   P < 0.001]. PD remained associated with increased length of stay after
   controlling for comorbidity, age, sex and injury (P < 0.001).
   Conclusions: This study provides important benchmark data for
   hospitalizations for falls and fall injuries for older people with PD,
   which may be used to monitor the effect of fall prevention programmes.}},

Abstract = {{A cylindrically curved panel in a state of generalized plane strain
   subject to a radial temperature gradient is discussed by analytical
   means. The ends of this thick-walled shell are presupposed to be guided
   in such a way that a displacement in circumferential direction may occur
   and that the radius of the middle surface remains unchanged. Then,
   couples act on those ends, giving rise to pure bending condition. The
   material is power-law functionally graded, and - based on the rule of
   mixtures - a coherent dependence of all the material properties (except
   for Poisson's ratio) on the radial coordinate is taken into account. The
   stresses occurring for both a positive and a negative temperature
   gradient are analyzed, and one finds that, depending on the grading
   exponent, the yield limit according to von Mises may be reached either
   at the inner surface, the outer surface or at both surfaces
   simultaneously. Numerical results are provided for a steel/aluminum FGM,
   and it is shown that by appropriate grading not only a reduction of the
   couples acting at the supports but in some cases also a considerable
   reduction of the weight of the panel may be achieved. (C) 2016 WILEY-VCH

   if their stiffness and strength properties could be improved. The aim of
   this research was to design and determine elastic properties of sandwich
   panels (SPs) based on a dual corrugated HDF core. Stiffness matrix
   values of elements were determined by a numerical method. The 3D
   calculation results were compared with those of the homogeneous model.
   The calculation results were collated with those of experimental
   investigations. It was demonstrated that the linear elasticity modulus
   as well as the modulus of rupture of the SPs were comparable with
   mechanical properties of a particle board with identical thickness,
   while the SP has a 1/3 lower density. The panel core exhibited
   significant orthotropic properties. In the xy plane it could be
   characterized as an auxetic structure. The homogeneous model leads to
   results similar to those achieved from the 3D model and observed in
   experimental tests.}},

Abstract = {{Differential provision of local services and amenities has been proposed
   as a mechanism behind the relationship between social capital and
   health. The aim of this study was to investigate whether social capital
   and collective efficacy are related to the provision of social support
   services and amenities in Dutch municipalities, against a background of
   decentralisation of long-term care to municipalities. We used data on
   neighbourhood social capital, collective efficacy (the extent to which
   people are willing to work for the common good), and the provision of
   services and amenities in 2012. We included the services municipalities
   provide to support informal caregivers (e.g. respite care), individual
   services and support (e.g. domiciliary help), and general and collective
   services and amenities (e.g. lending point for wheelchairs). Data for
   social capital were collected between May 2011 and September 2012.
   Social capital was measured by focusing on contacts between neighbours.
   A social capital measure was estimated for 414 municipalities with
   ecometric measurements. A measure of collective efficacy was constructed
   based on information about the experienced responsibility for the
   liveability of the neighbourhood by residents in 2012, average charity
   collection returns in municipalities in 2012, voter turnout at the
   municipal elections in 2010 and the percentage of blood donors in 2012.
   We conducted Poisson regression and negative binomial regression to test
   our hypotheses. We found no relationship between social capital and the
   provision of services and amenities in municipalities. We found an
   interaction effect (coefficient=3.11, 95\% CI=0.72-5.51, P=0.011) of
   social capital and collective efficacy on the provision of support
   services for informal caregivers in rural municipalities. To gain more
   insight in the relationship between social capital and health, it will
   be important to study the relationship between social capital and
   differential provision of services and amenities more extensively and in
   different contexts.}},

Abstract = {{Majority of the available research on buckling analysis of the plates,
   has been devoted to plates with well-behaved configurations, e.g.,
   rectangular or circular geometries. In the present research, thermal
   buckling of general quadrilateral plates fabricated from heterogeneous,
   orthotropic, and auxetic (with negative Poisson ratio) materials resting
   on elastic Winkler-Pasternak elastic media is investigated. Edges of the
   plate may be either simply supported or clamped. Thus, the problem is a
   quite general one, from the material, boundary conditions, and to some
   extent, geometry points of view and may cover wide ranges of the
   practical applications, as special cases. The stability equations are
   derived through transformation of the governing equations of the plate
   from the geometric rectangular Cartesian coordinates to the
   computational natural coordinates and discretization of the resulting
   equations by means of the differential quadratic method. Buckling
   analysis has been accomplished through investigation of the pre-buckling
   and buckling onset situations. Finally, effects of the skew angles of
   the general quadrilateral plate, heterogeneity index, orthotropy angle,
   edge condition, foundation stiffness, and auxeticity of the material on
   the buckling temperature rises are investigated comprehensively.}},

Abstract = {{In the present research, free vibration of circular and annular sandwich
   plates with auxetic (negative Poisson's ratio) cores and
   isotropic/orthotropic face sheets is investigated for different
   combinations of the boundary conditions. To ensure that the results are
   accurate and reliable, a global-local layerwise plate theory is employed
   instead of the traditional equivalent single-layer theories. The
   governing equations are derived based on Hamilton's principle and solved
   using a Taylor transform whose center is located at the outer radius of
   the plate. Due to this hint, the resulting semi-analytical solution can
   be employed for both circular and annular sandwich plates. After
   investigation of vibration behavior of a single-layer annular auxetic
   plate, a comprehensive parametric study including evaluation of effects
   of the auxeticity for sandwich plates with isotropic and orthotropic
   face sheets, symmetric and asymmetric layups, different core to sheet
   thickness, radius to thickness, and inner to outer radius ratios, and
   various boundary conditions, is carried out. Results show that unlike
   the single-layer auxetic plates that exhibit a transition state, the
   auxeticity may considerably increase the natural frequencies and
   rigidities of the circular/annular sandwich plates, especially when the
   boundary conditions induce higher rigidity in the plate or when the
   fibers are along the radial direction. Accuracy of results of the
   employed layerwise theory and the proposed semi-analytical solution is
   verified by comparing the results with those of the three-dimensional
   theory of elasticity extracted from the ABAQUS software.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of feature selection in text classification is to choose highly
   distinguishing features for, improving the performance of a classifier.
   The well-known text classification feature selection metric named
   balanced accuracy measure (ACC2) (Forman, 2003) evaluates a term by
   taking the difference of its document frequency in the positive class
   (also known as true positives) and its document frequency in the
   negative class (also known as false positives). This however results in
   assigning equal ranks to terms having equal difference, ignoring their
   relative document frequencies in the classes. In this paper we propose a
   new feature ranking (FR) metric, called normalized difference measure
   (NDM), which takes into account the relative document frequencies. The
   performance of NDM is investigated against seven well known feature
   ranking metrics including odds ratio (OR), chi squared (CHI),
   information gain (IG), distinguishing feature selector (DFS), gini index
   (GINI),balanced accuracy measure (ACC2) and Poisson ratio (POIS) on
   seven datasets namely We-bACE(WAP,K1a,K1b), Reuters (REO, RE1),spam
   email dataset and 20 newsgroups using the multinomial naive Bayes (MNB)
   and supports vector machines (SVM) classifiers. Our results show that
   the NDM metric outperforms the seven metrics in 66\% cases in terms of
   macro-Fl measure and in 51\% cases in terms of micro F1 measure in our
   experimental trials on these datasets. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A bimorph composed of ferrimagnetic cobalt ferrite (CoFe2O4, CFO) and
   flexible muscovite was fabricated via van der Waals epitaxy. The
   combination of X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy
   was conducted to reveal the heteroepitaxy of the CFO/muscovite system.
   The robust magnetic behaviors against mechanical bending were
   characterized by hysteresis measurements and magnetic force microscopy,
   which maintain a saturation magnetization (M-s) of similar to 120-150
   emu/cm(3) under different bending states. The large magnetostrictive
   response of the CFO film was then determined by digital holographic
   microscopy, where the difference of magnetostrction coefficient (Delta
   lambda) is -104 ppm. The superior performance of this bimorph is
   attributed to the nature of weak interaction between film and substrate.
   Such a flexible CFO/muscovite bimorph provides a new platform to develop
   next-generation flexible magnetic devices.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To assess the relationship between sense of coherence (SOC)
   and oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) among children aged one
   to three years. Participants: A cross-sectional study was conducted with
   276 mother-child pairs randomly selected from the city of Diamantina,
   Brazil. Method: Information was obtained on socio-demographic factors.
   The short version of Antonovsky's sense of coherence scale (SOC 13) and
   the Early Childhood Oral Health Impact Scale (ECOHIS) were administered.
   The children were examined for dental caries. Statistical analysis
   involved descriptive statistics, the calculation of Spearman's
   correlation coefficients and adjusted Poisson regression models.
   Results: SOC was significantly associated with the child's OHRQoL in the
   multivariate analysis. Children of mothers with high SOC (PR 0.96;
   95\%CI 0.93,0.98; p=0.045) had a lower prevalence of a negative impact
   on OHRQoL. Children with severe dental caries had a greater prevalence
   of a negative impact on OHRQoL (PR 2.53; 95\%CI 1.77,3.62; p<0.001).
   Conclusions: Maternal SOC could be a psychosocial determinant of the
   OHRQoL of children aged one to three years. Severe dental caries was
   associated with poorer quality of life.}},

Abstract = {{Background People remain at risk of reinfection with hepatitis C virus
   (HCV), even after clearance of the primary infection. We identified
   factors associated with HCV reinfection risk in a large population-based
   cohort study in British Columbia, Canada, and examined the association
   of opioid substitution therapy and mental health counselling with
   reinfection.
   Methods We obtained data from the British Columbia Hepatitis Testers
   Cohort, which includes all individuals tested for HCV or HIV at the
   British Columbia Centre for Disease Control Public Health Laboratory
   during 1990-2013 (when data were available). We defined cases of HCV
   reinfection as individuals with a positive HCV PCR test after either
   spontaneous clearance (two consecutive negative HCV PCR tests spaced >=
   28 days apart without treatment) or a sustained virological response
   (SVR; two consecutive negative HCV PCR tests spaced >= 28 days apart 12
   weeks after completing interferon-based treatment). We calculated
   incidence rates of HCV reinfection (per 100 person-years of follow-up)
   and corresponding 95\% CIs assuming a Poisson distribution, and used a
   multivariable Cox proportional hazards model to examine reinfection risk
   factors (age, birth cohort, sex, year of HCV diagnosis, HCV clearance
   type, HIV co-infection, number of mental health counselling visits,
   levels of material and social deprivation, and alcohol and injection
   drug use), and the association of opioid substitution therapy and mental
   health counselling with HCV reinfection among people who inject drugs
   (PWID).
   Findings 5915 individuals with HCV were included in this study after
   clearance (3690 after spontaneous clearance and 2225 after SVR). 452
   (8\%) patients developed reinfection; 402 (11\%) after spontaneous
   clearance and 50 (2\%) who had achieved SVR. Individuals were followed
   up for a median of 5.4 years (IQR 2.9-8.7), and the median time to
   reinfection was 3 . 0 years (1.5-5.4). The overall incidence rate of
   reinfection was 1 . 27 (95\% CI 1.15-1.39) per 100 person-years of
   follow-up over a total of 35 672 person-years, with significantly higher
   rates in the spontaneous clearance group (1.59, 1.44-1.76) than in the
   SVR group (0.48, 0.36-0.63). With the adjusted Cox proportional hazards
   model, we noted higher reinfection risks in the spontaneous clearance
   group (adjusted hazard ratio {[}HR] 2.71, 95\% CI 2.00-3.68),
   individuals co-infected with HIV (2.25, 1.78-2.85), and PWID (1.53,
   1.21-1.92) than with other reinfection risk factors. Among the 1604 PWID
   with a current history of injection drug use, opioid substitution
   therapy was significantly associated with a lower risk of reinfection
   (adjusted HR 0.73, 95\% CI 0.54-0.98), as was engagement with mental
   health counselling services (0.71, 0.54-0.92).
   Interpretation The incidence of HCV reinfection was higher among HIV
   co-infected individuals, those who spontaneously cleared HCV infection,
   and PWID. HCV treatment complemented with opioid substitution therapy
   and mental health counselling could reduce HCV reinfection risk among
   PWID. These findings support policies of post-clearance follow-up of
   PWID, and provision of harm-reduction services to minimise HCV
   reinfection and transmission.}},

Abstract = {{The synthesis of novel one-dimensional carbon nanostructures named
   diamond nanothreads (DNT) has been recently reported, and subsequent
   studies employing molecular dynamics (MD) simulations demonstrated that
   they possess remarkable mechanical properties. In this paper we present
   the results of Density Functional Theory calculations of the mechanical
   properties for several DNT configurations, confirming that they indeed
   exhibit a high ideal strength (as high as 15.7 nN or 2.6 x 10(7) N m/kg)
   and stiffness (as high as 168 nN or 2.8 x 10(8) N m/kg), similarly to
   other carbon nanostructures. We compare these results with previously
   reported and additional MD calculations, and show that traditional
   interatomic potentials predict these properties with deviations up to
   similar to 50\%. A detailed analysis of the dependence of atomic
   structure on strain shows the reasons for these discrepancies. We also
   show that the most known DNT configuration (the (3,0) sp(3)-nanotube)
   exhibits a negative radial Poisson ratio. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Fiber networks with out-of-plane auxetic behavior have been sporadically
   investigated. One of the major challenges is to design such materials
   with giant negative Poisson's ratio over large deformations. Here in, we
   report a systematic investigation to create three-dimensional (3D) fiber
   networks in the form of needlepunched nonwoven materials with
   out-of-plane auxetic behavior over large deformations via theoretical
   modeling and extensive set of experiments. The experimental matrix has
   encapsulated the key parameters of the needlepunching nonwoven process.
   Under uniaxial tensile loading, the anisotropy coupled with local fiber
   densification in networks has yielded large negative Poisson's ratio (up
   to -5.7) specifically in the preferential direction. The in-plane and
   out-of-plane Poisson's ratios of fiber networks have been predicted and,
   subsequently, compared with the experimental results. Fiber orientation
   was found to be a core parameter that modulated the in-plane Poisson's
   ratio of fiber networks. A parametric analysis has revealed the
   interplay between the anisotropy of the fiber network and the
   out-of-plane Poisson's ratio based upon constant volume consideration.}},

Abstract = {{Nucleic acids are strongly negatively charged, and thus electrostatic
   interactions-screened by ions in solution play an important role in
   governing their ability to fold and participate in biomolecular
   interactions. The negative charge creates a region, known as the ion
   atmosphere, in which cation and anion concentrations are perturbed from
   their bulk values. Ion counting experiments quantify the ion atmosphere
   by measuring the preferential ion interaction coefficient: the net total
   number of excess ions above, or below, the number expected due to the
   bulk concentration. The results of such studies provide important
   constraints on theories, which typically predict the full
   three-dimensional distribution of the screening cloud. This article
   reviews the state of nucleic acid ion counting measurements and
   critically analyzes their ability to test both analytical and

   Uganda}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Abstract = {{Background
   Although the association between alcohol consumption and HIV risk is
   well documented, few studies have examined the magnitude of new HIV
   infections that could be prevented by controlling alcohol use. We report
   the population attributable fraction (PAF) of incident HIV infections
   due to alcohol consumption among the HIV high-risk population of fishing
   communities along Lake Victoria, Uganda.
   Methods
   In a community-based cohort study, 1607 HIV sero-negative participants
   aged 18-49 years were enrolled from eight fishing communities along Lake
   Victoria, Uganda. At follow up 12 months later, 1288 (80.1\%) were seen
   and interviewed. At baseline and follow-up visits, participants
   completed interviewer-administered questionnaires on alcohol
   consumption, demographics, and sexual risk behavior, and were tested for
   HIV infection. HIV incidence and adjusted incident rate ratios (adjusted
   IRRs) were estimated using Poisson regression models; the crude and
   adjusted PAFs of incident HIV infections associated with alcohol
   consumption were calculated using the Greenland and Drescher method for
   cohort studies.
   Results
   Among the 1288 participants seen at follow up, 53.5\% reported drinking
   alcohol of whom 24.4\% drank occasionally (2 days a week or less) and
   29.1\% drank regularly (3-7 days a week). Forty eight incident HIV
   infections occurred giving an incidence rate of 3.39/100 person years
   at-risk (pyar) (95\% CI, 2.55-4.49). Compared to non-drinkers, the
   adjusted IRR of HIV was 3.09 (1.13-8.46) among occasional drinkers and
   5.34 (2.04-13.97) among regular drinkers. The overall adjusted PAF of
   incident HIV infections due alcohol was 64.1 (95\% CI; 23.5-83.1);
   ranging from 52.3 (11.9-74.2) among Muslims to 71.2 (32.6-87.7) for
   participants who reported >= 2 sexual partners in the past 12 months.
   Conclusion
   In fishing communities along Lake Victoria, Uganda, 64\% of new HIV
   infections can be attributed to drinking alcohol. Interventions to
   reduce alcohol consumption should be integrated in HIV/AIDS prevention
   activities for populations in whom both HIV and alcohol consumption are
   highly prevalent.}},

Abstract = {{Studies on designing polymeric fibres based helical auxetic yarn (HAY)
   to maximise their auxetic effect are yet to propose optimised design
   configurations for general impact mitigation applications. This study
   therefore presents optimal design parameters through analytical
   calculations and finite element (FE) method. Three main design
   parameters were considered which includes Poisson's ratio, core/wrap
   diameter ratio, and starting wrap angle. The Poisson's ratio of the HAY
   was calculated by measuring its total diameter at a given rate of
   strain. The investigation found here to be a starting wrap angle of a
   HAY (critical angle) that resulted in the highest possible exhibiting of
   the auxetic effect. The critical angle was determined to be 7, and a
   maximum NPR of - 12.04 was achieved with this design. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{Four metallic metamaterials with tailorable mechanical properties are
   designed using bi-material star shaped re-entrant planar lattice
   structures, which do not involve pins, adhesive, welding or pressure fit
   joints and can be fabricated through laser-based additive manufacturing.
   Three length parameters, one angle parameter and three material
   combinations are used as adjustable design parameters to explore
   structure-property relations. For each of the four designed
   metamaterials, the effects of the design parameters on the Poisson's
   ratio (PR), coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), Young's modulus and
   relative density are systematically investigated using unit cell-based
   finite element simulations that incorporate periodic boundary
   conditions. It is found that the bi-material lattice structures can be
   tailored to obtain 3-D printable metallic metamaterials with positive,
   near-zero or negative PR and CTE together with an uncompromised Young's
   modulus. In particular, it is shown that metamaterial \# 1 can exhibit
   both a negative PR and a non-positive CTE simultaneously. These metallic
   metamaterials can find applications in structures or devices such as
   antennas and precision instruments to reduce thermomechanical stresses
   and extend service lives. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has been associated with
   increased non-liver-related morbidity and mortality. However, studies
   have yielded inconsistent results.
   Methods. The incidence of clinical events in human immunodeficiency
   virus (HIV)-infected HCV-seropositive and incidence density-matched
   HCV-seronegative participants of the Swiss HIV Cohort Study from August
   1994 to December 2014 was studied. We compared (1) HCV-seropositive with
   HCV-seronegative participants and (2) HCV-viremic with successfully
   treated nonviremic patients. Poisson regression was used to assess
   differences between these groups.
   Results. We included 2503 HCV-seropositive participants (540 with
   spontaneous HCV clearance, 1294 untreated HCV RNA positive, 345 treated
   with sustained virologic response {[}SVR], 43 during treatment, and 281
   treated without SVR), and 2503 HCVseronegative controls. After a mean
   follow-up of 8.2 years, we observed (HCV seropositive and HCV
   seronegative, respectively) 107 and 18 liver events, 41 and 14 kidney
   events, 230 and 121 osteoporosis/fractures, 82 and 94 diabetes mellitus,
   114 and 129 cardiovascular events, 119 and 147 non-AIDS malignancies,
   162 and 126 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention HIV category B/C
   events, 106 and 10 liver-related deaths, and 227 and 218
   non-liver-related deaths. Compared with HCV-negative controls,
   HCV-seropositive participants had an increased risk of liver events
   (incidence rate ratio {[}IRR], 6.29 {[}95\% confidence interval \{CI\},
   3.52-11.22]), liver-related death (IRR, 8.24 {[}95\% CI, 3.61-18.83]),
   kidney events (IRR, 2.43 {[}95\% CI, 1.11-5.33]), and osteoporosis/
   fracture (IRR, 1.43 {[}95\% CI, 1.03-2.01]). Among HCV-seropositive
   individuals, treated participants without SVR vs those with SVR had a
   higher risk of liver events (IRR, 6.79 {[}95\% CI, 2.33-19.81]),
   liver-related death (IRR, 3.29 {[}95\% CI, 1.35-8.05]), and diabetes
   mellitus (IRR, 4.62 {[}95\% CI, 1.53-13.96]). Similar but not
   statistically significant differences were found between untreated HCV
   RNA-positive patients and those with SVR.
   Conclusions. While HCV exposure was associated with an increased risk of
   kidney disease and osteoporosis/fracture, this risk did not seem to be
   dependent of persistent HCV RNA. Successful HCV treatment was associated
   with a lower incidence of liver disease, liver-related death, and
   diabetes mellitus, whereas the other conditions studied were less
   affected.}},

Abstract = {{Metamaterials with artificially designed architectures are increasingly
   considered as new paradigmatic material systems with unusual physical
   properties. Here, we report a class of architected lattice metamaterials
   with mechanically tunable negative Poisson's ratios and
   vibration-mitigation capability. The proposed lattice metamaterials are
   built by replacing regular straight beams with sinusoidally shaped ones,
   which are highly stretchable under uniaxial tension. Our experimental
   and numerical results indicate that the proposed lattices exhibit
   extreme Poisson's-ratio variations between -0.7 and 0.5 over large
   tensile deformations up to 50\%. This large variation of Poisson's-ratio
   values is attributed to the deformation pattern switching from bending
   to stretching within the sinusoidally shaped beams. The interplay
   between the multiscale (ligament and cell) architecture and wave
   propagation also enables remarkable broadband vibration-mitigation
   capability of the lattice metamaterials, which can be dynamically tuned
   by an external mechanical stimulus. The material design strategy
   provides insights into the development of classes of architected
   metamaterials with potential applications including energy absorption,
   tunable acoustics, vibration control, responsive devices, soft robotics,
   and stretchable electronics.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Policing involves inherent physical and psychological
   dangers as well as occupational stressors that could lead to chronic
   fatigue. Although accounts of adverse events associated with police
   fatigue are not scarce, literature on the association between chronic
   fatigue and on-duty injury are limited. Methods: Participants were
   officers from the Buffalo Cardio-Metabolic Occupational Police Stress
   (BCOPS) Study. A 10-item questionnaire was administered to assess how
   tired or energetic the officers generally felt irrespective of sleep
   hours or workload. The questionnaire consisted of five positively worded
   and five negatively phrased items that measured feelings of vigor/energy
   and tiredness, respectively. Total as well as separate scores for
   positive and negative items were computed by summing scores of
   individual items. Payroll records documenting each officer's work
   history were used to assess occurrence of injury. Poisson regression was
   used to estimate prevalence ratios (PR) of injury. Results: Nearly 40\%
   of officers reported feeling drained. Overall prevalence of on-duty
   injury during the past year was 23.9\%. Injury prevalence showed a
   significant increasing trend across tertiles of total fatigue score:
   19.6, 21.7, and 30.8\% for lowest, middle and highest tertiles,
   respectively (trend p-value = 0.037). After controlling for potential
   confounders, a 5-unit increase in total fatigue score Was associated
   with a 12\% increase in prevalence of injury which was marginally
   significant (p = 0.075). A 5-tinit increase in fatigue score of the
   positively worded items was associated with a 33\% increase in
   prevalence of injury (PR = 1.33, 95\% CI: 1.04-1.70, p = 0.022).
   Conclusion: Officers who do not feel active, full of vigor, alert, or
   lively had a significantly higher prevalence of non-fatal work place
   injury compared to their counter parts. Practical applications: With
   additional prospective evidence, workplace interventions designed to
   enhance level of energy may reduce feelings of tiredness and hence may
   prevent workplace injury. Published by Elsevier Ltd. on behalf of

Abstract = {{Background: Studies assessing Spanish smoke-free laws have found a
   decrease in second-hand smoke exposure, but the impact of such laws on
   general smoking trends is not clear. This study proposes to analyse
   trends in the prevalence of smoking in Spain, including changes by
   educational level, following the implementation of smokefree regulations
   (2005 and 2010). Methods: Seven editions of the Spanish Household Survey
   on Alcohol and Drugs from 1999 to 2011 were used to analyse the
   standardised prevalence of daily smokers, the proportion of ex-daily
   smokers, and the average cigarettes smoked daily in both sexes and by
   educational level, among the population aged 15-64. The annual
   percentage of change (APC), and Poisson and linear multiple regressions
   were used to identify differences in terms of years and educational
   levels. Results: The overall prevalence of Spanish daily smokers
   decreased from 33.5\% in 1999 to 30.2\% in 2011 (APC = -1.7\% for men,
   APC = -1.0\% for women). Differences between low and high educational
   levels in the prevalence of daily smokers and ex-daily smokers
   increased. For both sexes, the prevalence ratio (PR) of daily smokers
   was positive for the years before 2005 and negative afterwards.
   Conversely, for ex-daily smokers the PR in all years was lower than in
   2005. The mean number of cigarettes decreased from 17.6 cig/day in 1999
   to 14.2 in 2011 {[}APC= day 1.8 (95\% confidence interval: day 2.2, day
   1.3)]. Conclusion: Six years after the national smoke-free regulation
   was implemented, previously reported decreasing trends of smoking for
   both men and women persisted, while inequalities between educational
   levels increased in both sexes.}},

Abstract = {{Data suggest that pregnant women in some settings have high prevalence
   of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STI). We examined
   changes in sexual risk behaviors and intravaginal practices during
   pregnancy that may contribute to HIV and STI incidence using data from
   the Methods for Improved Reproductive Health in Africa study conducted
   in South Africa and Zimbabwe 2003-2006. We used a crossover design and
   modified Poisson regression to compare behaviors among HIV negative
   women 18-45 years during pregnant and non-pregnant periods. Among the
   4802 women <45 years at enrollment, 483 (10.1 \%) had a pregnancy and
   were included in the analysis. Compared to non-pregnant periods,
   pregnancy was associated with fewer than 3 sex acts per week (adjusted
   risk ratio {[}ARR] 0.89; 95 \% CI 0.79-0.99) but more sex acts without
   condoms (ARR 1.32; 95 \% CI 1.15-1.51). Pregnancy was also associated
   with decreased reporting of other sexual risk behaviors including any
   anal sex, multiple sexual partners, and/or sex in exchange for drugs or
   money. Women also reported less intravaginal wiping during pregnancy
   (ARR 0.84; 95 \% CI 0.76-0.93). We found pregnancy decreased sexual
   activity and some high-risk sexual behaviors but increased the risk of
   sex without a condom.}},

Title = {{Pluripotent stem cell expansion and neural differentiation in 3-D
   scaffolds of tunable Poisson's ratio}},
Journal = {{ACTA BIOMATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{49}},
Pages = {{192-203}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Biophysical properties of the scaffolds such as the elastic modulus,
   have been recently shown to impact stem cell lineage commitment. On the
   other hand, the contribution of the Poisson's ratio, another important
   biophysical property, to the stem cell fate decision, has not been
   studied. Scaffolds with tunable Poisson's ratio (v) (termed as auxetic
   scaffolds when Poisson's ratio is zero or negative) are anticipated to
   provide a spectrum of unique biophysical 3-D microenvironments to
   influence stem cell fate. To test this hypothesis, in the present work
   we fabricated auxetic polyurethane scaffolds (v = 0 to -0.45) and
   evaluated their effects on neural differentiation of mouse embryonic
   stem cells (ESCs) and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs).
   Compared to the regular scaffolds (v = +0.30) before auxetic conversion,
   the auxetic scaffolds supported smaller aggregate formation and higher
   expression of beta-tubulin III upon neural differentiation. The
   influences of pore structure, Poisson's ratio, and elastic modulus on
   neural lineage commitment were further evaluated using a series of
   auxetic scaffolds. The results indicate that Poisson's ratio may
   confound the effects of elastic modulus, and auxetic scaffolds with
   proper pore structure and Poisson's ratio enhance neural
   differentiation. This study demonstrates that tuning the Poisson's ratio
   of the scaffolds together with elastic modulus and microstructure would
   enhance the capability to generate broader, more diversified ranges of
   biophysical 3-D microenvironments for the modulation of cellular
   differentiation.
   Statement of Significance
   Biophysical signaling from the substrates and scaffolds plays a critical
   role in neural lineage commitment of pluripotent stem cells. While the
   contribution of elastic modulus has been well studied, the influence of
   Poisson's ratio along with microstructure of the scaffolds remains
   unknown largely due to the lack of technology to produce materials with
   tailorable Poisson's ratio. This study fabricated auxetic polyurethane
   scaffolds with different elastic modulus, Poisson's ratio and
   microstructure and evaluated neural differentiation of pluripotent stem
   cells. The findings add a novel angle to understand the impact of
   biophysical microenvironment on stem cell fate decisions. (C) 2016 Acta

Abstract = {{This work presents a novel negative Poisson's ratio honeycomb design
   composed by two parts (a reentrant hexagonal component and a thin plate
   part) that provide separate contributions to the in plane and
   out-of-plane mechanical properties. The re-entrant hexagons provide the
   in-plane negative Poisson's ratio, the in-plane compliance and the
   out-of-plane compressive strength, while the thin plate part connecting
   the re-entrant hexagonal section bears the large out-of-plane
   flexibility. This ``paper focuses on the in-plane mechanical properties
   of the auxetic cellular structure. Theoretical models related to the
   in-plane uniaxial tensile modulus, the shear modulus, and the Poisson's
   ratios have been built and validated using the finite element
   techniques. The in-plane behavior of the honeycomb has also been
   investigated against the geometrical parameters of the unit cell using a
   parametrical analysis. The theoretical and numerical models illustrate
   good agreement and show the potential of its application in morphing
   structures. We also provide a benchmark of the auxetic configuration
   proposed in this work against negative Poisson's ratio topologies from

   metamaterials using a reconciled level set method}},
Journal = {{COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{83}},
Pages = {{15-32}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Metamaterials are defined as a family of rationally designed artificial
   materials which can provide extraordinary effective properties compared
   with their nature counterparts. This paper proposes a level set based
   method for topology optimization of both single and multiple-material
   Negative Poisson's Ratio (NPR) metamaterials. For multi-material
   topology optimization, the conventional level set method is advanced
   with a new approach exploiting the reconciled level set (RLS) method.
   The proposed method simplifies the multi-material topology optimization
   by evolving each individual material with a single level set function
   and reconciling the result level set field with the Merriman-Bence-Osher
   (MBO) operator. The NPR metamaterial design problem is recast as a
   variational problem, where the effective elastic properties of the
   spatially periodic microstructure are formulated as the strain energy
   functionals under uniform displacement boundary conditions. The adjoint
   variable method is utilized to derive the shape sensitivities by
   combining the general linear elastic equation with a weak imposition of
   Dirichlet boundary conditions. The design velocity field is constructed
   using the steepest descent method and integrated with the level set
   method. Both single and multiple-material mechanical metamaterials are
   achieved in 2D and 3D with different Poisson's ratios and volumes.
   Benchmark designs are fabricated with multi-material 3D printing at high
   resolution. The effective auxetic properties of the achieved designs are
   verified through finite element simulations and characterized using
   experimental tests as well. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic structures are designed to be used for producing auxetic
   materials with controllable mechanical properties. The present study
   treats a design of viscoelastic auxetic honeycomb structures using
   numerical approach and mathematical formulation for impact mitigation.
   In order to increase the energy absorption capacity, viscoelastic
   material has been added into auxetic structure as it has capability to
   dissipate energy under impact loading. Kelvin-Voigt and Maxwell models
   were employed to model viscoelastic components. The auxetic structure
   was then subjected to impact load with linear and nonlinear load
   functions. Dynamic analysis was carried out on a star honeycomb
   structure using continuum mechanics. Influence of different parameters
   on response function was then further studied. The primary outcome of
   this research is the development of viscoelastic auxetic honeycomb
   structural design for predicting the impact resistance under impact

Abstract = {{A novel mechanism for slithering locomotion of a snake-like soft robot
   is presented. A rectangular beam with an isotropic coefficient of
   friction of its contact surface with the flat ground can move forward or
   backward when actuated by a periodic traveling sinusoidal wave. The
   Poisson's ratio of the beam plays an important role in the slithering
   locomotion speed and direction, particularly when it is negative. A
   theoretical model is proposed to elucidate the slithering locomotion
   mechanism, which is analogous to the rolling of a wheel on ground. There
   are two key factors of slithering locomotion: a rotational velocity
   field and a corresponding local contact region between the beam and
   ground. During wriggling motion of the rectangular beam, a rotational
   velocity field is observed near the maximum curvature point of the beam.
   If the beam has a negative Poisson's ratio, the axial tension will cause
   a lateral expansion so that the contact region between the beam and
   ground is located at the outer edge of the maximum curvature (the
   largest lateral expansion point). The direction of the beam's velocity
   at this outer edge is usually opposite to the traveling wave direction,
   so the friction force propels the beam in the direction of the traveling
   wave. A similar scenario is found for the relatively large amplitude of
   wriggling motion when the beam's Poisson's ratio is positive. Finite
   element method (FEM) simulation was conducted to verify the slithering
   locomotion mechanism, and good agreement was found between the FEM
   simulation results and theoretical predictions. The insights obtained
   here present a simple, novel and straightforward mechanism for
   slithering locomotion and are helpful for future designs of snake-like
   soft robots.}},

   with identical geometric variables were fabricated via 3D printing, and
   their Poisson's ratios were measured and compared with the ones from
   simulation. Excellent agreement was found between the experimental
   results and the simulation. The stiffness of the model can be higher

Abstract = {{Silicon dioxide or silica, normally existing in various bulk crystalline
   and amorphous forms, was recently found to possess a two-dimensional
   structure. In this work, we use ab initio calculation and evolutionary
   algorithm to unveil three new two-dimensional (2D) silica structures
   whose thermal, dynamical, and mechanical stabilities are compared with
   many typical bulk silica. In particular, we find that all three of these
   2D silica structures have large in-plane negative Poisson's ratios with
   the largest one being double of penta graphene and three times of
   borophenes. The negative Poisson's ratio originates from the interplay
   of lattice symmetry and Si-O tetrahedron symmetry. Slab silica is also
   an insulating 2D material with the highest electronic band gap (>7 eV)
   among reported 2D structures. These exotic 2D silica with in-plane
   negative Poisson's ratios and widest band gaps are expected to have
   great potential applications in nanomechanics and nanoelectronics.}},

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional hierarchical re-entrant honeycomb structures were
   designed and the mechanical behaviors of the structures were studied

   re-entrant hexagon with identical strut aspect ratio. The Poisson's
   ratio and energy absorption capacity of re-entrant structures of
   different hierarchical orders were studied under different compression

   second order hierarchical structures can reach -1.36 and -1.33 with
   appropriate aspect ratio, 13.8\% and 12.1\% lower than that of the
   zeroth order hierarchical structure. The energy absorption capacity of
   the three models increased with an increasing compression velocity; the
   second order hierarchical structure exhibited the highest rate of
   increase in energy absorption capacity with an increasing compression
   velocity. The plateau stresses of the first and second order

Abstract = {{Count data often display excessive number of zero outcomes than are
   expected in the Poisson regression model. The zero-inflated Poisson
   regression model has been suggested to handle zero-inflated data,
   whereas the zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) regression model has
   been fitted for zero-inflated data with additional overdispersion. For
   bivariate and zero-inflated cases, several regression models such as the
   bivariate zero-inflated Poisson (BZIP) and bivariate zero-inflated
   negative binomial (BZINB) have been considered. This paper introduces
   several forms of nested BZINB regression model which can be fitted to
   bivariate and zero-inflated count data. The mean-variance approach is
   used for comparing the BZIP and our forms of BZINB regression model in
   this study. A similar approach was also used by past researchers for
   defining several negative binomial and zero-inflated negative binomial
   regression models based on the appearance of linear and quadratic terms
   of the variance function. The nested BZINB regression models proposed in
   this study have several advantages; the likelihood ratio tests can be
   performed for choosing the best model, the models have flexible forms of
   marginal mean-variance relationship, the models can be fitted to
   bivariate zero-inflated count data with positive or negative
   correlations, and the models allow additional overdispersion of the two
   dependent variables.}},

Title = {{High Adherence to Iron/Folic Acid Supplementation during Pregnancy Time
   among Antenatal and Postnatal Care Attendant Mothers in Governmental
   Health Centers in Akaki Kality Sub City, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia:
   Hierarchical Negative Binomial Poisson Regression}},

Abstract = {{Background
   Iron deficiency during pregnancy is a risk factor for anemia, preterm
   delivery, and low birth weight. Iron/Folic Acid supplementation with
   optimal adherence can effectively prevent anemia in pregnancy. However,
   studies that address this area of adherence are very limited. Therefore,
   the current study was conducted to assess the adherence and to identify
   factors associated with a number of Iron/Folic Acid uptake during
   pregnancy time among mothers attending antenatal and postnatal care
   follow up in Akaki kality sub city.
   Methods
   Institutional based cross-sectional study was conducted on a sample of
   557 pregnant women attending antenatal and postnatal care service.
   Systematic random sampling was used to select study subjects. The
   mothers were interviewed and the collected data was cleaned and entered
   into Epi Info 3.5.1 and analyzed by R version 3.2.0. Hierarchical
   Negative Binomial Poisson Regression Model was fitted to identify the
   factors associated with a number of Iron/Folic Acid uptake. Adjusted
   Incidence rate ratio (IRR) with 95\% confidence interval (CI) was
   computed to assess the strength and significance of the association.
   Result
   More than 90\% of the mothers were supplemented with at least one
   Iron/Folic Acid supplement from pill per week during their pregnancy
   time. Sixty percent of the mothers adhered (took four or more tablets
   per week) (95\% CI, 56\%-64.1\%). Higher IRR of Iron/Folic Acid
   supplementation was observed among women: who received health education;
   which were privately employed; who achieved secondary education; and who
   believed that Iron/Folic Acid supplements increase blood, whereas
   mothers who reported a side effect, who were from families with
   relatively better monthly income, and who took the supplement when sick
   were more likely to adhere.
   Conclusion
   Adherence to Iron/Folic Acid supplement during their pregnancy time
   among mothers attending antenatal and postnatal care was found to be
   high. Activities that would address the above mentioned factors were
   highly recommended to ensure the sustainability of mothers' adherence to
   the supplement.}},

Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{JAN 24}},
Abstract = {{In this paper we propose a general method for creating a new type of
   hierarchical structures at any level in both 2D and 3D. A simple rule
   based on a rotate-and-mirror procedure is introduced to achieve
   multilevel hierarchies. These new hierarchical structures have
   remarkably few degrees of freedom compared to existing designs by other
   methods. More importantly, these structures exhibit synchronized motions
   during opening or closure, resulting in uniform and easily-controllable
   deformations. Furthermore, a simple analytical formula is found which
   can be used to avoid collision of units of the structure during the
   closing process. The novel design concept is verified by mathematical
   analyses, computational simulations and physical experiments.}},

Title = {{Transformable topological mechanical metamaterials}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{JAN 23}},
Abstract = {{Mechanical metamaterials are engineered materials whose structures give
   them novel mechanical properties, including negative Poisson's ratios,
   negative compressibilities and phononic bandgaps. Of particular interest
   are systems near the point of mechanical instability, which recently
   have been shown to distribute force and motion in robust ways determined
   by a nontrivial topological state. Here we discuss the classification of
   and propose a design principle for mechanical metamaterials that can be
   easily and reversibly transformed between states with dramatically
   different mechanical and acoustic properties via a soft strain.
   Remarkably, despite the low energetic cost of this transition,
   quantities such as the edge stiffness and speed of sound can change by
   orders of magnitude. We show that the existence and form of a soft
   deformation directly determines floppy edge modes and phonon dispersion.
   Finally, we generalize the soft strain to generate domain structures
   that allow further tuning of the material.}},

   Transition in Earth's Lower Mantle}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{118}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{JAN 19}},
Abstract = {{Brillouin light scattering and impulsive stimulated light scattering
   have been used to determine the full elastic constants
   ofmagnesiosiderite {[}(Mg-0.35 Fe-0.65)CO3] up to 70 GPa at room
   temperature in a diamond-anvil cell. Drastic softening in C-11, C-33,
   C-12, and C-13 elasticmoduli associatedwith the compressive stress
   component and stiffening in C-44 and C-14 moduli associated with the
   shear stress component are observed to occur within the spin transition
   between similar to 42.4 and 46.5 GPa. Negative values of C-12 and C-13
   are also observed within the spin transition region. The Born criteria
   constants for the crystal remain positive within the spin transition,
   indicating that themixed-spin state remains mechanically stable.
   Significant auxeticity can be related to the electronic spin
   transition-induced elastic anomalies based on the analysis of Poisson's
   ratio. These elastic anomalies are explained using a thermo elastic
   model for the rhombohedral system. Finally, we conclude that mixed-spin
   state ferromagnesite, which is potentially a major deep-carbon carrier,
   is expected to exhibit abnormal elasticity, including a negative
   Poisson's ratio of -0.6 and drastically reduced V-P by 10\%, in Earth's

Abstract = {{In the present work, a new design of honeycomb is proposed by embedding
   the rhombic configuration into the normal re-entrant hexagonal honeycomb
   (NRHH), in order to enhance the honeycomb's in-plane mechanical
   properties. Both theoretical analysis and numerical simulations are
   employed to calculate the in-plane mechanical properties of the new
   honeycomb under uniaxial compression, including Young's modulus,
   Poisson's ratio and critical buckling strength. The results show that
   the new honeycomb can maintain auxetic performance, while both the
   in-plane Young's modulus and the critical buckling strength are
   significantly improved compared to the NRHH. Comparisons between the
   present design and other exiting enhanced periodic topologies are also
   carried out. With respect to them, the present design features superior
   performances. For these outstanding properties, this layout may provide
   a new concept for the optimization and design of auxetic materials. (C)

Abstract = {{We describe in this work a composite metamaterial with a hierarchical
   topology made by tessellating perforations that exhibit an auxetic
   (negative Poisson's ratio) behaviour. We perform an analysis of the
   hierarchical structure by evaluating the fractal order of the topologies
   associated to the perforated composites. The periodic hierarchical
   lattice configuration shows negative Poisson's ratio characteristics at
   higher levels of hierarchy, even when the baseline configuration has a
   topology not exhibiting an auxetic behaviour. We investigate the wave
   propagation characteristics of these particular hierarchical lattices by
   using a Bloch wave approach applied to detailed Finite Element
   geometries of the unit cell configurations. We show that the level of
   hierarchy creates new band gaps with large relative widths, and it also
   shifts the same bandgaps towards lower frequencies. We correlate the
   mechanical properties, fractal order and the dispersion characteristics
   of the multiscale auxetic perforated metamaterial with the parameters
   defining the geometry of the lattice and the hierarchy levels, and
   discuss the results in a nondimensional form to provide a performance
   map of the mechanical and dynamic properties. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

   8,549,667 instances of artificial insemination (AI) and their
   corresponding preceding and subsequent test-days from 5,979,701 Holstein
   cows were examined over a 5-year period (2008-2012). The effect of udder
   health was evaluated through a low (L) or high (H) somatic cell count
   (SCC) before and after AI using a threshold of 200,000 cells/mL, and
   transformed into four groups (LL, LH, HI, and HH). Three proxies for
   defining SCK were proposed based on the milk fat and protein content (or
   their ratio) before AI. Statistical analysis first included a
   generalized additive model to help define the optimal threshold values.
   Next, a logistic regression with a Poisson correction was performed. On
   average, the risk of conception at first AI was reduced by 14\% for LH
   or HH cows (relative risk {[}and 95\% CI] = 0.86 10.85-0.871) when the
   SCC increased or remained high within 40 days before and after AI,
   relative to LL group. The reduction of conception success associated
   with SCK (fat and protein contents changes) varied from 3\% to 17\%
   depending on the used SCK proxy. Including the interaction term
   SCC{*}SCK clearly showed that the association of increased SCC around AI
   with conception success was modified by the presence of SCK. A cow that
   already has SCK and experiences an increase in SCC around or after AI
   exhibits up to 2 times further decrease in conception success compared
   with a cow with a high SCC and no SCK. In conclusion, this study
   reinforces the previously described association between intramammary
   inflammation around or after AI and a decreased rate of conception.
   These findings highlight how SCK interacts with the above mentioned
   relationship by strengthening the negative association between mastitis
   and conception success. In addition, the present work supports the
   theory that local inflammation may affect the whole-body response and
   alter the functions of other organs, such as the reproductive tract. (C)

Title = {{delta-Phosphorene: a two dimensional material with a highly negative

Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{As a basic mechanical parameter, Poisson's ratio (nu) measures the
   mechanical responses of solids against external loads. In rare cases,
   materials have a negative Poisson's ratio (NPR), and present an
   interesting auxetic effect. That is, when a material is stretched in one
   direction, it will expand in the perpendicular direction. To design
   modern nanoscale electromechanical devices with special functions, two
   dimensional (2D) auxetic materials are highly desirable. In this work,
   based on first principles calculations, we rediscover the previously
   proposed delta-phosphorene (delta-P) nanosheets {[}Jie Guan, et al.,
   Phys. Rev. Lett., 2014, 113, 046804] which are good auxetic materials
   with a high NPR. The results show that the Young's modulus and Poisson's
   ratio of delta-P are all anisotropic. The NPR value along the grooved
   direction is up to -0.267, which is much higher than the recently
   reported 2D auxetic materials. The auxetic effect of delta-P originating
   from its puckered structure is robust and insensitive to the number of
   layers due to weak interlayer interactions. Moreover, delta-P possesses
   good flexibility because of its relatively small Young's modulus and
   high critical crack strain. If delta-P can be synthesized, these
   extraordinary properties would endow it with great potential in
   designing low dimensional electromechanical devices.}},

Journal = {{NANOSCALE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{128-133}},
Month = {{JAN 7}},
Abstract = {{Poisson's ratio is a fundamental property of a material which reflects
   the transverse strain response to the applied axial strain. Negative
   Poisson's ratio is allowed theoretically, but is rare in nature. Besides
   the discovery and tailoring of bulk auxetic materials, recent studies
   have also found a negative Poisson's ratio in nanomaterials, while their
   negative Poisson's ratio is mainly based on conventional rigid
   mechanical models as bulk auxetic materials. In this work, we report the
   existence of in-plane negative Poisson's ratio in a two-dimensional
   convex structure of newly synthesized semi-fluorinated graphene by using
   first-principles calculations. In addition, the sign of the Poisson's
   ratio can be tuned by the applied strain. Interestingly, we find that
   this unconventional negative Poisson's ratio cannot be explained by
   conventional rigid mechanical models but originates from the enhanced
   bond angle strain over the bond strain due to chemical
   functionalization. This new mechanism of auxetics extends the scope of
   auxetic nanomaterials and can serve as design principles for future
   discovery and design of new auxetic materials.}},

   under Large Uniaxial Loading}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{JAN 4}},
Abstract = {{Anisotropic materials form inside living tissue and are widely applied
   in engineered structures, where sophisticated structural and functional
   design principles are essential to employing these materials. This paper
   presents a candidate laminated open-cell framework, which is an
   anisotropic material that shows remarkable mechanical performance. Using
   additive manufacturing, artificial frameworks are fabricated by
   lamination of in-plane orthotropic microstructures made of elbowed beam
   and column members; this fabricated structure features orthogonal
   anisotropy in three-dimensional space. Uniaxial loading tests reveal
   strong auxeticity (high negative Poisson's ratios) in the out-of-plane
   direction, which is retained reproducibly up to the nonlinear elastic
   region, and is equal under tensile and compressive loading. Finite
   element simulations support the observed auxetic behaviors for a unit
   cell in the periodic framework, which preserve the theoretical elastic
   properties of an orthogonal solid. These findings open the possibility
   of conceptual materials design based on geometry.}},

   re-entrant honeycomb samples were manufactured using direct metal
   printing (DMP). Quasi-static uniaxial tension was executed in both X and
   Y direction. A Digital VIC-2D Image Correlation System was used to
   record the deformation history. Force and displacement were measured by
   ZWICK machine. The results show that loading direction has a significant
   effect on the mechanical properties and auxeticity of the tested
   structure. Re-entrant honeycomb under X-loading withstand lower force
   and has smaller magnitude of Poisson's ratio compared with that under

Abstract = {{For body-mounted sensor applications, the evolution of soft condensed
   matter sensor (SCMS) materials offer conformability andit enables
   mechanical compliance between the body surface and the sensing
   mechanism. A piezoresistive hybrid sensor and compliant metamaterial
   sub-structure provided a way to engineer sensor physical designs through
   modification of the mechanical properties of the compliant design. A
   piezoresistive fiber sensor was produced by combining a thermoplastic
   elastomer (TPE) matrix with Carbon Black (CB) particles in 1: 1 mass
   ratio. Feedstock was extruded in monofilament fiber form (diameter of
   300 microns), resulting in a highly stretchable sensor (strain sensor
   range up to 100\%) with linear resistance signal response.
   The soft condensed matter sensor was integrated into a hybrid design
   including a 3D printed metamaterial structure combined with a soft
   silicone. An auxetic unit cell was chosen (with negative Poisson's
   Ratio) in the design in order to combine with the soft silicon, which
   exhibits a high Poisson's Ratio. The hybrid sensor design was subjected
   to mechanical tensile testing up to 50\% strain (with gauge factor
   calculation for sensor performance), and then utilized for strain-based
   sensing applications on the body including gesture recognition and vital
   function monitoring including blood pulse-wave and breath monitoring. A
   10 gesture Natural User Interface (NUI) test protocol was utilized to
   show the effectiveness of a single wrist-mounted sensor to identify
   discrete gestures including finger and hand motions. These hand motions
   were chosen specifically for Human Computer Interaction (HCI)
   applications. The blood pulse-wave signal was monitored with the hand at
   rest, in a wrist-mounted. In addition different breathing patterns were
   investigated, including normal breathing and coughing, using a belt and
   chest-mounted configuration.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Marijuana use is common among HIV+ individuals, but few
   studies have examined long-term trends in prevalence and correlates of
   use. Methods: We evaluated trends (1984-2013) in the annual prevalence
   of current (past 6-month use) and daily (among current users) marijuana
   use and determined correlates of use among 2742 HIV-seropositive (HIV+)
   and 3172 HIV-seronegative (HIV-) men who have sex with men in the
   Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS). Poisson regression models were
   used to estimate prevalence ratios of marijuana use separately for the
   men who were enrolled before 2001 (early-cohort) and after 2001
   (late-cohort). Results: Over the 29 years of the study, the prevalence
   of current marijuana use declined significantly, whereas daily use among
   users increased among all men in the early and late-cohorts. A HIV+
   status was associated with higher prevalence of marijuana use among the
   men in the early-cohort (adjusted prevalence ratio {[}aPR] = 1.53, 95\%
   confidence interval {[}CI]:1.42, 1.64, p = <0.0001), but not in the men
   in the late-cohort (aPR = 0.90, 95\% CI: 0.79, 1.03, p = 0.1424).
   Alcohol use and cigarette smoking were being positively associated with
   marijuana use. Conclusions: Although the annual prevalence of current
   marijuana use decreased significantly over time in the MACS, daily use
   among users increased significantly. Further, among the HIV+ men, our
   study did not show clinically significant adverse effects of marijuana
   use on highly active antiretroviral therapy use, CD4(+) count, or HIV
   viral load.}},

Abstract = {{Materials and structures with auxetic and negative linear
   compressibility are of great potential to be used in many applications
   because of their uncommon mechanical deformation features. However,
   their design and manufacture are less studied as compared to other
   mechanical properties. The aim of this research is to explore several
   new approaches relating to the design and fabrication of cellular
   materials and structures with these two uncommon features. For most
   cellular materials and structures, these uncommon properties only exist
   for a limited geometric range. To begin with, the geometric limit of the
   microstructure of a 2D elastomer-based auxetic material was identified
   numerically through large deformation analysis. Within the geometric
   limits, a tuning method was developed further to control their
   mechanical properties with prescribed performance constraints. A
   metallic auxetic metamaterial was used as an example of the developed
   tuning approach, and its effectiveness was validated by experimental
   results with specimens manufactured using 3D printing technique. To
   reduce the manufacturing cost using 3D printing, a composite approach
   was proposed to manufacture these metamaterials. Several new cellular
   composite structures with negative linear compressibility composite
   structures were used as examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
   design approach. The test samples were manufactured using the
   traditional composite method with low cost. These investigations
   mentioned above have clearly demonstrated the feasibility of designing
   and manufacturing of mechanical metamaterials using the presented
   approaches and laid the foundation for the expansion of their potential
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{A new generalized cross-property relation is proposed for predicting the
   relative elastic moduli (Young's modulus, shear modulus, bulk modulus)
   from the relative conductivities (thermal or electrical) of isotropic
   porous materials with spheroidal pores. Using this
   cross-property-relation it is possible to estimate the elastic moduli
   when the conductivites are known (either from real-world measurements or
   from numerical calculations on digital microstructures) and vice versa.
   This generalized cross-property relation contains the case of spherical
   or isometric pores as a special case, but is sufficiently general to
   account for the properties of materials with strongly anisometric pores,
   i.e. randomly orientated prolate and oblate pores, including the extreme
   cases of pore channels or microcracks. The exponent of this
   cross-property relation is shown in graphical form and for future
   reference with respect to practical applications its numerical values
   are listed in tabular form as a function of the pore aspect ratio and
   the Poisson ratio of the solid.}},

Abstract = {{A device for supporting soft rock masses combined with a constant
   resistance structure characterized by constant resistance and large
   deformation at the end of a steel bar, known as the constant resistance
   and large deformation (CRLD) bolt, has recently been developed to
   counteract soft rock swelling that often occurs during deep mining. In
   order to further study the mechanical properties of the CRLD bolt, we
   investigated its mechanical properties by comparison with the
   conventional strength bolt (rebar) using static pull tests on many
   aspects, including supporting capacity, elongation, radial deformation,
   and energy absorption. The tests verified that the mechanical defects of
   the rebar, which include the decrease of bolt diameter, reduction of
   supporting capacity, and emergence and evolution of fracture until
   failure during the whole pull process, were caused by the Poisson's
   ratio effect. Due to the special structure set on the CRLD bolt, the
   bolt presents a seemingly unusual phenomenon of the negative Poisson's
   ratio effect, i.e., the diameter of the constant resistance structure
   increases while under-pulling. It is the very effect that ensures the
   extraordinary mechanical properties, including high resistance, large
   elongation, and strong energy absorption. According to the comparison
   and analysis of numerical simulation and field test, we can conclude
   that the CRLD bolt works better than the rebar bolt.}},

   combining the orientations of the convex of the surfaces, four different
   models were presented. The mechanical properties of the models were
   studied by numerical analysis. The techniques of the representative

   analysis. Little differences in the mechanical properties between the
   models with opposite convex orientations are found. The simulation
   results showed that the auxetic responses of the unit cell are universal
   at variant the geometric variables and parent material Poisson's ratios.

Abstract = {{The surge of interest in so-called ``designer materials{''} during the
   last few years together with recent advances in additive manufacturing
   (3D printing) techniques that enable fabrication of materials with
   arbitrarily complex nano/micro-architecture have attracted increasing
   attention to the concept of mechanical metamaterials. Owing to their
   rationally designed nano/micro-architecture, mechanical metamaterials
   exhibit unusual properties at the macro-scale. These unusual mechanical
   properties could be exploited for the development of materials with
   advanced functionalities, with applications in soft robotics,
   biomedicine, soft electronics, acoustic cloaking, etc. Auxetic
   mechanical metamaterials are identified by a negative Poisson's ratio
   and are perhaps the most widely studied type of mechanical
   metamaterials. Similar to other types of mechanical metamaterials, the
   negative Poisson's ratio of auxetics is generally a direct consequence
   of the topology of their nano/micro-architecture. This paper therefore
   focuses on the topology-property relationship in three main classes of
   auxetic metamaterials, namely re-entrant, chiral, and rotating (semi-)
   rigid structures. While the deformation mechanisms in the
   above-mentioned types of structures and their relationship with the
   large-scale mechanical properties receive most attention, the emerging
   concepts in design of auxetics such as the use of instability in soft
   matter and origamibased structures are discussed as well. Furthermore,
   the data available in the literature regarding the elastic properties of
   auxetic mechanical metamaterials are systematically analyzed to identify
   the spread of Young's modulus-Poisson's ratio duos achieved in the
   auxetic materials developed to date.}},

Abstract = {{Interest to crash response of vehicle parts is increasing closely
   related with their importance for safety of passengers. In low velocity
   crash case, integration of foams to tubular systems shows positive
   effect on the performance. While foams are classified stochastic micro
   lattice structures, recently, dynamic behaviour of lattices in macro
   size are being researched with 3D printing technique. In addition to
   conventional macro lattices showing positive Poisson's ratio have good
   energy absorbing capabilities, with only geometrical modification macro
   lattices with negative Poisson's ratio can be created and have better
   energy absorbing capability than conventional ones. In this study, in
   different dimensions, blocks of anti-tetrachiral metallic lattices
   exhibiting negative Poisson's ratio, are modelled. Crushing behaviour of
   them is investigated under low-velocity impact using explicit and
   implicit FEA tools. With the results of this study, suitable
   width-lenght ratio of macro level anisotropic anti-tetrachiral lattices
   will be able to classified. In addition to that, force-time behaviour in
   different impact velocities will be able to understood to use in not
   only tubular systems but also in sandwich structures as core part.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this paper is to present the results of experimental
   investigations concerning a mechanical response of 2D regular cellular
   structures with different topologies in an aspect of crashworthiness
   behaviour. Developed by the authors, genuine topologies of 2D regular
   cellular structures were built with using Fused Deposition Modelling
   (FDM) additive manufacturing method and afterwards they were subjected
   to uniaxial compression tests. A wide range of structure topologies made
   from three commercially available polymeric materials -ABSplus, Nylon12
   and PC-10 were examined during carried out investigations. One of the
   commercially available CAD systems was used to define proposed structure
   topologies. It was found that the energy absorption depends on the
   elasticity of a structure, where high strength geometries represent
   linear crashworthiness behaviour with bending and cracking while
   flexible ones present exponential increase of deformation force due to
   densification of the structure.}},

   microstructure characteristics of polyvinyl alcohol hydrogel with
   three-dimension porous structure, and compared to the similar hexagonal
   honeycomb configuration, a kind of novel Centre symmetric honeycomb
   structure with three sorts of shapes, stack patterns evaluated is
   constructed. The results show that the entire structure without filling
   with honeycombs has the negative Poisson's ratio ignoring various
   configuration parameters. The entire structure filling with honeycombs,
   the changes of the honeycombs thickness, three different arrange-square,
   vertical and transverse deformation modes, and the configuration
   parameters make the entire unit cell possess the negative Poisson's
   ratio. When the numerical value of the unit cell thickness is less than
   5 mu m and the honeycombs in the novel Centre symmetric structure take
   arrange-square shapes, if filling with circular honeycombs, the entire
   structure should choose the bigger values of the structure parameters
   R-2,theta(1) and L-2, the novel Centre symmetric honeycomb structure
   possess the negative Poisson's ratio; if filling with hexagonal
   honeycombs, the entire structure should choose the smaller values of the

Abstract = {{A mechanism of instability of geomaterials in compression is proposed
   based on the phenomenon of transitional negative stiffness associated
   with the process of crack/fracture formation. This phenomenon acts only
   for a very short time as the fracture is being formed. The negative
   stiffness cracks increase the Poisson's ratio and thus are capable of
   making nearly incompressible material elastically unstable. A
   geomaterial can reach the limiting value of the incremental Poisson's
   ratio due to dilatancy observed in compression. While dilatancy is a
   non-linear phenomenon, incrementally, at the time of fracture formation
   it is elastic and hence can be made unstable by the transitional
   negative stiffness.}},

Abstract = {{Various carbon nanostructures and their properties are of great interest
   nowadays. It is well known that graphene has unique mechanical
   properties among other carbon nanomaterials and at some conditions
   graphene can show auxetic behavior which means that it can have negative
   Poisson's ratio. From the consideration of the mechanical properties of
   graphene and 3D carbon-based nanomaterials, several groups of promising
   candidates to be auxetics can be mentioned. In this study, mechanical
   properties of strained graphene and different diamond-like
   three-dimensional structures based on carbon nanotubes (tubulanes) are
   investigated by molecular dynamics method. It is shown that graphene has
   negative Poisson's ratio under homogeneous tensile strain above 0.12. It
   is found that three of the studied tubulanes have negative Poisson's
   ratio.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a computational framework for computational
   design and additive manufacturing of spatial free-form periodic
   metasurfaces. The proposed scheme rests on the level-set based topology
   approach and the conformal mapping theory. A 2D unit cell of
   metamaterial with tailored effective properties is created using the
   level-set based topology optimization method. The achieved unit cell is
   further mapped to the 3D quad meshes on a free-form surface by applying
   the conformal mapping method which can preserve the local shape and
   angle when mapping the 2D design to a 3D surface. The proposed level-set
   based optimization methods not only can act as a motivator for design
   synthesis, but also can be seamlessly hooked with additive manufacturing
   with no need of CAD reconstructions. The proposed computational
   framework provides a solution to increasing applications involving
   innovative metamaterial designs on free-form surfaces in different
   fields of interest. The performance of the proposed scheme is
   illustrated through a benchmark example where a negative-Poisson's-ratio
   unit cell pattern is mapped to a 3D human face and fabricated through
   additive manufacturing.}},

   analysis and conceptual design of mechanical meta materials. The
   methodology is inspired by recent advances in the insightful syntheiis
   of compliant mechanisms by visualizing a kinetostatic field of forces
   that flow through the mechanism geometry. The framework relates load
   flow behavior in the microstructure geometry to the global behavior of
   the materials, such as auxetic (negative poisson's ratio), high bulk
   modulus, and high shear modulus. This understanding is used to
   synthesize and demonstrate novel planar microstructures that exhibit
   negative poisson's ratio behavior. Furthermore, the paper identifies
   three unique classes of qualitative design problems for planar
   mechanical microstructures that can be potentially solved using this
   framework.}},

Abstract = {{This paper mainly concentrates on the design and analysis of the annulus
   with zero thermal expansion coefficient (ZTE) aiming to solve the heat
   generation and deformation in high speed bearing. First, a fork-like
   lattice cell inspired by the basic triangular cell is put forward and
   further applied to construct an annulus. The stretch-dominated lattice
   cell utilizes the Poisson's contraction effect to achieve the tailorable
   thermal expansion coefficient (CTE). The thermal behaviors differences
   between the continuous interfaces and lattice cells will lead to the
   internal stress. Thus, the CTE of the annulus consisting of the lattice
   cell can be tailored to zero even negative values through the offset
   between the thermal-strain and force-strain. Then a theoretical model is
   established with some appropriate assumptions to reveal the quantitative
   relations among the geometrical parameters, material properties and
   equivalent CTEs thoroughly. The prerequisites for realizing a zero CTE
   are further derived in terms of material limitations and geometric
   constraints. Finally FEA method is implemented to verb and analyze the
   thermal behaviors of annulus. The proposed annulus design characterized
   by the CTE tunability, structure efficiency and continuous interfaces is
   hopefully to be applied in the high speed bearings, adapters between the
   shaft and collar and fastener screws.}},

Journal = {{IEEE JOURNAL OF TRANSLATIONAL ENGINEERING IN HEALTH AND MEDICINE-JTEHM}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{5}},
Abstract = {{The design and fabrication of a wound healing device for chronic wounds,
   with multiple functions for controlled drug delivery and exudate
   removal, has been described in this paper. The structural features have
   been machined and modified through laser cutting in a biocompatible
   polymer cast. Miniaturized versions of electronically actuated
   (lead-screw and pulley) mechanisms are used for the specific purpose of
   controlled drug delivery. These mechanisms have been studied and tested,
   being controlled through a microcontroller setup. An auxetic polymeric
   barrier membrane has been used for restricting the drug quantities
   administered. Drug delivery mechanisms are powered wirelessly, through
   an external, active RF component; this communicates with a passive
   component that is buried inside the wound healing device. The exudate
   removal efficiency of the device has been assessed through several
   simple tests using simulated wound exudate. It has been found that
   reasonably precise quantities of drug dosages to be administered to the
   wound site can be controlled through both drug delivery mechanisms;
   however, the lead-screw mechanism provides a better control of auxetic
   barrier membrane actuation and hence controlled drug delivery. We
   propose that this device can have potential clinical significance in
   controlled drug delivery and exudate removal in the management of
   chronic wounds.}},

Abstract = {{This manuscript investigates the flexural wave propagation behavior of a
   foldable metamaterial structure. Origami inspired foldable structures
   are making inroads into many engineering applications-deployable solar
   cell arrays, foldable telescope lenses, foldable automotive airbags, to
   name a few; driven primarily by some of the remarkable mechanical
   properties (high stiffness, negative Poisson's ratio, bistability etc.)
   of these structures. The chief motivation of this research is a
   comprehensive analysis of flexural wave propagation in such foldable
   structures. The repeating unit cell of the structure consists of an
   Euler-Bernoulli beam and a torsion spring. Transfer Matrix (TM) method
   is used to analyze the vibration attenuation properties of the structure
   and it is shown that the structure exhibits bandgap behavior. The
   obtained bandgaps are validated using Finite Element Analysis (FEA).
   Using the characteristic equation of the transfer matrix, we derive a
   transcendental equation for the bandgap edge frequencies. We show that
   for the nth band gap, the second band edge frequency is always equal to
   the natural frequency of the nth modeshape of the constituent beam under
   the simply supported condition. This frequency, therefore, is
   independent of the torsion spring constant. In addition, a detailed
   parametric study of the variation in band edge frequencies when the
   geometric and material parameters of the structure (Young's modulus of
   beam, torsional spring constant, width and thickness of beam etc.) are
   varied is conducted. It is concluded that the ratio of flexural rigidity
   of the beam to the torsion spring constant (EI/k(t)) is an important
   parameter affecting the width of the bandgap. For low values of the
   ratio, i.e., low beam flexural rigidity and high torsional stiffness,
   the first band edge frequency is almost equal to the second band edge
   and, effectively, no bandgap exists. As the stiffness ratio increases,
   i.e. high flexural rigidity (El of the beam) and low torsional stiffness
   k(t), the first band edge frequency assumes progressively lower values
   relative to the second band edge and we obtain a relatively large
   bandgap over which no flexural waves propagate. This has important
   ramifications for the design of foldable metamaterial structures}},

Abstract = {{Objectives The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of shift
   work and long working hours in midlife on the risk of dementia in old
   age.
   Methods The present study comprised 4766 participants from the
   Copenhagen Male Study. We used information on shift work (collected in
   1970-1971 and 1985-1986), long working hours defined as >45 hours per
   week (collected in 1970-1971), socioeconomic status, sleep, stress, and
   cardiovascular risk factors. Information about dementia diagnoses was
   obtained from registers. Participants were followed until 2014 (mean
   length of follow-up was 17.8 years). We employed Poisson regression for
   the survival analyses and estimated incidence rate ratios (IRR) and
   their 95\% confidence intervals (CI).
   Results We found no statistically significant association between shift
   work (IRR 0.86, 95\% CI 0.70-1.05) or long working hours (IRR 0.97, 95\%
   CI 0.79-1.19) and dementia. Adjustment for potential confounders and
   mediators did not change the estimates. Working shifts at both time
   points of exposure assessment was not associated with a higher incidence
   of dementia compared with non-shift workers at both time points (IRR
   0.99, 95\% CI 0.69-1.42). The lowest incidence of dementia was observed
   among participants who reported shift work at one time point (only in
   1985-1986: IRR 0.44, 95\% CI 0.16-1.23 and only in 1970-1971: IRR 0.58,
   95\% CI 0.31-1.11).
   Conclusion We did not find positive evidence of an association between
   shift work or long working hours and the incidence of dementia, but the
   negative findings may reflect the crude assessment of shift work and
   long working hours, which is a major limitation of the present study.}},

Abstract = {{We have studied the electroosmotic flow (EOF) and its effect through a
   polyelectrolyte coated conical nanopore. The nanopore wall bears a
   uniform negative surface charge while charged density of the
   polyelectrolyte layer (PEL) bears positive charge. The degree of
   softness in the PEL is mainly affects the hydrodynamic field inside the
   nanopore while ionic current is not affected significantly by flow
   field. The characteristic of electrokinetic flow is based on the
   nonlinear Nernst-Planck equations for the ion transport coupled with the
   Brinkman extended Navier-Stokes equations for fluid flow and the Poisson
   equation for induced electric potential. The coupled set of governing
   nonlinear equations for fluid flow and ionic species concentration are
   solved through a finite volume method on a staggered grid system. A
   numerical method based on the pressure correction iterative algorithm is
   adopted to compute the flow field. This study investigated the
   importance of the bulk concentration of the electrolyte, the geometries
   of the nanopore and both the thickness and the charged density of PEL on
   the electrokinetic ion and fluid transport. The ratio of the
   cross-sectional average flow of the present model with plane cylindrical
   channel, decreases with the increase of the scaled charge density of PEL
   for both low and high ionic concentration cases when softness parameter
   and thickness of PEL are fixed. The average flow rate decreases with the
   increase of the PEL sealed charge density in both low and high ionic
   concentration cases for fixed PEL thickness. The increase of nanopore
   radius increases the cross sectional averaged flow for fixed scaled
   charged density and PEL thickness. The average flow rate decreases with
   the increase of the PEL thickness for fixed charged density of PEL. The
   critical value of scaled charge density of PEL is defined for which
   there is no flow through the nanopore. The average current density
   increases with the increase of applied electric field for different
   charged density of PEL. But there is no different of average current
   density for different charge density of PEL in high ionic concentration
   cases.}},

   the Auxetic Kevlar (R) reinforced composites showed a significant
   reduction in damaged area compared to woven counterpart. On the other

Abstract = {{One of the most important goal of modern material science is designing
   structures which exhibit appropriate properties. These properties can be
   obtained by optimization methods which often use numerical calculations
   e.g. finite element method (FEM). This paper shows the results of
   topological optimization which is used to obtain the greatest possible
   negative Poisson's ratio of the two-phase composite. The shape is
   anti-tetra-chiral two-dimensional unit cell of the whole lattice
   structure which has negative Poisson's ratio when it is built of one
   solid material. Two phase used in optimization are two solid materials
   with positive Poisson's ratio and Young's modulus. Distribution of
   reinforcement hard material inside soft matrix material in
   anti-tetra-chiral domain influenced mechanical properties of structure.
   The calculations shows that the resultant structure has negative
   Poisson's ratio even eight times smaller than homogenous anti-tetra
   chiral structure made of classic one material. In the analysis FEM is
   connected with algorithm Method of Moving Asymptote (MMA). The results
   of materials' properties parameters are described and calculated by
   means of shape interpolation scheme - Solid Isotropic Material with
   Penalization (SIMP) method.}},

Journal = {{AMERICAN STATISTICIAN}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{71}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{191-201}},
Abstract = {{The classical birthday problem considers the probability that at least
   two people in a group of size N share the same birthday. The inverse
   birthday problem considers the estimation of the size N of a group given
   the number of different birthdays in the group. In practice, this
   problem is analogous to estimating the size of a population from
   occurrence data only. The inverse problem can be solved via two simple
   approaches including the method of moments for a multinominal model and
   the maximum likelihood estimate of a Poisson model, which we present in
   this study. We investigate properties of both methods and show that they
   can yield asymptotically equivalent Wald-type interval estimators.
   Moreover, we show that these methods estimate a lower bound for the
   population size when birth rates are nonhomogenous or individuals in the
   population are aggregated. A simulation study was conducted to evaluate
   the performance of the point estimates arising from the two approaches
   and to compare the performance of seven interval estimators, including
   likelihood ratio and log-transformation methods. We illustrate the
   utility of these methods by estimating: (1) the abundance of tree
   species over a 50-hectare forest plot, (2) the number of Chlamydia
   infections when only the number of different birthdays of the patients
   is known, and (3) the number of rainy days when the number of rainy
   weeks is known. Supplementary materials for this article are available

Title = {{Validation of algorithms to determine incidence of Hirschsprung disease
   in Ontario, Canada: a population-based study using health administrative
   data}},
Journal = {{CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{9}},
Abstract = {{Objective: Incidence rates of Hirschsprung disease (HD) vary by
   geographical region, yet no recent population-based estimate exists for
   Canada. The objective of our study was to validate and use health
   administrative data from Ontario, Canada to describe trends in incidence
   of HD between 1991 and 2013.
   Study design: To identify children with HD we tested algorithms
   consisting of a combination of diagnostic, procedural, and intervention
   codes against the reference standard of abstracted clinical charts from
   a tertiary pediatric hospital. The algorithm with the highest positive
   predictive value (PPV) that could maintain high sensitivity was applied
   to health administrative data from April 31, 1991 to March 31, 2014
   (fiscal years 1991-2013) to determine annual incidence. Temporal trends
   were evaluated using Poisson regression, controlling for sex as a
   covariate.
   Results: The selected algorithm was highly sensitive (93.5\%) and
   specific (>99.9\%) with excellent predictive abilities (PPV 89.6\% and
   negative predictive value >99.9\%). Using the algorithm, a total of 679
   patients diagnosed with HD were identified in Ontario between 1991 and
   2013. The overall incidence during this time was 2.05 per 10,000 live
   births (or 1 in 4,868 live births). The incidence did not change
   significantly over time (odds ratio 0.998, 95\% confidence interval
   0.983-1.013, p = 0.80).
   Conclusion: Ontario health administrative data can be used to accurately
   identify cases of HD and describe trends in incidence. There has not
   been a significant change in HD incidence over time in Ontario between
   1991 and 2013.}},

Abstract = {{The subject of the study are the models based on digital
   microstructures, in particular open-cell metallic foams characterized
   with the skeleton formed of convex or re-entrant cells. Recently, the
   auxetic materials revealing negative Poisson's ratio have attracted
   increasing attention in the context of modern materials applications. Up
   to date, the research of auxetics is mainly concentrating on the cell
   structure design and the analysis of quasi-static response. The dynamic
   properties of such materials are less known. Impact compressions of the
   two kind of foams under high-velocity are numerically analyzed. To
   simulate the deformation processes the finite element program ABAOUS is
   used. The computer tomography makes the basis for the formulation of
   computational model of virtual foam and the finite element
   discretization of the skeleton. For numerical simulations the
   constitutive elasto-viscoplasticity model is applied that defines the
   dynamic behavior of oxygen-free high conductivity (OFHC) Cu using the
   experimental data reported in the literature. The numerical predictions
   of crushing force for velocity 50 and 300 m/s are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this work was to propose a method for dynamic testing
   of Poisson's ratio of dimension lumber. Based on the first-order bending
   mode shape of cantilever slab, Sitka Spruce was selected as research
   object using instruments including four-channel dynamic resistance
   strain gauge and CRAS vibration and a set of collection-analysis system
   for dynamic signal. Free vibration of cantilever specimen of Sitka
   Spruce and mild steel can be stimulated by knocking, and the fundamental
   vibration should be reserved by filtering processing. Additionally,
   decaying curve of oscillatory waves for transverse and longitudinal
   strain of fundamental vibration should also be recorded and displayed.
   Obtained from the positive (negative) peak in oscillatory wave curve for
   transverse strain, Poisson's ratios along grain and across grain on
   radial section and that across grain on transverse section of Sitka
   Spruce specimens were measured. Then measured results were applied to
   analyse the accuracy of calculated modulus of elasticity obtained by
   plugging the first-order bending frequency measured by cantilever slab
   into equation of cantilever beam, and this method is proved to be robust
   and accurate. The method based on first-order bending mode shape of
   cantilever slab to measure dimension lumber Poisson's ratio is efficient
   and simple, with good repeatability and high accuracy. Besides, the same
   method was also applied to test Poisson's ratio of mild steel to
   validate the correctness of the method on wood. It is observed that the
   positive (negative) peak in oscillatory wave curve for transverse strain
   is corresponding to that for longitudinal strain, meaning that the phase
   difference, between oscillatory wave curves for transverse strain and
   longitudinal strain, is 180 degrees, or that transverse strain and
   longitudinal strain are reversed. The average value should be taken
   after calculating the ratios between peak-to-peak values read from the
   first channel and the second channel in oscillatory wave curve. The
   results show that the Poisson's ratio along grain of Sitka Spruce
   specimen is one order higher than that across grain, which indicates the
   anisotropy of wood. The test results validated that the elastic modulus
   of the lumber can be accurately derived by substituting the first-order
   fixed frequency, measured with the cantilever plate of Sitka Spruce
   specimen, into the cantilever theoretical equation. This research can
   provide reference to practical measurement and assessment of mechanical
   properties of wood and steel.}},

Journal = {{ENGINEERING COMPUTATIONS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1572-1597}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - This paper aims to present the development of a numerical
   continuum-discrete approach for computing the sensitivity of the waves
   propagating in periodic composite structures. The work can be directly
   used for evaluating the sensitivity of the structural dynamic
   performance with respect to geometric and layering structural
   modifications.
   Design/methodology/approach - A structure of arbitrary layering and
   geometric complexity is modelled using solid finite element (FE). A
   generic expression for computing the variation of the mass and the
   stiffness matrices of the structure with respect to the material and
   geometric characteristics is hereby given. The sensitivity of the
   structural wave properties can thus be numerically determined by
   computing the variability of the corresponding eigenvalues for the
   resulting eigenproblem. The exhibited approach is validated against the
   finite difference method as well as analytical results.
   Findings - An intense wavenumber dependence is observed for the
   sensitivity results of a sandwich structure. This exhibits the
   importance and potential of the presented tool with regard to the
   optimization of layered structures for specific applications. The model
   can also be used for computing the effect of the inclusion of smart
   layers such as auxetics and piezoelectrics.
   Originality/value - The paper presents the first continuum-discrete
   approach specifically developed for accurately and efficiently computing
   the sensitivity of the wave propagation data for periodic composite
   structures irrespective of their size. The considered structure can be
   of arbitrary layering and material characteristics as FEmodelling is
   used.}},

   incorporates influence of the auxeticity (negative Poisson ratio) of the
   material into elastic responses of the variable thickness functionally

   to general non-uniform normal and shear tractions. The mentioned
   material and loading complexities have not been investigated before and
   consequently, the presented comprehensive results are quite new. The
   proposed unified formulation is developed using the principle of minimum
   total potential energy and solved using Taylor's transform, for some
   combinations of the simply supported, clamped and free edge conditions.
   Accuracy of results of the proposed unified solution is verified by
   results of the three-dimensional theory of elasticity extracted from the
   ABAQUS finite element analysis code. Finally, a comprehensive parametric
   study including evaluation of individual/simultaneous effects of the
   auxeticity, structure configuration, shear/normal traction, thickness

Abstract = {{The issue of energy absorption during impact is present in various
   aspects of life. The possibility of dissipating unwanted energy gives
   huge opportunities for a variety applications such as helmets, car
   bumpers, smart body armours and protective pads. Nevertheless, there are
   numerous technical problems with achieving a compromise between good
   energy absorption efficiency and other important properties such as
   flexibility, weight and thickness. The article describes a study of
   composite structures based on shear thickening fluids (STF) and auxetic
   foams. The composites are developed as a potential component of products
   with high energy absorbing efficiency. The study reports on the
   rheological behavior of STF and force absorbing properties of the
   manufactured composites. In the experiment, two types of STF and eleven
   types of auxetic foams were used. Force absorbing tests for the produced
   samples were performed by dropping an impactor with the energy of 5 J.
   It was proved that the addition of STF to the auxetic foams increases
   the force absorbing efficiency.}},

Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{Included in Statistics Canada's largest geographical ``peer group,''
   London, Ontario is typical of many midsize Canadian cities. A local
   health forum identified community acceptance and homophobia as key
   factors impacting LGBTQ health; we studied these with regard to
   HIV-related sexual risk in gay and bisexual men. Survey data were
   collected from 201 gay and bisexual men in Middlesex-London, Ontario;
   173 reported their HIV status as negative/unknown and were included in
   this analysis. Unadjusted and adjusted prevalence risk ratios (PRRs)
   were modelled using modified Poisson regression. First, a model was fit
   for non-modifiable sociodemographic and background factors. Community
   factors were then added: social support; internalized homonegativity;
   perceptions of community acceptance of people like oneself (based on
   orientation, racialization, gender identity). Older age was associated
   with decreased risk; other sociodemographic and background factors were
   not. For each 10-year increase in age, prevalence of high-risk sex
   decreased by 24\% (PRR = 0.76; 95\% CI: 0.60, 0.95). Controlling for
   age, we found an interaction between perception of broader community
   acceptance and gay community acceptance of people like oneself. As
   broader community acceptance increased, high-risk sex decreased;
   however, this effect varied depending upon perceptions of gay community
   acceptance, with men feeling most accepted within the gay community
   having the smallest reductions in high-risk sex. This interaction raises
   a series of questions. Among these: How do community norms and
   availability of partners shape sexual risk-taking? Are conventional
   ``contextualized'' measures of sexual risk sufficient, or do they miss
   important risk-mitigation strategies used within gay communities?}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ECONOMICS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{44}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{816-830}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of trade
   policy pertaining to imported processed food on poorer health outcomes
   of people's in the Pacific island countries.
   Design/methodology/approach - Using an extended gravity model, the paper
   adopts the OLS time varying importer/exporter effects method and a
   Pseudo Poisson maximum likelihood estimator on a cross-sectional panel
   data set of 215 countries and territories. The estimation procedure
   controlled for 11 Pacific island countries between 2003 and 2013.
   Findings - The empirical findings revealed a positive and statistically
   significant relationship between trade liberalisation and increased
   processed food imports in the Pacific island countries. The findings
   also reveal that the access ratio (kg/person) to selected imported
   processed food high in salt to Pacific island countries has increased
   significantly over time.
   Originality/value - While much of the trade literature reveals positive
   impact of trade on the prosperity of nations, this study makes a new
   contribution in terms of supporting a negative impact of trade
   liberalisation policy on people's health in small island developing
   states.}},

Abstract = {{Mixing of lithographically processable materials with functional
   additives is one of the widely explored possibilities in the field of
   the laser material processing. In this work we investigate how gold
   nanoparticles (Au NP) influence the photosensitivity of S Z2080 and
   PEG-DA-700 - two materials commonly used in femtosecond 3D direct laser
   writing (DLW). Experimental study of achieved line widths as well as
   comparison of polymerization/optical damage threshold intensities
   allowed quantitatively define how Au NP change polymers' response to
   ultrafast laser pulses. Light-material and plasmonic interaction
   theories are applied to explain this phenomena. Furthermore, we
   demonstrate how nanoprecision achieved with DLW can be employed to
   create functional micromechanical structures, namely negative Poisson
   coefficient metamaterial and chain-mail like flexible structure. Later
   one is produced using combination of linear stages and galvanoscanners,
   demonstrating nearly unlimited working area (in range of similar to cm)
   and very high translation velocity (similar to mm/s) thus proving that
   DLW can be considered an industrial grade technology.}},

Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},

Abstract = {{The anisotropy strain effects on black phosphorus and the IV-VI
   monolayer analogues have been widely investigated due to their potential
   applications in solar energy conversion and opto-electronics. Although
   the coupling effects of strain on structural and electronic properties
   might be important in flexible monolayer materials they were neglected
   in most cases. In this paper, we investigated the strain effect on the
   properties of SnS via strain induced potential energy surface and band
   profiles. Our firstprinciples calculations predict different types of
   low-dimensional phases under ununiformed biaxial strain of 19.09 N
   m(-1), with either strain induced semiconductor-metal transitions,
   indirect-direct bandgap transitions or negative Poisson's ratio. Our
   calculations suggest a new method to illuminate the strain effect beyond
   the axis direction, demonstrating that the coupling of strain effect
   plays an important role in the search for new properties for flexible
   materials and cannot be neglected.}},

Journal = {{CARIES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{51}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{198-208}},
Abstract = {{Marginalized zero-inflated count regression models have recently been
   introduced for the statistical analysis of dental caries indices and
   other zero-inflated count data as alternatives to traditional
   zero-inflated and hurdle models. Unlike the standard approaches, the
   marginalized models directly estimate overall exposure or treatment
   effects by relating covariates to the marginal mean count. This article
   discusses model interpretation and model class choice according to the
   research question being addressed in caries research. Two data sets, one
   consisting of fictional dmft counts in 2 groups and the other on DMFS
   among schoolchildren from a randomized clinical trial comparing 3
   toothpaste formulations to prevent incident dental caries, are analyzed
   with negative binomial hurdle, zero-inflated negative binomial, and
   marginalized zero-inflated negative binomial models. In the first
   example, estimates of treatment effects vary according to the type of
   incidence rate ratio (IRR) estimated by the model. Estimates of IRRs in
   the analysis of the randomized clinical trial were similar despite their
   distinctive interpretations. The choice of statistical model class
   should match the study's purpose, while accounting for the broad decline
   in children's caries experience, such that dmft and DMFS indices more
   frequently generate zero counts. Marginalized (marginal mean) models for
   zero-inflated count data should be considered for direct assessment of
   exposure effects on the marginal mean dental caries count in the
   presence of high frequencies of zero counts. (C) 2017 S. Karger AG,

Title = {{Marginal zero-inflated regression models for count data}},

Abstract = {{Data sets with excess zeroes are frequently analyzed in many
   disciplines. A common framework used to analyze such data is the
   zero-inflated (ZI) regression model. It mixes a degenerate distribution
   with point mass at zero with a non-degenerate distribution. The
   estimates from ZI models quantify the effects of covariates on the means
   of latent random variables, which are often not the quantities of
   primary interest. Recently, marginal zero-inflated Poisson (MZIP; Long
   etal. {[}A marginalized zero-inflated Poisson regression model with
   overall exposure effects. Stat. Med. 33 (2014), pp.5151-5165]) and
   negative binomial (MZINB; Preisser et al., 2016) models have been
   introduced that model the mean response directly. These models yield
   covariate effects that have simple interpretations that are, for many
   applications, more appealing than those available from ZI regression.
   This paper outlines a general framework for marginal zero-inflated
   models where the latent distribution is a member of the exponential
   dispersion family, focusing on common distributions for count data. In
   particular, our discussion includes the marginal zero-inflated binomial
   (MZIB) model, which has not been discussed previously. The details of
   maximum likelihood estimation via the EM algorithm are presented and the
   properties of the estimators as well as Wald and likelihood ratio-based
   inference are examined via simulation. Two examples presented illustrate
   the advantages of MZIP, MZINB, and MZIB models for practical data
   analysis.}},

Abstract = {{The properties of cellular materials depend as much on their
   architecture as on their composition. Auxetic materials are a novel
   class of mechanical metamaterials which exhibit an interesting property
   of negative Poisson's ratio by virtue of their architecture rather than
   composition. One of their most interesting aspects is their improved
   indentation resistance, impact resistance and fracture toughness. Thus,
   they have potential applications in wearable impact protection. The
   classical re-entrant structure has been a focus of research for many
   years because of its well established auxetic behaviour. However, the
   stiff re-entrant corners, buckling of struts, less strain sensitivity
   and limited cellular stiffness limit its applications in wearable impact
   protection devices. In this work, multi-material cellular designs are
   proposed which have the capability to fulfill the requirements for
   wearable impact protection devices. With the advancements in 3D
   printing, multi-material cellular designs can be realized in practice.
   Using Finite Elements approach, two-material and multi material cellular
   designs are investigated. It was observed that introduction of material
   gradient/distribution in the cell provides a means to tailor auxetic
   behaviour, cellular stiffness and strain-sensitivity as per the specific
   requirement. The results will lead to a better understanding of
   tailoring auxeticity in cellular materials and will aid in the design of
   auxetic wearable impact protection devices which rely on auxeticity
   gradients and variable auxeticity as well.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials, known as materials with negative Poisson's ratio
   (NPR), have many promising application areas. However, there are only
   few natural and man-made materials such as certain living bone tissues,
   certain rocks and minerals, polymeric honeycombs, microporous
   polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), foams, and carbon-fiber-reinforced epoxy
   composite laminate panels that possess this property.
   In recent years, various auxetic material structures have been designed
   and fabricated for diverse applications that utilized normal materials
   which follow Hooke's law but still show the NPR properties. One of the
   applications is body protection pads that are comfortable to wear and
   effective in protecting body parts by reducing impact force and
   preventing injuries in high-risk individuals such as elderly people,
   industry workers, law enforcement and military personnel, and sports
   players. It is important to develop new body protectors that best
   combine each individual's requirements for wearing comfort (flexible,
   light-weight), ease of fitting (customized), ensured protection, and
   cost-effectiveness. The protection pad would be made from multilayer
   materials and adaptive structures to achieve unique multifunctional
   properties such as high hardness, impact toughness, light weight, and
   excellent shock absorption suitable for the needs.
   This paper reports an integrated theoretical, computational (finite
   element analysis), and experimental investigation conducted for typical
   auxetic polymeric materials that exhibit negative Poisson's ratio (NPR)
   effect: Parametric 3D CAD models of auxetic polymeric structures such as
   re-entrant hexagonal cells and arrowhead were developed. Then, key
   structural characteristics of protectors were evaluated through static
   analyses of FEA models. In addition, impact/shock analyses were
   conducted through dynamic analyses of FEA models to validate the results
   obtained from the static analyses. Particularly, an advanced additive
   manufacturing (3D printing) technique was used to build prototypes of
   the auxetic polymeric structures. Specifically, three different
   materials typically used for FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling) technology
   such as Polylactic acid (PLA) and thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU)
   material (NinjaFlex and SemiFlex) were used for different stiffness and
   shock-absorption performances. The 3D printed prototypes were then
   tested and the results were compared with the computational prediction.
   The results showed that the auxetic material can be effective for body
   protection pads. Each structure and material had unique structural
   properties such as stiffness, Poisson's ratio, and efficiency in shock
   absorption. Particularly, auxtetic structures showed better shock
   absorption performance than non-auxetic ones. The mechanism for ideal
   input force distribution or shunting could be suggested for designing
   protectors using various shapes, thicknesses, and materials of auxetic
   materials to reduce the risk of injury.}},

Abstract = {{One typically analyzes clustered data using random- or fixed-effects
   models. Fixed-effects models allow consistent estimation of the effects
   of level-one variables, even if there is unobserved heterogeneity at
   level two. However, these models cannot estimate the effects of

   flexible modeling specifications that separate within and

   level-one effects and inclusion of level-two variables. In this article,
   we elaborate on the separation of within- and between-cluster effects in
   generalized linear mixed models. These models present a unifying
   framework for an entire class of models whose response variables follow
   a distribution from the exponential family (for example, linear, logit,
   probit, ordered probit and logit, Poisson, and negative binomial
   models). We introduce the user-written command xthybrid, a shell for the
   meglm command. xthybrid can fit a variety of hybrid and correlated

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOPHARMACEUTICAL STATISTICS}},

Volume = {{27}},

Pages = {{239-256}},
Abstract = {{Assessing equivalence or similarity has drawn much attention recently as
   many drug products have lost or will lose their patents in the next few
   years, especially certain best-selling biologics. To claim equivalence
   between the test treatment and the reference treatment when assay
   sensitivity is well established from historical data, one has to
   demonstrate both superiority of the test treatment over placebo and
   equivalence between the test treatment and the reference treatment.
   Thus, there is urgency for practitioners to derive a practical way to
   calculate sample size for a three-arm equivalence trial. The primary
   endpoints of a clinical trial may not always be continuous, but may be
   discrete. In this paper, the authors derive power function and discuss
   sample size requirement for a three-arm equivalence trial with Poisson
   and negative binomial clinical endpoints. In addition, the authors
   examine the effect of the dispersion parameter on the power and the
   sample size by varying its coefficient from small to large. In extensive
   numerical studies, the authors demonstrate that required sample size
   heavily depends on the dispersion parameter. Therefore, misusing a
   Poisson model for negative binomial data may easily lose power up to
   20\%, depending on the value of the dispersion parameter.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: To investigate the relationship between maternal depression and
   childhood caries in a cohort of adolescent mothers. Methods: This
   cross-sectional study nested in a cohort evaluated a sample of 538
   mother/child dyads. When the children were 24-36 months of age, data
   regarding oral health from children and mothers were collected by
   clinical dental examination. A mother's major depressive disorder was
   assessed by using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview
   (MINI {[}Plus]), at the current moment. Independent variables were
   obtained by using questionnaires. The outcome on dental caries
   experience was dichotomized by using 2 cut points: dmfs >= 1 and dmfs >=
   3. Poisson regression analysis, using a hierarchical approach, was
   applied to assess the association between major depressive disorder in
   mothers with and those without caries experience and the outcome.
   Results: The prevalence of dental caries in children was 15.1\% (n =
   82). The mean dmfs index was 1.12 (SD = 3.72). The prevalence of major
   depressive disorder was 32.6\% (n = 168). An interaction between caries
   status and depressive disorder was found, and after adjusted analysis,
   children from mothers with major depressive disorder with negative
   caries experience presented a higher caries prevalence (prevalence ratio
   4.00, 95\% confidence interval 1.29-12.41). Conclusion: Our findings
   suggest that maternal psychiatric disorders could have a negative impact
   on children's oral health. (C) 2016 S. Karger AG, Basel}},

   STUDY DESIGN: We analyzed longitudinal data collected from Oct. 1, 1994,
   through Sept. 30, 2012, through the Women's Interagency HIV Study.
   Age-adjusted rates per 100 person-years live births and induced
   abortions were calculated by HIV serostatus over 4 time periods. Poisson
   mixed effects models containing variables associated with live births
   and abortions in bivariable analyses (P <.05) generated adjusted
   incidence rate ratios and 95\% confidence intervals.
   RESULTS: There were 1356 pregnancies among 2414 women. Among
   HIV-positive women, age-adjusted rates of live birth increased from 1994
   through 1997 to 2006 through 2012 (2.85-7.27/ 100 person-years, P trend
   <.0001). Age-adjusted rates of abortion in HIV-positive women remained
   stable over these time periods (4.03-4.29/ 100 person-years,P trend
   =.09). Significantly lower live-birth rates occurred among HIVpositive
   compared to HIV-negative women in 1994 through 1997 and 1997 through
   2001, however rates were similar during 2002 through 2005 and 2006
   through 2012. Higher CD4\_ inverted perpendicular cells/mm (3) (
   (similar to) 350 adjusted incidence rate ratio, 1.39 {[}95\% CI
   1.03-1.89] vs < 350) were significantly associated with increased
   live-birth rates, while combination antiretroviral treatment use
   (adjusted incidence rate ratio, 1.35 {[}95\% CI 0.99-1.83]) was
   marginally associated with increased live-birth rates. Younger age,
   having a prior abortion, condom use, and increased parity were
   associated with increased abortion rates among both HIV-positive and
   HIV-negative women. CD4\_ inverted perpendicular-cell count, combination
   antiretroviral treatment use, and viral load were not associated with
   abortion rates.
   CONCLUSION: Unlike earlier periods (pre-2001) when live-birth rates were
   lower among HIV-positive women, rates are now similar to HIV-negative
   women, potentially due to improved health status and combination
   antiretroviral treatment. Abortion rates remain unchanged, illuminating
   a need to improve contraceptive services.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Auxetic materials tend to exhibit stretching in the
   direction of the applied load as well as in the perpendicular direction.
   This may be an inherent property of the material, or it might be a
   particular structural characteristic that confers it with auxetic
   properties. In this study, the auxetic properties of a rotating squares
   auxetic design were utilized in tandem with a stretching mechanism to
   manufacture a device that offers the advantages of adjustable pore size
   and hence tunable drug delivery characteristics.
   Methods: An auxetic polyurethane film was fabricated through the polymer
   casting technique. An acrylonitrilebutadiene- styrene (ABS) plastic mold
   for polymer casting was made through additive manufacturing.
   Stereolithography was used for fabrication of the mechanism that
   controlled pore size of the polymeric auxetic film. A laminate
   arrangement of the film and the mechanism was devised, through which
   movement of the mechanism controlled stretching of the auxetic film
   underneath.
   Results: Results were analyzed through image processing. It was observed
   that a 2-dimensional increase (in length and width) of the auxetic film
   took place that corresponded to an increase in pore size of the film.
   Several mathematical correlations were drawn up.
   Conclusions: It may be concluded that the first factor controlling drug
   release kinetics is the pore size of the film. This study explored a
   prototype mechanism that has the potential for being used in devices for
   controlled drug delivery or in smart bandage systems that may enhance
   wound healing in chronic wound treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Aim of this work is the synthesis of auxetic structures using a topology
   optimization approach for micropolar (or Cosserat) materials. A
   distributed compliant mechanism design problem is formulated, adopting a
   SIMP-like model to approximate the constitutive parameters of 2D
   micropolar bodies. The robustness of the proposed approach is assessed
   through numerical examples concerning the optimal design of structures
   that can expand perpendicularly to an applied tensile stress. The
   influence of the material characteristic length on the optimal layouts
   is investigated. Depending on the inherent flexural stiffness of
   micropolar solids, truss-like solutions typical of Cauchy solids are
   replaced by curved beam-like material distributions. No homogenization
   technique is implemented, since the proposed design approach applies to
   elements made of microstructured material with prescribed properties and
   not to the material itself.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF POLYMER SCIENCE}},

Abstract = {{The effect of dynamic compressive stimulation on MG-63 cell
   proliferation on an auxetic PLGA scaffold was investigated. The
   estimated Poisson ratio of the prepared auxetic scaffold specimens was
   approximately (-)0.07, while the Poisson ratio estimated for
   conventional scaffold specimens was (+)0.12 under 10\% strain
   compression on average. Three stimulus groups were examined: control (no
   stimulation), static compression, and dynamic compression. In
   preparation for proliferation testing, cells were seeded at 2.2 x 10(5)
   cells/80 mu L on each scaffold specimen. The average proliferation rates
   of the static and dynamic groups were higher than those of the control
   group: 13.4\% and 25.5\% higher at culture day 1, 34.7\% and 56.2\% at
   culture day 3, and 17.5\% and 43.0\% at culture day 5, respectively. The
   static and dynamic group results at culture day 5 were significantly
   different (p < 0.01). Moreover, proliferation rate of the dynamic
   stimulation group was 1.22 times higher than that of the static group (p
   < 0.01). Conclusively, proliferation of osteoblast-like cells was
   enhanced through compressive stimulation, but the enhancement was
   maximal with dynamic compressive stimulation of auxetic scaffolds.}},

Title = {{Time trends in health inequalities due to care in the context of the
   Spanish Dependency Law}},
Journal = {{GACETA SANITARIA}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{11-17}},

Abstract = {{Objective: In Spain, responsibility for care of old people and those in
   situations of dependency is assumed by families, and has an unequal
   social distribution according to gender and socioeconomic level. This
   responsibility has negative health effects on the carer. In 2006, the
   Dependency Law recognised the obligation of the State to provide
   support. This study analyses time trends in health inequalities
   attributable to caregiving under this new law.
   Methods: Study of trends using two cross-sectional samples from the 2006
   and 2012 editions of the Spanish National Health Survey (27,922 and
   19,995 people, respectively). We compared fair/poor self rated health,
   poor mental health (GHQ-12 >2), back pain, and the use of psychotropic
   drugs between non-carers, carers sharing care with other persons, and
   those providing care alone. We obtain prevalence ratios by fitting
   robust Poisson regression models.
   Results: We observed no change in the social profile of carers according
   to gender or social class. Among women, the difference in all health
   indicators between carers and non-carers tended to decrease among those
   sharing care but not among lone carers. Inequalities tend to decrease
   slightly in both groups of men carers.
   Conclusions: Between 2006 and 2012, trends in health inequalities
   attributable to informal care show different trends according to gender
   and share of responsibility. It is necessary to redesign and implement
   policies to reduce inequalities that take into account the most affected
   groups, such as women lone carers. Policies that strengthen the fair
   social distribution of care should also be adopted. (C) 2016 SESPAS.

Abstract = {{This study presents an evaluation of the mechanical behaviour of low
   porosity, ductile auxetic structures.
   Using time-averaged speckle interferometry and a specific experimental
   set-up, the eigenmodes and displacement fields of three low-porosity
   metallic auxetic samples were assessed and compared with the numerical
   simulations obtained using the commercial software Abaqus/Standard
   (Simulia Providence, RI).
   Guided by the finite element predictions, the eigenmode analysis was
   carried out by vibrating the specimens-each characterized by a different
   pore geometry-from 100 Hz to about 10 kHz analysing the structural
   response. A good agreement between the numerical calculations and the
   experimental results was found. This study not only validates the
   numerical-experimental approach used to analyse materials, but also to
   open a way to test and validate the performances of negative Poisson's
   ratio structures and meta-materials in general applications.
   Furthermore, the findings of this work provides a new convincing and
   reliable experimental data, enlarge the knowledge about the elastic
   instabilities in metallic auxetic structures, supporting their use in
   critical applications.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this research was to design, fabricate, and test coronary
   stent designs composed of carbon-infiltrated carbon nanotubes (CI-CNTs).
   Coronary stents currently have two major complications: restenosis and
   thrombosis. CI-CNT stents may provide improved clinical outcomes for
   both of these issues. Multiple stent design concepts were generated,
   evaluated, and two stent designs were selected: one with a semi-auxetic
   nature, and one designed for maximum force. These designs were further
   developed and optimized using analytical tools along with finite element
   analysis. Planar versions of the stent designs were manufactured and
   mechanically tested to verify performance. The performance of the
   cylindrical stent configurations was analyzed using finite element
   modeling. A sample cylindrical stent was also fabricated. This research
   demonstrates that feasible coronary stent designs can be manufactured
   from CI-CNTs. However, a major challenge for CI-CNT stent designs is
   meeting the design requirement of sufficient radial force.}},

   composite-bamboo. Digital Image Correlation was utilized to determine
   the deformation and strain of a bamboo beam. It was found that (a) the
   material responses to the applied load had both a linear and a
   non-linear range, (b) the beam was stiffer when it had node at two ends,
   (c) the neutral axis shifted toward the tensile side of the beam during
   loading process, (d) when samples were reloaded, the material responses
   to the load were different, (e) negative Poisson's ration was found in
   the high fiber density of the beam.}},

Abstract = {{ObjectiveTo identify empirical model-based patterns of multimorbidity
   from chronic noncommunicable diseases in the general population, with a
   focus on the contribution of rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases
   (RMDs), and to quantify their association with adverse health outcomes.
   MethodsCross-sectional data from the Portuguese Fourth National Health
   Survey were analyzed (n=23,754). Latent class analysis was used to
   identify patterns of coexistence of 11 chronic noncommunicable diseases
   (RMDs, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary
   disease, stroke, depression, myocardial infarction, cancer,
   osteoporosis, asthma, and renal failure). Based on the Outcome Measures
   in Rheumatology, filter 2.0, health outcomes included life impact,
   pathophysiologic manifestations, and resource use. We assessed the
   association between patterns and adverse health outcomes, through sex-,
   age-, and body mass index-adjusted prevalence ratios with 95\%
   confidence intervals, obtained using Poisson regression.
   ResultsFour patterns of chronic noncommunicable diseases co-occurrence
   were identified and labeled as low disease probability, cardiometabolic
   conditions, respiratory conditions, and RMDs and depression. RMDs were
   highly prevalent in patients with chronic diseases (from 38.6\% in
   cardiometabolic conditions to 66.7\% in RMDs and depression). While
   negative self-rated health, short-term disability, and chronic pain were
   more strongly associated with cardiometabolic conditions and respiratory
   conditions, all multimorbidity patterns were similarly associated with
   long-term disability, frequent health care utilization, and
   out-of-pocket health care expenses.
   ConclusionOur study emphasizes RMDs as a major presence in
   multimorbidity in the general population. All multimorbidity patterns
   were associated with a wide set of adverse health outcomes. Management
   strategies for the patient with chronic cardiometabolic, respiratory, or
   depressive conditions should also target RMDs.}},

Abstract = {{The unique physical properties of auxetic compounds make them very
   attractive materials. Nevertheless, no synthesised materials known to
   exhibit negative Poisson's ratio at the molecular level have been made.
   One way to explore such compounds is to predict potential candidates
   prior to their synthesis. To achieve it, multi-atom simulation is a
   powerful predicting tool. However, the lack of existing systems means
   that the crucial step of validation cannot be carried out. This paper
   aims to provide a procedure to predict the auxeticity of proposed
   molecular systems. The strategy is based on first revealing the
   determinant step in reaching the mechanical equilibrium of existing
   isotropic compounds such as polymers, or organic glasses, to compute
   efficiently mechanical properties. The Poisson's ratio is found in good
   agreement with experimental data. The procedure is thus modified to be
   applied to anisotropic compounds, liquid crystals. The agreement with
   experimental behaviour allowed us to extrapolate the procedure to
   potentially auxetic compounds, thus offering great opportunities to
   reveal auxetic properties prior to the synthesis of the molecules.}},

Abstract = {{New correlations are found between the elastic constants and late-stage

   auxetic behaviour of Poisson's ratio, v, measured parallel to {[}001] or
   {[}1 (1) over bar0] in response to {[}110] loading, favours the
   amalgamation of Ni3Al and Ni3Ga precipitates into non-equilibrium shapes
   along cube directions when delta v = (v(v') - v(v'))/v(v')> 0, the
   superscripts referring to the gamma' (Ni3X) and. (Ni-X) phases,
   respectively. When delta v < 0 amalgamation of Ni3Ge and Ni3Si
   precipitates does not occur and the particles retain cuboidal shapes.
   When delta v > 0 amalgamation of Ni3Al and Ni3Ge occurs readily,
   primarily producing laths of both phases. The gamma' volume fraction, f,
   is also shown to play a role in the late-stage microstructures of Ni-Al
   alloys, with an increasing tendency to form Ni3Al laths, rather than
   plates, as f increases. The shapes of elastically soft. precipitates in
   inverse Ni-Al and Ni-Ge alloys are different; Ni-Al precipitates are
   lath shaped, but Ni-Ge precipitates are plate shaped. The Ni-Ge plate
   shape, in a non-auxetic Ni3Ge matrix (Ni3Ge being the sole non-auxetic
   Ni3X phase of the four studied), is the only example of persistent
   plates in any of the Ni-base alloys investigated to date. The
   combination of an elastically soft precipitate (Ni-Ge) in a non-auxetic
   matrix suggests a connection between auxeticity and shape.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the analysis of the mechanical response of realistic
   fullerene-nanotube nanotruss networks with face-centered cubic geometry
   is performed by using molecular dynamics with reactive potentials. In
   particular, the mechanical properties of these novel architectures are
   investigated in both compressive and tensile regimes, a number of truss
   geometries by straining along different directions. Our atomistic
   simulations reveal a similar behavior under tensile stress for all the
   samples. Conversely, under compressive regimes the emergence of a
   response that depends on the orientation of load is observed together
   with a peculiar local instability. Due to this instability, some of
   these nanotruss networks present a negative Poisson ratio in
   compression, like re-entrant foams. Finally, the performance of these
   nanotruss networks is analyzed with regards to their use as impact
   energy absorbers, displaying properties that outperform materials
   traditionally used in these applications. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This letter presents a piezoelectric bimorph with auxetic (negative
   Poisson's ratio) behaviors for increased power output in vibration
   energy harvesting. The piezoelectric bimorph comprises a 2D auxetic
   substrate sandwiched between two piezoelectric layers. The auxetic
   substrate is capable of introducing auxetic behaviors and thus
   increasing the transverse stress in the piezoelectric layers when the
   bimorph is subjected to a longitudinal stretching load. As a result,
   both 31- and 32-modes are simultaneously exploited to generate electric
   power, leading to an increased power output. The increasing power output
   principle was theoretically analyzed and verified by finite element (FE)
   modelling. The FE modelling results showed that the auxetic substrate
   can increase the transverse stress of a bimorph by 16.7 times. The
   average power generated by the auxetic bimorph is 2.76 times of that
   generated by a conventional bimorph. (C) 2017 Author(s).}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays, the auxetic materials, auxetic reinforcement as well as
   auxetic composite are under the great attention of scientific research
   due to having excellent mechanical properties. In the current research
   work, the impact resistance of composite was improved by modifying the
   four layer through the thickness woven structure, that was used as
   reinforcement. A comparison was made between the standard four layer
   through the thickness and modified four layer through the thickness
   woven structure in terms of auxeticity and penetration. The modified
   four layer through the thickness woven structure showed auxetic behavior
   in both warp and weft direction having less penetration resistance as
   compared to standard sample. The four layer through the thickness
   non-auxetic woven structures and modified auxetic four layer thorough
   the thickness woven structures were used as reinforcements to develop
   composite for impact resistance comparison. The result showed that
   impact resistance of auxetic composite was 6.7\% greater as compared to
   the non-auxetic composite. It was concluded that the greater value of
   impact resistance was due to the auxetic behavior of modified four layer

Abstract = {{Delay Tolerant Network (DTN) is a type of network that permanent
   connections between nodes are not always available. Routing in DTN uses
   store-carry-and-forward scheme, where nodes store and carry data until a
   suitable message carrier appears. Positive social characteristics such
   as centrality and friendship can be used to make a better routing
   decision in DTN. However, negative social characteristics such as
   selfishness may decrease the network performance. Selfish nodes for
   their individual or social benefits, do not contribute in message
   relaying when the device resources like battery level are low. Moreover,
   to achieve a better network performance we need to consider buffer
   congestion at the rely node. In this paper, we propose Congestion Aware
   and Selfishness Aware Social Routing protocol (CASASR) which by using
   social characteristics and awareness of buffer congestion and selfish
   behavior in the network selects a better relay. Using Poisson process,
   we find a utility value to select a relay node with a higher chance to
   deliver the message to the destination in the remained message TTL. In
   addition, we take into account the social and individual selfish
   behavior of nodes to adjust energy level available for message relaying.
   Comparison of our algorithm against several well-known algorithm shows
   that CASASR performs better in terms of delivery ratio and delivery
   overhead.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE}},

Volume = {{52}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{Negative thermal expansion (NTE) and negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) are
   counterintuitive material properties that have gained popularity as the
   focus of many recent works. However, most of the structures previously
   studied only exhibit NTE or NPR exclusively. One important structure
   that has already been shown to exhibit NPR is the re-entrant triangle.
   In this work, the property of NTE in re-entrant triangular cellular
   structure composed of welded/bonded/brazed ribs of two different
   materials is investigated via analytical and finite element (FE)
   modelling. Based on analytical and FE analysis, the geometrical and
   material parameters for attaining NTE in the re-entrant metamaterial are
   established. The analysis and simulations reveal the dependence of NTE
   on the inclination of the longer chevron strut, the dimensionless rod
   coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), the ratio of thermal expansion
   coefficients of constituent struts but independent of scale and
   temperature. The extent of this property becomes more negative for
   higher values of the angle of the longer chevron strut with the
   vertical, higher ratios of CTE of the base to chevron strut material and
   for lower values of the non-dimensional re-entrant base material thermal
   expansion coefficient. The anisotropic and NTE behaviour is
   stretch-dominated. Effectively, combined with previous knowledge of NPR
   in the re-entrant triangle, NTE leads to further significance of such
   structures for many thermal and mechanical applications, such as
   composite materials, sensors and electronic components industries in
   both thermal and mechanical applications.}},

Abstract = {{The elastic constants, formation enthalpies, elastic moduli, Poisson's
   ratios, acoustic velocities and Debye temperatures of D0(22)-Ni3Nb phase
   at different pressures are determined using first-principles
   calculations. The effects of pressure on anisotropic elastic properties
   and minimum thermal conductivity are discussed in detail. It is found
   that the calculated equilibrium lattice parameters at 0 GPa well agree
   with the experimental results. The negative formation enthalpy indicates
   that Ni3Nb phase is thermodynamically stable in the ground state, and
   the stability becomes better as the pressure is increased. The bigger
   ratio of B/G (larger than 1.75) and positive Cauchy pressure indicate
   that Ni3Nb phase is ductile. Moreover, Ni3Nb phase exhibits high elastic
   anisotropy, and the elastic anisotropies become increasingly pronounced
   with the increase of pressure. Additionally, the anisotropic chemical
   bonds of Ni3Nb phase reduce the minimum thermal conductivity. The
   minimum thermal conductivity increases with the increased pressure. (C)

   and magnetic properties of CoMnCrZ (Z = Al, Si, Ge and As) quaternary
   Heusler compounds, using full-potential linearized augmented plane wave
   (FP-LAPW) scheme within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA).
   The computed equilibrium lattice parameters agree well with the
   available theoretical data. The obtained negative formation energy shows
   that CoMnCrZ (Z = Al, Si, Ge, As) compounds have strong structural
   stability. The elastic constants C-ij are calculated using the total
   energy variation with strain technique. The polycrystalline elastic
   moduli (namely: the shear modulus, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio,
   sound velocities, Debye temperature and melting temperature were derived
   from the obtained single-crystal elastic constants. The ductility
   mechanism for the studied compounds is discussed via the elastic
   constants C-ij. Our calculations with the GGA approximation predict that
   CoMnCrGe, CoMnCrAl, CoMnCrSi and CoMnCrAs are half-metallic ferrimagnets
   (HMFs) with a half-metallic gap E-HM of 0.03 eV, 0.19 eV, 0.34 eV and

Abstract = {{In order to study corona wind flow during the negative corona discharge

   experiment was conducted on the velocities of the corona wind flows
   generated from corona electrodes of three different curvature radii. The
   corresponding results show that the corona wind's low velocity at the
   needle point (the site of the corona) increased rapidly along the axial
   direction, leveled off at a certain value, and then dropped down. The
   larger the potential difference between plates, the faster the corona
   wind; the smaller the radius of curvature of the corona, the faster the
   corona wind to be generated around the pole tip.}},

Abstract = {{Poisson's ratio is one of the key parameters of material properties, and
   it could directly decide deformation and distribution of stress in
   materials and structures. In this paper, effects of Poisson's ratio on
   static mechanical behaviours of functionally graded structure are
   investigated in three different kinds of elastic models. Configurations
   of unit cell and finite element (FE) models are utilized to analyze
   macro cellular structures under static compression loads. The properties
   of graphite sheet structure in micro-nano scaled structures are
   calculated. The unit cell varies from hexagonal to re-entrant
   configurations while Poisson's ratio varies from positive to negative
   values gradually. The combined Fourier series-Galerkin method is
   introduced to solve beam structure subjected to transverse loads. In the
   numerical results, it is found that Poisson's ratio exhibits appreciable
   effects on bearing capacity, which indicates static properties can be
   improved by optimal design of cell shape material distribution and

Abstract = {{We present an analytical model to investigate the mechanics of
   2-dimensional lattices composed of elastic beams of non-uniform
   cross-section. Our approach is based on reducing a lattice to a single
   beam subject to the action of a set of linear and torsional springs,
   thus allowing the problem to be solved through a transfer matrix method.
   We show a non-trivial region of design space that yields materials with
   short wavelength modes (closely associated with auxetic behaviour) for
   strains greater than that required to trigger elastic instability. The
   critical loading required to make this transition from long to short
   wavelength buckling modes is calculated. Furthermore, we present lattice
   parameters that provide direction-dependent deformation modes offering
   great tailorability of the mechanical properties of finite size
   lattices. Not only is our analytical formulation in good agreement with
   the finite element simulation results, but it provides an insight into
   the role of the interplay between structure and elastic instability, and
   gives an efficient methodology to pursue questions of rational design in
   the field of mechanical metamaterials. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper considers a particular generalized inverse trinomial
   distribution which may be regarded as the convolution of binomial and
   negative distributions for the statistical analysis of count data. This
   distribution has the flexibility to cater for under-, equi- and
   over-dispersion in the data. Some basic and probabilistic properties and
   tail approximation of the distribution have been derived. Conditions for
   the numerical stability of the two-term probability recurrence formula
   have also been examined to facilitate computation. For the purpose of
   statistical analysis, test of hypothesis for equi-dispersion by the
   score and likelihood ratio tests and simulation study of their power,
   parameter estimation by maximum likelihood and a probability generating
   function based methods have been considered. The versatility of the
   distribution is illustrated by its application to real biological data
   sets which exhibit under and over dispersion. It is shown that the
   distribution fits better than the well-known generalized Poisson and
   COM-Poisson distributions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Effectiveness of HypoAware, a Brief Partly Web-Based Psychoeducational
   Intervention for Adults With Type 1 and Insulin-Treated Type 2 Diabetes
   and Problematic Hypoglycemia: A Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE
   To establish the effectiveness of a brief, partly web-based group
   intervention, HypoAware, in patients with problematic hypoglycemia, in
   terms of the reduction of severe hypoglycemic episodes, impaired
   hypoglycemia awareness, and worries.
   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
   A two-arm, cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted in
   insulin-treated patients with problematic hypoglycemia in eight Dutch
   clinics comparing HypoAware with care as usual. Primary outcomes
   included self-reported severe hypoglycemia, impaired hypoglycemia
   awareness (Gold score), and worries and distress about hypoglycemia
   (Hypoglycemia Fear Survey-II/Problem Areas In Diabetes scale hypo-item),
   assessed at baseline, and at 2, 4, and 6 months of follow-up. We used t
   tests, nonparametric tests, and intention-to-treat generalized
   estimation equation (GEE) analyses with linear, logistic, and Poisson or
   negative binomial models.
   RESULTS
   We enrolled 137 participants. Adjusted GEE analyses over four time
   points showed a nonsignificant 33\% fewer episodes of severe
   hypoglycemia in the HypoAware group compared with the control group
   (relative risk {[}RR] 0.67 {[}95\% CI 0.39-1.16], P = 0.150); a
   significant reduced odds of impaired awareness (odds ratio 0.38 {[}95\%
   CI 0.15-0.95], P = 0.038), a trend toward 20\% fewer worries about
   hypoglycemia (RR 0.80 {[}95\% CI 0.64-1.01], P = 0.059), and a
   significant 30\% less hypo-distress (RR 0.70 {[}95\% CI 0.56-0.88], P =
   0.002). Over the 6-month study duration, participants experienced a
   median of 2.5 events of severe hypoglycemia (interquartile range {[}IQR]
   1-10) in the control condition versus 1 event (IQR 0-6.5) in the
   HypoAware group (P = 0.030). There was no significant change in HbA(1c)
   level within and between both groups.
   CONCLUSIONS
   HypoAware resulted in fewer severe hypoglycemic episodes, significantly
   improved hypoglycemia awareness, and less hypo-distress in comparison
   with usual care, and deserves further dissemination.}},

Title = {{Food Insecurity and the Negative Impact on Brazilian Children's
   HealthWhy Does Food Security Matter for Our Future Prosperity? Brazilian
   National Survey (PNDS 2006/07)}},
Journal = {{FOOD AND NUTRITION BULLETIN}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{Background: Food insecurity (FI) refers to limited or uncertain access
   to food resulting from financial constraints. Numerous studies have
   shown association between FI and adverse health outcomes among adults
   and children around the world, but in Brazil, such information is
   scarce, especially if referring to nationally representative
   information.
   Objective: To test for an independent association between FI and health
   outcomes.
   Methods: Most recent Brazilian Demographic and Health Survey using
   nationally representative complex probability sampling. Participants
   were 3923 children <5 years of age, each representing a household. Data
   from the validated Brazilian Food Insecurity Scale were dichotomized as
   food secure (food security/mild FI) or food insecure (moderate FI/severe
   FI). Poisson regression was used to test for associations between FI and
   various health indicators.
   Results: Models adjusted for socioeconomic and demographic variables
   showed that children hospitalized for pneumonia or diarrhea were 30\%
   more prevalent in FI households (adjusted prevalence ratio {[}aPR]: 1.3;
   1.1-1.6). Underweight children were 40\% more prevalent in FI households
   (aPR: 1.4; 1.1-1.7). Children who didn't eat meat and fruits and
   vegetables every day were 20\% and 70\% more prevalent in FI households
   (aPR: 1.2; 1.1-1.4 and aPR: 1.7; 1.3-2.3), respectively.
   Conclusion: Children who grow up in food-insecure households have been
   shown to have worse health conditions than those in food-secure
   households. Consequently, their human capital accumulation and work-life
   productivity are likely to be reduced in the future, leading them into
   adulthood less capable of generating sufficient income, resulting in a
   cycle of intergenerational poverty and FI.}},

Abstract = {{Analytical solutions for the elastic properties of a variety of binary
   nanotubes with arbitrary chirality are obtained through the study of
   systematic molecular mechanics. This molecular mechanics model is first
   extended to chiral binary nanotubes by introducing an additional
   out-of-plane inversion term into the so-called stick-spiral model, which
   results from the polar bonds and the buckling of binary graphitic
   crystals. The closed-form expressions for the longitudinal and
   circumferential Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of chiral binary
   nanotubes are derived as functions of the tube diameter. The obtained
   inversion force constants are negative for all types of binary
   nanotubes, and the predicted tube stiffness is lower than that by the
   former stick-spiral model without consideration of the inversion term,
   reflecting the softening effect of the buckling on the elastic
   properties of binary nanotubes. The obtained properties are shown to be
   comparable to available density functional theory calculated results and
   to be chirality and size sensitive. The developed model and explicit
   solutions provide a systematic understanding of the mechanical
   performance of binary nanotubes consisting of III-V and II-VI group
   elements.}},

Abstract = {{We aimed to assess the associations of socioeconomic factors with
   dietary patterns in a Guatemalan population.
   Cross-sectional data of 1076 participants (42 \% men, mean age 32.6 +/-
   A 4.2 years) collected between 2002 and 2004 in four rural villages in
   Guatemala. Dietary patterns were derived using principal component
   analysis. Chi-square and Poisson regression models were used to assess
   associations between socioeconomic factors and dietary patterns.
   Three dietary patterns were identified: ``Western{''} (high in processed
   foods), ``traditional{''} (high in traditional foods) and ``coffee and
   sugar{''}, explaining 11, 7 and 6 \% of the variance, respectively.
   Annual expenditures were associated with a higher adherence to the
   ``Western{''} pattern: prevalence ratios {[}(PR) (95 \% confidence
   interval)] 1.92 (1.17-3.15) for the highest vs. lowest expenditure group
   in men and 8.99 (3.57-22.64) in women. A borderline significant (p =
   0.06) negative association was found between the ``traditional{''}
   pattern and higher household expenditures {[}0.71 (0.49-1.02) in men]
   and with schooling {[}0.23 (0.05-1.02)] in women (p = 0.05).
   Dietary patterns in Guatemala are predicted by socioeconomic factors. In
   particular, high annual expenditures are associated with a more
   westernized, less traditional diet.}},

Abstract = {{Energy minimizations for unstretched and stretched cellulose models
   using an all-atom empirical force field (molecular mechanics) have been
   performed to investigate the mechanism for auxetic (negative Poisson's
   ratio) response in crystalline cellulose I-beta from kraft cooked Norway
   spruce. An initial investigation to identify an appropriate force field
   led to a study of the structure and elastic constants from models
   employing the CVFF force field. Negative values of on-axis Poisson's
   ratios nu (31) and nu (13) in the x (1)-x (3) plane containing the chain
   direction (x (3)) were realized in energy minimizations employing a
   stress perpendicular to the hydrogen-bonded cellobiose sheets to
   simulate swelling in this direction due to the kraft cooking process.
   Energy minimizations of structural evolution due to stretching along the
   x (3) chain direction of the `swollen' (kraft cooked) model identified
   chain rotation about the chain axis combined with inextensible secondary
   bonds as the most likely mechanism for auxetic response.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Sometimes there is interest in a dichotomized outcome indicating whether
   a count variable is positive or zero. Under this scenario, the
   application of ordinary logistic regression may result in efficiency
   loss, which is quantifiable under an assumed model for the counts. In
   such situations, a shared-parameter hurdle model is investigated for
   more efficient estimation of regression parameters relating to overall
   effects of covariates on the dichotomous outcome, while handling count
   data with many zeroes. One model part provides a logistic regression
   containing marginal log odds ratio effects of primary interest, while an
   ancillary model part describes the mean count of a Poisson or negative
   binomial process in terms of nuisance regression parameters. Asymptotic
   efficiency of the logistic model parameter estimators of the two-part
   models is evaluated with respect to ordinary logistic regression.
   Simulations are used to assess the properties of the models with respect
   to power and Type I error, the latter investigated under both
   misspecified and correctly specified models. The methods are applied to
   data from a randomized clinical trial of three toothpaste formulations
   to prevent incident dental caries in a large population of Scottish
   schoolchildren.}},

Abstract = {{We analyze the propagation of nonlinear waves in homogenized periodic
   nonlinear hexagonal networks, considering successively 1D and 2D
   situations. Wave analysis is performed on the basis of the construction
   of the effective strain energy density of periodic hexagonal lattices in
   the nonlinear regime. The obtained second order gradient nonlinear
   continuum has two propagation modes: an evanescent subsonic mode that
   disappears after a certain wavenumber and a supersonic mode
   characterized by an increase of the frequency with the wavenumber. For a
   weak nonlinearity, a supersonic mode occurs and the dispersion curves
   lie above the linear dispersion curve (v(P) = v(p0)). For a higher
   nonlinearity, the wave changes from a supersonic to an evanescent
   subsonic mode at s=0.7 and the dispersion curves drops below the linear
   case and vanish for certain values of the wavenumber. An important
   decrease in the frequency occurs for both subsonic and supersonic modes
   when the lattice becomes auxetic, and the longitudinal and shear modes
   become very close to each other. The influence of the lattice
   geometrical parameters of the lattice on the dispersion relations is
   analyzed.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials (materials with negative Poisson's ratio) and
   nanomaterials have independently been, for many years, two of the most
   active research fields in material science. Recently, these formerly
   independent fields have begun to intersect in new and interesting ways
   due to the recent discovery of auxeticity in nanomaterials like
   graphene, metal nanoplates, black phosphorus, and others. Here, we
   review the research emerging at the intersection of auxeticity and
   nanomaterials. We first survey the atomistic mechanisms, both intrinsic
   and extrinsic, that have been found, primarily through atomistic
   simulations, to cause auxeticity in nanomaterials. We then outline the
   available experimental evidence for auxetic nanomaterials. In order to
   lay the groundwork for future work in this exciting area, we close by
   discussing several future prospects as well as the current challenges in
   this field. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Abstract = {{An innovative sandwich structure with auxetic re-entrant cell honeycomb
   cores was proposed in this paper, and the dynamic responses and blast
   resistance of the honeycomb sandwich structures under blast loading were
   investigated numerically by employing the LS-DYNA. The honeycomb
   structures with thicker walls have a higher plateau force and specific
   energy absorption (SEA) under the compression loading. Deformation modes
   and deflections distribution along the axis direction caused by plastic
   stretching and bending were investigated in detail to have a better
   understanding of the deformation mechanism. Results show that the
   sandwich structures have a higher ability of resisting deformation along
   the longitudinal(Y)-direction than the transverse(X)-direction. In
   addition, the dynamic responses of honeycomb sandwich structures with
   different stand-off distances, graded cores and arranged orientations
   were studied. Results show that both the graded honeycomb cores and
   cross-arranged honeycomb cores can significantly improve the resistance
   ability of the sandwich structures under blast loading, compared with
   the ungraded honeycomb cores and regular-arranged cores.
   Comprehensively, the cross-arranged graded honeycomb cores with higher
   density of the upper layer performs the best under the blast loading
   compared with the other configurations, taking the effects of graded
   cores and arranged orientations into consideration. This work provides a
   reliable basis to design the sandwich structures with auxetic re-entrant
   cell honeycomb cores under compression and blast loading. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials become thicker rather than thinner when stretched,
   exhibiting an unusual negative Poisson's ratio well suited for designing
   shape transforming metamaterials. Current auxetic designs, however, are
   often monostable and cannot maintain the transformed shape upon load
   removal. Here, inspired by ancient geometric motifs arranged in square
   and triangular grids, we introduce a class of switchable architected
   materials exhibiting simultaneous auxeticity and structural bistability.
   The material concept is experimentally realized by perforating various
   cut motifs into a sheet of rubber, thus creating a network of rotating
   units connected with compliant hinges. The metamaterial performance is
   assessed through mechanical testing and accurately predicted by a
   coherent set of finite element simulations. A discussion on a rich set
   of mechanical phenomena follows to shed light on the main design
   principles governing bistable auxetics. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This paper is categorized into two parts. (1) A frame work to design the
   aircraft wing structure and (2) analysis of a morphing airfoil with
   auxetic structure. The developed design frame work in the first part is
   used to arrive at the sizes of the various components of an aircraft
   wing structure. The strength based design is adopted, where the design
   loads are extracted from the aerodynamic loads. The aerodynamic loads
   acting on a wing structure are converted to equivalent distributed
   loads, which are further converted point loads to arrive at the shear
   forces, bending and twisting moments along the wing span. Based on the
   estimated shear forces, bending and twisting moments, the strength based
   design is employed to estimate the sizes of various sections of a
   composite wing structure. A three dimensional numerical model of the
   composite wing structure has been developed and analyzed for the extreme
   load conditions. Glass fiber reinforced plastic material is used in the
   numerical analysis. The estimated natural frequencies are observed to be
   in the acceptable limits. Furthermore, the discussed design principles
   in the first part are extended to the design of a morphing airfoil with
   auxetic structure. The advantages of the morphing airfoil with auxetic
   structure are (i) larger displacement with limited straining of the
   components and (ii) unique deformation characteristics, which produce a
   theoretical in-plane Poisson's ratio of-1. Aluminum Alloy AL6061-T651 is
   considered in the design of all the structural elements. The compliance
   characteristics of the airfoil are investigated through a numerical
   model. The numerical results are observed to be in close agreement with
   the experimental results in the literature.}},

Abstract = {{This paper contains results of numerical and experimental investigation
   of glow discharge plasma created in a chamber of a new-type large-volume
   coaxial gridded hollow cathode. The discharge is created in argon at 25
   Pa by applying time-varying power with frequency 20 kHz on electrodes. A
   2-D model of the discharge was built using COMSOL Multiphysics.
   Self-consistent description of the discharge was obtained using the
   extended fluid approach, which couples continuity equations for charged
   particles and electron energy balance with Poisson's equation for
   electric potential. Electron transport coefficients and rates of
   electron-impact reactions were calculated using the electron energy
   distribution function. The spatial and radial distributions of plasma
   potential (V-p), electron density (n(e)), and electron temperature (T-e)
   were obtained. It is shown that the plasma inside the chamber is similar
   to the negative glow of a dc glow discharge. Comparison of numerical
   results with the Langmuir probe measurements of electron density and
   electron temperature is presented and showed a good agreement.}},

Abstract = {{Recent developments in additive manufacturing techniques have motivated
   an increasing number of researchers to study regular porous biomaterials
   that are based on repeating unit cells. The physical and mechanical
   properties of such porous biomaterials have therefore received
   increasing attention during recent years. One of the areas that have
   revived is analytical study of the mechanical behavior of regular porous
   biomaterials with the aim of deriving analytical relationships that
   could predict the relative density and mechanical properties of porous
   biomaterials, given the design and dimensions of their repeating unit
   cells. In this article, we review the analytical relationships that have
   been presented in the literature for predicting the relative density,
   elastic modulus, Poisson's ratio, yield stress, and buckling limit of
   regular porous structures based on various types of unit cells. The
   reviewed analytical relationships are used to compare the mechanical
   properties of porous biomaterials based on different types of unit
   cells. The major areas where the analytical relationships have improved
   during the recent years are discussed and suggestions are made for
   future research directions. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed

Abstract = {{Recently synthesized atomically thin boron sheets (that is, borophene)
   provide a fascinating template for new material property discovery.
   Here, we report findings of an extraordinary combination of unusual
   mechanical and electronic properties in hydrogenated borophene, known as
   borophane, from first-principles calculations. This novel 2D material
   has been shown to exhibit robust Dirac transport physics. Our study
   unveils that borophane is auxetic with a surprising negative Poisson's
   ratio stemming from its unique puckered triangle hinge structure and the
   associated hinge dihedral angle variation under a tensile strain in the
   armchair direction. Our results also identify borophane to be
   ferroelastic with a stress-driven 90 lattice rotation in the boron
   layer, accompanied by a remarkable orientation switch of the anisotropic
   Dirac transport channels. These outstanding strain-engineered properties
   make borophane a highly versatile and promising 2D material for
   innovative applications in microelectromechanical and nanoelectronic
   devices.}},

Title = {{Geometry: The leading parameter for the Poisson's ratio of

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{100}},
Pages = {{1-10}},

Abstract = {{Control over the deformation behaviour that a cellular structure shows
   in response to imposed external forces is a requirement for the
   effective design of mechanical metamaterials, in particular those with
   negative Poisson's ratio. This article sheds light on the old question
   of the relationship between geometric microstructure and mechanical
   response, by comparison of the deformation properties of bar-and-joint
   frameworks with those of their realisation as a cellular solid made from
   linear-elastic material. For ordered planar tessellation models, we find
   a classification in terms of the number of degrees of freedom of the
   framework model: first, in cases where the geometry uniquely prescribes
   a single deformation mode of the framework model, the mechanical
   deformation and Poisson's ratio of the linearly-elastic cellular solid
   closely follow those of the unique deformation mode; the result is a
   bending-dominated deformation with negligible dependence of the
   effective Poisson's ratio on the underlying material's Poisson's ratio
   and small values of the effective Young's modulus. Second, in the case
   of rigid structures or when geometric degeneracy prevents the
   bending-dominated deformation mode, the effective Poisson's ratio is
   material-dependent and the Young's modulus (E) over tilde (cs) large.
   All analysed structures of this type have positive values of the
   Poisson's ratio and large values of (E) over tilde (cs). Third, in the
   case, where the framework has multiple deformation modes, geometry alone
   does not suffice to determine the mechanical deformation. These results
   clarify the relationship between mechanical properties of a
   linear-elastic cellular solid and its corresponding bar-and-joint
   framework abstraction. They also raise the question if, in essence,
   auxetic behaviour is restricted to the geometry-guided class of
   bending-dominated structures corresponding to unique mechanisms, with
   inherently low values of the Young's modulus. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

   for positive predictive values or risk of interval cancer, despite an
   excess of +16\% in the highest temperature class for interval cancer.
   Conclusions Ambient temperatures can affect screening performance.
   Continued monitoring is needed to verify the effect of introducing FIT
   tubes with a new buffer, which should guarantee a higher stability of

Title = {{Improved shear correction factors for deflection of simply supported
   very thick rectangular auxetic plates}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL AND MATERIALS ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 25}},
Abstract = {{Background: The first-order shear deformation theory (FSDT) for plates
   requires a shear correction factor due to the assumption of constant
   shear strain and shear stress across the thickness; hence, the shear
   correction factor strongly influences the accuracy of the deflection
   solution; the third-order shear deformation theory (TSDT) does not
   require a correction factor because it facilitates the change in shear
   strain across the plate thickness.
   Methods: This paper obtains an improved shear correction factor for
   simply supported very thick rectangular plates by matching the
   deflection of the Mindlin plate (FSDT) with that of the Reddy plate
   (TSDT).
   Results: As a consequence, the use of the exact shear correction factor
   for the Mindlin plate gives solutions that are exactly the same as for
   the Reddy plate.
   Conclusions: The customary adoption of 5/6 shear correction factor is a
   lower bound, and the exact shear correction factor is higher for the
   following: (a) very thick plates, (b) narrow or long plates, (c) high
   Poisson's ratio plate material, and (d) highly patterned loads, while
   the commonly used shear correction factor of 5/6 is still valid for the
   following: (i) marginally thick plates, (ii) square plates, (iii)
   negative Poisson's ratio materials, and (d) uniformly distributed
   loadings.}},

Abstract = {{Polyion complex (PIC) hydrogels have been proposed as promising
   engineered soft materials due to their high toughness and good
   processability. In this work, we reported manufacturing of complex
   structures with tough PIC hydrogels based on three-dimensional (3D)
   printing technology. The strategy relies on the distinct strength of
   ionic bonding in PIC hydrogels at different stages of printing. In
   concentrated saline solution, PIC forms viscous solution, which can be
   directly extruded out of a nozzle into water, where dialyzing out of
   salt and counterions results in sol gel transition to form tough
   physical PIC gel with intricate structures. The printability of PIC
   solutions was systematically investigated by adjusting the PIC material
   formula and printing parameters in which proper viscosity and gelation
   rate were found to be key factors for successful 3D printing. Uniaxial
   tensile tests were performed to printed single fibers and multilayer
   grids, both exhibiting distinct yet controllable strength and toughness.
   More complex 3D structures with negative Poisson's ratio, gradient grid,
   and material anisotropy were constructed as well, demonstrating the
   flexible printability of PIC hydrogels. The methodology and capability
   here provide a versatile platform to fabricate complex structures with
   tough PIC hydrogels, which should broaden the use of such materials in
   applications such as biomedical devices and artificial tissues.}},

Abstract = {{Natural acquisition of small amounts of foreign cells or DNA, referred
   to as microchimerism, occurs primarily through maternal-fetal exchange
   during pregnancy. Microchimerism can persist long-term and has been
   associated with both beneficial and adverse human health outcomes.
   Quantitative microchimerism data present challenges for statistical
   analysis, including a skewed distribution, excess zero values, and
   occasional large values. Methods for comparing microchimerism levels
   across groups while controlling for covariates are not well established.
   We compared statistical models for quantitative microchimerism values,
   applied to simulated data sets and 2 observed data sets, to make
   recommendations for analytic practice. Modeling the level of
   quantitative microchimerism as a rate via Poisson or negative binomial
   model with the rate of detection defined as a count of microchimerism
   genome equivalents per total cell equivalents tested utilizes all
   available data and facilitates a comparison of rates between groups. We
   found that both the marginalized zero-inflated Poisson model and the
   negative binomial model can provide unbiased and consistent estimates of
   the overall association of exposure or study group with microchimerism
   detection rates. The negative binomial model remains the more accessible
   of these 2 approaches; thus, we conclude that the negative binomial
   model may be most appropriate for analyzing quantitative microchimerism
   data.}},

Title = {{Energy efficiency analysis of ArF excimer laser system}},
Journal = {{ACTA PHYSICA SINICA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{65}},
Number = {{21}},
Month = {{NOV 5}},
Abstract = {{The reliable functioning and continual optimizing of ArF excimer laser
   system is of importance when it comes to productization into the market
   from a laboratory test machine. The analysis of dynamic characteristics
   of the system is vital to understanding its operating mechanism and
   optimizing the design theoretically. In this article, one-dimensional
   fluid model is used to analyze the excimer laser discharge mechanism,
   and the content ratio of fluorine gas, argon gas, and neon gas, which
   constitute a gas mixture, is studied in a simulated ArF excimer laser
   system. Particles are treated as a fluid, which significantly reduces
   the computing cost in fluid model, and therefore is suitable for
   high-pressure situation. Four equations are included in one-dimensional
   fluid model, i.e., Boltzmann equation that describes electron energy
   distribution, ion continue equation that illustrates ion number density,
   Poisson's equation that shows the distribution of electric field, and
   photon rate equation that demonstrates laser outputting process. By
   combining these four equations, high pressure plasma discharge process
   and particles stimulated radiation process are studied, and calculation
   continues from one time step to another until the end of discharging
   process. The result of the calculation presents energy transfer process
   from three aspects: energy deposition efficiency, ArF{*} formation, and
   laser outputting. In the energy deposition process, the energy
   deposition efficiency is sensitive to the change of fluorine gas ratio
   while the variation of the content ratio of other two gases has a less
   influence on this process. In addition, there exists an optimal fluorine
   gas ratio that causes the highest energy deposition efficiency. In the
   ArF{*} formation process, the reaction between excited argon ions and
   fluorine gas is the main channel that generates ArF{*}. The proper
   increasing of fluorine gas ratio helps form ArF{*}. In the laser
   outputting process, photon loss is mainly because of the reaction
   between fluorine negative ions and photons. Therefore superfluous
   fluorine gas in the mixture leads to less photons, which eventually
   results in low energy efficiency of laser. By summarizing the three
   aspects of energy transfer process, the fluorine gas ratio in the gas
   mixture plays a significant role in determining the energy efficiency of
   ArF excimer laser system. This theory is verified by experiments,
   showing that the deviation of the optimized fluorine gas ratio severely
   reduces energy efficiency. This conclusion can guide us in optimizing
   the design and steady reliable function of ArF excimer laser system.}},

Abstract = {{Deep mining has been paid much more attention because of the depletion
   of shallow mining resources. Traditional bolts could be invalid to
   accommodate large displacement and deformation in geomaterials.
   Consequently, alternative support and reinforcement bolts need to be
   studied and their constitutive models also need to be developed to help
   understanding for the complex stress-strain responses of rock masses
   under loadings. The effect of Negative Poisson's Ratio (NPR) that is
   attributed to the swelling phenomenon along the lateral direction may
   appear in metal materials under tensional loadings. Thence NPR materials
   often have an advantage over NPR ones in mechanical behavior such as
   impact resistance, anti-shearing, and energy absorbed. From the
   characteristics of NPR materials, a series of bolt and cable supports
   with the effect of NPR and constant-resistance have been recently
   developed. We here firstly introduce the structural features of NPR
   support. Then the constitutive model of NPR support is presented and its
   corresponding equation of energy equilibrium. Its basic principle
   interacted on rock masses is further discussed. Finally, NPR cables are
   employed to support the slope of an open-pit mine. The applications show
   that NPR cables can ease failure within the slope and play an important
   role in predicting and providing early warning of slope failure,
   together with a monitoring system of slope stability. (C) 2016 Published

Abstract = {{Tight clastic reservoirs are an important aspect of hydrocarbon
   exploration and development worldwide. The Xu5 section of the Upper
   Triassic Xujiahe Formation in the western Sichuan Basin of central China
   contains tight terrestrial clastic reservoirs. The depth of these
   reservoirs is greater than 3000 m, while the thickness is generally
   greater than 500-580 m; the tight sandstone and shale reservoirs are
   frequently interbedded. Based on the proportion of sandstone and shale,
   the reservoirs can be divided into four types: sand-rich, interbedded
   Type I, interbedded Type II, and shale-rich. Horizontal wells and
   multistage fracturing are used due to the complexity and significant
   heterogeneity of the tight clastic reservoirs in the study area. The
   Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of the reservoir rocks are the two
   most significant parameters that must be evaluated when implementing
   these key techniques. Based on mechanical and acoustic tests, a new
   assessment system for the Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio based on
   the Hoek-Brown criterion was proposed. This evaluation system does not
   require the shear wave time difference; thus, the increase in error
   caused by the unreliability of the shear wave time difference can be
   avoided when assessing strata with complex geological structures. This
   method can be directly applied in single wells using only conventional
   longitudinal wave time difference log data. After converting the wave
   velocity of the high experimental frequency into the wave velocity of
   the logging frequency using the acoustic dispersion technique, the
   analysis results were applicable to the log evaluations. The
   relationship between the Hoek-Brown criterion parameters and the
   mechanical and acoustic parameters of the rock were systematically
   analyzed. By distinguishing the lithologies, the equations for the
   Young's moduli of tight sandstones and shales were established based on
   the Hoek-Brown criterion. The Young's modulus can be expressed using
   only the longitudinal wave velocity (V-p). A significant negative
   correlation exists between the Poisson's ratio and Young's modulus;
   therefore, the Poisson's ratio can be evaluated from the Young's
   modulus. The errors of the Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio predicted
   by the proposed assessment method are small, which meets engineering
   requirements and validates the accuracy of the method. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The problem of linear elasticity for free harmonic (periodic) and
   solitary bell-shaped (nonperiodic) waves in an isotropic half-space with
   stress-free plane boundary is considered. The half-space is made of
   either conventional (classical structural) or nonconventional
   (nonclassical auxetic) material. Two cases of wave damping are studied:
   rapid (surface wave) and periodic (nonsurface wave). The following
   conclusions on a free harmonic wave are drawn: a surface wave exists in
   materials of both classes, but the ratio of the wave velocity to the
   velocity of a transverse plane wave in auxetic materials is somewhat
   lower than in conventional materials; a nonsurface wave cannot be
   described by the approach applied to conventional materials, but can
   theoretically exist in auxetic materials where there are two wave
   velocities. For a solitary (bell-shaped) wave, the assumption that the
   wave velocity depends on the wave phase is substantiated and some
   constraint is imposed on the time of travel of the wave and the way the
   wave velocity varies with time. The following conclusions are drawn: a
   rapidly damped bell-shaped wave cannot be described by the approach for
   both classes of materials, whereas a periodically damped bell-shaped
   wave can be described.}},

Abstract = {{Material properties can be tailored through modification of their
   geometry or architecture. With this concept, a lot of smart materials,

   materials and structures are a novel class of materials which exhibit an

   auxetic behavior, mechanical properties such as fracture toughness,
   indentation resistance, etc., can be improved. In order to exploit the
   interesting properties of auxetic materials, several potential
   applications of auxetic materials have been explored in medical, sports,
   automobile, defense, etc. Design and modeling of novel auxetic materials
   and structures is still on the way. Here, the article focuses upon the
   different aspects of auxetic materials and structures. A comprehensive
   updated review of auxetic materials, their types and properties, and

Title = {{Mechanical Properties of Auxetic Cellular Material Consisting of
   Re-Entrant Hexagonal Honeycombs}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{A preliminary study of the mechanical properties of auxetic cellular
   material consisting of re-entrant hexagonal honeycombs is presented. For
   different scales of the honeycombs, the finite element method (FEM) and
   experimental models are used to perform a parametric analysis on the
   effects of the Poisson's ratio (cell angle) and the relative density
   (cell thickness) of honeycombs on bearing capacity and dynamic
   performance of the auxetic material. The analysis demonstrates that the
   ultimate bearing capacity of the presented auxetic cellular material is
   scale-independent when the Poisson's ratio and the relative density are
   kept constant. The relationship between the geometric parameters and
   vibration level difference of the honeycombs is also revealed, which can
   be divided into two converse parts around the Poisson's ratio v = -1.5.
   When v is smaller than -1.5, increasing the cell thickness leads to an
   increase in the vibration level difference of the honeycombs. Moreover,
   the dynamic performance of thin-walled honeycombs is greatly influenced
   by the scale of the honeycombs, especially for the ones with small
   Poisson's ratio. These conclusions are verified by a frequency response
   test and a good agreement between the numerical results and experimental
   data is achieved.}},

Abstract = {{To investigate the influence of auxetic behavior on thermally induced

   structures are compared. The simulations were carried out in Comsol for
   a cubic as well as a chiral array of 30 mm length in each spatial
   dimension (3 x 3 x 3 unit cells). The center cells of these arrays were
   heated for 20 s. For two boundary conditions (free and clamped),
   deformation mechanisms are analyzed. It is found, that the auxetic
   behavior can effectively reduce thermal stresses by internal node
   rotation and strut bending, especially for constrained (clamped)
   boundary conditions. A stress reduction of a factor of 3.3 in
   comparisons to a simple cubic cell array could be evaluated.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Tailoring the dynamical behavior of wave-guide structures can provide an
   efficient and physically elegant approach for optimizing mechanical
   components with regards to vibroacoustic propagation. Architectured
   materials as pyramidal core kirigami cells combined with smart systems
   may represent a promising way to improve the vibroacoustic quality of
   structural components. This paper describes the design and modeling of a
   pyramidal core with auxetic (negative Poisson's ratio) characteristics
   and distributed shunted piezoelectric patches that allow for wave
   propagation control. The core is produced using a kirigami technique,
   inspired by the cutting/folding processes of the ancient Japanese art.
   The kirigami structure has a pyramidal unit cell shape that creates an
   in-plane negative Poisson's ratio macroscopic behavior. This structure
   exhibits in-plane elastic properties (Young's and shear modulus) which
   are higher than the out-of-plane ones, and hence this lattice has very
   specific properties in terms of wave propagation that are investigated
   in this work. The short-circuited configuration is first analyzed,
   before using negative capacitance and resistance as a shunt which
   provides impressive band gaps in the low frequency range. All
   configurations are investigated by using a full analysis of the
   Brillouin zone, rendering possible the deep understanding of the
   dynamical properties of the smart lattice. The results are presented in
   terms of dispersion and directivity diagrams, and the smart lattice
   shows quite interesting properties for the adaptive filtering of elastic
   waves at low frequencies bandwidths.}},

   Results: During an average 4.8 years of follow-up, 7,910 invasive breast
   cancers were diagnosed. Compared with nonusers of hormone therapy, users
   of estradiol and tibolone were more likely to be diagnosed with grade I,
   lymph node-negative, and estrogen receptor-positive (ER+)/progesterone
   receptor-positive (PR+) tumors. However, compared with nonusers, users
   of the most common estrogen and progestin combinations
   {[}estradiol-norethisterone acetate (NETA) preparations (Kliogest,
   Activelle or Trisekvens)] were at a 4-to 5-fold elevated risk of grade I
   tumors, 3-fold elevated risk of lymph node-negative tumors, and 3-to
   4-fold elevated risk of ER+/PR+ tumors. Importantly, estradiol-NETA
   users were also at a 2- to 3-fold increased risk of medium
   differentiated (grade II) tumors and tumors with lymph node involvement.
   Conclusions: Use of oral estradiol, tibolone, and estradiol-NETA
   predominantly increases the risk of breast cancer with favorable
   prognosis characteristics. However, use of estradiol-NETA preparations
   also increases the risk of breast cancers with less favorable
   characteristics.
   Impact: The hormone therapy preparations most commonly used in the
   Nordic countries are associated with both breast cancers with good and
   less favorable prognosis characteristics. (C) 2016 AACR.}},

Abstract = {{Distributional identities for a Levy process X-t, its quadratic
   variation process V-t and its maximal jump processes, are derived, and
   used to make ``small time{''} (as t down arrow 0) asymptotic comparisons
   between them. The representations are constructed using properties of
   the underlying Poisson point process of the jumps of X. Apart from
   providing insight into the connections between X, V, and their maximal
   jump processes, they enable investigation of a great variety of limiting
   behaviours. As an application, we study ``self-normalised{''} versions
   of Xt, that is, Xt after division by SuP(0<s <= t) Delta X-s, or by
   sup(0<s <= t) vertical bar Delta X-s vertical bar Thus, we obtain
   necessary and sufficient conditions for X-t/ sup(0<s <= t) Delta X-s and
   X-t/ suP(0<s <= t) vertical bar Delta X-s vertical bar to converge in
   probability to 1, or to infinity, as t down arrow 0, so that Xis either
   comparable to, or dominates, its largest jump. The former situation
   tends to occur when, the singularity at 0 of the Levy measure of X is
   fairly mild (its tail is slowly varying at 0), while the latter
   situation is related to the relative stability or attraction to
   normality of X at 0 (a steeper singularity at 0). An important component
   in the analyses is the way the largest positive and negative jumps
   interact with each other. Analogous ``large time{''} (as t -> infinity)
   versions of the results can also be obtained.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},

Volume = {{94}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{OCT 24}},
Abstract = {{Origami-based design holds promise for developing new mechanical
   metamaterials whose overall kinematic and mechanical properties can be
   programmed using purely geometric criteria. In this article, we
   demonstrate that the deformation of a generic degree-four vertex (
   4-vertex) origami cell is a combination of contracting, shearing,
   bending, and facet-binding. The last three deformation mechanisms are
   missing in the current rigid-origami metamaterial investigations, which
   focus mainly on conventional Miura-ori patterns. We show that these
   mechanisms provide the 4-vertex origami sheets and blocks with new
   deformation patterns as well as extraordinary kinematical and mechanical
   properties, including self-locking, tridirectional negative Poisson's
   ratios, flipping of stiffness profiles, and emerging shearing stiffness.
   This study reveals that the 4-vertex cells offer a better platform and
   greater design space for developing origami-based mechanical
   metamaterials than the conventional Miura-ori cell.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the effective stress-strain behavior of cellular
   elastomers, structured with a periodic pattern of elliptic holes by
   means of full scale simulations under small deformations. First, we show
   that the elastic response behaves non trivially with the pore geometry.
   In particular, we show that auxetic and anistropic responses arise for a
   broad range of parameters, when the microstructure becomes sufficiently
   porous. Second, we show that, in the limit of large and near -circular
   holes, the stress-strain nonlinearities become very large. Third, we
   adopt an effective theoretical description where the filaments between
   the holes are modeled by slender beams to predict the linear response,
   and by bars and pivots to capture the leading order nonlinear
   corrections. This approach fully captures the asymptotic observations
   and open pathways for an effective-beams based homogenization and the
   design of nonlinear cellular materials. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOLIDS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{97-98}},
Pages = {{575-592}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{The class of anti-tetrachiral cellular materials is phenomenologically
   characterized by a strong auxeticity of the elastic macroscopic
   response. The auxetic behavior is activated by rolling-up deformation
   mechanisms developed by the material microstructure, composed by a
   periodic pattern of stiff rings connected by flexible ligaments. A
   linear beam lattice model is formulated to describe the free dynamic
   response of the periodic cell, in the absence of a soft matrix. After a
   static condensation of the passive degrees-of freedom, a general
   procedure is applied to analyze the wave propagation in the
   low-dimensional space of the active degrees-of-freedom. The exact
   dispersion functions are compared with explicit - although approximate -
   dispersion relations, obtained from asymptotic perturbation solutions of
   the eigenproblem governing the Floquet-Bloch theory. A general
   hierarchical scheme is outlined to formulate and solve the perturbation
   equations, taking into account the dimension of the perturbation vector.
   Original recursive formulas are presented to achieve any desired order
   of asymptotic approximation. For the anti-tetrachiral material, the
   fourth-order asymptotic solutions are found to approximate the
   dispersion curves with fine agreement over wide regions of the parameter
   space. The asymptotic eigensolutions allow an accurate sensitivity
   analysis of the material spectrum under variation of the key physical
   parameters, including the cell aspect ratio, the ligament slenderness
   and the spatial ring density. Finally, the explicit dependence of the
   dispersion functions on the mechanical parameters may facilitate the
   custom design of specific spectral properties, such as the wave
   velocities and band gap amplitudes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   absolute value of the structure's Poisson's ratio decreased rapidly at
   first with an increasing compression strain epsilon(y) and then more
   slowly as it approached a constant of approximately 1 when epsilon(y) >

Abstract = {{Two new graphene allotropes, penta-graphene and phagraphene, have been
   proposed recently with unique electronic properties, e.g. quasi-direct
   band gap, direction-dependent Dirac cones and tunable Fermi velocities.
   However, their mechanical properties have not been fully studied yet. In
   this work, we have performed extensive density functional theory
   calculations to evaluate the mechanical properties of these two
   materials and compared with graphene, graphane, and pentaheptite. Our
   simulations show that the ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and the strain
   corresponding to UTS in both penta-graphene and phagraphene are smaller
   than that of graphene. A complete set of nonlinear anisotropic elastic
   constants up to the fourth order have been determined for these two
   allotropes using the tenets of continuum mechanics by fitting the
   stress-strain responses under uniaxial and biaxial tension until the
   point of fracture. We propose a new physical explanation for
   penta-graphene's negative Poisson's ratio based on the atomic
   de-wrinkling mechanism, driven by the local Hellman-Feynman force on
   each atom. Additionally, we used charge density plot and virtual
   Scanning Tunneling Microscopy images to analyze the initiation of
   fracture under uniaxial and biaxial tensile loading in these two
   materials. The charge density plots reveal that the charge density in
   sp(3) bonds is lower than that in the sp(2) bonds. In phagraphene, all
   the broken bonds were found to belong to the largest carbon ring in the
   structure.}},

   Considering a component requiring negative Poisson's ratio in NEMS, a
   graphene kirigami (GK) containing periodic re-entrant honeycombs is a
   natural option. This study demonstrates that a GK with specific auxetic
   property can be obtained by adjusting the sizes of its honeycombs. Using
   molecular dynamics experiments, the size effects on the auxetic
   behaviour of GK are investigated. In some cases, the auxetic difference
   between the hydrogenated GK and continuum kirigami (CK) is negligible,
   in which the results from macro CK can be used to predict auxetic
   behaviour of nano kirigami. Surface effect of GK is demonstrated from
   two aspects. One is to identify the difference of mechanical responses
   between the pure carbon GK and the hydrogenated GK at same geometry and
   loading condition. Another is from the difference of mechanical
   responses between the GK model and the CK model under same loading
   condition and geometric configuration. Generally, surface energy makes
   the GK possess higher variation of auxetic behaviour. It also results in
   higher modulus for the GK as comparing with that of the CK.}},

Title = {{Antenatal depressive symptoms and maternal health care utilisation: a
   population-based study of pregnant women in Ethiopia}},
Journal = {{BMC PREGNANCY AND CHILDBIRTH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{OCT 10}},
Abstract = {{Background: Depressive symptoms during pregnancy can have multiple
   adverse effects on perinatal outcomes, including maternal morbidity and
   mortality. The potential impact of antenatal depressive symptoms on
   maternal health care use, however, has been little explored in low and
   middle-income countries (LMICs). This paper investigates whether
   maternal health care utilisation varies as a function of antenatal
   depressive symptoms.
   Methods: In a population-based cross-sectional survey, 1311 women in the
   second or third trimesters of pregnancy were recruited in Sodo district,
   Gurage Zone, southern Ethiopia. Depressive symptoms were measured using
   a locally validated version of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9).
   The association between antenatal depressive symptoms and number of
   antenatal care (ANC) visits was examined using Poisson regression and
   the association of depression symptoms with emergency health care visits
   using negative binomial regression. Binary logistic regression was used
   to investigate the association of depressive symptoms with initiation,
   frequency and adequacy of antenatal care.
   Results: At PHQ-9 cut off of five or more, 29.5 \% of participants had
   depressive symptoms. The majority (60.5 \%) of women had attended for
   one or more ANC visits. Women with depressive symptoms had an increased
   risk of having more non-scheduled ANC visits (adjusted Risk Ratio (aRR)
   = 1.41, 95 \% CI: 1.20, 1.65), as well as an increased number of
   emergency health care visits to both traditional providers (aRR = 1.64,
   95 \% CI: 1.17, 2.31) and biomedical providers (aRR = 1.31, 95 \% CI:
   1.04, 1.69) for pregnancy-related emergencies. However, antenatal
   depressive symptoms were not significantly associated with initiation of
   ANC.
   Conclusions: Increased non-scheduled ANC and emergency health care
   visits may be indicators of undetected depression in antenatal women,
   and have the potential to overwhelm the capacity and resources of health
   care systems, particularly in LMICs. Establishment of a system for
   detection, referral and treatment of antenatal depression, integrated
   within existing antenatal care, may reduce antenatal morbidity and
   treatment costs and promote efficiency of the health care system.}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Currently, available results for the large deflection of circular
   isotropic membranes are valid for Poisson's ratio of 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4
   only. This paper explores the deflection of circular membranes when the
   membrane material is auxetic, i.e., when they possess negative Poisson's
   ratio and compared against conventional ones. Due to the multistage
   calculations involved in the exact method, a generic semi-empirical
   model is proposed to facilitate convenient and direct computation of the
   membrane deflection as a function of the radial distance; additionally,
   a specific semi-empirical model is given to provide a more accurate
   maximum deflection. Comparison of deflection distributions verifies the
   validity of the semi-empirical model vis-a-vis the exact model. The
   deflection of circular membrane increases with the diminishing effect as
   the Poisson's ratio of the membrane material becomes more negative.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},

Pages = {{181-203}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Count data often exhibit more zeros than predicted by common count
   distributions like the Poisson or negative binomial. In recent years,
   there has been considerable interest in methods for analyzing
   zero-inflated count data in longitudinal or other correlated data
   settings. A common approach has been to extend zero-inflated Poisson
   models to include random effects that account for correlation among
   observations. However, these models have been shown to have a few
   drawbacks, including interpretability of regression coefficients and
   numerical instability of fitting algorithms even when the data arise
   from the assumed model. To address these issues, we propose a model that
   parameterizes the marginal associations between the count outcome and
   the covariates as easily interpretable log relative rates, while
   including random effects to account for correlation among observations.
   One of the main advantages of this marginal model is that it allows a
   basis upon which we can directly compare the performance of standard
   methods that ignore zero inflation with that of a method that explicitly
   takes zero inflation into account. We present simulations of these
   various model formulations in terms of bias and variance estimation.
   Finally, we apply the proposed approach to analyze toxicological data of
   the effect of emissions on cardiac arrhythmias.}},

Title = {{Numerical analysis of frictional contact in the presence of a surface
   crack in a functionally graded coating substrate system}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{117}},
Pages = {{286-298}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, the frictional two-dimensional contact in the presence of
   a surface crack in a functionally graded coating substrate system is
   studied for rigid circular and flat stamps. A computational method based
   on finite difference (FD) is developed to evaluate the contact stresses
   and also the fracture parameters, which are K-I and K-II due to mixed
   mode fracture. The FD method applied here, uses a mapping technique
   which enable the analysis to consider any geometry of the punch and the
   crack. The Coulomb's dry friction law is considered in the contact area.
   The advantage of this study, compared to the efforts done by other
   researchers, is the ability to analysis a system with any arbitrary
   material properties distribution. Here, the elastic material properties
   distribution is estimated by TTO model which takes into account the
   interaction between the constituting phases as well, and the Poisson's
   ratio is assumed to be constant. The effect of material nonhomogeneity,
   the interaction of the constituting phases, the thickness of the graded
   coating layer, the size of the punch and the coefficient of friction is
   studied. In a general case, the findings of this research show that
   increasing the size of the punch, the coefficient of friction and the
   thickness of the graded layer increase the contact force and hence the
   contact stress; however, the interaction of the constituting phases does
   not have any effects on the contact parameters. In frictionless contact,
   the stress intensity factor is negative. In addition, increasing the
   coefficient of friction increases K-I but decreases K-II. These results
   are valid for any materials properties distribution. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Here three analytical models are presented through the layout of
   wine-rack mechanism in three dimensions (3D) where the conditions for
   these models to exhibit an extraordinary property, i.e. negative
   compressibility are specified. In particular, we show that these three
   models have adjustable compressibility that can be tailored for specific
   applications and can exhibit NLC, NAC, zero and negative Poisson's
   ratios in some cases. In this way, the potential of this 2D mechanism in
   designing 3D models with anomalous properties can be brought out.(C)

Abstract = {{On 2016 February 6 the South Taiwan earthquake (M-w 6.4) occurred in the
   Meinong District of Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan, at a depth of 17 km. It
   caused 117 fatalities and widespread damage to infrastructures,
   especially in the Tainan city. To clarify the generating mechanism of
   this damaging earthquake, we determined high-resolution 3-D images of P-
   and S-wave velocity (V-P, V-S) and Poisson's ratio (sigma) in the
   epicentral area. We used 105 712 P-and 61 250 S-wave arrival times of
   8279 local earthquakes (1.5 <= M <= 6.4) recorded at 41 seismic stations
   in South Taiwan during 2000-2011. In the upper crust (depth <= 10 km),
   the most remarkable feature is low-VP, low-VS and high-s anomalies in
   areas with known active faults in the southwestern and easternmost parts
   of Taiwan. In contrast, high-VP, high-VS and low-s anomalies become
   dominant in the lower crust. The hypocentre of the 2016 South Taiwan
   earthquake is located in a boundary zone where seismic velocity and
   Poisson's ratio change drastically in both the horizontal and vertical
   directions. Furthermore, the hypocentre is underlain by a vertically
   elongated high-s anomaly at depths of 23-40 km, which may reflect
   ascending fluids from the upper (or uppermost) mantle. The low-V and
   high-sigma anomalies in the upper crust coincide with areas of low heat
   flow, negative Bouguer gravity anomaly, and low magnetotelluric
   resistivity, which may reflect crustal fluids contained in the young
   fold-and-thrust belt. These results suggest that the 2016 South Taiwan
   earthquake was triggered by ascending fluids from dehydration of the
   subducting Eurasian slab, invading into active faults with a high
   loading rate.}},

Abstract = {{This paper treats the influence of auxetic foam on the crush response
   and energy absorption response of square-section tubes when subjected to
   uniaxial quasi-static loading. The study aims at quantifying the energy
   absorption capability of auxetic foam-filled square tubes for variations
   in wall thickness, initial height, aspect ratio and slenderness ratio of
   the tube. The capability of simulating the crush response of auxetic
   foam-filled tubes using the validated numerical models is also
   presented. Based on the experimental results, the influence of the
   auxeticfoam in the thin-walled square tubes was quantified in terms of
   energy absorption capacity, specific energy absorption and crush force
   efficiency. It is evident that a thicker tube filled with auxetic foam
   is preferable if the energy absorption level is the primary goal, yet
   this compromises the crush force efficiency. The outcome of this present
   study is the establishment of empirical models for estimating the
   quasi-static crushing response of auxetic foam-filled tubes with varying
   slenderness ratio and aspect ratio.}},

Abstract = {{A traditional aircraft is optimized for only one or two flight
   conditions, not for the entire flight envelope. In contrast, the wings
   of a bird can be reshaped to provide optimal performance at all flight
   conditions. Any change in an aircraft's configuration, in particular the
   wings, affects the aerodynamic performance, and optimal configurations
   can be obtained for each flight condition. Morphing technologies offer
   aerodynamic benefits for an aircraft over a wide range of flight
   conditions. The advantages of a morphing aircraft are based on an
   assumption that the additional weight of the morphing components is
   acceptable. Traditional mechanical and hydraulic systems are not
   considered good choices for morphing aircraft. Smart materials and
   structures have the advantages of high energy density, ease of control,
   variable stiffness, and the ability to tolerate large amounts of strain.
   These characteristics offer researchers and designers new possibilities
   for designing morphing aircraft. In this article, recent developments in
   the application of smart materials and structures to morphing aircraft
   are reviewed. Specifically, four categories of applications are
   discussed: actuators, sensors, controllers, and structures.}},

Title = {{A method to account for and estimate underreporting in crash frequency
   research}},
Journal = {{ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{95}},
Number = {{A}},
Pages = {{57-66}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Underreporting is a well-known issue in crash frequency research.
   However, statistical methods that can account for underreporting have
   received little attention in the published literature. This paper
   compares results from underreporting models to models that account for
   unobserved heterogeneity. The difference in the elasticities between the
   negative binomial underreporting model and random parameters negative
   binomial models, which accounts for unobserved heterogeneity in crash
   frequency models, are used as the basis for comparison. The paper also
   includes a comparison of the predicted number of unreported PDO crashes
   based on the negative binomial underreporting model with crashes that
   were reported to police but were not considered reportable to PennDOT to
   assess the ability of the underreporting models to predict
   non-reportable crashes.
   The data used in this study included 21,340 segments of two-lane rural
   highways that are owned and maintained by PennDOT. Reported accident
   frequencies over an eight year period (2005-2012) were included in the
   sample, producing a total of 170,468 segment-years of data. The results
   indicate that if a variable impacts both the true accident frequency and
   the probability of accidents being reported, statistical modeling
   methods that ignore underreporting produce biased regression
   coefficients. The magnitude of the bias in the present study (based on
   elasticities) ranged from 0.00-16.79\%. If the variable affects the true
   accident frequency, but not the probability of accidents being reported,
   the results from the negative binomial underreporting models are
   consistent with analysis methods that do not account for underreporting.

Abstract = {{Ross operation, i.e., the use of autologous pulmonary artery to replace
   diseased aortic valve, has been recently at the center of a vivid debate
   regarding its unjust underuse in the surgical practice. Keystone of the
   procedure regards the use of an autologous biologically available graft
   which would preserve the anticoagulative and tissue homeostatic
   functions normally exerted by the native leaflets and would harmoniously
   integrate in the vascular system, allowing for progressive somatic
   growth of aortic structures. With this respect, recently, some of the
   authors have successfully pioneered a large animal model of
   transposition of pulmonary artery in systemic pressure load in order to
   reproduce the clinical scenario in which this procedure might be applied
   and allow for the development and testing of different devices or
   techniques to improve the pulmonary autograft (PA) performance, by
   testing a bioresorbable mesh for PA reinforcement. In the present work,
   to support and supplement the in vivo animal experimentation, a
   mathematical model is developed in order to simulate the biomechanical
   changes in pulmonary artery subjected to systemic pressure load and
   reinforced with a combination of resorbable and auxetic synthetic
   materials. The positive biological effects on vessel wall remodeling,
   the regional somatic growth phenomena and prevention of dilatative
   degeneration have been analyzed. The theoretical outcomes show that a
   virtuous biomechanical cooperation between biological and synthetic
   materials takes place, stress-shielding guiding the physiological
   arterialization of vessel walls, consequently determining the overall
   success of the autograft system.}},

Title = {{To the question on the correctness of fractional derivative models in
   dynamic problems of viscoelastic bodies}},
Journal = {{MECHANICS RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{77}},
Pages = {{44-49}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The question is discussed on the possibility of utilization of such
   simplest fractional derivative viscoelastic models as Kelvin-Voigt and
   standard linear solid models for the description of the dynamic response
   of viscoelastic bodies, namely: beams and plates. It has been shown that
   the adoption of the Kelvin-Voigt model with the fractional derivative in
   conjunction with the time-independent Poisson's ratio for the
   description of the dynamic behavior of a viscoelastic Kirchhoff-Love
   plate results in the fact that the given problem is reduced to the
   equivalent problem on dynamic response of an elastic Kirchhoff Love
   plate in a viscoelastic medium with fractional damping. If Young's
   operator is preassigned via the fractional derivative Kelvin-Voigt model
   in conjunction with the time-independent coefficient of volume
   extension-compression for solving the same problem, what seems to be
   more logical from the point of view of experimental data, then such a
   model tunes out to be inapplicable at all, while if the shear operator
   is governed by the fractional derivative Kelvin-Voigt model, then such a
   model could describe the behavior of so-called auxetic materials with
   negative Poisson's ratios. As for the fractional derivative standard
   linear solid model, then it remains to be correct both with and without
   considering the volume relaxation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The Poisson's ratio of a material characterizes its response to uniaxial
   strain. Materials normally possess a positive Poisson's ratio - they
   contract laterally when stretched, and expand laterally when compressed.
   A negative Poisson's ratio is theoretically permissible but has not,
   with few exceptions of man-made bulk structures, been experimentally
   observed in any natural materials. Here, we show that the negative
   Poisson's ratio exists in the low-dimensional natural material black
   phosphorus and that our experimental observations are consistent with
   first-principles simulations. Through applying uniaxial strain along
   armchair direction, we have succeeded in demonstrating a cross-plane
   interlayer negative Poisson's ratio on black phosphorus for the first
   time. Meanwhile, our results support the existence of a cross-plane
   intralayer negative Poisson's ratio in the constituent phosphorene
   layers under uniaxial deformation along the zigzag axis, which is in
   line with a previous theoretical prediction. The phenomenon originates
   from the puckered structure of its in-plane lattice, together with
   coupled hinge-like bonding configurations.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of determining the extrema of Poisson's ratio for cubic
   crystals is considered, and analytical expressions are derived to
   calculate its extreme values. It follows from the obtained solution
   that, apart from extreme values at standard orientations, extreme values
   of Poisson's ratio can also be detected at special orientations deviated
   from the standard ones. The derived analytical expressions are used to
   calculate the extreme values of Poisson's ratio for a large number of
   known cubic crystals. The extremely high values of Poisson's ratio are
   shown to be characteristic of metastable crystals, such as crystals with
   the shape memory effect caused by martensitic transformation. These
   crystals are mainly represented by metallic alloys. For some crystals,
   the absolute extrema of Poisson's ratio can exceed the standard values,
   which are-1 for a standard minimum and +2 for a standard maximum.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of malocclusion
   on the quality of life (QOL) of adolescents in Brazil. We carried out a
   cross-sectional study in a sample population of 1015 schoolchildren aged
   12 to 15 years from Sao Luis, Maranhao, Brazil. The explanatory variable
   was malocclusion, evaluated on the basis of the normative need or the
   adolescent's self-perceived need for dental treatment. Normative need
   for dental treatment was determined by professional diagnosis, made on
   the basis of Angle's classification, the Dental Aesthetic Index, and
   other morphological deviations (e.g., posterior crossbite, posterior
   open bite, and deep overbite). We analyzed the impact of malocclusion on
   the QOL using the Portuguese version of the Oral Health Impact
   Profile-14. Associations were estimated by using the prevalence ratio
   (PR) in Poisson regression analysis, with hierarchized modeling. An
   alpha of 5\% was adopted as the criterion for statistical significance.
   The QOL of adolescents was impacted by malocclusion, classified by a
   normative need for treatment according to the Dental Aesthetic Index (PR
   = 1.27; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI] = 1.03-1.56) or by the

Abstract = {{We perform molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the effect of
   hydrogenation on the Poisson's ratio of graphene. It is found that the
   value of the Poisson's ratio of graphene can be effectively tuned from
   positive to negative by varying the percentage of hydrogenation.
   Specifically, the Poisson's ratio decreases with an increase in the
   percentage of hydrogenation, and reaches a minimum value of -0.04 when
   the percentage of hydrogenation is about 50\%. The Poisson's ratio
   starts to increase upon a further increase of the percentage of
   hydrogenation. The appearance of a minimum negative Poisson's ratio in
   the hydrogenated graphene is attributed to the suppression of the
   hydrogenation-induced ripples during the stretching of graphene. Our
   results demonstrate that hydrogenation is a valuable approach for tuning
   the Poisson's ratio from positive to negative in graphene.}},

Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{The present work reports the first attempt of developing auxetic
   structures using high performance fibres through knitting technology.
   Polyamide (PA) and para-aramid (p-AR) fibres and their combination were
   knitted in to purl structures using flatbed knitting machine, varying
   different structural (such as loop length, cover factor and yarn
   density) and machine parameters (such as take-down load). The influence
   of different parameters on negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) was thoroughly
   investigated. It was observed that NPR improved strongly with the
   increase in loop length of knitted structures. NPR also increased with
   the decrease in cover factor and increase in course density of knitted
   fabrics. An increase in take-down load also improved NPR for tightly
   knitted samples, but led to initial decrease and subsequent increase in
   NPR for medium and higher loop lengths; except for p-AR fabrics, which
   showed a decrease in NPR with take-down load for higher loop lengths.
   Tensile properties of the developed auxetic structures were also found
   to depend strongly on fibre type and loop length, and the highest
   tensile performance was achieved with lower loop lengths and p-AR yarns.
   The p-AR fabrics produced using lower loop length and lower take-down
   load resulted in the highest NPR of -0.713. Therefore, the developed
   knitted structures produced using high performance yarns and showing
   strong auxetic effects can have huge potential for industrial
   applications, especially in personal protection materials, such as cut
   resistance fabrics, bullet proof vest, helmets, and so on. (C) 2016

   Origami-based Cylindrical Structures}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{SEP 14}},
Abstract = {{Origami structures enrich the field of mechanical metamaterials with the
   ability to convert morphologically and systematically between
   two-dimensional (2D) thin sheets and three-dimensional (3D) spatial
   structures. In this study, an in-plane design method is proposed to
   approximate curved surfaces of interest with generalized Miura-ori
   units. Using this method, two combination types of crease lines are
   unified in one reprogrammable procedure, generating multiple types of
   cylindrical structures. Structural completeness conditions of the
   finite-thickness counterparts to the two types are also proposed. As an
   example of the design method, the kinematics and elastic properties of
   an origami-based circular cylindrical shell are analysed. The concept of
   Poisson's ratio is extended to the cylindrical structures, demonstrating
   their auxetic property. An analytical model of rigid plates linked by
   elastic hinges, consistent with numerical simulations, is employed to
   describe the mechanical response of the structures. Under particular
   load patterns, the circular shells display novel mechanical behaviour
   such as snap-through and limiting folding positions. By analysing the
   geometry and mechanics of the origami structures, we extend the design
   space of mechanical metamaterials and provide a basis for their
   practical applications in science and engineering.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},

Month = {{SEP 9}},
Abstract = {{In this study, we report the polymer-based graphene foams through
   combination of bottom-up assembly and simple triaxially buckled
   structure design. The resulting polymer-based graphene foams not only
   effectively transfer the functional properties of graphene, but also
   exhibit novel negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) behaviors due to the
   presence of buckled structure. Our results show that after the
   introduction of buckled structure, improvement in stretchability,
   toughness, flexibility, energy absorbing ability, hydrophobicity,
   conductivity, piezoresistive sensitivity and crack resistance could be
   achieved simultaneously. The combination of mechanical properties,
   multifunctional performance and unusual deformation behavior would lead
   to the use of our polymer-based graphene foams for a variety of novel
   applications in future such as stretchable capacitors or conductors,
   sensors and oil/water separators and so on.}},

Abstract = {{Studies concerning the relationship between the value of mu and a number
   of mechanical and thermal properties of amorphous polymers and glasses
   are analyzed with the aim to gain information about the origin of
   Poisson ratio mu in these systems. It is shown that the Poisson ratio
   features a more pronounced structure-sensitive behavior than the elastic
   modulus, although the Poisson ratio varies in a narrow range. The
   relationship between the Poisson ratio and the Gruneisen parameter is
   substantiated. In this context, the issue of the correlation between
   harmonic and anharmonic quantities is highlighted. The Poisson ratio is
   sensitive to lattice dynamics and atomic-molecular structures of
   polymers and glasses. When light atoms, for example, hydrogen atoms in
   polyethylene, are replaced with larger and heavier atoms on pendant
   chains of the macromolecular backbone, anharmonicity increases; that is,
   lattice Gruneisen parameter gamma (D) increases. As a result, the
   Poisson ratio increases because these quantities are related
   unambiguously. Conditions of preparing an isotropic material with a
   negative Poisson ratio (mu < 0) are discussed. The relative ultimate
   strain of the interatomic bond in glassy systems is a function of the
   Poisson ratio solely. The frozen elastic strain of amorphous polymers
   and glasses is likewise a single-valued function of the Poisson ratio.
   The discussed phenomena are interpreted in terms of the Kuz'menko and
   Pineda theories and the Berlin-Rothenburg-Bathurst model.}},

Title = {{Elastic networks to model auxetic properties of cellular materials}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES}},

Volume = {{115}},
Pages = {{481-488}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Elastic networks model that is used to model a class of two-dimensional
   cellular structures including reentrant and regular honeycombs is
   considered. Two mechanical parameters (longitudinal stiffness and
   torsional stiffness) are used to describe the interaction between the
   nodes in a lattice for a given geometry. Effective properties with
   emphasis on the auxeticy of solid materials corresponding to the
   considered microstructures are investigated. A method based on
   comparison of the strain energies at macro and microscale is proposed to
   determine the effective properties of continuum and can be applied to
   other cellular materials. All components of stiffness tensor are
   determined as functions of interaction parameters. Thus, the general
   parametric study of the honeycomb structures is made possible.
   Re-entrant honeycomb structures demonstrate the auxetic properties at
   any combination of parameters whereas the regular honeycombs can have
   both positive and negative Poisson's ratios. Comparison with other model
   shows that the 2-parameter elastic networks can successfully describe
   isotropic materials. However in cases of higher anisotropy this model
   can be used within certain limitations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) may experience falls and/or
   fractures as a result of disease symptoms. There are limited data
   available from long-term studies estimating the incidence of
   falls/fractures in patients with PD. The objective was to compare the
   incidence rate of falls/fractures in PD patients with non-PD patients in
   a US population. This was a retrospective study using a US-based claims
   database (Truven Health MarketScan (R)) that compared the incidence rate
   of falls/fractures in PD subjects with non-PD subjects. The study period
   included the 12 months prior to index date (defined as earliest PD
   diagnosis {[}International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision,
   Clinical Modification code 332.0]) and a postindex period to the end of
   data availability. Fractures were defined by inpatient/outpatient claims
   as a principal or secondary diagnosis and accompanying procedure codes
   during the postindex period. Incidence rates and 95\% CIs for
   falls/fractures were calculated as the number of events per 10,000
   person-years of follow-up using negative binomial or Poisson regression
   models. Twenty-eight thousand two hundred and eighty PD subjects were
   matched to non-PD subjects for the analysis (mean {[}SD] age, 71.4
   {[}11.8] years; 53\% male). A higher incidence rate (adjusted for
   comorbidities and medications) of all fall/fracture cases and by fall
   and fracture types was observed for PD subjects versus non-PD subjects;
   the overall adjusted incidence rate ratio comparing PD to non-PD
   subjects was 2.05; 95\% CI, 1.88-2.24. The incidence rate of
   falls/fractures was significantly higher in subjects with PD compared
   with non-PD subjects in a US population.}},

Abstract = {{Assessment of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) after liver
   transplantation (LT) has been limited by the lack of a multicenter study
   with detailed clinical information. An integrated database linking
   information from the University HealthSystem Consortium and the Organ
   Procurement and Transplant Network was analyzed using multivariate
   Poisson regression to assess factors associated with 30- and 90-day MACE
   after LT (February 2002 to December 2012). MACE was defined as
   myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure (HF), atrial fibrillation
   (AF), cardiac arrest, pulmonary embolism, and/or stroke. Of 32 810
   recipients, MACE hospitalizations occurred in 8\% and 11\% of patients
   at 30 and 90 days, respectively. Recipients with MACE were older and
   more likely to have a history of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH),
   alcoholic cirrhosis, MI, HF, stroke, AF and pulmonary and chronic renal
   disease than those without MACE. In multivariable analysis, age >65
   years (incidence rate ratio {[}IRR] 2.8, 95\% confidence interval
   {[}95\% CI] 1.8-4.4), alcoholic cirrhosis (IRR 1.6, 95\% CI 1.2-2.2),
   NASH (IRR 1.6, 95\% CI 1.1-2.4), pre-LT creatinine (IRR 1.1, 95\% CI
   1.04-1.2), baseline AF (IRR 6.9, 95\% CI 5.0-9.6) and stroke (IRR 6.3,
   95\% CI 1.6-25.4) were independently associated with MACE. MACE was
   associated with lower 1-year survival after LT (79\% vs. 88\%, p <
   0.0001). In a national database, MACE occurred in 11\% of LT recipients
   and had a negative impact on survival. Pre-LT AF and stroke
   substantially increase the risk of MACE, highlighting potentially
   high-risk LT candidates.
   Using an integrated database that links information from the University
   HealthSystem Consortium and the OPTN, the authors assess factors
   associated with 30- and 90-day major adverse cardiac events after liver
   transplantation and discover that cardiac events occur in 11\% of liver
   transplant recipients, and that a history of atrial fibrillation and
   stroke are significant predictors of these events.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic cellular materials are modern materials which have some unique
   and superior mechanical properties. As a consequence of the structural
   deformation of their internal cellular structure they exhibit a negative
   Poisson's ratio, i.e. they significantly increase in volume when
   stretched and vice versa. The effect of negative Poisson's ratio is
   useful in many applications to enhance certain physical properties such
   as the density, stiffness, fracture toughness, energy absorption and
   damping. These properties can be further tailored by using variable cell
   geometry and density distribution, which can be achieved with
   functionally graded porosity of auxetic materials. This review paper
   provides the state-of-the-art overview of the auxetic materials, their
   development, most common geometries, fabrication methods, mechanical
   properties, applications and further possibilities for their

Abstract = {{Our aim was to evaluate the factors affecting the mortality of patients

   study. Among these patients, 70 (70\%) underwent below-knee amputation,
   whereas 30 (30\%) underwent above-knee amputation. Eleven (15.7\%) of
   the 70 patients who underwent below-knee amputation and 12 (40\%) of the
   30 patients who underwent above-knee amputation (P = .008) were
   deceased. After multivariable Poisson regression analysis, female gender
   (risk ratio {[}RR] = 2.00, 95\% CI = 1.07-3.74) and a neutrophil
   lymphocyte ratio (NLR) less than 6.8 (RR = 5.12, 95\% CI = 1.86-14.08)

   6.8 was used as a cutoff point for the NLR (area under the curve = 0.73,
   95\% CI = 0.62-0.85), with a sensitivity, specificity, positive
   predictive value, and negative predictive value of 83\%, 66\%, 57\%, and
   92\%, respectively. The NLR and female gender were found to be
   independent factors that are related to increased mortality in patients
   who underwent lower limb amputation due to diabetic and/or ischemic
   causes. The coexistence of congestive heart failure and the amputation
   level (above knee) were found to be predictors of mortality in

Abstract = {{This paper presents a gravity model of student migration flows to higher
   education institutions (HEIs) in Ireland. The analysis is performed on a
   novel dataset containing detailed information on a range of push' and
   pull' factors, allowing one to estimate the effects of a number of
   important school-level characteristics on these flows. This is achieved
   by estimating and comparing a fixed-effects Poisson model and two
   conditional fixed-effects negative binomial models and selecting the
   best model on the basis of the Akaike information criterion (AIC). The
   preferred negative binomial model accounts for over-dispersion in the
   student flow data and allows for estimation of the parameter
   coefficients of the HEI-invariant characteristics. The analysis suggests
   that while geography plays a very important role in explaining student
   flows, so too do a range of school-level characteristics. Furthermore,
   it is found that distance has a differential impact across HEIs and HEI
   types with important implications for policy-makers and HEI managers.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an effective prevention
   tool for people at substantial risk of acquiring human immunodeficiency
   virus (HIV). To monitor the current state of PrEP use among men who have
   sex with men (MSM), we report on willingness to use PrEP and PrEP
   utilization. To assess whether the MSM subpopulations at highest risk
   for infection have indications for PrEP according to the 2014 clinical
   guidelines, we estimated indications for PrEP for MSM by demographics.
   Methods. We analyzed data from the 2014 cycle of the National HIV
   Behavioral Surveillance (NHBS) system among MSM who tested HIV negative
   in NHBS and were currently sexually active. Adjusted prevalence ratios
   and 95\% confidence intervals were estimated from log-linked Poisson
   regression with generalized estimating equations to explore differences
   in willingness to take PrEP, PrEP use, and indications for PrEP.
   Results. Whereas over half of MSM said they were willing to take PrEP,
   only about 4\% reported using PrEP. There was no difference in
   willingness to take PrEP between black and white MSM. PrEP use was
   higher among white compared with black MSM and among those with greater
   education and income levels. Young, black MSM were less likely to have
   indications for PrEP compared with young MSM of other races/ethnicities.
   Conclusions. Young, black MSM, despite being at high risk of HIV
   acquisition, may not have indications for PrEP under the current
   guidelines. Clinicians may need to consider other factors besides risk
   behaviors such as HIV incidence and prevalence in subgroups of their

Volume = {{3}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The emerging concept of mechanical meta-materials has received
   increasing attention during the last few years partially due to the
   advances in additive manufacturing techniques that have enabled
   fabricating materials with arbitrarily complex micro/nano-architectures.
   The rationally designed micro/nano-architecture of mechanical
   meta-materials gives rise to unprecedented or rare mechanical properties
   that could be exploited to create advanced materials with novel
   functionalities. This paper presents an overview of the recent
   developments in the area of mechanical meta-materials. Extremal
   materials that are extremely stiff in certain modes of deformation,
   while extremely soft in other modes of deformation are discussed first.
   Penta-mode, dilational, and other auxetic meta-materials are all
   discussed within the context of extremal materials. Negative
   meta-materials are presented next with special focus on materials with
   negative compressibility and negative stiffness. Ultra-property
   meta-materials are the topic of the following section that covers
   ultra-light, ultra-stiff, and ultra-tough materials. Finally, the
   emerging areas of research in mechanical meta-materials including
   active, adaptive, programmable, and origami-based mechanical
   meta-materials are reviewed. This paper concludes with some suggestions
   for future research.}},

Volume = {{54}},

Abstract = {{Possessing the unique properties of lower mass and higher performances,
   the structure with Negative Poisson's Ratio (NPR) can be widely used in
   aerospace and vehicle industry. By combing the NPR structure filled core
   and the traditional crash box, a novel NPR crash box is first proposed
   in this work to improve the performances of the crash box. The
   performances of the novel NPR crash box are fully studied by comparing
   to the traditional crash box and the aluminum foam filled crash box. A
   parameterized model of the NPR crash box, which integrates the design
   parameters of the basic NPR cell structure, is built to improve the
   analysis and optimization efficiency, the accuracy of the parameterized
   model is also verified by comparing to traditional FEM model.
   Multi-objective optimization model of the NPR crash box is established
   by combining the parameterized model, optimal Latin square design method
   and response surface model approach. Non-dominated sorting genetic
   algorithm-II (NSGA-II) is then applied to optimize the design parameters
   of the basic NPR cell structure to improve the performances of the NPR
   crash box. The results indicate that the novel NPR crash box can improve
   the performances of the crash box remarkably and the combination of
   parameterized model and multi-objective genetic algorithms optimize the
   NPR crash box efficiently. The presented new method also serves as a
   good example for other application and optimization of NPR structure.}},

Title = {{Is outdoor work associated with elevated rates of cerebrovascular
   disease mortality? A cohort study based on iron-ore mining}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL MEDICINE AND TOXICOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{AUG 26}},
Abstract = {{Background: A cohort study that examined iron ore mining found negative
   associations between cumulative working time employed underground and
   several outcomes, including mortality of cerebrovascular diseases. In
   this cohort study, and using the same group of miners, we examined
   whether work in an outdoor environment could explain elevated
   cerebrovascular disease rates.
   Methods: This study was based on a Swedish iron ore mining cohort
   consisting of 13,000 workers. Poisson regression models were used to
   generate smoothed estimates of standardized mortality ratios and
   adjusted rate ratios, both models by cumulative exposure time in outdoor
   work.
   Results: The adjusted rate ratio between employment classified as
   outdoor work >= 25 years and outdoor work 0-4 years was 1.62 (95 \% CI
   1.07-2.42). The subgroup underground work >= 15 years deviated most in
   occurrence of cerebrovascular disease mortality compared with the
   external reference population: SMR (0.70 (95 \% CI 0.56-0.85)).
   Conclusions: Employment in outdoor environments was associated with
   elevated rates of cerebrovascular disease mortality. In contrast, work
   in tempered underground employment was associated with a protecting
   effect.}},

Title = {{Characterization of Nanodiamond Seeded Interdigitated Electrodes using
   Impedance Spectroscopy of Pure Water}},
Journal = {{ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{210}},
Pages = {{375-382}},
Month = {{AUG 20}},
Abstract = {{We have recently demonstrated enhancement in sensitivity of an impedance
   biosensor by seeding detonation nanodiamonds (DNDs) at the
   interdigitated electrodes (IDEs). Here, impedance spectroscopy of pure
   water is carried out at such IDEs to reveal the role of the DNDs. The
   impedance data is fit to an equivalent circuit model consisting of a
   geometrical resistance in series with a distributed element for
   Havriliak-Negami (HN) relaxation, and in parallel with a geometrical
   capacitance. Concurrently, the motion of charges across the IDEs is
   modeled as Plank-Nerst-Poisson anomalous diffusion across two partially
   blocking conductive electrodes. Results show that the DNDs (having a
   positive zeta potential) at the IDEs reduce the geometrical resistance
   to less than half, and the time constant for the HN relaxation to less
   than one-fourth. These changes propose doubled diffusion coefficient and
   mobility of the charged species, and reduced dielectric relaxation time
   constant. The diffusion modeling suggests insignificant increase in
   charged mobile species upon DND seeding. It is hypothesized that the
   DNDs, which have a positive zeta potential, when seeded on gold and
   oxide surfaces with a negative zeta potential, reduce the electrostatic
   force acting on the diffuse layer ions, and increase their mobility. (C)

   material}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{AUG 19}},
Abstract = {{By using density functional theory with generalized gradient
   approximation, we have carried out detailed investigations of
   two-dimensional BxNy nanomaterials in the Cairo pentagonal tiling
   geometry fully composed of pentagons (penta-BxNy). Only penta-BN and BN2
   planar structures are dynamically stable without imaginary modes in
   their phonon spectra. Their stabilities have been further evaluated by
   formation energy analysis, first-principles molecular dynamics
   simulation, and mechanical stability analysis. Penta-BN2 is superior to
   penta-BN in structural stability. Its stability analysis against
   oxidization and functional group adsorption as well as its synthesizing
   reaction path analysis show possibilities in fabricating penta-BN2 on
   experiment. Furthermore, the penta-BN2 could be transferred from
   metallic to semiconducting by ionizing or covalently binding an electron
   per dinitrogen. Also, it has been found to have superior mechanical
   properties, such as the negative Poisson's ratio and the comparable
   stiffness as that of hexagonal h-BN sheet. These studies on the
   stabilities, electronic properties, and mechanical properties suggest
   penta-BN2 as an attractive material to call for further studies on both
   theory and experiment.}},

Title = {{Sexually transmitted infections after bereavement - a population-based
   cohort study}},
Journal = {{BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{Background: Loss of a loved one has consistently been associated with
   various health risks. Little is however known about its relation to
   sexually transmitted infections (STIs).
   Methods: We conducted a population-based cohort study during 1987-2012
   using the Swedish Multi-Generation Register, including 3,002,209 women
   aged 10-44 years. Bereavement was defined as death of a child, parent,
   sibling or spouse (N = 979,579, 33 \%). STIs were defined as hospital
   visits with an STI as main or secondary diagnosis. Poisson regression
   and negative binomial regression were used to estimate incidence rate
   ratios (IRRs) and 95 \% confidence intervals (CIs) of STIs, comparing
   incidence rates of women who had experienced loss to those who had not.
   Results: Bereaved women were at significantly higher risk of nearly all
   STIs studied. The relative risk of any STI was highest during the first
   year after loss (IRR: 1.45, 95 \% CI: 1.27-1.65) and predominantly among
   women with subsequent onset of psychiatric disorders after bereavement
   (IRR: 2.61, 95 \% CI: 2.00-3.34). Notably, a consistent excess risk,
   persisting for over five years, was observed for acute salpingitis (IRR:
   1.28, 95 \% CI: 1.13-1.44), a severe complication of bacterial STIs.
   Conclusion: These data suggest that women who have experienced
   bereavement are at increased risk of STIs.}},

Abstract = {{Rate differences are an important effect measure in biostatistics and
   provide an alternative perspective to rate ratios. When the data are
   event counts observed during an exposure period, adjusted rate
   differences may be estimated using an identity-link Poisson generalised
   linear model, also known as additive Poisson regression. A problem with
   this approach is that the assumption of equality of mean and variance
   rarely holds in real data, which often show overdispersion. An additive
   negative binomial model is the natural alternative to account for this;
   however, standard model-fitting methods are often unable to cope with
   the constrained parameter space arising from the non-negativity
   restrictions of the additive model. In this paper, we propose a novel
   solution to this problem using a variant of the expectation-conditional
   maximisation-either algorithm. Our method provides a reliable way to fit
   an additive negative binomial regression model and also permits flexible
   generalisations using semi-parametric regression functions. We
   illustrate the method using a placebo-controlled clinical trial of
   fenofibrate treatment in patients with type II diabetes, where the
   outcome is the number of laser therapy courses administered to treat
   diabetic retinopathy. An R package is available that implements the
   proposed method. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an experimental investigation of the dynamic
   thermo-mechanical and impact properties of helical auxetic yarns (HAYs).
   A series of thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) core fibres fabricated
   using an extrusion process have been wrapped with either
   ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) wrap or stainless
   steel wire wrap to form helical auxetic yarns. Dynamic mechanical
   analysis (DMA) measurements indicated that the core/wrap diameter ratio
   and the initial wrap angle influenced significantly the dynamic
   thermo-mechanical behaviour of HAYs. The impact test results have shown
   that the fibre property, impact velocity and the initial wrap angle had
   great effect on the impact response of a HAY. Importantly, in this work
   it is shown that an optimal wrap angle can be found to give the best
   combination of stiffness, energy absorption and auxetic performance of
   HAYs. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{This study aimed at investigating how ice templating conditions affected
   the shrinkage, the microstructure, and the mechanical properties of
   cellulose nanofibril (NFC) foams. Enzymatic and TEMPO-oxidized NFC foams
   were fabricated using two solidification techniques, i.e., quenching NFC
   suspensions in temperature-controlled baths, and mechanical stirring of
   NFC suspensions during solidification followed by quenching, prior to
   freeze-drying. Foams prepared by direct quenching using stabilized
   TEMPO-oxidized NFC suspensions exhibited higher specific mechanical
   properties and more regular anisotropic cells with unimodal size than
   enzymatic NFC foams. In addition, NFC concentration and NFC morphology
   severely affected the foam shrinkage and the geometry of foam cells.
   Controlling the solidification had also a drastic effect on the foam
   microstructure, e.g. foams prepared by mechanical stirring and quenching
   exhibited bimodal cell size and enhanced mechanical properties. The
   compressive behavior of foams showed successive elastic,
   strain-hardening and densification regimes with auxetic effects and
   strain localization. Both the elastic modulus and the yield stress were
   power-law functions of the foam relative density whose exponents reached
   unusual high values for enzymatic NFC foams, potentially because of
   their chaotic microstructures. The evolution of a typical TEMPO-oxidized
   NFC foam was studied under compression using X-ray microtomography,
   unveiling deformation mechanisms at the cell scale. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Volume = {{30}},

Month = {{AUG 10}},
Abstract = {{The thermodynamic, mechanical and dynamic properties of TcB3 and MoB3
   are systematically investigated at high-pressure by first-principles
   within density functional theory (DFT). The calculated formation
   enthalpies are negative for TcB3 with considered structures under the
   pressure range from 0 to 100 GPa. Triboride hP4-TcB3 (i.e., TcB3 in
   hP4-OsB3 type structure) has the lowest formation enthalpy of -1.44 eV
   under ambient condition. The largest shear modulus of 240 GPa and
   smallest Poisson's ratio of 0.20 for oP16-TcB3 are comparable to those
   of 267 GPa and 0.15 for ReB2. The calculated elastic constants show that
   MB3 (M=Tc and Mo) are mechanically stable at ambient conditions, except
   for mP8-MoB3. The estimated high hardness of 33.4 and 33.1 GPa for
   oP16-TcB3 and hP4-TcB3, respectively, are reported for the first time.
   The calculated lattice parameters for MoB3 are in good agreement with
   the previously theoretical and experimental studies. Below 13 GPa,
   hP16-MoB3 and hR24-MoB3 are thermodynamically more favorable than MoB3
   in other structures. A pressure-induced phase transition is predicted at
   13 GPa from hP16-MoB3 and hR24-MoB3 to hP4-MoB3. Above 13 GPa, hP4-MoB3
   becomes the thermodynamically most stable phase among MoB3 in considered
   structures. All compounds with considered structures are metallic, and
   the electronic structures of MB3 are governed by a strong hybridization
   between M-4d and B-2p states. The strong and directional covalent
   bonding between M-4d and B-2p as well as the strong interlayer
   interactions of boron layers are correlated to the high hardness of 38.0
   and 38.4 GPa for hP16-MoB3 and hR24-MoB3, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{We describe a new class of negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) open cell
   PU-PE foams produced by blocking the shape memory effect in the polymer.
   Contrary to classical NPR open cell thermoset and thermoplastic foams
   that return to their auxetic phase after reheating (and therefore limit
   their use in technological applications), this new class of cellular
   solids has a permanent negative Poisson's ratio behavior, generated
   through multiple shape memory (mSM) treatments that lead to a fixity of
   the topology of the cell foam. The mSM-NPR foams have Poisson's ratio
   values similar to the auxetic foams prior their return to the
   conventional phase, but compressive stress strain curves similar to the
   ones of conventional foams. The results show that by manipulating the
   shape memory effect in polymer microstructures it is possible to obtain
   new classes of materials with unusual deformation mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{Jounce bumpers in automotive suspension can absorb impact energy and
   improve Noise, Vibration and Harshness (NVH) performance of entire
   vehicle. In this paper, a negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) structure was
   introduced and applied on the jounce bumper. The NPR jounce bumper can
   be primarily described by few parameters and is convenient for design,
   analysis and optimization. Three NPR jounce bumper prototypes were
   manufactured and tested. The test results of prototype 1 indicated that
   the NPR jounce bumpers had excellent viscoelasticity characteristic to
   absorb impact energy owing to its high damping. Compared with
   traditional jounce bumper, the NPR jounce bumper can achieve similar
   mechanical behavior but with a smoother load-displacement curve, which
   is beneficial to the NVH performance. Moreover, numerical calculation
   was conducted. Its results were fairly reliable for the prediction of
   mechanical behavior of NPR jounce bumper. The numerical results implied
   the stress concentration areas and the displacement of failure. The
   deformation shapes of NPR jounce bumper were also discussed. Finally,
   prototypes 2 and 3 manufactured from 3D printing technology were tested
   to explore the possibility of the application of 3D printing technology
   on NPR structures. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An innovative three-dimensional (3D) auxetic structure based on 2D
   re-entrant honeycombs was developed in this article. A sample of the
   proposed structure made of acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) was
   fabricated through 3D printing technology, and a compression test was
   performed on it. Meanwhile, the unit cell required for the
   finite-element (FE) analysis was determined to simulate the auxetic
   behavior of the proposed structure. Both experimental and numerical
   results showed that the 3D structure can achieve a negative Poisson's
   ratio (NPR) in two principal orthogonal coordinate directions when it
   was compressed along the other principal axis. A systematic numerical
   simulation was performed through the experimentally validated finite
   element models to analyze the effects of structural parameters (i.e.,
   top-view reentrant angle and lateral-view re-entrant angle) and
   deformation on the auxetic behavior. Numerical results revealed that
   this structure can achieve a negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) under large
   deformation and the structural parameters and compression strain have
   significant effects on the auxetic behavior. Our structure, with large
   flexibility in design, is based on very simple initial geometric shapes.
   This analysis can provide useful information for the design, fabrication
   of this kind of 3D auxetic structure, which is promising in some
   technical applications. (C) 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA,

Abstract = {{While the maximum bending moment, and hence maximum bending stress, of a
   fully clamped elliptical plate under uniform load is independent from
   the Poisson's ratio of the plate material, the same cannot be said so
   when the plate is simply supported. This paper develops a simple but
   sufficiently accurate model for evaluating the bending stresses along
   the principal axes of a simply supported elliptical under uniform load.
   Plotted results suggest that bending stresses at plate center along the
   longer principal axis is minimized by the use of highly auxetic
   materials if the elliptical plate is almost circular but the use of
   mildly auxetic material is preferred if the aspect ratio of the
   elliptical plate is very high. Results also reveal that bending stresses
   at plate center along the shorter principal axis is minimized when the
   plate material is highly auxetic. Upon considering the von Mises stress
   state as the effective stress, it was found that the maximum effective
   stress is reduced with the use of auxetic and conventional materials for
   simply supported elliptical plates of low and high aspect ratios,
   respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials have previously been shown to enhance various
   performances due to its unusual property of becoming fatter when
   uniaxially stretched and thinner when uniaxially compressed (i.e., the
   materials exhibit a negative Poisson's ratio). The current study focuses
   on assessing the potential of an auxetic material to enhance the
   buckling capacity of a rectangular plate under uniaxial compression. The
   in-plane translational restraint along the unloaded edges that was often
   neglected in open literature is taken into consideration in our buckling
   model proposed in this study. The closed-form expressions for the
   critical buckling coefficient of the rectangle are provided and the
   predicted results agree well with those determined by the finite element
   method. Furthermore, the results indicate that the buckling performance
   of a rectangular plate under uniaxial compression can be significantly
   improved by replacing the traditional material that has a positive
   Poisson's ratio with an auxetic material when there is in-plane
   translation restraint along the unloaded edges. (C) 2016 Chinese Society

Abstract = {{Research that examines the associations of psychosocial factors with

   Jackson Heart Study (JHS) data, we examined associations of negative
   affect and stress with incident hypertension and blood pressure (BP)
   progression among AA.
   Our sample consisted of 1,656 normotensive participants at baseline
   (2000-2004) (mean age 47 +/- 12; 61\% women). We investigated
   associations of negative affect (cynical distrust, anger-in, anger-out,
   and depressive symptoms) and stress (perceived stress, weekly stress
   inventory (WSI)-event, WSI-impact, and major life events) with BP
   progression (an increase by one BP stage as defined by JNC VII) and
   incident hypertension by examination 2 (2005-2008). Poisson regression
   analysis was utilized to examine the prevalence ratios (PRs; 95\%
   confidence interval (CI)) of BP tracking and incident hypertension with
   psychosocial factors, adjusting for baseline age, sex, socioeconomic
   status (SES), and hypertension risk factors.
   Fifty-six percentage of the sample (922 cases) had BP progression from
   2005 to 2008. After adjustment for age, sex, and SES, a high anger-out
   score was associated with a 20\% increased risk of BP progression
   compared to a low anger-out score (PR 1.20; 95\% CI 1.05-1.36). High
   depressive symptoms score was associated with BP progression in the age,
   sex, and SES-adjusted model (PR 1.14; 95\% CI 1.00-1.30). High WSI-event
   scores were associated with BP progression in the fully adjusted model
   (PR 1.21; 95\% CI 1.04-1.40). We did not observe significant
   associations with any of the psychosocial measures and incident
   hypertension.
   Psychosocial factors were associated with BP progression, with the
   strongest evidence for number of stressful events that occurred.}},

Abstract = {{Entropic surfaces represented by fluctuating two-dimensional (2D)
   membranes are predicted to have desirable mechanical properties when
   unstressed, including a negative Poisson's ratio ({''}auxetic{''}
   behavior). Herein, we present calculations of the strain-dependent
   Poisson ratio of self-avoiding 2D membranes demonstrating desirable
   auxetic properties over a range of mechanical strain. Finite size
   membranes with unclamped boundary conditions have positive Poisson's
   ratio due to spontaneous non-zero mean curvature, which can be
   suppressed with an explicit bending rigidity in agreement with prior
   findings. Applying longitudinal strain along a singular axis to this
   system suppresses this mean curvature and the entropic out-of-plane
   fluctuations, resulting in a molecular-scale mechanism for realizing a
   negative Poisson's ratio above a critical strain, with values
   significantly more negative than the previously observed zero-strain
   limit for infinite sheets. We find that auxetic behavior persists over
   surprisingly high strains of more than 20\% for the smallest surfaces,
   with desirable finite-size scaling producing surfaces with negative
   Poisson's ratio over a wide range of strains. These results promise the
   design of surfaces and composite materials with tunable Poisson's ratio
   by prestressing platelet inclusions or controlling the surface rigidity
   of a matrix of 2D materials.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the good balance between high efficiency and accuracy, meta-model
   based optimization algorithm is an important global optimization
   category and has been widely applied. To better solve the highly
   nonlinear and computation intensive engineering optimization problems,
   an enhanced hybrid and adaptive meta-model based global optimization
   (E-HAM) is first proposed in this work. Important region update method
   (IRU) and different sampling size strategies are proposed in the
   optimization method to enhance the performance. By applying self-moving
   and scaling strategy, the important region will be updated adaptively
   according to the search results to improve the resulting precision and
   convergence rate. Rough sampling strategy and intensive sampling
   strategy are applied at different stages of the optimization to improve
   the search efficiently and avoid results prematurely gathering in a
   small design space. The effectiveness of the new optimization algorithm
   is verified by comparing to six optimization methods with different
   variables bench mark optimization problems. The E-HAM optimization
   method is then applied to optimize the design parameters of the
   practical negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) crash box in this work. The
   results indicate that the proposed E-HAM has high accuracy and
   efficiency in optimizing the computation intensive problems and can be
   widely used in engineering industry.}},

Abstract = {{African Americans exhibit a lower degree of nocturnal blood pressure
   (BP) dipping compared with Whites, but the reasons for reduced BP
   dipping in this group are not fully understood. The aim of this study
   was to identify psychosocial factors associated with BP dipping in a
   population-based cohort of African Americans.
   This cross-sectional study included 668 Jackson Heart Study (JHS)
   participants with valid 24-hour ambulatory BP data and complete data on
   psychosocial factors of interest including stress, negative emotions,
   and psychosocial resources (e.g., perceived support). The association of
   each psychosocial factor with BP dipping percentage and nondipping
   status (defined as < 10\% BP dipping) was assessed using linear and
   Poisson regression models, respectively, with progressive adjustment for
   demographic, socioeconomic, biomedical, and behavioral factors.
   The prevalence of nondipping was 64\%. Higher depressive symptoms,
   higher hostility, and lower perceived social support were associated
   with a lower BP dipping percentage in unadjusted models and after
   adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, and mean 24-hour systolic BP
   (P < 0.05). Only perceived support was associated with BP dipping
   percentage in fully adjusted models. Also, after full multivariable
   adjustment, the prevalence ratio for nondipping BP associated with 1 SD
   (7.1 unit) increase in perceived support was 0.93 (95\% CI: 0.88-0.99).
   No other psychosocial factors were associated with nondipping status.
   Lower perceived support was associated with reduced BP dipping in this
   study. The role of social support as a potentially modifiable
   determinant of nocturnal BP dipping warrants further investigation.}},

Journal = {{CARBON}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{105}},
Pages = {{323-329}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Searching for the Dirac materials with ultrasoftness is crucial for
   flexible electronics applications. Based on first-principles
   calculations, we propose a new carbon allotrope (named as ph-graphene)
   with a penta-hexagonal framework, which is energetically more favorable
   than the penta-graphene composing surely of pentagons and some of
   already-synthesized carbon allotropes. Ph-graphene has an in-plane
   stiffness of 27.75 GPa.nm, smaller than those of graphene and
   penta-graphene by one order. The famous isotropic Dirac cones are well
   preserved in the ultrasoft ph-graphene, exhibiting delocalized feature
   of p(z) orbits with the Fermi velocity of 2.8 x 10(5) m/s. Additionally,
   surface hydrogenation alters drastically the electronic and mechanical
   properties of ph-graphene, resulting in electronic spin-polarization and
   anisotropic negative Poisson's ratios sequentially with the increase of
   hydrogenation concentrations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   behaviour of the two gradient honeycomb configurations is simulated
   using full-scale Finite Elements and Component Mode Synthesis (CMS)
   substructuring. Samples of the gradient honeycombs have been
   manufactured by means of 3D printing techniques, and subjected to modal
   analysis using scanning laser vibrometry. We observe a general good
   comparison between the numerical and the experimental results. A
   numerical parametric analysis shows the effect of the gradient topology

Abstract = {{The population mixing hypothesis proposes that childhood leukaemia (CL)
   might be a rare complication of a yet unidentified subclinical
   infection. Large population influxes into previously isolated rural
   areas may foster localised epidemics of the postulated infection causing
   a subsequent increase of CL. While marked population growth after a
   period of stability was central to the formulation of the hypothesis and
   to the early studies on population mixing, there is a lack of objective
   criteria to define such growth patterns. We aimed to determine whether
   periods of marked population growth coincided with increases in the risk
   of CL in Swiss municipalities. We identified incident cases of CL aged
   0-15 years for the period 1985-2010 from the Swiss Childhood Cancer
   Registry. Annual data on population counts in Swiss municipalities were
   obtained for 1980-2010. As exposures, we defined (1) cumulative
   population growth during a 5-year moving time window centred on each
   year (1985-2010) and (2) periods of `take-off growth' identified by
   segmented linear regression. We compared CL incidence across exposure
   categories using Poisson regression and tested for effect modification
   by degree of urbanisation. Our study included 1500 incident cases and
   2561 municipalities. The incident rate ratio (IRR) comparing the highest
   to the lowest quintile of 5-year population growth was 1.18 (95 \% CI
   0.96, 1.46) in all municipalities and 1.33 (95 \% CI 0.93, 1.92) in
   rural municipalities (p value interaction 0.36). In municipalities with
   take-off growth, the IRR comparing the take-off period (> 6 \% annual
   population growth) with the initial period of low or negative growth (<
   2 \%) was 2.07 (95 \% CI 0.95, 4.51) overall and 2.99 (1.11, 8.05) in
   rural areas (p interaction 0.52). Our study provides further support for
   the population mixing hypothesis and underlines the need to distinguish
   take-off growth from other growth patterns in future research.}},

Title = {{Mechanical Properties of Additively Manufactured Thick Honeycombs}},
Journal = {{Materials}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Honeycombs resemble the structure of a number of natural and biological
   materials such as cancellous bone, wood, and cork. Thick honeycomb could
   be also used for energy absorption applications. Moreover, studying the
   mechanical behavior of honeycombs under in-plane loading could help
   understanding the mechanical behavior of more complex 3D tessellated
   structures such as porous biomaterials. In this paper, we study the
   mechanical behavior of thick honeycombs made using additive
   manufacturing techniques that allow for fabrication of honeycombs with
   arbitrary and precisely controlled thickness. Thick honeycombs with
   different wall thicknesses were produced from polylactic acid (PLA)
   using fused deposition modelling, i.e., an additive manufacturing
   technique. The samples were mechanically tested in-plane under
   compression to determine their mechanical properties. We also obtained
   exact analytical solutions for the stiffness matrix of thick hexagonal
   honeycombs using both Euler-Bernoulli and Timoshenko beam theories. The
   stiffness matrix was then used to derive analytical relationships that
   describe the elastic modulus, yield stress, and Poisson's ratio of thick
   honeycombs. Finite element models were also built for computational
   analysis of the mechanical behavior of thick honeycombs under
   compression. The mechanical properties obtained using our analytical
   relationships were compared with experimental observations and
   computational results as well as with analytical solutions available in
   the literature. It was found that the analytical solutions presented
   here are in good agreement with experimental and computational results
   even for very thick honeycombs, whereas the analytical solutions
   available in the literature show a large deviation from experimental
   observation, computational results, and our analytical solutions.}},

Abstract = {{Negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) materials have drawn significant interest
   because the enhanced toughness, shear resistance, and vibration
   absorption that typically are seen in auxetic materials may enable a
   range of novel applications. In this work, we report that single-layer
   graphene exhibits an intrinsic NPR, which is robust and independent of
   its size and temperature. The NPR arises due to the interplay between
   two intrinsic deformation pathways (one with positive Poisson's ratio,
   the other with NPR), which correspond to the bond stretching and angle
   bending interactions in graphene. We propose an energy-based deformation
   pathway criteria, which predicts that the pathway with NPR has lower
   energy and thus becomes the dominant deformation mode when graphene is
   stretched by a strain above 6\%, resulting in the NPR phenomenon.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials are gaining special interest in technical sectors due
   to their attractive mechanical behaviour. This paper reports a
   systematic investigation on missing rib design based auxetic structures
   produced from braided composites for civil engineering applications. The
   influence of various structural and material parameters on auxetic and
   mechanical properties was thoroughly investigated. The basic structures
   were also modified with straight longitudinal rods to enhance their
   strengthening potential in structural elements. Additionally, a new
   analytical model was proposed to predict Poisson's ratio through a semi
   empirical approach. Auxetic and tensile behaviours were also predicted
   using finite element analysis. The auxetic and tensile behaviours were
   observed to be more strongly dependent on their structural parameters
   than the material parameters. The developed analytical models could well
   predict the auxetic behaviour of these structures except at very low or
   high strains. Good agreement was also observed between the experimental
   results and numerical analysis. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Density modulated tungsten (W) thin films with nanoscale porosity
   contents of 7\% to 40\% by volume were grown on Si substrates through

   105 nm and 520 nm. Nanomechanical properties of samples were
   investigated by means of instrumented nanoindentation. Reduced-(2)
   analysis was carried out to assess four models formulated through
   differential effective medium approach. The model that factored in both
   the crowding effect and the maximum random packing of pores successfully
   captured the experimental trends. Attempts to breach the auxetic barrier
   resulted in large-scale pulverization or spontaneous conversion into
   WO3. Porosity corrected yield strength calculations underlined the
   possibility of defining a porosity threshold beyond which the
   compressive yield strength of density modulated nanoporous metallic thin
   films would drop abruptly due to aggravated geometric slenderness

Title = {{Comparison of Droplet Digital PCR and Quantitative PCR Assays for
   Quantitative Detection of Xanthomonas citri Subsp citri}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},

Month = {{JUL 18}},
Abstract = {{Droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) is a novel molecular
   biology technique providing absolute quantification of target nucleic
   acids without the need for an external calibrator. Despite its emerging
   applications in medical diagnosis, there are few reports of its use for
   the detection of plant pathogens. This work was designed to assess the
   diagnosis potential of the ddPCR for absolute quantitative detection of
   Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri, a quarantine plant pathogenic bacterium
   that causes citrus bacterial canker in susceptible Citrus species. We
   transferred an established quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay for citrus
   bacterial canker diagnosis directly to the ddPCR format and compared the
   performance of the two methods. The qPCR assay has a broader dynamic
   range compared to the ddPCR assay and the ddPCR assay has a
   significantly higher degree of sensitivity compared to the qPCR assay.
   The influence of PCR inhibitors can be reduced considerably in the ddPCR
   assay because the collection of end-point fluorescent signals and the
   counting of binomial events (positive or negative droplets) are
   associated with a Poisson algorithm. The ddPCR assay also shows lower
   coefficient of variation compared to the qPCR assay especially in low
   target concentration. The linear association of the measurements by
   ddPCR and qPCR assays is strong (Pearson correlation = 0.8633; P<0.001).
   Receiver operating characteristic analysis indicates the ddPCR
   methodology is a more robust approach for diagnosis of citrus bacterial
   canker. In summary, the results demonstrated that the ddPCR assay has
   the potential for the quantitative detection of X. citri subsp. citri
   with high precision and accuracy as compared with the results from qPCR
   assay. Further studies are required to evaluate and validate the value
   of ddPCR technology in the diagnosis of plant disease and quarantine
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{Stereotypic behavior is an important indicator of compromised welfare.
   Zoo elephants are documented to perform stereotypic behavior, but the
   factors that contribute to performance have not been systematically
   assessed. We collected behavioral data on 89 elephants (47 African
   {[}Loxodonta africana], 42 Asian {[}Elephas maximus]) at 39 North
   American zoos during the summer and winter. Elephants were videoed for a
   median of 12 daytime hours per season. A subset of 32 elephants (19
   African, 13 Asian) was also observed live for a median of 10.5 nighttime
   hours. Percentages of visible behavior scans were calculated from five
   minute instantaneous samples. Stereotypic behavior was the second most
   commonly performed behavior (after feeding), making up 15.5\% of
   observations during the daytime and 24.8\% at nighttime. Negative
   binomial regression models fitted with generalized estimating equations
   were used to determine which social, housing, management, life history,
   and demographic variables were associated with daytime and nighttime
   stereotypic behavior rates. Species was a significant risk factor in
   both models, with Asian elephants at greater risk (daytime: p<0.001,
   Risk Ratio = 4.087; nighttime: p<0.001, Risk Ratio = 8.015). For both
   species, spending time housed separately (p<0.001, Risk Ratio = 1.009),
   and having experienced inter-zoo transfers (p<0.001, Risk Ratio =
   1.175), increased the risk of performing higher rates of stereotypy
   during the day, while spending more time with juvenile elephants
   (p<0.001, Risk Ratio = 0.985), and engaging with zoo staff reduced this
   risk (p = 0.018, Risk Ratio = 0.988). At night, spending more time in
   environments with both indoor and outdoor areas (p = 0.013, Risk Ratio =
   0.987) and in larger social groups (p = 0.039, Risk Ratio = 0.752)
   corresponded with reduced risk of performing higher rates of stereotypy,
   while having experienced inter-zoo transfers (p = 0.033, Risk Ratio =
   1.115) increased this risk. Overall, our results indicate that factors
   related to the social environment are most influential in predicting
   elephant stereotypic behavior rates.}},

Title = {{Differences on Primary Care Labor Perceptions in Medical Students from
   11 Latin American Countries}},

Abstract = {{Background
   The shortage in Latin-American Primary Care (PC) workforce may be due to
   negative perceptions about it. These perceptions might be probably
   influenced by particular features of health systems and academic
   environments, thus varying between countries.
   Methods
   Observational, analytic and cross-sectional multicountry study that
   evaluated 9,561 first and fifth-year medical students from 63 medical
   schools of 11 Latin American countries through a survey. Perceptions on
   PC work was evaluated through a previously validated scale. Tertiles of
   the scores were created in order to compare the different countries.
   Crude and adjusted prevalence ratios were calculated using simple and
   multiple Poisson regression with robust variance.
   Results
   Approximately 53\% of subjects were female; mean age was 20.4 +/- 2.9
   years; 35.5\% were fifth-year students. Statistically significant
   differences were found between the study subjects' country, using Peru
   as reference. Students from Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Paraguay
   perceived PC work more positively, while those from Ecuador showed a
   less favorable position. No differences were found among perceptions of
   Bolivian, Salvadoran, Honduran and Venezuelan students when compared to
   their Peruvian peers.
   Conclusions
   Perceptions of PC among medical students from Latin America vary
   according to country. Considering such differences can be of major
   importance for potential local specific interventions.}},

Title = {{Strain effects on borophene: ideal strength, negative Possion's ratio
   and phonon instability}},
Journal = {{NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{18}},
Month = {{JUL 7}},
Abstract = {{Very recently, two-dimensional (2D) boron sheets (borophene) with
   rectangular structures were grown successfully on single crystal Ag(111)
   substrates (Mannix et al 2015 Science 350 1513). The fabricated
   boroprene is predicted to have unusual mechanical properties. We
   performed first-principle calculations to investigate the mechanical
   properties of the monolayer borophene, including ideal tensile strength
   and critical strain. It was found that monolayer borophene can withstand
   stress up to 20.26 N m(-1) and 12.98 N m(-1) in a and b directions,
   respectively. However, its critical strain was found to be small. In the
   a direction, the critical value is only 8\%, which, to the best of our
   knowledge, is the lowest among all studied 2D materials. Our numerical
   results show that the tensile strain applied in the b direction enhances
   the bucking height of borophene resulting in an out-of-plane negative
   Poisson's ratio, which makes the boron sheet show superior mechanical
   flexibility along the b direction. The failure mechanism and phonon
   instability of monolayer borophene were also explored.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, free-standing buckypapers (BPs) made up of a
   three-dimensional network of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) that
   are branched, cross-linked, and share common walls, defined henceforth
   as multi-walled carbon nanostructures (MWCNSs) are characterized to
   obtain their electrical, thermal and mechanical properties. Two types of
   free-standing sheets are studied, namely uncompressed buckypapers (UBPs)
   and compressed buckypapers (CBPs). Both are processed via a vacuum
   filtration method, with subsequent compressive force applied between
   platen presses to obtain CBP. CBPs are found to exhibit improved thermal
   and electrical conductivities since higher density of CNT networks leads
   to more conductive pathways. However, mechanical properties of CBPs and
   UBPs are approximately the same. Local anisotropic behavior of both BPs
   allows them to have either positive or negative Poisson's ratio. While
   UBP is suitable for membrane applications due to its mechanical
   stability and well-defined pore characteristics, the CBP offers a
   compact structure that can reduce penetration of the polymer matrix in
   composite applications such as for integrated circuit packaging and EMI
   shielding. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Among the pests of citrus, one of the most important is the red and
   black flat mite Brevipalpus phoenicis (Geijskes), which transmits the
   Citrus leprosis virus C (CiLV-C). When a rational pest control plan is
   adopted, it is important to determine the correct timing for carrying
   out the control plan. Making this decision demands constant follow-up of
   the culture through periodic sampling where knowledge about the spatial
   distribution of the pest is a fundamental part to improve sampling and
   control decisions. The objective of this work was to study the spatial
   distribution pattern and build a sequential sampling plan for the pest.
   The data used were gathered from two blocks of Valencia sweet orange on
   a farm in Sao Paulo State, Brazil, by 40 inspectors trained for the data
   collection. The following aggregation indices were calculated:
   variance/mean ratio, Morisita index, Green's coefficient, and k
   parameter of the negative binomial distribution. The data were tested
   for fit with Poisson and negative binomial distributions using the
   chi-square goodness of fit test. The sequential sampling was developed
   using Wald's Sequential Probability Ratio Test and validated through
   simulations. We concluded that the spatial distribution of B. phoenicis
   is aggregated, its behavior best fitted to the negative binomial
   distribution and we built and validated a sequential sampling plan for
   control decision-making.}},

Abstract = {{Recent years have seen a consistent trend in the extension of 2D auxetic
   models towards 3D ones. This article introduces a 3D auxetic linkage
   structure by extending the double arrowhead honeycomb structure to an
   intersecting double arrowhead structure. A geometrical analysis on the
   basis of rigid linkages with rotational joints shows that auxeticity is
   manifested in all three orthogonal planes. Results reveal that the
   geometry, in terms of either the relative linkage lengths or the half
   angles, can be changed to substantially control the Poisson's ratio. It
   is herein suggested that functionally graded beams and plates that
   exhibit gradual change in Poisson's ratio from negative to positive, as
   well as functionally graded solids with opposing auxeticity trends on
   different planes, are easily achievable by 3D printing using the
   intersecting double arrowhead structure, and that further mechanistic
   analysis be performed. (C) 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA,

Abstract = {{We have examined the effect of temperature, pressure, and time on the
   magnitude of induced auxetic response in post-manufacture-processed
   needle-punched nonwovens. Different combinations of these processing
   parameters - temperatures ranging from room temperature to above the
   glass transition temperature (T-g) of constituent fibers, pressure of
   0.49 or 2.45 MPa, and duration of 4 or 24 h - were used to process these
   nonwovens. This resulted in some permanent compression (defined as
   ``compression set{''}) and in out-of-plane auxetic behavior of the
   fabric, both of which were found to be proportional to the severity of
   the processing conditions employed. Milder processing conditions were
   found to be insufficient in producing significant compression set and
   hence produced little or no auxetic response. Using micro-CT and optical
   video microscopy techniques, it was found that the processing conditions
   caused the fiber bundles present in needle-punched nonwovens to assume a
   buckled/tilted state, which opened up during mechanical extension and
   hence were instrumental in the observed thickness increase. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Auxetic polyproplyene fibres have been produced on a large-scale

   identified a coarse processing window which was then more closely

   and bath temperature) on the Poisson's ratio and Young's modulus of the
   fibres were examined. It was found that a temperature of 200 degrees C,
   screw speed of 12.5 rpm and take-up speed of either 1.5 or 3.5 rpm
   produced fibres with a high degree of auxeticity up to 5\% strain
   -significantly increasing the auxetic strain range previously reported
   for lab-scale extrusions at lower extruder temperatures. Quenching with
   a water bath reduced the auxeticity, so was not employed as a processing

Abstract = {{We conducted molecular statics simulations to investigate the negative
   Poisson's ratio (auxetic behavior) of periodic porous graphene
   structures based on the rotating rigid unit mechanism. To obtain a
   negative Poisson's ratio, simple voids were periodically introduced into
   graphene. We showed that the Poisson's ratio of the designed graphene
   structure is strongly dependent on the aspect ratio of the voids, and it
   can approach the theoretical limit of -1.0. More importantly, the
   graphene periodic structure maintains its auxetic behavior even under
   large strains (epsilon similar to 0.20). Hence, it can be employed in a
   wide range of applications requiring structures that can endure large
   deformation. In addition, we found that the key factor in the auxeticity
   of the investigated structures is the deformation occurring at the void
   tips. (C) 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA, Weinheim}},

Abstract = {{Hard-body models reproduce many fundamental features of real physical
   systems and are convenient tools to study the role of molecular shape
   and its influence on macroscopic, for example, elastic, properties of
   condensed matter. In this article, a degenerate (aperiodic) crystal of
   hard dimers with arrays of nanochannels introduced in the direction
   {[}001] is studied by Monte Carlo simulations. The nanochannels are
   filled by hard spheres of diameter sigma' which can be different from
   the diameter sigma of spheres forming dimers. It is shown that, by
   modifying the ratio o'/o, one can qualitatively modify the Poisson's
   ratio of the system. In particular, one can obtain partial auxetics
   (i.e., systems with negative Poisson's ratio in some directions) with
   auxetic directions {[}110] or {[}111]. The applied method is convenient
   to determine Poisson's ratio in all directions for crystals of arbitrary
   symmetry. Explicit formulae for Poisson's ratio in main directions of
   the studied structures are given. (C) 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co.

Abstract = {{In this article, we present an experimental study validating the concept
   of the reinforced-core auxetic assemblies. The main distinctive feature
   of these assemblies is the presence of a reinforcing core in the
   microstructural units that increases the shear stiffness and thus
   produces negative Poisson's ratio. We tested a number of prototypes
   manufactured using the stereolithography and selective laser sintering
   methods. To measure the deformations, we employed the close-range
   photogrammetry method, which enables monitoring of locations of
   unlimited number of points from digital images. We developed a procedure
   for multi-point measurement of planar deformations using a single
   digital camera. This procedure allows for continuous measurement of
   deformations without interruption to the loading sequence. Camera
   self-calibration is based on multiple images of stable reference points,
   which enables high accuracy of the measurements even using a consumer
   grade digital camera. We compare the obtained experimental results with
   a simplified continuum model. We demonstrate a good agreement between
   the theoretical predictions and the experimental results. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{The torsion of a prismatic beam has been a classic problem of structural
   mechanics since the famous works of Saint-Venant. In this paper, an
   analysis is extended on a composite beam with elliptical cross-section.
   We consider a beam in which the elliptical cross-sectionis split into
   sectors in which two materials, one of which is auxetic, are distributed
   alternately. The influence of auxetic phase on the total elastic strain
   energy is analyzed as well as geometrical parameters representing both
   the shape of the cross- section, and the arrangements of sectors. An
   unexpected behavior of a beam with strong auxetic phase is presented as,
   in the case of selected parameters, the beam with elliptical
   cross-section is more rigid than the beam with a circular one. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{A two phase, fibrous composite subjected to bending non-uniform load is
   studied in this article. The composite is built of two constituents: the
   matrix is built of conventional material characterised by constant
   positive Poisson's ratio, whereas the Poisson's ratio of fibres is
   changed from positive (common materials) to negative values (auxetics).
   The influence of the arrangement of fibres, the volume fraction of
   fibres' materials and the distribution of loading force is studied by
   means of FEM. The behaviour of the composite is investigated in order to
   determine if auxetic reinforcement improves rigidity and indentation
   resistance of the composite. The results obtained confirm that auxetics
   can be used in composites to decrease deformation in the direction of
   acting force. (C) 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA, Weinheim}},

Abstract = {{Optimization of structures with complex shapes is a big challenge for
   computational physics. Results of numerical calculations show that
   composite or sandwich panel structures have a great influence on their
   effective properties. This article presents numerical results of
   optimization of sandwich panel properties. Calculations were provided
   for a three-layer sandwich two-phase composite. Optimization techniques
   were used for minimization of the effective Poisson's ratio of the core.
   The resultant composite structure exhibits a negative Poisson's ratio
   (NPR), although all its constituents are characterized by positive
   values of the Poisson's ratio. The structure of the composite is
   completely filled with solid materials, hence no voids appear within its
   whole volume. To find a solution, the finite-element method combined
   with an optimization algorithm MMA (method of moving asymptotes) was
   used. For the purpose of analysis, the material parameters were written
   by means of the shape interpolation SIMP (solid isotropic material with
   penalization) scheme. (C) 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA,

Abstract = {{Molecular mechanics simulations were used to analyse the on-axis
   mechanical properties of a series of nanonetworks. These consisted of
   naphthacene-like units linked together through acetylene chains, and
   designed to mimic the geometry of a winerack-like structure in one of
   the major planes, a geometry which is closely associated with negative
   linear compressibility. It was found that these networks have a
   potential to exhibit a negative linear compressibility in one of the
   major axis. An analysis of the deformation mechanism as well as the
   magnitudes of the compressibility in the major directions suggest that
   this effect arises from relative rotations of the rigid polyphenyl
   chains and is comparable to that predicted by an idealised winerack
   model deforming through hinging. This confirms that there is a very
   strong link between negative linear compressibility and geometry, as is
   the case with auxetic materials. (C) 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co.

Abstract = {{The dynamic mechanical responses of the ferroelastic materials under
   uniaxial straining and temperature cycling are studied via the
   Landau-type phase field model in two dimensions. The model may exhibit a
   single-well (double-well) energy profile when temperature is greater
   (less) than the critical temperature. Effective negative stiffness in
   the vicinity of the temperature-induced solid-solid phase transformation
   is numerically demonstrated through monotonic uniaxial straining on a
   single-domain ferroelastic under temperature cycling around the Curie
   temperature. Under sinusoidal uniaxial straining, the effective Young's
   modulus and damping, as indicated by the enclosed area of the
   stress-strain curve, may be largely increased due to the phase
   transition. Our calculated responses here are consistent with
   experimental data reported in the literature, as well as theoretical
   results based on the composite theory with inclusions assumed to have
   negative modulus. No negative stiffness values are directly assigned in
   our phase field model as the underlying physics of the order parameters,
   i.e., spontaneous strains, provides effective negative stiffness into
   the systems. (C) 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA, Weinheim}},

Abstract = {{Iron-gallium alloy (galfenol) is a body centered cubic (BCC)
   magnetostrictive alloy that, like many other BCC metals, is auxetic in
   the < 110 >\{100\} directions. For compositions of 12-33 at.\% gallium,
   Poisson ratio (nu) values as low as -0.7 are observed along these
   directions in response to a uniaxial elastic force (tensile tests,
   resonant ultrasound spectroscopy, etc.). In 2014, Raghunath and Flatau
   first reported that galfenol also exhibits positive strain in both these
   directions when the uniaxial force applied along the < 110 >\{100\}
   directions is provided solely by a magnetic field, i.e., with no
   external mechanical/elastic force or stress being applied to the alloy
   {[}Raghunath and Flatau, IEEE Trans. Magn. 50(11), 1-4 (2014)]. The
   observed response is a result of the intrinsic, atomic-scale,
   bi-directionally coupled magnetoelastic properties of these alloys. In
   this paper, we advance the understanding of the intrinsic atomic-scale
   magnetoelastic coupling of the alloy that leads to the observed
   magnetoelastic auxetic-like behavior by presenting simulations developed
   based on density functional theory, which we show match the experimental
   findings and energy-based simulations. The elastic anisotropy and the
   electronic mechanisms that lead to magnetoelastic auxetic-like behavior
   in galfenol are discussed. (C) 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA,

Abstract = {{This paper presents two new types of origami-inspired mechanical
   metamaterials based on the Miura-derivative fold patterns that consist
   of nonidentical parallelogram facets. The analytical models to predict
   dimension changes and deformation kinematics of the proposed
   metamaterials are developed. Furthermore, by modelling the creases as
   revolute hinges with certain rotational spring constants, we derived
   analytical models for stretching and bulk moduli. The analytical models
   are validated through finite-element simulation results. Numerical
   examples reveal that the proposed metamaterials possess some intriguing
   properties, including negative Poisson's ratios and bulk modulus. The
   work presented in this paper can provide a highly flexible framework for
   the design of versatile tunable mechanical metamaterials.}},

Abstract = {{This paper evaluates the effect of different Poisson's ratios and an
   equivalent Poisson's ratio formula on the crack initiation angle and
   life estimation by using the three shear-strain based fatigue damage
   models (Brown-Miller, Fatemi-Socie, and Liu's Virtual Energy) on
   strain-controlled biaxial cyclic loading tests of specific tubular
   material specimens. The four shear failure mode materials studied were
   Inconel 718, 304L stainless steel, normalized 1050, and
   quenched/tempered 1050 steels. This study was motivated by the fact that
   for all the strain-controlled fatigue testing, the induced transverse
   strain was not measured, but assumed to be a negative product of the
   axial strain and the Poisson ratio, where the axial strain was known and
   given, and the Poisson ratio was either assumed to be a constant or a
   variable represented by a function of elastic and plastic equivalent
   strains. Therefore, the assumption of a Poisson's ratio in the
   transverse strain calculation was assessed in this study. It is
   concluded that the use of different Poisson's ratios in the three
   fatigue damage models would have some effects on the crack angle
   prediction, depending on the material type, and little effect on the
   fatigue life estimation for all materials investigated in this study.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic epoxy resin foams were produced by solid-state foaming thanks to
   the use of properly shaped precursors. In fact, a re-entrant hexagonal
   shape of the precursors is preserved during foaming and results in a
   foam with a complex structure: a thin macro-structure with the
   re-entrant geometry filled with foam. The auxetic behavior was observed
   by using tensile tests at different temperatures (room temperature, 80?,
   and 100?). Indentation tests were also carried out to evaluate the
   gradient properties across the lines of the thin re-entrant
   macro-structure. In order to show that the auxetic behavior depended on
   the internal macro-structure, tests were also performed on foam panels
   obtained by cylindrical tablets and, therefore, with a
   standard-hexagonal macro-structure. In conclusion, the auxetic behavior
   was observed only for the foam panels with re-entrant hexagonal
   structure at 80?. In this case, a negative Poisson's ratio is
   immediately achieved at small strains and tends to a zero plateau value
   for longitudinal strains up to 1\%.}},

Abstract = {{Human-animal relationships are essential for dairy farming. They affect
   work comfort and efficiency, as well as milk production. A poor
   human-animal relationship can result in stress and accidents to both
   animals and caretakers and needs to be improved. However, many studies
   have demonstrated the multifactoriality of these relationships. We aimed
   at assessing the relative importance of the various factors expected to
   be associated with poor human-animal relationships. On 118 dairy farms,
   we applied a standardized avoidance distance test to cows at the feeding
   rack. The sample of farms covered a wide range of situations: lowland
   versus highland, small versus medium size farms, cubicles versus
   deep-bedded systems, milking parlor versus automatic milking systems,
   and Holstein versus Montbeliarde breeds. We used Poisson regression to
   analyze the links between the number of cows that accepted being
   touched, and farm characteristics, animals, management, and farmers'
   attitudes. A multivariate analysis yielded a final model that explained
   32.7\% of the variability between farms. Calving conditions ({''}Main
   calving location{''} and ``Cleaning or adding litter after calving{''})
   accounted for a significant part of the variability observed
   (respectively 25.8 and 13.6\% of variability explained by the model,
   SSB). Fewer cows accepted being touched on farms where the main calving
   location was in the barn, and where farmers cleaned or added litter
   after calving. The proportion of cows that accepted being touched
   increased with the proportion of lean cows in the herd (18.8\%), with
   worker/cow ratio on the farm (11.7\%), when farmers considered
   ``health{''} or ``human-cow relationships{''} as most important issues
   for farm success (10.4\%), and with farmers' years of experience
   (10.8\%). Farmers with more negative behavioral attitudes toward cows
   had a lower proportion of cows that accepted being touched (8.9\%). In
   conclusion, the human-animal relationship was not found to be associated
   with farm characteristics (e.g., housing or milking system) but varied
   with farmers' attitudes and management. We confirm that cows' fear of
   people is linked to negative attitudes displayed by caretakers toward
   cows, and is reduced in farms where several caretakers are present. Our
   study also suggests further exploring the key role of factors linked to
   calving conditions, as cows are more likely to be afraid of people when
   disturbed at calving.}},

Abstract = {{We present a computational method for interactive 3D design and
   rationalization of surfaces via auxetic materials, i.e., flat flexible
   material that can stretch uniformly up to a certain extent. A key
   motivation for studying such material is that one can approximate
   doubly-curved surfaces (such as the sphere) using only flat pieces,
   making it attractive for fabrication. We physically realize surfaces by
   introducing cuts into approximately inextensible material such as sheet
   metal, plastic, or leather. The cutting pattern is modeled as a regular
   triangular linkage that yields hexagonal openings of spatially-varying
   radius when stretched. In the same way that isometry is fundamental to
   modeling developable surfaces, we leverage conformal geometry to
   understand auxetic design. In particular, we compute a global conformal
   map with bounded scale factor to initialize an otherwise intractable
   non-linear optimization. We demonstrate that this global approach can
   handle non-trivial topology and non-local dependencies inherent in
   auxetic material. Design studies and physical prototypes are used to
   illustrate a wide range of possible applications.}},

   Elizabeth using respondent-driven sampling and completed an
   interviewer-administered questionnaire alongside HIV testing and
   counseling. In this secondary analysis, robust Poisson regression was
   used to model prevalence ratios for positive fertility intentions in
   this cross-sectional study. Knowledge of safer conception methods by HIV
   status was compared using Fisher exact tests.
   RESULTS: Overall 391 women were represented in the analyses. More than
   50\% had a prior HIV diagnosis, and an additional 12\% were diagnosed
   with HIV during the study. Approximately half (n=185) of the women
   reported future pregnancy intentions. In univariate analysis, a prior
   HIV diagnosis was negatively associated with pregnancy intentions as
   compared with HIV-negative women (prevalence ratio 0.68, 95\% confidence
   interval 0.55-0.85). Only parity remained independently associated with
   future pregnancy intentions in multivariate regression after controlling
   for HIV status, age, race, relationship status, and years selling sex.
   Knowledge of safer conception methods such as timed sex without a
   condom, preexposure prophylaxis, or self-insemination was low and
   similar between those with and without future pregnancy plans.
   CONCLUSION: Pregnancy intentions did not significantly vary according to
   HIV status. Fertility intentions were high, however, and knowledge of
   safer conception methods low, suggesting a need to provide female sex
   workers with advice around options to conceive safely in the context of
   high HIV prevalence.}},

Abstract = {{Elastic properties of the hexagonal crystals under pressure were
   analyzed. Seven crystals with negative Poisson's ratio (auxetics) were
   revealed at zero pressure. These are crystals of MoS2, Zn, Be, BeCu
   (alloy with 2.4 at.\% Cu), TiB2, C7H12, and MnAs. Analytical expressions
   of extreme values of Poisson's ratio and Young's modulus were obtained.
   For these materials, the variability of Poisson's ratio and Young's
   modulus was analyzed at pressure change. It was shown that all seven
   hexagonal auxetics may become completely auxetic under certain pressure
   values. The variability of the elastic properties of graphite and SiC,
   being non-auxetics at zero pressure, was considered. These crystals
   become partially auxetic at negative pressure (-15 GPa for graphite and
   -56 GPa for silicon carbide) and completely auxetic at -114 and -122
   GPa, respectively. (C) 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA, Weinheim}},

Abstract = {{This report employed molecular statics simulation and
   density-functional-theory calculation to study the Poisson's ratios of
   face-centered-cubic materials. We provide numerical and theoretical
   evidences to show that cubic materials can exhibit auxetic behavior in a
   principal direction under proper loading conditions. When a stress
   perpendicular to the loading direction is applied, cubic materials can
   exhibit a negative Poisson's ratio at finite strain. The negative
   Poisson's ratio behavior, including its direction and value, is highly
   dependent on the direction and magnitude of the transversely applied
   stresses. As a result, we show that it is possible to tune the direction
   and magnitude of the negative Poisson's ratio behavior of cubic
   materials by controlling the transverse loadings. (C) 2016 WILEY-VCH

Abstract = {{Diamond-like carbon nanostructures with cubic anisotropy made by joining
   fullerene-like molecules of different types via valence bonds are
   studied by means of molecular dynamics simulations. The considered
   structures are interesting because they include both sp(2)- and
   sp(3)-hybridized carbon atoms, which lead to their distinct properties
   compared to the structures with one type of hybridization. Seven
   diamond-like carbon phases having different shapes of structural units
   and/or different ways of their connection are studied in the present
   work. For the relaxed equilibrium structures, the engineering elastic
   constants (Poisson's ratio, Young's modulus, and shear modulus) are
   calculated as the functions of the crystal orientation angles. Extreme
   values of the elastic constants are reported. It is shown that two of
   the considered diamond-like structures have negative Poisson's ratio and
   can be regarded as the partial auxetics. According to the results of the
   present study, elastic properties of the bulk diamond-like carbon
   structures can vary considerably depending on their structure. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{It is demonstrated that the large-amplitude, short-wavelength
   vibrational modes excited in the lattice can change its elastic
   properties due to physical and/or geometric nonlinearity of the lattice
   bonds. Depending on the symmetry of the vibrational mode the symmetry of
   the elastic properties of the lattice can also change. Using as an
   example the two-dimensional honeycomb structure with beta-FPU pairwise
   interparticle interactions, we demonstrate that the excitation of a
   large-amplitude vibrational mode in combination with equiaxial tensile
   strain can change the sign of the Poisson's ratio from positive to
   negative, thus leading to the auxetic property of the lattice. It is
   shown that the considered lattice supports discrete breathers, i.e.,
   spatially localized nonlinear vibrational modes. The excitation of the
   discrete breathers as a result of the modulational instability of the
   extended short-wavelength modes is analyzed. Our results contribute to
   the understanding of the relation between the elastic properties and
   nonlinear dynamics of the lattices of interacting particles. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Monte Carlo simulations in the isobaric-isothermal ensemble with
   variable shape of the periodic box are used to study elastic properties
   of two-dimensional (2D) model systems of hard discs with parallel layers
   of hard cyclic hexamers. Both the particles in their pure phases form
   elastically isotropic crystals. However, the crystal of discs shows
   positive and that of hexamers negative Poisson's ratio (PR). The studied
   systems with layers are of low symmetry. Hence, a general analytic
   formula for the orientational dependence of PR in 2D systems is applied
   to such systems. It is shown that, by changing parameters of the
   particles and their relative concentration, as well as orientation of
   the layers, one can obtain systems which are non-auxetic (their PR is
   positive), auxetic (their PR is negative), or partially auxetic ones
   (their PR is negative for some directions and positive for other ones).
   If the disks and hexamers are interpreted as small molecules, the
   obtained results indicate that by introducing auxetic nano-layers one
   can strongly modify PR of crystals or even thin layers. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Auxetic composites have attracted considerable attention in recent years
   and have demonstrated a high potential of applications in different
   areas due to their wonderful properties as compared to non-auxetic
   composites. In this study, a three-dimensional (3D) auxetic textile
   structure previously developed was used as reinforcement to fabricate
   auxetic composites with conventional polyurethane (PU) foam. Both the
   deformation behavior and mechanical properties of the auxetic composites
   under compression were analyzed and compared with those of the pure PU
   foam and non-auxetic composites made with the same materials and
   structural parameters but with different yarn arrangement. The results
   show that the negative Poisson's ratio of composites can be obtained
   when suitable yarn arrangement in a 3D textile structure is adopted. The
   results also show that the auxetic composites and non-auxetic composites
   have different mechanical behaviors due to different yarn arrangements
   in 3D textile structure. While the auxetic composites behave more like
   damping material with lower compression stress, the non-auxetic
   composite behaves more like stiffer material with higher compression
   stress. It is expected that this study could pave a way to the
   development of innovative 3D auxetic textile composites for different
   potential applications such as impact protection. (C) 2016 WILEY-VCH

Abstract = {{Analytical treatment of a linear elastic isotropic bi-material
   full-space reinforced by an interfacial thin film under axisymmetric
   normal loading is addressed. The thin film is modeled as an extensible

   system are explicitly written in the form of semi-infinite line
   integrals. The analytical results are verified by the special cases
   corresponding to the surface stiffened half-space and classical
   bi-material problem. The limiting cases of reinforced homogeneous
   full-space and inextensible membrane are presented and discussed. The
   proposed formulation is also applicable for studying reinforced auxetic
   materials with negative Poisson's ratio. The surface/interface effect on
   the elastic responses of two perfectly bonded half-spaces is also
   simulated by assigning equivalent surface elastic constant to the
   membrane stiffness. Effects of thin film stiffness, material properties,
   loading depth, and surface/interface effect are studied by some

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with the problem of uniformly loaded bars in
   strain gradient elasticity. We study the deformation of an isotropic
   chiral bar subjected to body forces, to tractions on the lateral surface
   and to resultant forces and moments on the ends. Examples of chiral
   materials include some auxetic materials, bones, some honeycomb
   structures, as well as composites with inclusions. The three-dimensional
   problem is reduced to the study of some generalized plane strain
   problems. The method is used to study the deformation of a uniformly
   loaded circular cylinder. New chiral effects are presented. The flexure
   of a chiral cylinder, in contrast with the case of achiral materials, is
   accompanied by extension and bending. The salient feature of the
   solution is that a uniform pressure acting on the lateral surface of a
   chiral circular elastic cylinder produces a twist around its axis. (C)

Abstract = {{A 2D (two-dimensional) random cellular solid model was built using FEM
   (finite element method) based on a modified Voronoi tessellation
   technique. A sequence of permanent biaxial compression deformations was
   applied on the model to obtain a series of re-entrant random cellular
   solid structures with different area compression ratios. The Poisson's
   ratio and energy absorption capacity of cellular solid models with
   different initial relative densities (0.032 and 0.039) were studied at
   different area compression ratios. The results showed that the Poisson's
   ratio first decreased and then increased with increasing compression
   strain. A minimum Poisson's ratio of approximately -0.38 was achieved
   with an appropriate compression strain. An empirical fitting rule was
   established which can best fit the 2D simulation to 3D experimental
   results for foams. The cellular solids with minimum negative Poisson's
   ratio can exhibit the highest energy absorption capacity. Furthermore,
   mechanical properties of the random cellular solid model were compared
   with 2D regular honeycomb models with both concave- and convex-shaped
   cells. Results showed that the energy absorption capacity of the three
   models increased with an increasing dynamic compression velocity. The
   random foam model exhibited the highest increase rate in energy
   absorption capacity with the increasing compression velocity.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 20}},
Abstract = {{Electromagnetic resonators are integrated with advanced elastic material
   to develop a new type of tunable metamaterial. An
   electromagnetic-elastic metamaterial able to switch on and off its
   electromagnetic chiral response is experimentally demonstrated. Such
   tunability is attained by harnessing the unique buckling properties of
   auxetic elastic materials (buckliballs) with embedded electromagnetic
   resonators. In these structures, simple uniaxial compression results in
   a complex but controlled pattern of deformation, resulting in a shift of
   its electromagnetic resonance, and in the structure transforming to a
   chiral state. The concept can be extended to the tuning of
   three-dimensional materials constructed from the meta-molecules, since
   all the components twist and deform into the same chiral configuration
   when compressed.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Postcoital genital washing by uncircumcised men may affect
   the risk of male HIV acquisition.
   Method: We assessed the association between self-reported washing after
   sex in 2976 initially HIV-negative, uncircumcised men enrolled in a
   prospective cohort study in Rakai, Uganda.
   Results: Data from the 2976 participants who reported sexual intercourse
   in the past 12 months contributed 4290 visits, with 7316.6 person-years
   of observation during the 2-year follow-up. The overall HIV-incidence
   was 1.28/100 person-years 95\%CI (1.04-1.57). About 91.0\% of men
   reported washing their penis after sex, and their HIV incidence was
   1.34/100 person-years (95\%CI 1.08-1.66), compared with an incidence of
   0.62/100 person-years (95\%CI 0.17-1.60) in men who did not wash their
   penis after intercourse. Using Poisson multivariable regression, the
   adjusted incidence rate ratio of HIV acquisition associated with
   postcoital washing was 1.94 (95\%CI 0.71-5.29).
   Conclusion: Postcoital penile washing, as practiced in this rural
   African population does not afford protection from HIV acquisition among
   uncircumcised men, and may increase risk. Copyright (C) 2016 Wolters

Abstract = {{The impact response of the re-entrant auxetic honeycomb is studied by
   simulating its in-plane dynamic crushing with FE methods. The
   characteristics of the peculiar crushing patterns and modes in the
   re-entrant honeycomb are described. The energy absorption performances
   of the re-entrant auxetic honeycomb and the hexagonal honeycomb are
   compared. When subjected to the same magnitude of crushing strain, the
   re-entrant honeycomb can dissipate more energy through plastic
   deformation. But if the peak stress is the primary concern for the
   packaging material, the re-entrant structure tends to generate higher
   stress in order to dissipate the same amount of impact energy. Moreover,
   the structural irregularity of the re-entrant auxetic honeycomb is
   defined and its influence on the dynamic crushing is studied. Unlike the
   hexagonal honeycomb, the irregular re-entrant auxetic honeycomb can
   absorb more energy than the regular one in the quasi-static regime. This
   situation reverses under high speed impact. This study will help to
   understand the dynamic behavior of the re-entrant foam and provide
   references for its application. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In the present paper a new additive manufacturing processing route is
   introduced for ultra-high performance concrete. Interdisciplinary work
   involving materials science, computation, robotics, architecture and
   design resulted in the development of an innovative way of 3D printing
   cementitious materials. The 3D printing process involved is based on a
   FDM-like technique, in the sense that a material is deposited layer by
   layer through an extrusion printhead mounted on a 6-axis robotic arm.
   The mechanical properties of 3D printed materials are assessed. The
   proposed technology succeeds in solving many of the problems that can be
   found in the literature. Most notably, this process allows the
   production of 3D large-scale complex geometries, without the use of
   temporary supports, as opposed to 2.5D examples found in the literature
   for concrete 3D printing. Architectural cases of application are used as
   examples in order to demonstrate the potentialities of the technology.
   Two structural elements were produced and constitute some of the largest
   3D printed concrete parts available until now. Multifunctionality was
   enabled for both structural elements by taking advantage of the complex
   geometry which can be achieved using our technology for large-scale
   additive manufacturing. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Very recently, a new single-element two-dimensional (2D) material
   borophene was successfully grown on a silver surface under pristine
   ultrahigh vacuum conditions which attracts tremendous interest. In this
   paper, the lattice thermal conductivity, phonon lifetimes, thermal
   expansion and temperature dependent elastic moduli of borophene are
   systematically studied by using first-principles. Our simulations show
   that borophene possesses unique thermal properties. Strong phonon-phonon
   scattering is found in borophene, which results in its unexpectedly low
   lattice thermal conductivity. Thermal expansion coefficients along both
   the armchair and zigzag directions of borophene show impressive negative
   values. More strikingly, the elastic moduli are sizably strengthened as
   temperature increases, and the negative in-plane Poisson's ratios are
   found along both the armchair and zigzag directions at around 120 K. The
   mechanisms of these unique thermal properties are also discussed in this
   paper.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 10}},
Abstract = {{When materials are under stretching, occurrence of lateral contraction
   of materials is commonly observed. This is because Poisson's ratio, the
   quantity describes the relationship between a lateral strain and applied
   strain, is positive for nearly all materials. There are some reported
   structures and materials having negative Poisson's ratio. However, most
   of them are at macroscale, and reentrant structures and rigid rotating
   units are the main mechanisms for their negative Poisson's ratio
   behavior. Here, with numerical and theoretical evidence, we show that
   metal {[}100] nanowires with asymmetric cross-sections such as rectangle
   or ellipse can exhibit negative Poisson's ratio behavior. Furthermore,
   the negative Poisson's ratio behavior can be further improved by
   introducing a hole inside the asymmetric nanowires. We show that the
   surface effect inducing the asymmetric stresses inside the nanowires is
   a main origin of the superior property.}},

Abstract = {{Penta-graphene has recently been proposed as a new allotrope of carbon
   composed of pure pentagons, and displays many novel properties going
   beyond graphene {[}Zhang et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A., 2015,
   112, 2372]. To further explore the property modulations, we have carried
   out a theoretical investigation of the hydrogenated and fluorinated
   penta-graphene sheets. Our first-principles calculations reveal that
   hydrogenation and fluorination can effectively tune the electronic and
   mechanical properties of penta-graphene: turning the sheet from
   semiconducting to insulating; changing the Poisson's ratio from negative
   to positive, and reducing the Young's modulus. Moreover, the band gaps
   of the hydrogenated and fluorinated penta-graphene sheets are larger
   than those of fully hydrogenated and fluorinated graphene by 0.37 and
   0.04 eV, respectively. The phonon dispersions and ab initio molecular
   dynamics simulations confirm that the surface modified penta-graphene
   sheets are dynamically and thermally stable, and show that the
   hydrogenated penta-graphene has more Raman-active modes with higher
   frequencies as compared to the fluorinated penta-graphene.}},

Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{99}},
Pages = {{467-476}},
Month = {{JUN 5}},
Abstract = {{As promising metamaterials, 3D periodic auxetic cellular structures
   (PACSs) have attracted great interest. However, they usually consist of
   intricate geometries which make their fabrication a significant
   challenge. The present paper is focused on introducing the interlocking
   assembly concept into the fabrication of 3D PACSs. There are distinct
   advantages of the interlocking assembly method compared with the
   additive manufacturing methods mainly used before. Based on the
   interlocking assembly method, the dependences of mechanical properties
   mainly including the Poisson's ratio and the Young's modulus of the
   structure on the re-entrant angle were investigated through a
   combination of uniaxial compression experiments and numerical
   simulations, excellent qualitative and quantitative agreement was found.
   Using the experimentally verified numerical model, the effects of the
   strut thickness and the ratio of the vertical strut length to oblique
   strut length on the mechanical properties of the structure were
   investigated. Results show that the compression modulus of the structure
   will increase with the structure becomes more re-entrant, but there
   exists an extreme value for Poisson's ratio with the reentrant angle
   around 45 which differs from former studies. With the thickening of the
   struts the compression modulus of the structure monotonously increases
   and the Poisson's ratio of the structure will gradually changes from
   negative to positive then gradually approaches to the Poisson's ratio of
   the parent material. The vertical strut length to oblique strut length
   ratio plays fewer roles on the mechanical properties compared with the
   re-entrant angle and the strut thickness. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Recently published articles have proposed the use of likelihood ratios
   (LRs) in determining the evidential value of finding a given number of
   gunshot residue (GSR) particles on a suspect. LRs depend on the
   probabilistic models assumed for the defence proposition (the suspect
   was not involved in a shooting) and the prosecutor's proposition (the
   suspect was involved), and should be calculated based on data obtained
   in well designed experiments. However, statistical aspects of the
   analysis that select the appropriate model and provide uncertainty
   measures are rarely considered. In this article, data from Cardinetti et
   al. (2006, A proposal for statistical evaluation of the detection of
   gunshot residues on a suspect. Scanning, 28(3): 142-147) are used to
   demonstrate the sensitivity of calculated LRs to the assumed model. It
   is shown that the Poisson model, considered by Cardinetti and others, is
   inappropriate and that a Negative Binomial model fits the data much
   better. The statistical error arising from the fact that models are
   estimated based on small sampled data is discussed, as well as the
   importance of accounting for this error. We conclude that only with a
   large database can statistical models be estimated accurately and LR's
   be treated as valid scientific measures.}},

Abstract = {{We examine the local determinants of destination choices of foreign
   immigrants to the Madrid metro area using data for 2005 and 2009 from
   the Spanish annual municipal-level registers of inhabitants. Taking
   advantage of the equivalence relation between conditional logit and
   Poisson, we estimate a location-choice model using the Poisson
   fixed-effects estimator. Origin-destination fixed effects are
   incorporated to account for the persistent spatial structure of the
   immigrants' settlement patterns and to control for potential violations
   of the independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA) assumption. The
   Poisson regression model is estimated for seven different groups of
   immigrants according to world regions or countries of origin. Our
   modelling strategy has important empirical implications, with magnitudes
   and/or signs of the estimated coefficients changing in the expected
   directions. It is found that newly arriving immigrants tend to settle in
   low-to-middle-income locations in the suburban reaches of the Madrid
   metro area. Moreover, the effects of the size of local communities of
   established immigrants are found to be insignificant and even negative
   in several instances, reflecting hetero-local settlement preferences
   and/or the saturation of local networks causing in-group job rivalry,
   respectively.}},

Journal = {{METALS}},

Abstract = {{In the present study, the influence of substitutional elements (Ti and
   Al) on the structural stability, mechanical properties, electronic
   properties and Debye temperature of Ta5Si3 with a D8(m) structure were
   investigated by first principle calculations. The Ta5Si3 alloyed with Ti
   and Al shows negative values of formation enthalpies, indicating that
   these compounds are energetically stable. Based on the values of
   formation enthalpies, Ti exhibits a preferential occupying the Ta-4b
   site and Al has a strong site preference for the Si-8h site. From the
   values of the bulk modulus (B), shear modulus (G) and Young's modulus
   (E), we determined that both Ti and Al additions decrease both the shear
   deformation resistance and the elastic stiffness of D8(m) structured
   Ta5Si3. Using the shear modulus/bulk modulus ratio (G/B), Poisson's
   ratio (upsilon) and Cauchy's pressure, the effect of Ti and Al additions
   on the ductility of D8(m)-structured Ta5Si3 are explored. The results
   show that Ti and Al additions reduce the hardness, resulting in solid
   solution softening, but improve the ductility of D8(m)-structured
   Ta5Si3. The electronic calculations reveal that Ti and Al additions
   change hybridization between Ta-Si and Si-Si atoms for the binary
   D8(m)-structured Ta5Si3. The new Ta-Al bond is weaker than the Ta-Si
   covalent bonds, reducing the covalent property of bonding in
   D8(m)-structured Ta5Si3, while the new strong Ti-4b-Ti-4b anti-bonding
   enhances the metallic behavior of the binary D8(m)-structured Ta5Si3.
   The change in the nature of bonding can well explain the improved
   ductility of D8(m)-structured Ta5Si3 doped by Ti and Al. Moreover, the
   Debye temperatures, (D), of D8(m)-structured Ta5Si3 alloying with Ti and
   Al are decreased as compared to the binary Ta5Si3.}},

Abstract = {{Objective We aimed to evaluate residence in evacuation areas (storm
   areas) as a risk factor for food and waterborne disease (FWBD)
   associated with Hurricane Sandy flooding.
   Methods We captured 9601 incident outpatient and inpatient FWBD hospital
   discharge diagnoses for residents of the greater New York City area. We
   used Poisson or negative binomial regression models to compare the
   covariate-adjusted risk for a FWBD diagnosis, pre-Sandy (10/28-11/09,
   2001-2011) vs. post-Sandy (10/28-11/09, 2012), for residents of storm
   and non-storm areas.
   Results Outpatient FWBD risk was lower for storm area residents after
   Hurricane Sandy (risk ratio {[}RR]=0.58, 95\% confidence interval
   {[}CI]: 0.46-0.74), and varied by age, sex, and county. However, storm
   area residents 65 years of age or older experienced higher risk after
   Hurricane Sandy (RR=2.16, 95\% CI: 1.11-4.19), albeit based on few
   cases. Inpatient FWBD risk was lower for non-storm area residents after
   Hurricane Sandy (RR=0.79, 95\% CI: 0.66-0.95), and varied by age, race,
   and county, although there was no significant change for storm area
   residents (RR=0.86, 95\% CI: 0.69-1.08). Those 65 years of age were also
   at lower risk for inpatient FWBD diagnosis, yet the effect was weaker
   for storm area (RR=0.89, 95\% CI: 0.67-1.18) than for non-storm area
   residents (RR=0.68, 95\% CI: 0.52-0.89).
   Conclusions Hurricane preparation, mitigation, and response activities
   in the greater New York City area may have led to protective effects for
   FWBD. (Disaster Med Public Health Preparedness. 2016;10:503-511)}},

Abstract = {{Background. Given high rates of anal disease, we investigated the
   natural history of high-risk anal human papillomavirus (HPV) among a
   multinational group of men who have sex with men (MSM) aged 18-64 years.
   Methods. Anal specimens from human immunodeficiency virus-negative men
   from Brazil, Mexico, and the United States were genotyped. Over 2 years,
   406 MSM provided evaluable specimens every 6 months for >= 2 visits.
   These men were stratified into men who have sex only with men (MSOM, n =
   70) and men who have sex with women and men (MSWM, n = 336). Persistence
   was defined as >= 12 months' type-specific duration and could begin with
   either a prevalent or incident infection. Prevalence ratios and 95\%
   confidence intervals were calculated by Poisson regression.
   Results. Median follow-up time was 2.1 years. Retention was 82\%. Annual
   cumulative incidence of 9-valent vaccine types was 19\% and 8\% among
   MSOM and MSWM, respectively (log-rank P =.02). Duration of anal HPV did
   not differ for MSOM and MSWM and was a median of 6.9 months for HPV-16
   after combining men from the 2 groups. Among men with prevalent
   high-risk infection (n = 106), a total of 36.8\%, retained the infection
   for at least 24 months. For those with prevalent HPV-16 (n = 27), 29.6\%
   were persistent for at least 24 months. Persistence of high-risk HPV was
   associated with number of male anal sex partners and inversely
   associated with number of female sex partners.
   Conclusions. MSM with prevalent high-risk HPV infection should be
   considered at increased risk for nontransient infection.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we analyze the performance of a cloud radio access
   network (CRAN), consisting of multiple randomly distributed remote radio
   heads (RRHs) and a macro base station (MBS), each equipped with multiple
   antennas. To model the spatial distribution of RRHs and analyze its
   performance, we use stochastic geometry tools. In contrast to previous
   works on CRAN that consider Poisson Point Process (PPP) model for the
   spatial distribution of RRHs, we consider a more realistic Matarn
   hard-core point process (MHCPP) model that imposes a certain minimal
   distance (referred to as hard-core distance) between the two RRHs so
   that the RRHs are not too close to each other. To compare system
   performance of CRAN when different transmission strategies are used,
   three RRH selection schemes are adopted including 1) the best RRH
   selection (BRS); 2) all RRHs participation (ARP); and 3) nearest RRH
   selection (NRS). Considering downlink transmission, the ergodic
   capacity, outage probability, and system throughput of CRAN are
   analytically characterized for different RRH selection schemes. The
   presented results demonstrate that compared to PPP model, the increase
   in hard-core distance will result in a higher outage probability and
   cause a negative impact on ergodic capacity. Furthermore, when the same
   total transmit power is consumed, BRS scheme provides the best outage
   performance while ARP scheme is the best RRH selection scheme when the
   same transmit SNR at each RRH is assumed. Moreover, it is shown that the
   hard-core distance has a more significant impact on systems with higher
   intensity of PPP distributed candidate points and in large hard-core
   distance regime increasing the intensity of candidate points can only
   provide a small improvement in outage performance. We extend our work to
   multiuser case with zero-forcing (ZF) precoding where it is proven that
   the results in multiuser case reduce to the derived results in this work
   by substituting K=1 for single-user.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a class of auxetic three-dimensional lattice structures. The
   elastic microstructure can be designed to have an omnidirectional

   cubic behaviour of the periodic system has been fully characterized; the
   minimum and maximum Poisson's ratio and the associated principal

   The initial microstructure is then modified into a body-centred cubic
   system that can achieve Poisson's ratio lower than -1 and that can also
   behave as an isotropic three-dimensional auxetic structure. (C) 2016

Title = {{Planar auxeticity from elliptic inclusions}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITES PART B-ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{94}},
Pages = {{379-388}},
Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{Composites with elliptic inclusions of long semi-axis a and short
   semi-axis b are studied by the Finite Element method. The centres of
   ellipses form a square lattice of the unit lattice constant. The
   neighbouring ellipses are perpendicular to each other and their axes are
   parallel to the lattice axes. The influence of geometry and material
   characteristics on the effective mechanical properties of these
   anisotropic composites is investigated for deformations applied along
   lattice axes. It is found that for anisotropic inclusions of low Young's
   modulus, when a + b -> 1 the effective Poisson's ratio tends to -1,
   while the effective Young's modulus takes very low values. In this case
   the structure performs the rotating rigid body mechanism. In the limit
   of large values of Young's modulus of inclusions, both effective
   Poisson's ratio and effective Young's modulus saturate to values which
   do not depend on Poisson's ratio of inclusions but depend on geometry of
   the composite and the matrix Poisson's ratio. For highly anisotropic
   inclusions of very large Young's modulus, the effective Poisson's ratio
   of the composite can be negative for nonauxetic both matrix and
   inclusions. This is a very simple example of an auxetic structure being
   not only entirely continuous, but with very high Young's modulus. A
   severe qualitative change in the composite behaviour is observed as a/b
   reaches the limit of 1, i.e. inclusions are isotropic. The observed
   changes in both Poisson's ratio and Young's modulus are complex
   functions of parameters defining the composite. The latter allows one to
   tailor a material of practically arbitrary elastic parameters. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{The recently discovered tetragonal, monoclinic and orthorhombic
   polymorphs of M3N4 (M-C, Si, Sn) are investigated by using
   first-principles calculations. A set of anisotropic elastic quantities,
   i.e., the bulk and shear moduli, Young's modulus, Poisson ratio B/G
   ratio and Vickers hardness of M3N4 (M=C, Si, Sn) are predicted. The
   quasi-harmonic Debye model, assuming that the solids are isotopic, may
   lead to large errors for the non-cubic crystals. The thermal effects are
   obtained by the traditional quasi-harmonic approach. The dependences of
   heat capacity, thermal expansion coefficient and Debye temperature on
   temperature and pressure are systematically discussed in the pressure
   range of 0-10 GPa and in the temperature range of 0-1100 K. More
   importantly, o-C3N4 is a negative thermal expansion material. Our
   results may have important consequences in shaping the understanding of

Abstract = {{Stretching 7-constant rhombohedral crystals is described in the theory
   of elasticity. Numerical analysis, based on the obtained analytical
   expressions for Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio, is showed that
   three of the eight 7-constant rhombohedral crystals are partial
   auxetics, i.e. they have a negative Poisson's ratio in some directions
   of stretching crystals. Minimum and maximum values of Poisson's ratio
   and Young's modulus, values of the average Poisson's ratio and the
   minimum and maximum values of Poisson's ratio for particular
   orientations were obtained. Auxetic surfaces corresponding to zero
   Poisson's ratio were plotted. Solution of problems of tension and
   torsion curvilinear anisotropic nano/microtubes from 7-constant
   rhombohedral crystals was considered under Saint-Venant's approach.
   Analytical expressions of Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio for these
   nano/microtubes were obtained. Numerical analysis allowed to find six of
   the eight auxetics among nano/microtubes. Values of Poisson's ratio for
   thin-walled nano/microtubes from 7-constant rhombohedral crystals, as
   well as critical values of thickness parameter at which the change in
   the sign of Poisson's ratio were obtained. It is shown that Young's
   modulus slightly dependent on the thickness parameter of the tube. An
   analytical expression for the torsional stiffness of nano/microtubes
   from 7-constant rhombohedral crystals were obtained. The numerical
   values of the coefficient characterizing the torsional stiffness of
   nano/microtubes of 7-constant rhombohedral crystals were given. It is
   found that the influence of the chirality angle on the mechanical
   characteristics of nano/microtubes from 7-constant rhombohedral crystals
   in the case of the direct and inverse Poynting's effect unlike tubes
   from orthorhombic and tetragonal crystals are absent.}},

Abstract = {{To analyze the influence of an adjacent foundation on ground stiffness,
   a new concept of ground stiffness influence coefficient is introduced,
   which is defined as the ratio of the ground stiffness with the adjacent
   foundation to that without. Based on the Mindlin solution, an analytical
   expression of the influence coefficient is derived from a system of two
   rigid, surface, rectangular foundations under three-dimensional elastic
   half space. Through calculating the influence coefficient, we analyze
   the influences of clear distance, side-length ratio of foundations and
   Poisson's ratio of the ground soil on ground stiffness when the adjacent
   foundation exists. It is shown that: (1) The ground stiffness can be
   improved when the effect of the adjacent foundation is taken into
   account. (2) The influence of the adjacent foundation on ground
   stiffness shows a positive correlation with the side-length ratio and
   the Poisson's ratio, and a negative correlation with the clear distance.
   (3) The influence is more significant in clay ground than in other kinds
   of ground, such as silt ground. (4) It is not necessary to consider the
   influence of adjacent foundation when the clear distance is larger than
   15 times the side length of the foundation or the side-length ratio is
   less than 0.1. In other cases, however, we should decide whether or not
   it is necessary to consider the influence of both the clear distance and
   the side-length ratio.}},

Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2016}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic materials and structures are increasingly used in various fields
   because of their unusual properties. Auxetic tubular structures have
   been fabricated and studied due to their potential to be adopted as
   oesophageal stents where only tensile auxetic performance is required.
   However, studies on compressive mechanical properties of auxetic tubular
   structures are limited in the current literature. In this paper, we
   developed a simple tubular structure which exhibits auxetic behaviour in
   both compression and tension. This was achieved by extending a design
   concept recently proposed by the authors for generating 3D metallic
   auxetic metamaterials. Both compressive and tensile mechanical
   properties of the auxetic tubular structure were investigated. It was
   found that the methodology for generating 3D auxetic metamaterials could
   be effectively used to create auxetic tubular structures as well. By
   properly adjusting certain parameters, the mechanical properties of the
   designed auxetic tubular structure could be easily tuned.}},

Abstract = {{Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) is often considered as a main
   covariate for predicting crash frequencies at urban and suburban
   intersections. A linear functional form is typically assumed for the
   Safety Performance Function (SPF) to describe the relationship between
   the natural logarithm of expected crash frequency and covariates derived
   from AADTs. Such a linearity assumption has been questioned by many
   researchers. This study applies Generalized Additive Models (GAMS) and
   Piecewise Linear Negative Binomial (PLNB) regression models to fit
   intersection crash data. Various covariates derived from minor-and
   major-approach AADTs are considered. Three different dependent variables
   are modeled, which are total multiple-vehicle crashes, rear-end crashes,
   and angle crashes. The modeling results suggest that a nonlinear
   functional form may be more appropriate. Also, the results show that it
   is important to take into consideration the joint safety effects of
   multiple covariates. Additionally, it is found that the ratio of minor
   to major-approach AADT has a varying impact on intersection safety and
   deserves further investigations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{98}},
Pages = {{71-78}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{This study examines measures of predictive power for a generalized
   linear model (GLM). Although many measures of predictive power for GLMs
   have been proposed, most have limitations. Hence, we focus on the
   regression correlation coefficient (RCC) (Zheng and Agresti, 2000),
   which satisfies the four requirements of (i) interpretability, (ii)
   applicability, (iii) consistency, and (iv) affinity. The RCC is a
   population value that is defined by the correlation between a response
   variable and the conditional expectation of the response variable. Its
   sample value is defined by the sample correlation between the observed
   response values and estimated values of the response variable. For an
   arbitrary GLM, we do not always have an explicit form of the RCC.
   However, for a Poisson regression model, assuming that the predictor
   variables have a multivariate normal distribution, we can find the
   explicit form of the RCC (true value). Therefore, it is possible to
   compare the estimators (sample values) of the RCC in terms of bias and
   RMSE (root of the mean square error) by using the true value.
   Furthermore, by using the explicit form, we propose a new estimator of
   the RCC for the Poisson regression model. We then compare the new
   estimator with the sample correlation estimator, the jack-knife
   estimator, and the leave-one-out cross validation estimator in terms of
   bias and RMSE. The leave-one-out cross validation estimator has large
   negative bias and large RMSE. Although the remaining three estimators
   show similar behavior for a large sample size, for a small sample size
   the new estimator shows the best behavior in terms of bias and RMSE. (C)

Abstract = {{The linear thermal expansion coefficients (LTEC) and thermomechanics of
   single-layer black and blue phosphorus are systematically studied using
   first-principles based on quasiharmonic approximation. We find the
   thermal expansion of black phosphorus is very anisotropic. The LTEC
   along zigzag direction has a turning from negative to positive at around
   138 K, while the LTEC along armchair direction is positive (except below
   8 K) and about 2.5 times larger than that along zigzag direction at 300
   K. For blue phosphorus, the LTEC is negative in the temperature range
   from 0 to 350 K. In addition, we find that the Young's modulus and
   Poisson's ratio of black phosphorus along zigzag direction are 4 to 5
   times larger than those along armchair direction within considered
   temperature range, showing a remarkable anisotropic in-plane
   thermomechanics property. The mechanisms of these peculiar thermal
   properties are also explored. This work provides a theoretical
   understanding of the thermal expansion and thermomechanics of this
   single layer phosphorus family, which will be useful in nanodevices. (C)

Abstract = {{Developing functional small-diameter vascular grafts is an important
   objective in tissue engineering research. In this study, we address the
   problem of compliance mismatch by designing and developing a 3D tubular
   construct that has a negative Poisson's ratio v(xy) (NPR). NPR
   constructs have the unique ability to expand transversely when pulled
   axially, thereby resulting in a highly-compliant tubular construct. In
   this work, we used projection stereolithography to 3D-print a planar NPR
   sheet composed of photosensitive poly(ethylene) glycol diacrylate
   biomaterial. We used a step-lithography exposure and a stitch process to
   scale up the projection printing process, and used the cut-missing rib
   unit design to develop a centimeter-scale NPR sheet, which was rolled up
   to form a tubular construct. The constructs had Poisson's ratios of -0.6
   <= -v(xy) <= -0.1. The NPR construct also supports higher cellular
   adhesion than does the construct that has positive v(xy). Our NPR design
   offers a significant advance in the development of highly-compliant
   vascular grafts.}},

Abstract = {{In order to evaluate the influence of porosity on the elastic properties
   of crustal rocks at deep crustal pressures, we performed laboratory
   measurements of compressional-wave (Vp) and shear-wave (Vs) velocities
   in a porosity-developed gabbro sample up to 1.0 GPa at room temperature.
   Based on the measured Vp and Vs data, we evaluated the changes in
   velocities, Vp/Vs, Poisson's ratio (sigma), and total porosity of the
   rock as a function of pressure. Compared with the `porosity-free'
   intrinsic elastic values of the gabbro sample, our results suggest that
   the development of porosity in crustal rocks lowers their Vp, Vs, Vp/Vs,
   and Poisson's ratio. Deviations (Delta Vp, Delta Vs, Delta Vp/Vs, and
   Delta sigma) of the measured values from the intrinsic values are
   enhanced with increasing porosity. We evaluated the AVp from previous
   experimental study on the rocks of Tanzawa plutonic complex providing
   constraints on interpretation of the seismic velocity profiles of the
   Izu-Bonin-Mariana (IBM) arc and found a large negative Delta Vp (up to -
   22.7\%) at lower pressures. The intrinsic velocity combined with the
   measured velocity data at in situ pressure conditions suggest that the
   ranges of Vp (6.0-6.5 km/s) in the middle crust of the IBM arc reflect
   the presence of considerable porosity and its closure in intermediate
   rocks and/or the change of composition from felsic to intermediate in
   mid-crustal rocks. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional (2D) crystalline materials possess unique structural,
   mechanical and electronic properties(1,2) that make them highly
   attractive in many applications(3-5). Although there have been advances
   in preparing 2D materials that consist of one or a few atomic or
   molecular layers(6,7), bottom-up assembly of 2D crystalline materials
   remains a challenge and an active area of development(8-10). More
   challenging is the design of dynamic 2D lattices that can undergo
   large-scale motions without loss of crystallinity. Dynamic behaviour in
   porous three-dimensional (3D) crystalline solids has been exploited for
   stimuli-responsive functions and adaptive behaviour(11-13). As in such
   3D materials, integrating flexibility and adaptiveness into crystalline
   2D lattices would greatly broaden the functional scope of 2D materials.
   Here we report the self-assembly of unsupported, 2D protein lattices
   with precise spatial arrangements and patterns using a readily
   accessible design strategy. Three single-or double-point mutants of the
   C4-symmetric protein RhuA were designed to assemble via different modes
   of intermolecular interactions (single-disulfide, double-disulfide and
   metal-coordination) into crystalline 2D arrays. Owing to the flexibility
   of the single-disulfide interactions, the lattices of one of the
   variants ((C98)RhuA) are essentially defect-free and undergo
   substantial, but fully correlated, changes in molecular arrangement,
   yielding coherently dynamic 2D molecular lattices. (C98)RhuA lattices
   display a Poisson's ratio of -1-the lowest thermodynamically possible
   value for an isotropic material-making them auxetic.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Recent antimicrobial resistance data are lacking from
   inpatient oncology settings to guide infection prophylaxis and treatment
   recommendations. We describe central line-associated bloodstream
   infection (CLABSI) pathogens and antimicrobial resistance patterns
   reported from oncology locations to the Centers for Disease Control and
   Prevention's National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN).
   Methods. CLABSI data reported to NHSN from 2009 to 2012 from adult
   inpatient oncology locations were compared to data from nononcology
   adult locations within the same hospitals. Pathogen profile,
   antimicrobial resistance rates, and CLABSI incidence rates per 1000
   central line-days were calculated. CLABSI incidence rates were compared
   using Poisson regression.
   Results. During 2009-2012, 4654 CLABSIs were reported to NHSN from 299
   adult oncology units. The most common organisms causing CLABSI in
   oncology locations were coagulase-negative staphylococci (16.9\%),
   Escherichia coli (11.8\%), and Enterococcus faecium (11.4\%).
   Fluoroquinolone resistance was more common among E. coli CLABSI in
   oncology than nononcology locations (56.5\% vs 41.5\% of isolates
   tested; P < .0001) and increased significantly from 2009-2010 to
   2011-2012 (49.5\% vs 60.4\%; P = .01). Furthermore, rates of CLABSI were
   significantly higher in oncology compared to nononcology locations for
   fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli (rate ratio, 7.37; 95\% confidence
   interval {[}CI], 6.20-8.76) and vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (rate
   ratio, 2.27, 95\% CI, 2.03-2.53). However, resistance rates for some
   organisms, such as Klebsiella species and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, were
   lower in oncology than in nononcology locations.
   Conclusions. Antimicrobial-resistant E. coli and E. faecium have become
   significant pathogens in oncology. Practices for antimicrobial
   prophylaxis and empiric antimicrobial therapy should be regularly
   assessed in conjunction with contemporary antimicrobial resistance data.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports the first attempt of developing macro-scale auxetic
   structures based on re-entrant hexagon design from braided composite
   materials for civil engineering applications. Braided composite rods
   (BCRs) were produced and arranged as longitudinal and horizontal
   elements to produce three types of auxetic structures: (1) basic
   re-entrant hexagon structure, (2) basic structure modified by adding
   straight longitudinal elements and (3): structure-2 modified by changing
   structural angle. The influence of various material and structural
   parameters as well as structure type on Poisson's ratio and tensile
   properties was thoroughly investigated. The auxetic behaviour was found
   to strongly depend on the structural angle and straight elements,
   resulting in lower auxeticity with lower angles and in presence of
   straight elements. Material parameters influenced the auxetic behaviour
   to a lesser extent and a decrease in auxetic behaviour was noticed with
   increase in core fibre linear density and using stiffer fibres such as
   carbon. The reverse effect was observed in case of tensile strength and
   work of rupture. Among these structures, structure-3 exhibited good
   auxetic behaviour, balanced tensile properties, and high energy
   absorption capacity and their auxetic behaviour could be well predicted
   with the developed analytical model. Therefore, these novel structures
   present good potential for strengthening of civil structures. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{The zero-inflated negative binomial regression model (ZINB) is often
   employed in diverse fields such as dentistry, health care utilization,
   highway safety, and medicine to examine relationships between exposures
   of interest and overdispersed count outcomes exhibiting many zeros. The
   regression coefficients of ZINB have latent class interpretations for a
   susceptible subpopulation at risk for the disease/condition under study
   with counts generated from a negative binomial distribution and for a
   non-susceptible subpopulation that provides only zero counts. The ZINB
   parameters, however, are not well-suited for estimating overall exposure
   effects, specifically, in quantifying the effect of an explanatory
   variable in the overall mixture population. In this paper, a
   marginalized zero-inflated negative binomial regression (MZINB) model
   for independent responses is proposed to model the population marginal
   mean count directly, providing straightforward inference for overall
   exposure effects based on maximum likelihood estimation. Through
   simulation studies, the finite sample performance of MZINB is compared
   with marginalized zero-inflated Poisson, Poisson, and negative binomial
   regression. The MZINB model is applied in the evaluation of a
   school-based fluoride mouthrinse program on dental caries in 677
   children. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The performance of flexible and stretchable sensors relies on the
   optimization of both the flexible substrate and the sensing element, and
   their synergistic interactions. Herein, a novel strategy is reported for
   cost-effective and scalable manufacturing of a new class of porous
   materials as 3D flexible and stretchable piezoresistive sensors, by
   assembling carbon nanotubes onto porous substrates of tunable Poisson
   ratios. It is shown that the piezoresistive sensitivity of the sensors
   increases as the substrate's Poisson's ratio decreases. Substrates with
   negative Poisson ratios (auxetic foams) exhibit significantly higher
   piezoresistive sensitivity, resulting from the coherent mode of
   deformation of the auxetic foam and enhanced changes of tunneling
   resistance of the carbon nanotube networks. Compared with conventional
   foam sensors, the auxetic foam sensor (AFS) with a Poisson's ratio of
   -0.5 demonstrates a 300\% improvement in piezoresistive sensitivity and
   the gauge factor increases as much as 500\%. The AFS has high sensing
   capability, is extremely robust, and capable of multimodal sensing, such
   as large deformation sensing, pressure sensing, shear/torsion sensing,
   and underwater sensing. AFS shows great potential for a broad range of
   wearable and portable devices applications, which are described by
   reporting on a series of demonstrations.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents an experimental and geometrical study of a novel
   kind of plied yarn structure with negative Poisson's ratio (NPR). The
   deformation mechanism of the yarn structure formed with two stiff yarns
   and two soft yarns to achieve NPR behavior was firstly introduced. Based
   on the proposed yarn structure, four kinds of yarn samples were then
   fabricated with two kinds of stiff yarns and two types of soft yarns and
   tested under the axial extension to verify their auxetic or NPR effect.
   A geometric analysis was finally conducted to theoretically calculate
   the Poisson's ratio of the yarn structure and compared with the
   experimental results. The study shows that the proposed yarn structure
   has obvious NPR effect and the geometrical analysis can well predict its
   Poisson's ratio in the higher axial strain range. It is expected that
   this study could promote further development of auxetic textiles with
   unusual behavior.}},

Abstract = {{The banana root borer, Cosmopolites sordidus Germar (Coleoptera:
   Curculionidae), is a major pest in many banana (Musa spp.)producing
   regions of the world, causing yield losses of up to 100\%. The aims of
   this study were to define the spatial distribution pattern of C.
   sordidus in banana plantations, to determine the probability
   distribution model that best describes the sampling data, and to develop
   a sequential sampling plan for this pest. Aggregation was investigated
   using aggregation indices and theoretical frequency distributions. To
   quantify the number of insects, 80 traps were distributed in a
   commercial banana plantation with an area of 4 ha and inspections were
   performed every 2 wk from 2005 to 2008. The sequential sampling plan was
   based on Wald's sequential probability ratio test. The calculated
   indices indicated moderate aggregation, with a common k parameter of the
   negative binomial distribution equal to 3.29. The best model for
   predicting the spatial distribution of the insects was the negative
   binomial distribution, which fit 93\% of the inspections, followed by
   the Neyman Type A distribution, which fit 90\% of the surveys, and
   Poisson's distribution, which fit only one survey. A sequential sampling
   plan was generated with Type I and II error rates of 5\%, for which 19
   was the maximum expected number of samples required to reach a decision
   for an infestation mean of approximately 3.7 insects per trap. The
   validation showed that the constructed plan is reliable and provides
   correct recommendations for decision-making in pest control.}},

Abstract = {{We consider count data modeling, in particular, the zero-truncated case
   as it arises naturally in capture-recapture modeling as the marginal
   distribution of the count of identifications of the members of a target
   population. Whereas in wildlife ecology these distributions are often of
   a well-defined type, this is less the case for social and medical
   science applications since study types are often entirely observational.
   Hence, in these applications, violations of the assumptions underlying
   closed capture-recapture are more likely to occur than in carefully
   designed capture-recapture experiments. As a consequence, the marginal
   count distribution might be rather complex. The purpose of this note is
   to sketch some of the major ideas in the recent developments in ratio
   plotting and ratio regression designed to explore the pattern of the
   distribution underlying the capture process. Ratio plotting and ratio
   regression are based upon considering the ratios of neighboring
   probabilities which can be estimated by ratios of observed frequencies.
   Frequently, these ratios show patterns which can be easily modeled by a
   regression model. The fitted regression model is then used to predict
   the frequency of hidden zero counts. Particular attention is given to
   regression models corresponding to the negative binomial, multiplicative
   binomial and the Conway-Maxwell-Poisson distribution.}},

Abstract = {{A parametric beam lattice model is formulated to analyze the propagation
   properties of elastic in-plane waves in an auxetic material based on a
   hexachiral topology of the periodic cell, equipped with inertial local
   resonators. The Floquet-Bloch boundary conditions are imposed on a
   low-order linear model, suitably reduced to the only dynamically active

   the resonators can be designed to open and shift band gaps, an optimal
   design, focused on the largest possible gap in the low-frequency range,
   is achieved by solving a maximization problem in the bounded space of
   the significant geometrical and mechanical parameters. A local optimized
   solution, for the lowest pair of consecutive dispersion curves, is found
   by employing the globally convergent version of the method of moving
   asymptotes, combined with Monte Carlo and quasi-Monte Carlo multi-start

Title = {{Auxeticity in truss networks and the role of bending versus stretching
   deformation}},
Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic behavior (i.e., a negative value of Poisson's ratio) has been
   reported for a variety of cellular networks including truss structures.
   Commonly, this implies that the geometric arrangement of truss members
   within a periodic unit cell is designed to achieve the negative Poisson
   effect, e.g., in the reentrant honeycomb configuration. Here, we show
   that elastic periodic truss lattices can be tuned to display auxeticity
   by controlling the ratio of bending to stretching stiffness. If the
   nodal stiffness (or the bending stiffness) is low compared to the
   stretching stiffness of individual truss members, then the lattice is
   expected to exhibit a positive Poisson's ratio, showing lateral
   expansion upon uniaxial compression. In contrast, if the nodal or
   bending stiffness is high (and buckling is prevented), the lattice may
   reveal auxetic behavior, contracting laterally under uniaxial
   compression. This effect is demonstrated in two dimensions for the
   examples of square and triangular lattices, and it is confirmed both
   analytically in the limit of small strains as well as numerically for
   finite elastic deformation. Under large deformation, instability
   additionally gives rise to auxetic behavior due to truss buckling.}},

   present capabilities and challenges}},
Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic metamaterials are known for having a negative Poisson's ratio
   (NPR) and for displaying the unexpected properties of lateral expansion
   when stretched and densification when compressed. Even though a wide set
   of micro-manufacturing resources have been used for the development of
   auxetic metamaterials and related devices, additional precision and an
   extension to other families of materials is needed for their industrial
   expansion. In addition, their manufacture using ceramic materials is
   still challenging. In this study we present a very promising approach
   for the development of auxetic metamaterials and devices based on the
   use of lithography-based ceramic manufacturing. The process stands out
   for its precision and complex three-dimensional geometries attainable,
   without the need of supporting structures, and for enabling the
   manufacture of ceramic auxetics with their geometry controlled from the
   design stage with micrometric precision. To our knowledge it represents
   the first example of application of this technology to the manufacture
   of auxetic geometries using ceramic materials. We have used a special
   three-dimensional auxetic design whose remarkable NPR has been
   previously highlighted.}},

Abstract = {{This study compared low strain rate material properties and impact force
   attenuation of auxetic foam and the conventional open-cell polyurethane
   counterpart. This furthers our knowledge with regards to how best to
   apply these highly conformable and breathable auxetic foams to
   protective sports equipment. Cubes of auxetic foam measuring 150 x 150 x
   150 mm were fabricated using a thermo-mechanical conversion process.
   Quasi-static compression confirmed the converted foam to be auxetic,
   prior to being sliced into 20 mm thick cuboid samples for further
   testing. Density, Poisson's ratio and the stress-strain curve were all
   found to be dependent on the position of each cuboid from within the
   cube. Impact tests with a hemispherical drop hammer were performed for
   energies up to 6 J, on foams covered with a polypropylene sheet between
   1 and 2 mm thick. Auxetic samples reduced peak force by similar to 10
   times in comparison to the conventional foam. This work has shown
   further potential for auxetic foam to be applied to protective
   equipment, while identifying that improved fabrication methods are

Title = {{Longitudinal wave motion in width-constrained auxetic plates}},
Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{This paper investigates the longitudinal wave velocity in auxetic plates
   in comparison to conventional ones, in which the plate is constrained
   from motion in the width direction. By taking into account the thickness
   change of the plate and its corresponding change in density, the
   developed wave velocity is casted not only as a function of Young's
   modulus and density, but also in terms of Poisson's ratio and
   longitudinal strain. Results show that density and thickness variations
   compensate for one another when the Poisson's ratio is positive, but add
   up when the Poisson's ratio is negative. Results also reveal that the
   classical model of longitudinal wave velocity for the plate is accurate
   when the Poisson's ratio is about 1/3; at this Poisson's ratio the
   influence from density and thickness variations cancel each other.
   Comparison between the current corrected model and the density-corrected
   Rayleigh-Lamb model reveals a number of consistent trends, while the
   discrepancies are elucidated. If the plate material possesses a negative
   Poisson's ratio, the deviation of the actual wave velocity from the
   classical model becomes significant; auxeticity suppresses and enhances
   the wave velocity in compressive and tensile impacts, respectively.
   Hence the use of the corrected model is proposed when predicting
   longitudinal waves in width-constrained auxetic plates, and auxetic
   materials can be harnessed for effectively controlling wave velocities
   in thin-walled structures.}},

Title = {{Refined shear correction factor for very thick simply supported and
   uniformly loaded isosceles right triangular auxetic plates}},
Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{For moderately thick plates, the use of First order Shear Deformation
   Theory (FSDT) with a constant shear correction factor of 5/6 is
   sufficient to take into account the plate deflection arising from
   transverse shear deformation. For very thick plates, the use of Third
   order Shear Deformation Theory (TSDT) is preferred as it allows the
   shear strain distribution to be varied through the plate thickness.
   Therefore no correction factor is required in TSDT, unlike FSDT. Due to
   the complexity involved in TSDT, this paper obtains a more accurate
   shear correction factor for use in FSDT of very thick simply supported
   and uniformly loaded isosceles right triangular plates based on the
   TSDT. By matching the maximum deflections for this plate according to
   FSDT and TSDT, a variable shear correction factor is obtained. Results
   show that the shear correction factor for the simplified TSDT, i.e.
   14/17, is least accurate. The commonly adopted shear correction factor
   of 5/6 in FSDT is valid only for very thin or highly auxetic plates.
   This paper provides a variable shear correction for FSDT deflection that
   matches the plate deflection by TSDT. This variable shear correction
   factor allows designers to justify the use of a commonly adopted shear
   correction factor of 5/6 even for very thick plates as long as the
   Poisson's ratio of the plate material is sufficiently negative.}},

Title = {{Phononic band gap design in honeycomb lattice with combinations of
   auxetic and conventional core}},
Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{We present a novel design of a honeycomb lattice geometry that uses a
   seamless combination of conventional and auxetic cores, i.e. elements
   showing positive and negative Poisson's ratio. The design is aimed at
   tuning and improving the band structure of periodic cellular structures.
   The proposed cellular configurations show a significantly wide band gap
   at much lower frequencies compared to their pure counterparts, while
   still retaining their major dynamic features. Different topologies
   involving both auxetic inclusions in a conventional lattice and
   conversely hexagonal cellular inclusions in auxetic butterfly lattices
   are presented. For all these cases the impact of the varying degree of
   auxeticity on the band structure is evaluated. The proposed cellular
   designs may offer significant advantages in tuning high-frequency
   bandgap behaviour, which is relevant to phononics applications. The
   configurations shown in this paper may be made iso-volumetric and
   iso-weight to a given regular hexagonal topology, making possible to
   adapt the hybrid lattices to existing sandwich structures with fixed
   dimensions and weights. This work also features a comparative study of
   the wave speeds corresponding to different configurations vis-a vis
   those of a regular honeycomb to highlight the superior behaviour of the
   combined hybrid lattice.}},

Abstract = {{The work describes the vibroacoustic behavior of anti-tetrachiral and
   auxetic hexagonal gradient sandwich panels using homogenized finite

   structure over the frequency range of 0-1000 Hz is minimized by
   modifying the core geometry of the gradient auxetic sandwich panels.
   Several excitation cases are considered. First-order and random
   optimization methods are used for the minimization of radiated sound
   power level of the structures. The results of this study present

Title = {{The influence of large deformations on mechanical properties of
   sinusoidal ligament structures}},
Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Studies of mechanical properties of materials, both theoretical and
   experimental, usually deal with linear characteristics assuming a small
   range of deformations. In particular, not much research has been
   published devoted to large deformations of auxetic structures - i.e.
   structures exhibiting negative Poisson's ratio. This paper is focused on
   mechanical properties of selected structures that are subject to large
   deformations. Four examples of structure built of sinusoidal ligaments
   are studied and for each geometry the impact of deformation size and
   geometrical parameters on the effective mechanical properties of these
   structures are investigated. It is shown that some of them are auxetic
   when compressed and non-auxetic when stretched. Geometrical parameters
   describing sinusoidal shape of ligaments strongly affect effective
   mechanical properties of the structure. In some cases of deformation,
   the increase of the value of amplitude of the sinusoidal shape decreases
   the effective Poisson's ratio by 0.7. Therefore the influence of
   geometry, as well as the arrangement of ligaments allows for smart
   control of mechanical properties of the sinusoidal ligament structure
   being considered. Given the large deformation of the structure, both a
   linear elastic material model, and a hyperelastic Neo-Hookean material
   model are used.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{15}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: Quantitative data mining methods can be used to identify
   potential signals of unexpected relationships between drug and adverse
   event (AE). This study aims to compare and explore the use of three data
   mining methods in our small spontaneous AE database.
   Methods: We consider reporting odds ratio (ROR), Bayesian Confidence
   Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN) and Gamma Poisson Shrinker (GPS)
   assuming two different sets of criteria: (1) ROR-1.96SE>1, IC-1.96SD>0,
   EB05>1 (2) ROR-1.96SE>2, IC-1.96SD>1, EB05>2. Count of drug-AE pairs 3
   was considered for ROR and GPS.
   Results: The Health Sciences Authority, Singapore received 151,180 AE
   reports between 1993 and 2013. ROR, BCPNN and GPS identified 2,835,
   2,311 and 2,374 significant drug-AE pairs using Criterion 1, and 1,899,
   1,101 and 1,358 respectively using Criterion 2. The performance of the
   three methods with respect to specificity, positive predictive value and
   negative predictive value were similar, although ROR yielded a higher
   sensitivity and larger area under the receiver operating characteristic
   curve. ROR and GPS picked up some potential signals which BCPNN missed.
   Conclusions: The defined threshold used for ROR (Criterion 1) is a
   useful screening tool for our small database. It may be used in
   conjunction with GPS to avoid missed signals.}},

Abstract = {{We analyze in this contribution the impact of wave damping-on the
   dispersion features of 3D viscoelastic periodic structures, which are
   modeled as Kelvin Voigt viscoelastic beam-lattices. The band diagram
   structure and damping ratio are computed for different repetitive
   structures, based on the micropolar viscoelastic response of the
   effective medium obtained by the homogenization of the initially
   discrete lattice architecture. The employed methodology is herewith
   exemplified for the cases of the 3D hexagon structure, which shows
   negative Poisson's ratio for reentrant configurations, and the 2D plain
   weave textile structure. The dispersion relations and damping ratio are
   obtained by inserting an harmonic plane waves Ansatz into the dynamical
   equations of motion of the obtained effective viscoelastic anisotropic
   continuum. The 3D reentrant hexagon is an auxetic metamaterial showing
   excellent wave absorption capabilities, as reflected by the high
   incidence of partial band gaps. The textile plain weave structure shows
   a complete band gap for low frequencies. Comparing the frequency band
   structure of the effective continuum with that obtained by Floquet Bloch
   analysis extended to a 3D context shows that the wave propagation
   characteristics can be directly obtained from the homogenized continuum
   at low frequencies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Screening programmes for type 2 diabetes inevitably find more people at
   high risk of developing diabetes than people with undiagnosed prevalent
   diabetes. We describe the incidence of diabetes for risk groups
   according to advancement in a screening process.
   In 2001-2006, a diabetes screening programme based on the Danish
   diabetes risk score and measures of HbA(1c) and glucose was carried out
   in Danish general practices. The present study includes 13,249
   individuals with low diabetes risk scores and 22,726 with high diabetes
   risk scores but no diabetes according to WHO 1999 criteria. Seven
   incremental levels of diabetes risk were defined and followed for
   incident diabetes recorded in the Danish National Diabetes Register
   until December 2012. For each group, cumulative diabetes incidence was
   calculated. Incidence rates and rate ratios were estimated by Poisson
   regression analyses.
   After 10 years of follow-up 1,164 new diabetes cases were registered.
   Incidence rates were 1.0, 4.2, 14.5, 28.8 and 52.6 per 1,000
   person-years in individuals at low risk and in those with normal glucose
   tolerance, impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance and one
   diabetic glucose value, respectively. For each step in the screening
   algorithm, the risk of developing diabetes was higher than in the
   previous step.
   The risk of developing clinical diabetes in people who screen negative
   for diabetes depends on the level of risk stratification at screening,
   even at lower risk levels. This risk increases markedly in the presence
   of impaired glucose regulation. These results can inform policy
   recommendations concerning prevention strategies following screening.}},

Title = {{A nonlinear mechanics model of bio-inspired hierarchical lattice
   materials consisting of horseshoe microstructures}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICS AND PHYSICS OF SOLIDS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{90}},
Pages = {{179-202}},

Abstract = {{Development of advanced synthetic materials that can mimic the
   mechanical properties of non-mineralized soft biological materials has
   important implications in a wide range of technologies. Hierarchical
   lattice materials constructed with horseshoe microstructures belong to
   this class of bio-inspired synthetic materials, where the mechanical
   responses can be tailored to match the nonlinear J-shaped stress-strain
   curves of human skins. The underlying relations between the J-shaped
   stress-strain curves and their microstructure geometry are essential in
   designing such systems for targeted applications. Here, a theoretical
   model of this type of hierarchical lattice material is developed by
   combining a finite deformation constitutive relation of the building
   block (i.e., horseshoe microstructure), with the analyses of equilibrium
   and deformation compatibility in the periodical lattices. The nonlinear
   J-shaped stress-strain curves and Poisson ratios predicted by this model
   agree very well with results of finite element analyses (FEA) and
   experiment. Based on this model, analytic solutions were obtained for
   some key mechanical quantities, e.g., elastic modulus, Poisson ratio,
   peak modulus, and critical strain around which the tangent modulus
   increases rapidly. A negative Poisson effect is revealed in the
   hierarchical lattice with triangular topology, as opposed to a positive
   Poisson effect in hierarchical lattices with Kagome and honeycomb
   topologies. The lattice topology is also found to have a strong
   influence on the stress-strain curve. For the three isotropic lattice
   topologies (triangular, Kagome and honeycomb), the hierarchical
   triangular lattice material renders the sharpest transition in the
   stress-strain curve and relative high stretchability, given the same
   porosity and arc angle of horseshoe microstructure. Furthermore, a
   demonstrative example illustrates the utility of the developed model in
   the rapid optimization of hierarchical lattice materials for reproducing
   the desired stress-strain curves of human skins. This study provides
   theoretical guidelines for future designs of soft bio-mimetic materials
   with hierarchical lattice constructions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Designing new materials with novel topological properties and reduced
   dimensionality is always desirable for material innovation. Here we
   report the design of a two-dimensional material, namely Be5C2 monolayer
   on the basis of density functional theory computations. In Be5C2
   monolayer, each carbon atom binds with five beryllium atoms in almost
   the same plane, forming a quasi-planar pentacoordinate carbon moiety.
   Be5C2 monolayer appears to have good stability as revealed by its
   moderate cohesive energy, positive phonon modes and high melting point.
   It is the lowest-energy structure with the Be5C2 stoichiometry in
   two-dimensional space and therefore holds some promise to be realized
   experimentally. Be5C2 monolayer is a gapless semiconductor with a
   Dirac-like point in the band structure and also has an unusual negative
   Poisson's ratio. If synthesized, Be5C2 monolayer may find applications
   in electronics and mechanics.}},

Abstract = {{A solution for the tension and torsion problems for the curvilinearly
   anisotropic nano/microtubes made of orthorhombic crystals in the
   framework of the Saint-Venant's approach is given. We find that the
   number of partial auxetics among the tubes is twice as. frequent among
   the rectilinearly anisotropic crystals, at the same time about one third
   of 136 orthorhombic crystals are auxetics. It is shown that the torsion
   causes extension of the nano/microtubes even in the absence of a
   longitudinal tensile force. This Poynting's effect substantially depends
   on the chiral angle, and in particular, it disappears when the chiral
   angle vanishes. We also investigate an inverse Poynting's effect when
   the extension of the nano/microtubes is accompanied by their twisting.
   It is shown that the signs of Poynting's effect and Poisson's ratio are
   changed several times with the change of the chiral angle.}},

Abstract = {{Recent frontiers in material development are represented by a class of
   so-called auxetic metamaterials that, thanks to their structure rather
   than composition, are characterized by a negative Poisson's ratio. In
   the present paper a two-dimensional auxetic plate, made by structural
   straight elements forming a lattice periodic structure with re-entrant
   cells, is considered. A thorough discussion on the linear and
   geometrically nonlinear deformability of the auxetic plate is presented.
   The key geometric parameters governing the deformability of the plate
   are identified, and some analytical expressions for calculating the
   Poisson's ratio, as a function of the applied strain, are given.
   Numerical (finite element) analyses and experimental tests on 3D printed
   specimens are carried out to verify the theoretical findings. For the
   latter ones, full field strain maps are obtained by means of a suitable
   interpolation of the sampled displacement field measured by digital
   image techniques.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a systematic study of the helical auxetic yarn (HAY)
   via careful in-house fabrication and characterisation of a wide range of
   polymeric fibres and yarns. It provides a better understanding of the
   auxetic behaviour of the HAY in order to tailor their properties for
   specific applications. The study focused on three parameters: component
   moduli, the core/wrap diameter ratio and the initial wrap angle. The
   results show that a larger difference in component moduli, a higher
   core/wrap diameter ratio and a lower initial wrap angle can produce a
   larger maximum negative Poisson's ratio value and thereby a better
   auxetic performance for HAYs. All three parameters could be carefully
   utilised when in combination to achieve the required auxetic behaviour
   of HAYs. Moreover, the instantaneous true Poisson's ratio analysis
   accurately presents the instantaneous behaviour of highly strain
   dependent HAYs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Post-buckling behavior of the auxetic (with negative Poisson ratio)
   structures has not been investigated so far, especially for structures
   fabricated from heterogeneous materials. In the present research,
   effects of auxeticity of the materials on uniaxial and biaxial
   post-buckling behaviors of the FGM plates are investigated using the
   exact three-dimensional theory of elasticity, instead of the approximate
   plate theories. Furthermore, influence of the Winkler-type elastic
   foundation on the post-buckling responses of the plate is investigated.
   In this regard, a full compatible C-1-continuous 3D Hermitian element
   that in contrast to the conventional elements, satisfies the stress
   continuity condition at the mutual nodes of the adjacent elements, is
   employed to solve the governing equations of the post-buckling. The full
   Green's strain tensor is employed instead of using the approximate von
   Karman strain-displacement expressions to enable tracing behavior of the
   plate for quite large deformations. The governing system of equations is
   solved by a condensation-based incremental under-relaxation
   Newton-Raphson procedure, due to sensitivity and high numerical
   compliance of the resulting highly non-linear finite element system of
   equations. Furthermore, new criteria are proposed for tracing the
   post-buckling behavior. Results reveal that the elastic foundation
   significantly affects the post-buckling mechanism and deformation
   pattern and post-buckling behavior of the plate is enhanced drastically
   by more negative Poisson's ratios. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Month = {{APR 13}},
Abstract = {{Based on a first principles approach, we study structural, electronic
   and elastic properties, as well as stabilities of all possible
   half-oxidized phosphorene conformers. Stability analysis reveals that
   oxygen chemisorption is an exothermic process in the six configurations
   despite the formation of interstitial oxygen bridges in three of them.
   Electronic structure calculations show that oxidation induces a band gap
   modulation ranging between 0.54 and 1.57 eV in the generalized gradient
   approximation corrected to 1.19 and 2.88 eV using GW. The mechanical
   response of the conformers is sensitively dependent on direction and
   indicates that the new derivatives are incompressible materials and one
   configuration has an auxetic behavior. The present results provide a
   basis for tailoring the electronic and elastic properties of phosphorene
   via half oxidation.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the mechanical properties of metal-organic frameworks
   (MOFs) is crucial not only to yield robust practical applications, but
   also to advance fundamental research underpinning the flexibility of a
   myriad of open-framework chemical compounds. Herein we present one of
   the most comprehensive structural analyses yet on MOF-mechanics:
   elucidating the complex elastic response of an isoreticular series of
   topical Zr-based MOFs, explaining all the important mechanical
   properties, and identifying major trends arising from systematic organic
   linker exchange. Ab initio density functional theory (DFT) was employed
   to establish the single-crystal elastic constants of the nanoporous
   MIL-140(A-D) structures, generating a complete 3-D representation of the
   principal mechanical properties, encompassing the Young's modulus, shear
   modulus, linear compressibility and Poisson's ratio. Of particular
   interest, we discovered significantly high values of both positive and
   negative linear compressibility and Poisson's ratio, whose framework
   molecular mechanisms responsible for such elastic anomalies have been
   fully revealed. In addition to pinpointing large elastic anisotropy and
   unusual physical properties, we analyzed the bulk modulus of
   isoreticular Zr-MOF compounds to understand the framework structural
   resistance against the hydrostatic pressure, and determined the averaged
   mechanical behaviour of bulk (polycrystalline) MOF materials important
   for the design of emergent applications.}},

Abstract = {{Materials with a negative Poisson's ratio (PR) are called auxetics; they
   are characterized by expansion/contraction when tensioned/compressed.
   Given this counterintuitive behavior, they present very particular
   characteristics and mechanical behavior. Geometrical models have been
   developed to justify and artificially reproduce such materials' auxetic
   behavior. The focus of this study is the exploration of a reentrant
   model by analyzing the variation in the PR of reentrant structures as a
   function of geometrical and base material parameters. It is shown that,
   even in the presence of protruding ribs, there may not be auxetic
   behavior, and this depends on the geometry of each reentrant structure.
   Values determined for these parameters can be helpful as approximate
   reference data in the design and fabrication of auxetic lattices using
   reentrant geometries.

Abstract = {{This study aimed at determining the role of proximity to specific types
   of green spaces (GSes) as well as their spatial location in the
   relationship with the most morbid cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and
   diabetes. We measured the accessibility to various types of GS and used
   a cross-sectional approach at census Dissemination Area (DA) levels in
   the Montreal and Quebec City metropolitan zones for the period
   2006-2011. Poisson and negative binomial regression models were fitted
   to quantify the relationship between distances to specific types of GS
   and CVD morbidity as well as some risk factors (diabetes and
   hypertension) while controlling for several social and environmental
   confounders. GSes that have sports facilities showed a significant
   relationship to cerebrovascular diseases: the most distant population
   had an 11\% higher prevalence rate ratio (PRR) compared to the nearest,
   as well as higher diabetes risk (PRR 9\%) than the nearest. However, the
   overall model performance and the understanding of the role of GSes with
   sport facilities may be substantially achieved with lifestyle factors.
   Significantly higher prevalence of diabetes and cerebrovascular diseases
   as well as lower access to GSes equipped with sports facilities were
   found in suburban areas. GSes can advantageously be used to prevent some
   CVDs and their risk factors, but there may be a need to reconsider their
   types and location.}},

Title = {{Resolving uncertainty in the spatial relationships between passive

Volume = {{41}},

Abstract = {{Background: Benzene is a known occupational carcinogen associated with
   increased risk of hematologic cancers, but the relationships between
   quantity of passive benzene exposure through residential proximity to
   toxic release sites, duration of exposure, lag time from exposure to
   cancer development, and lymphoma risk remain unclear.
   Methods: We collected release data through the Environmental Protection
   Agency's Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) from 1989 to 2003, which
   included location of benzene release sites, years when release occurred,
   and amount of release. We also collected data on incident cases of
   non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) from the Georgia Comprehensive Cancer
   Registry (GCCR) for the years 1999-2008. We constructed distance-decay
   surrogate exposure metrics and Poisson and negative binomial regression
   models of NHL incidence to quantify associations between passive
   exposure to benzene and NHL risk and examined the impact of amount,
   duration of exposure, and lag time on cancer development. Akaike's
   information criteria (AIC) were used to determine the scaling factors
   for benzene dispersion and exposure periods that best predicted NHL
   risk.
   Results: Using a range of scaling factors and exposure periods, we found
   that increased levels of passive benzene exposure were associated with
   higher risk of NHL. The best fitting model, with a scaling factor of 4
   kilometers (km) and exposure period of 1989-1993, showed that higher
   exposure levels were associated with increased NHL risk (Level 4
   (1.1-160 kilograms (kg)) vs. Level 1: risk ratio 1.56 {[}1.44-1.68],
   Level 5 (>160 kg) vs. Level 1: 1.60 {[}1.48-1.74]).
   Conclusions: Higher levels of passive benzene exposure are associated
   with increased NHL risk across various lag periods. Additional
   epidemiological studies are needed to refine these models and better
   quantify the expected total passive benzene exposure in areas
   surrounding release sites. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{The psyllid Triozoida limbata (Enderlein) (Hemiptera: Triozidae) is a
   major pest in guava, feeding primarily on new shoots. Despite its
   importance, there are no studies on the spatial distribution of T.
   limbata on guava. Such studies are needed to establish sequential
   sampling plans for decision making in pest control. Thus, an experiment
   was carried out in a 9-year-old commercial guava orchard divided into
   100 sampling units or plots. Double-sided yellow sticky traps were
   placed on one plant per plot (sample unit) to capture and monitor T.
   limbata adults from April 2011 to May 2012. To determine the insect
   distribution in the area, we calculated the variance-to-mean ratio index
   (I), the Morisita index (I (delta) ), Green's coefficient (Cx), and the
   k exponent of the negative binomial distribution. Most of the samples
   showed that the adults had a moderate to highly aggregated distribution.
   Statistical models were also used to study the pest spatial distribution
   by fitting the number of adults captured to the Poisson and negative
   binomial distributions. The negative binomial distribution model best
   fitted the data of the number of adult psyllids captured by the traps,
   which is consistent with an aggregated distribution.}},

Journal = {{PLASMA SOURCES SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The positive ion flux exiting a low-pressure plasma discharge is a
   crucial quantity in global (volume-averaged) models. In discharges
   containing only electrons and positive ions (electropositive
   discharges), it is common to write this flux Gamma wall = h(l)n(i0)u(B),
   where n(i0) is the central positive ion density, u(B) is the positive
   ion fluid speed at the sheath edge (the Bohm speed), and h(l) is the
   positive ion edge-to-centre density ratio. There are well established
   formulae for h(l) in electropositive discharges, but for discharges
   containing negative ions (electronegative discharges), the analysis is
   more complicated. The purpose of this paper is to propose a formula for
   the h(l) factor in low-pressure electronegative discharges. We use the
   numerical solution of fluid equations with Boltzmann negative ions,
   including Poisson's equation, as a guide to derive an analytical
   expression that can easily be incorporated in global models. The
   parameter space in which the derived expression is valid is discussed at
   the end of the paper.}},

Abstract = {{An elastic layer slides on a rigid flat governed by Coulomb's friction

   the sliding localizes within stick-slip pulses, which transform into
   opening waves propagating at intersonic speed in the direction of
   sliding or, for high Poisson's ratios, at supersonic speed in the
   opposite direction. This sliding mode, characterized by marginal
   frictional dissipation, and similar to carpet fold propagation, may
   result in inversion of the frictional force direction; at longer time
   intervals, the system demonstrates stick-slip behavior. The mechanism is
   described in detail, and a parametric study is presented.}},

Abstract = {{An analytical framework has been developed for predicting the equivalent
   in-plane elastic moduli (longitudinal and transverse Young's modulus,
   shear modulus, Poisson's ratios) of irregular auxetic honeycombs with
   spatially random variations in cell angles. Employing a bottom up
   multi-scale based approach, computationally efficient closed-form
   expressions have been derived in this article. This study also includes
   development of a highly generalized finite element code capable of
   accepting number of cells in two perpendicular directions, random
   structural geometry and material properties of irregular auxetic
   honeycomb and thereby obtaining five in-plane elastic moduli of the
   structure. The elastic moduli obtained for different degree of
   randomness following the analytical formulae have been compared with the
   results of direct finite element simulations and they are found to be in
   good agreement corroborating the validity and accuracy of the proposed
   approach. The transverse Young's modulus, shear modulus and Poisson's
   ratio for loading in transverse direction (effecting the auxetic
   property) have been found to be highly influenced by the structural
   irregularity in auxetic honeycombs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{NANO LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{2657-2662}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The Poisson's ratio characterizes the resultant strain in the lateral
   direction for a material under longitudinal deformation. Though negative
   Poisson's ratios (NPR) are theoretically possible within continuum
   elasticity, they are most frequently observed in engineered materials
   and structures, as they are not intrinsic to many materials. In this
   work, we report NPR in single-layer graphene ribbons, which results from
   the compressive edge stress induced warping of the edges. The effect is
   robust, as the NPR is observed for graphene ribbons with widths smaller
   than about 10 nm, and for tensile strains smaller than about 0.5\% with
   NPR values reaching as large as -1.51. The NPR is explained analytically
   using an inclined plate model, which is able to predict the Poisson's
   ratio for graphene sheets of arbitrary size. The inclined plate model
   demonstrates that the NPR is governed by the interplay between the width
   (a bulk property), and the warping amplitude of the edge (an edge
   property), which eventually yields a phase diagram determining the sign
   of the Poisson's ratio as a function of the graphene geometry.}},

Abstract = {{Background
   Prevalence estimates of anal high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) are
   needed in sub-Saharan Africa where HIV is endemic. This study evaluated
   anal HR-HPV in Nigeria among HIV-positive and HIV-negative men who have
   sex with men (MSM) for future immunization recommendations.
   Methods
   We conducted a cross-sectional study to compare the prevalence of anal
   HR-HPV infections between 64 HIV-negative and 90 HIV-positive MSM.
   Multivariate Poisson regression analyses were used to examine
   demographic and behavioral risk factors associated with any HR-HPV
   infections.
   Results
   The median age of the 154 participants was 25 years (interquartile
   range, 22-28 years; range, 16-38 years), and the median age at
   initiation of anal sex with another man was 16 years (interquartile
   range, 13-18 years; range, 7-29 years). The prevalence of anal HR-HPV
   was higher among HIV-positive than HIV-negative MSM (91.1\% vs. 40.6\%,
   P < 0.001). In the multivariate analysis, HIV infection (adjusted
   prevalence ratio {[}aPR], 2.02; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI],
   1.49-2.72), 10 years or more since anal sexual debut (aPR, 1.26; 95\%
   CI, 1.07-1.49), and concurrent relationships with men (aPR, 1.32; 95\%
   CI, 1.04-1.67) were associated with increased anal HR-HPV prevalence.
   Conclusions
   Anal HR-HPV infection is high for young Nigerian MSM, and rates are
   amplified in those coinfected with HIV. Providing universal coverage as
   well as catch-up immunization for young MSM may be an effective anal
   cancer prevention strategy in Nigeria.}},

Abstract = {{The occurrence of lightning-induced forest fires during a time period is
   count data featuring over-dispersion (i.e., variance is larger than
   mean) and a high frequency of zero counts. In this study, we used six
   generalized linear models to examine the relationship between the
   occurrence of lightning-induced forest fires and meteorological factors
   in the Northern Daxing'an Mountains of China. The six models included
   Poisson, negative binomial (NB), zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP),
   zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB), Poisson hurdle (PH), and
   negative binomial hurdle (NBH) models. Goodness-of-fit was compared and
   tested among the six models using Akaike information criterion (AIC),
   sum of squared errors, likelihood ratio test, and Vuong test. The
   predictive performance of the models was assessed and compared using
   independent validation data by the data-splitting method. Based on the
   model AIC, the ZINB model best fitted the fire occurrence data, followed
   by (in order of smaller AIC) NBH, ZIP, NB, PH, and Poisson models. The
   ZINB model was also best for predicting either zero counts or positive
   counts (a parts per thousand yen1). The two Hurdle models (PH and NBH)
   were better than ZIP, Poisson, and NB models for predicting positive
   counts, but worse than these three models for predicting zero counts.
   Thus, the ZINB model was the first choice for modeling the occurrence of
   lightning-induced forest fires in this study, which implied that the
   excessive zero counts of lightning-induced fires came from both
   structure and sampling zeros.}},

Title = {{Measuring the Impact of Antiretroviral Therapy Roll-Out on Population
   Level Fertility in Three African Countries}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 25}},
Abstract = {{Background
   UNAIDS official estimates of national HIV prevalence are based on trends
   observed in antenatal clinic surveillance, after adjustment for the
   reduced fertility of HIV positive women. Uptake of ART may impact on the
   fertility of HIV positive women, implying a need to re-estimate the
   adjustment factors used in these calculations. We analyse the effect of
   antiretroviral therapy (ART) provision on population-level fertility in
   Southern and East Africa, comparing trends in HIV infected women against
   the secular trends observed in uninfected women.
   Methods
   We used fertility data from four community-based demographic and HIV
   surveillance sites: Kisesa (Tanzania), Masaka and Rakai (Uganda) and
   uMkhanyakude (South Africa). All births to women aged 15-44 years old
   were included in the analysis, classified by mother's age and HIV status
   at time of birth, and ART availability in the community. Calendar time
   period of data availability relative to ART Introduction varied across
   the sites, from 5 years prior to ART roll-out, to 9 years after.
   Calendar time was classified according to ART availability, grouped into
   pre ART, ART introduction (available in at least one health facility
   serving study site) and ART available (available in all designated
   health facilities serving study site). We used Poisson regression to
   calculate age adjusted fertility rate ratios over time by HIV status,
   and investigated the interaction between ART period and HIV status to
   ascertain whether trends over time were different for HIV positive and
   negative women.
   Results
   Age-adjusted fertility rates declined significantly over time for HIV
   negative women in all four studies. However HIV positives either had no
   change in fertility (Masaka, Rakai) or experienced a significant
   increase over the same period (Kisesa, uMkhanyakude). HIV positive
   fertility was significantly lower than negative in both the pre ART
   period (age adjusted fertility rate ratio (FRR) range 0.51 95\% CI
   0.42-0.61 to 0.73 95\% CI 0.64-0.83) and when ART was widely available
   (FRR range 0.57 95\% CI 0.52-0.62 to 0.83 95\% CI 0.78-0.87), but the
   difference has narrowed. The interaction terms describing the difference
   in trends between HIV positives and negatives are generally significant.
   Conclusions
   Differences in fertility between HIV positive and HIV negative women are
   narrowing over time as ART becomes more widely available in these
   communities. Routine adjustment of ANC data for estimating national HIV
   prevalence will need to allow for the impact of treatment.}},

Abstract = {{This study aims to provide fundamental understandings in several issues
   critical to the fabrication of auxetic polyurethane (PU) foams by
   thermal compression process: conversion and auxetic structure fixation
   mechanisms, materials characteristics essential for the successful
   auxetic conversion, and optimal conditions for auxetic conversion. Three
   flexible PU foams with similar morphology were selected for the study.
   First the commonalities as well as the differences between these foams
   in terms of their chemical composition, microstructure and
   thermomechanical properties were thoroughly analyzed. This is followed
   by the auxetic convertibility study of these three foams. Mechanisms for
   fixing the structure were elucidated and the windows for processing were
   interpreted in the context of polymer relaxation. Guided by these
   understandings, a series of auxetic foams were manufactured at a wide
   range of conditions. The processing conditions agreed very well with
   those suggested from the mechanistic investigation, validating the
   proposed auxetic conversion and structure fixation mechanisms. The
   mechanism was further confirmed by direct observation of the morphology
   of the fabricated auxetic foams. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In this paper, analytical and finite element (FE) simulations are
   carried out to calculate the in-plane Poisson's ratio and Young's
   modulus of a novel concept of structure with honeycomb-like
   configuration under uniaxial loading. Opposite to similar re-entrant
   honeycomb structures, the new unit cell topology adding a narrow rib in
   the well-known re-entrant cellular structure. The results obtained
   through the analytical and FE analysis show that adding a narrow rib in
   the unit cell of re-entrant honeycomb configuration gives rise to a
   cellular structure with significant enhanced Young's modulus compared to
   the classical re-entrant configurations exhibited in literature. The
   results also show an obvious linear relationship between Young's modulus
   and Poisson's ratio of the proposed design with the adding ribs'
   thickness changing. For its significant Young's modulus enhancement and
   convenient to predictions of in-plane mechanical properties (Young's
   modulus and Poisson's ratios), this layout can be considered as a
   possible basis to design new concepts of auxetic structures with special

   that the auxeticity of the inclusions can reduce thermal stresses, which

Abstract = {{Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the impact of
   malocclusion on children's oral health-related quality of life (COHRQoL)
   and self-reported happiness.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in a representative
   sample of 12-year-old schoolchildren from Santa Maria, South Brazil.
   Four calibrated examiners carried out clinical exams to evaluate
   malocclusion {[}Dental Aesthetic Index (DAI)], dental caries (DMFT), and
   dental trauma (O'Brien classification, used in the Children's dental
   health survey in the UK, 1994). Participants answered the Brazilian
   versions of the Child Perceptions Questionnaire (CPQ(11-14)) and the
   Subjective Happiness Scale (SHS). Parents completed a structured
   questionnaire regarding socioeconomic status. Data analysis was
   conducted using multilevel Poisson regression models.
   Results: A total of 1,134 adolescents (boys: 45.8 percent; girls: 54.1
   percent) were enrolled in the study. The DAI overall score ranged from
   13 to 63 (mean: 25.19, standard error: 0.19); 57.6 percent of the
   subjects had minor or no malocclusion and 24.4 percent had definite
   malocclusion. Severe malocclusion and handicapping malocclusion were
   found in 10.4 percent and 7.4 percent of the subjects, respectively.
   After adjustment, the severity of malocclusion was associated with high
   mean values of the CPQ11-14 overall score, and the emotional well-being
   and social well-being domains were the most affected. Lower levels of
   happiness were also associated with the severity of malocclusion: those
   with definite malocclusion presented lower scores on the SHS scale (Rate
   Ratio 0.97; 95 percent CI 0.94-0.99).
   Conclusion: Malocclusion had a negative impact on COHRQoL and happiness,
   mainly on the emotional and social domains.}},

Abstract = {{The Japanese art of turning flat sheets into three dimensional intricate
   structures, origami, has inspired design of mechanical metamaterials.
   Mechanical metamaterials are artificially engineered materials with
   uncommon properties. Miura-ori is a remarkable origami folding pattern
   with metamaterial properties and a wide range of applications. In this
   study, by dislocating the zigzag strips of a Miura-ori pattern along the
   joining ridges, we create a class of one-degree of freedom (DOF)
   cellular mechanical metamaterials. The unit cell of the patterns
   comprises two zigzag strips surrounding a hole with a parallelogram
   shape. We show that dislocating zigzag strips of the Miura-ori along the
   joining ridges preserves and/or tunes the outstanding properties of the
   Miura-ori. The introduced materials are lighter than their corresponding
   Miura-ori sheets due to the presence of holes in the patterns. Moreover,
   they are amenable to similar modifications available for Miura-ori which
   make them appropriate for a wide range of applications across the length
   scales. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the static and dynamic (phononic) elastic behavior of
   fractal-cut materials. These materials are novel in the sense that they
   deform by rotation of ``rigid{''} units rather than by straining these
   units, can be fabricated by exploiting a simple cutting paradigm, and
   have properties that can be manipulated by control of the cut pattern
   and its hierarchy. We show that variation of fractal-cut level and cut
   pattern can be exploited to manipulate the symmetry of the elastic
   constant tensor, the elastic limit of deformation, and, therefore, the
   elastic response. By studying phonon behavior, we demonstrate how some
   cut symmetries naturally open acoustic band gaps. Several of the
   important features of the band structure can be directly related to the
   static elastic properties. Based upon our phonon calculations, we
   predict the acoustic transmission spectrum of an example fractal-cut
   structure and validated it through 3D printing and sound attenuation
   experiments. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   Materials and Methods. Men older than age 65 years with prostate cancer
   and bone metastasis diagnosed between 2004 and 2009 were identified from
   linked Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare records.
   Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) for the risk for
   death associated with SREs were calculated by using Cox regression. HCRU
   and costs (in 2013 U.S. dollars) were evaluated in a propensity
   score-matched cohort by using Poisson regression and Kaplan-Meier sample
   average estimators, respectively.
   Results. Among 3,297 men with prostate cancer metastatic to bone, 40\%
   experienced >= 1 SRE (median follow-up, 19months). Compared with men who
   remained SRE-free, men with >= 1 SRE had a twofold higher risk for death
   (HR, 2.29; 95\% CI, 2.09-2.51). Pathological fracture was associated
   with the highest risk for death (HR, 2.77; 95\% CI, 2.38-3.23). Among
   men with >= 1 SRE, emergency department visits were twice as frequent
   (95\% CI, 1.77-2.28) and hospitalizations were nearly four times as
   frequent (95\% CI, 3.20-4.40). The attributable cost of >= 1 SRE was
   \$21,191 (>= 1 SRE: \$72,454 {[}95\% CI, \$67,362-\$76,958]; SRE-free:
   \$51,263 {[}95\% CI, \$45,439-\$56,100]).
   Conclusion. Among men with prostate cancer metastatic to bone,
   experiencing >= 1 SRE is associated with poorer survival, increased
   HCRU, and increased costs. These negative effects emphasize the
   importance of SRE prevention in this population.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the multivariate Poisson Lognormal modeling of
   counts for different types of crashes. This multivariate model can
   account for the overdispersion as well as positive and/or negative
   association between counts. Approximate Bayesian inference via the
   Integrated Nested Laplace Approximations significantly decreases
   computational time which makes it attractive for researchers. The models
   are developed for single vehicle, same direction and opposite direction
   crash types using three years (2009-2011) of crash data on Connecticut
   divided limited access highway segments. Annual average daily traffic,
   segment length, and road specific covariates (median type, shoulder
   width, area type, and on-ramp indicator) are used as predictor
   variables. The results from the multivariate Poisson Lognormal model
   suggest that an increase in the annual average daily traffic, segment
   length, and shoulder width together with urban area type and presence of
   an on-ramp are associated with in an increase in crashes. The median
   type covariate has a mixed effect for different median types on
   different type of crashes. The multivariate Poisson Lognormal model
   results are compared with the results obtained from two univariate
   regression models, univariate Poisson Lognormal and univariate negative
   binomial, with respect to model implications and precision on analysis
   of crash counts. The results show that the coefficient estimates of
   predictors have almost similar effects across all three crash type count
   models; however, standard errors in the multivariate Poisson Lognormal
   model are smaller than standard errors from other two univariate models
   in most cases. Results on posterior means for the correlation
   coefficients between crash types indicate that there are significant
   correlations exist between the crash count vectors, which indicate that
   ignoring such a correlation could possibly lead to incorrect variance
   estimation for the parameters. Results on predicted mean absolute error
   (PMAE) indicate that Bayesian multivariate Poisson Lognormal model
   provides up to 33\% less prediction error compared to the univariate
   negative binomial model, although there are no significant difference of
   PMAE values between multivariate and univariate Poisson Lognormal models
   results. The analysis results demonstrated that the Bayesian
   multivariate Poisson Lognormal model provides correct estimates for
   parameters in predicting crash counts by accounting for correlations in
   the multivariate crash counts. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Little is known of the disease burden of patients with
   persistent asthma (PA) who also have a chronic obstructive pulmonary
   disease (COPD) diagnosis code (AS-COPD).
   OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to characterize and compare
   patients with AS-COPD with those with PA without COPD diagnosis, and
   determine in AS-COPD the relationship between blood eosinophil count and
   future asthma exacerbations.
   METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used administrative pharmacy
   and health care utilization data to identify, characterize, and compare
   the burden and asthma exacerbations in adults with AS-COPD (N = 901)
   with those with PA (N = 2392). Negative binomial regression and Poisson
   regression models were used to evaluate the relationships between
   baseline blood eosinophil counts (high vs low) based on various cutoff
   points and asthma exacerbations in the follow-up year, adjusting for
   demographics, comorbidities, and asthma burden.
   RESULTS: Compared with patients with PA, those with AS-COPD were
   significantly (all P < .001) older, more frequently female, less well
   educated, more likely to be or have been a smoker, had more
   comorbidities, received more asthma controller medications, and had
   greater rates and frequencies of asthma exacerbations, but had similar
   blood eosinophil counts. The rate of asthma exacerbations/person-year in
   AS-COPD during follow-up was 1.61 (95\% CI, 1.18-2.20). Patients with
   AS-COPD with a blood eosinophil count >= 400 cells/mm(3) had an
   increased rate of future asthma exacerbations compared with those whose
   blood eosinophil count was < 400 cells/mm3 (adjusted rate ratio, 1.44,
   95\% CI, 1.09-1.90).
   CONCLUSIONS: Compared with patients with PA, those with AS-COPD had more
   disease burden, but a similar relationship of high blood eosinophil
   count to more future asthma exacerbations. These findings suggest a
   common inflammatory component between AS-COPD and PA. (C) 2015 American

Title = {{Crustal thickness and Poisson ratio beneath the Huailai-Bayinonder

Abstract = {{The Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB) between the Siberia
   paleo-continent and the North China paleo-continent has a close
   relationship with the evolution of the Paleo-Asian Ocean. The
   Xing'an-Mongolia Orogenic Belt (XMOB) as eastern part of the CAOB is
   located in North China. It is generally considered that the closure of
   the Paleo-Asian Ocean resulted in the formation of the XMOB, but there
   remain some disputes about the tectonic attribute of the northern margin
   of the North China Craton and where the Paleo-Asian Ocean finally closed
   and how it behaves due to complex evolution process, extensive coverage
   of Cenozoic sediments and the lack of high resolution deep exploration
   data.
   Structures and some major discontinuities beneath stations can be imaged
   by the receiver function method. In recent years, this method has become
   a mature and effective tool for studying the velocity structure of the
   crust and upper mantle. By the H-kappa stacking method, the P-to-S
   converted waves at the Moho discontinuity and their multiple reflections
   are used to calculate crust thickness and V-p/V-s ratio, which provide a
   way to study the rock composition of the crust and stress condition
   under stations.
   Funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China, Institute of
   Geology, Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences deployed 41 portable
   broadband seismic stations from Huailai county in northern North China
   to Bayinondor town near the China-Mongolia border. The profile extends
   along the reflection and refraction profile funded by Sinoprobe project,
   crossing the Yinshan-Yanshan orogenic belt, the Inner Mongolia
   paleo-uplift, the Bainaimiao arc, the Ondor sum subduction accretion
   complex, the Solonker suture zone (the Solonder suture zone, located
   between the North China plate and Siberia plate, representing the
   closure of the Paleo-Asian Ocean), the Baolidao arc accretion complex,
   the Hegenshan ophiolite arc accretion complex and the Uliastai active
   continental margin from south to north. Recorders were set to the
   continuous recording mode and the sampling frequency was set to 50 Hz.
   The average distance between two neighbouring stations is 15 km and the
   length of the profile is about 650 km. Up to December 2014, we got 421
   GB raw data in total.
   First, we select 746 teleseismic events of m(b) > 5 from 30 to 95
   degrees and obtain their P waveforms from -20 s to 100 s with respect to
   the first P arrival time. Then, 3-component waveform data with high
   signal-noise ratio are pre-processed (including mean removal and linear
   removal) and pre-filtering at 0.02 similar to 2 Hz and then rotated
   Z-N-E to the Z-R-T coordinate system. Finally we obtain 1844 P-wave
   receiver functions by the time domain iterative deconvolution method.
   After that we obtain the crustal thicknesses, V-p/V-s ratios and Poisson
   ratios beneath the profile by the H-kappa stacking method and image
   extension of the Moho interface by the Common Coversion Point (CCP)
   stacking method. The results are as follows:
   (1) The Moho depth on average is 40 km along the profile. The crust
   thickness changes little across different tectonic blocks but shows
   evident variation at the boundaries between the blocks. The Moho dips
   southward beneath the Ondor sum belt and the Bainaimiao belt, while dips
   northward beneath the Baolidao belt and the Hegenshan belt. The Linxi
   fault seems to be as the boundary dividing the northern margin of North
   China Craton (NCC) and the southern CAOB. (2) The Poisson ratio shows a
   correlation with the tectonic unit along the profile. The averaged
   Poisson ratio in the northern margin of NCC is larger than the southern
   part of CAOB. The Poisson ratio changes little within the blocks except
   nearby the boundaries of different blocks. (3) There is a negative
   correlation between the crust thickness and the Poisson ratio that
   indicates the lateral heterogeneities of the crust structure resulted
   from the tectonic deformation. (4) Poisson ratio of the crust along the
   profile presents an approximately nonlinear symmetric shape relating to
   the south margin of Solonker suture zone. The characteristics of the
   crust and mantle structure and distribution of Poisson ratio along the
   profile support the geodynamic model that the Paleo-Asian Ocean
   subducted and closed at the southern margin of the Solon suture zone
   (along the Linxi fault).}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we give an asymptotic theory for the eigenvalues of the
   sample covariance matrix of a multivariate time series. The time series
   constitutes a linear process across time and between components. The
   input noise of the linear process has regularly varying tails with index
   alpha is an element of (0, 4); in particular, the time series has
   infinite fourth moment. We derive the limiting behavior for the largest
   eigenvalues of the sample covariance matrix and show point process
   convergence of the normalized eigenvalues. The limiting process has an
   explicit form involving points of a Poisson process and eigenvalues of a
   non-negative definite matrix. Based on this convergence we derive limit
   theory for a host of other continuous functionals of the eigenvalues,
   including the joint convergence of the largest eigenvalues, the joint
   convergence of the largest eigenvalue and the trace of the sample
   covariance matrix, and the ratio of the largest eigenvalue to their sum.

Title = {{On the conical indentation response of elastic auxetic materials:
   Effects of Poisson's ratio, contact friction and cone angle}},

Abstract = {{The linear elastic analytical solution of an axisymmetric probe
   indenting a semi-infinite half-space forms the backbone of most
   indentation data analysis protocols. It has been noted in the literature
   that the theoretical solution relies on a boundary condition that is
   ill-posed which leads to discrepancies from the actual response that
   depends, among other parameters, on the Poisson's ratio of the indented
   material. While correction factors have been proposed, prior studies
   have concentrated on the positive Poisson's ratio regime and have
   neglected an exciting and developing class of materials: the auxetic
   systems. The finite element method is used to simulate the conical
   indentation response of elastic materials with Poisson's ratios covering
   the whole thermodynamically possible range, -1 <= v <= 0.5. Consistent
   with theoretical predictions, the indentation resistance and hardness of
   auxetic materials is enhanced compared to their non-auxetic
   counterparts. The stress profiles and contact details are systematically
   analyzed and the increase in resistance is traced to the shear
   stiffening and the reduction of contact area compared to conventional
   materials. Furthermore, it is shown that the analytical linear elastic
   solution falls short in accurately describing the indentation response,
   especially for negative Poisson's ratio materials. In contrast to the
   theoretical prediction, the contact area reduces as the Poisson's ratio
   increases resulting in increased required force to penetrate the
   material and an enhanced pressure distribution beneath the indenter. The
   analytical solution is corrected for the whole v range and best fit
   polynomials are proposed for ease-of-use. The effects of
   contact-friction and indenter cone-angle are also studied and
   quantified. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Number = {{1-2, SI}},
Pages = {{263-273}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{A strain-consistent elastic plate model is formulated in which both
   initial surface tension and the induced residual stress are treated as
   finite values, and the exactly same strain expressions are consistently
   employed for both the surface and the bulk plate. Different than most of
   previous related models which follow the original Gurtin-Murdoch model
   and include some non-strain displacement gradient terms (which cannot be
   expressed in terms of the surface infinitesimal strains or the von
   Karman-type strains) in the surface stress-strain relations, the present
   model does not include any non-strain displacement gradient terms in the
   surface stress-strain relations. For a free elastic plate with in-plane
   movable edges, the present model predicts that initial surface tension
   exactly cancels out the induced residual compressive stress. On the
   other hand, if all edges are in-plane immovable, residual stress cannot
   develop in the plate and the initial surface tension causes a tensile
   net membrane force. In addition, the present model predicts that initial
   surface tension reduces the effective bending rigidity of the plate,
   while this reduction does not depend on Poisson ratio. In particular,
   self-buckling of a free elastic plate under tensile surface tension
   cannot occur unless the effective bending rigidity of plate vanishes or
   becomes negative.}},

   Coupled Drive System}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND NONLINEAR DYNAMICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Motor-transmission coupled drive system is attractive for battery and
   hybrid electric vehicles. In such a system, the motor rotor is directly
   connected to the transmission input shaft and the active-synchronization
   technique is implemented to assist the speed synchronization; therefore,
   the gear-shifting characteristics are different from those of
   traditional manual and automated mechanical transmissions. In this work,
   we present a methodology for modeling the gear-shifting process and
   analyzing its characteristics in a motor-transmission coupled drive
   system. We treat the engaging of sleeve and desired clutch gear as a
   two-phase process-sleeve first interacting with synchro ring and then
   with clutch gear, respectively, and investigate all possible interaction
   ways in each phase. The movement of each part is governed by multibody
   dynamics, and the speed jumps caused by shifting impacts are described
   using the Poisson coefficient of restitution. We then develop a hybrid
   automaton (HA) model to couple the continuous-time evolutions and the
   discrete transitions of state variables, which cover all interaction
   ways of sleeve, synchro ring, and clutch gear. Based on this model, we
   carry out simulations in MATLAB to analyze the effects of two control
   parameters-the relative rotational speed of sleeve and desired clutch
   gear, and the shifting force-on shifting performance. Simulation and
   bench test results show that the optimal control parameters are located
   in the domain where the relative rotational speed is negative with small
   absolute value, which means the sleeve will not be locked out by synchro
   ring and can engage with the desired clutch gear smoothly.}},

Volume = {{222}},

Abstract = {{The unusual thermal expansion properties of a prototype nanoporous,
   crystalline solid have been determined by studying epitaxially grown,
   highly oriented thin films rigidly anchored to a solid substrate using
   out-of-plane and in-plane X-ray diffraction (XRD). The analysis of the
   data for the particular metal organic frameworks (MOFs) studied here,
   HKUST-I, reveals a thermal expansion which is negative for the direction
   perpendicular and positive for the direction parallel to the substrate
   surface. The corresponding anisotropic coefficients of thermal expansion
   (CTE) amount to (-75 +/- 16) x 10(-6) K-1 in the direction perpendicular
   to the substrate and to (11.7 +/- 3.7) x 10(-6) K-1 in the direction
   parallel to the substrate surface. These values substantially differ
   from the intrinsic CTE, measured for powder MOFs (-4.1 x 10(-6) K-1).
   The substrate-induced anisotropic thermal expansion allows for a direct
   measurement of the Poisson's ratio of MOF materials, which is hardly
   measurable for powder MOFs. The Poisson's ratio of HKUST-1 was
   determined to be 0.69 +/- 0.37. Furthermore, thermal cycling experiments
   of the HKUST-1 SURMOFs reveal a pronounced stability, a necessary
   requirement for using MOFs in thermal response sensor devices and for
   high-temperature membrane separation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {{Parametric analysis of a cylindrical negative Poisson's ratio structure}},
Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Much research related to negative Poisson's ratio (NPR), or auxetic,
   structures is emerging these days. Several types of 3D NPR structure
   have been proposed and studied, but almost all of them had cuboid
   shapes, which were not suitable for certain engineering applications. In
   this paper, a cylindrical NPR structure was developed and researched. It
   was expected to be utilized in springs, bumpers, dampers and other
   similar applications. For the purpose of parametric analysis, a method
   of parametric modeling of cylindrical NPR structures was developed using
   MATLAB scripts. The scripts can automatically establish finite element
   models, invoke ABAQUS, read results etc. Subsequently the influences of
   structural parameters, including number of cells, number of layers and
   layer heights, on the uniaxial compression behavior of cylinder NPR
   structures were researched. This led to the conclusion that the
   stiffness of the cylindrical NPR structure was enhanced on increasing
   the number of cells and reducing the effective layer height. Moreover,
   small numbers of layers resulted in a late transition area of the
   load-displacement curve from low stiffness to high stiffness. Moreover,
   the middle contraction regions were more apparent with larger numbers of
   cells, smaller numbers of layers and smaller effective layer heights.
   The results indicate that the structural parameters had significant
   effects on the load-displacement curves and deformed shapes of
   cylindrical NPR structures. This paper is conducive to the further
   engineering applications of cylindrical NPR structures.}},

Abstract = {{Lower mass and higher performances of structure with Negative Poisson's
   Ratio (NPR) make it a promising option in vehicle design. In this work,
   a new NPR structure is introduced and analyzed. The new NPR structure
   has high shear strength and its effective Young's modulus increases as
   the load increases. Mathematical models are firstly established to study
   the unique properties of the NPR structure. The parameterized model of
   the structure is then built to study the performance of the structure
   under large deformations condition. Due to the complexities of the
   nonlinear properties, the hybrid and adaptive meta-model (HAM)
   optimization method is employed for optimizing the NPR structure. The
   optimization results are compared with those of traditional optimization
   method to validate the effectiveness of this approach. Quasi-static
   compressive experiments are also conducted to verify the accuracy of the
   model and the effectiveness of the optimization. The results show that
   the NPR structure is optimized successfully and the HAM optimization
   method is of great effectiveness in finding the optimal NPR structure.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of two geometric refinement strategies widespread in natural
   structures, chirality and self-similar hierarchy, on the in-plane
   elastic response of two-dimensional honeycombs were studied
   systematically. Simple closed-form expressions were derived for the
   elastic moduli of several chiral, anti-chiral, and hierarchical
   honeycombs with hexagon and square based networks. Finite element
   analysis was employed to validate the analytical estimates of the
   elastic moduli. The results were also compared with the numerical and
   experimental data available in the literature. We found that introducing
   a hierarchical refinement increases the Young's modulus of hexagon based
   honeycombs while decreases their shear modulus. For square based
   honeycombs, hierarchy increases the shear modulus while decreasing their
   Young's modulus. Introducing chirality was shown to always decrease the
   Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of the structure. However, chirality
   remains the only route to auxeticity. In particular, we found that
   anti-tetra-chiral structures were capable of simultaneously exhibiting
   anisotropy, auxeticity, and remarkably low shear modulus as the
   magnitude of the chirality of the unit cell increases. (C) 2016 The

Title = {{Poroelastic relaxation indentation of whey protein hydrogels}},
Journal = {{FOOD HYDROCOLLOIDS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{B}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Many solid food matrices contain high amounts of solvent, typically
   water, yet the time dependent mechanical characterization of foods has
   typically been analyzed following a viscoelastic approach, omitting the
   effect of the solvent. In solvent rich solids the solvent can flow
   internally, for example as it is compressed, which is typically
   understood using poroelastic theory. A poroelastic approach allows the
   determination of hydrogel parameters, such as the Darcy's diffusivity or
   the intrinsic permeability, that have a physical meaning. Recently, it
   has been proposed for polymeric hydrogels a novel experimental
   methodology, based on relaxation after indentation, that greatly
   simplifies the poroelastic analysis. This methodology is applied and
   tested to heat induced whey protein hydrogels. Finite element analysis
   was performed to simulate the particularities of the indentation
   experiments. Relaxation data suggest, after a pure poroelastic analysis,
   that there is also a small fast viscoelastic relaxation in whey protein
   hydrogels. Poroviscoelastic relaxation was simulated with finite
   elements modeling, and a forward regression methodology was implemented.
   Results show that the water diffusivity in the protein hydrogels is
   larger that the self-diffusivity of water, as expected in a matrix with
   large pores where solvent flow occurs by convection. Whey protein
   hydrogels swollen to different degrees using different salt
   concentrations relaxed to different proportions. This result was
   unexpected as it leads, in poroelastic theory, to different drained
   Poisson's ratio, with even negative values for the less swollen gels.

Volume = {{93}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB 29}},
Abstract = {{We study the effects of correlations on cumulants and their ratios of
   net-proton multiplicity distributions which have been measured for
   central (0\%-5\%) Au + Au collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion
   Collider (RHIC). This effect has been studied by assuming individual
   proton and antiproton distributions as a Poisson or negative binomial
   distribution (NBD). In spite of significantly correlated production due
   to baryon number, electric charge conservation, and kinematical
   correlations of protons and antiprotons, the measured cumulants of the
   net-proton distribution follow the independent-production model. In the
   present work we demonstrate how the introduction of the correlations
   will affect the cumulants and their ratios for the difference
   distributions. We have also demonstrated this study using the proton and
   antiproton distributions obtained from the HIJING event generator.}},

Journal = {{EPJ APPLIED METAMATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB 26}},
Abstract = {{We propose that wave propagation through a class of mechanical
   metamaterials opens unprecedented avenues in seismic wave protection
   based on spectral properties of auxetic-like metamaterials. The elastic
   parameters of these metamaterials like the bulk and shear moduli, the
   mass density, and even the Poisson ratio, can exhibit negative values in
   elastic stop bands. We show here that the propagation of seismic waves
   with frequencies ranging from 1 Hz to 40 Hz can be influenced by a
   decameter scale version of auxetic-like metamaterials buried in the
   soil, with the combined effects of impedance mismatch, local resonances
   and Bragg stop bands. More precisely, we numerically examine and
   illustrate the markedly different behaviors between the propagation of
   seismic waves through a homogeneous isotropic elastic medium (concrete)
   and an auxetic-like metamaterial plate consisting of 4(3) cells (40 m x
   40 m x 40 m), utilized here as a foundation of a building one would like
   to protect from seismic site effects. This novel class of seismic
   metamaterials opens band gaps at frequencies compatible with seismic
   waves when they are designed appropriately, what makes them interesting
   candidates for seismic isolation structures.}},

Abstract = {{There is a growing interest in using additive manufacturing to produce
   smart structures, which have the capability to respond to thermal and
   mechanical stimuli. In this report, Selective Laser Melting (SLM) is
   used to build a Negative Poisson's Ratio (NPR) TiNi-based Shape Memory
   Alloy (SMA) structure, creating a multi-functional structure that could
   be used as reusable armour. The study assesses the influence of SLM
   process parameters (laser power, scan speed, and track spacing) on the
   microstructural and structural integrity development in a Ti-rich TiNi
   alloy, as well as the impact of the post-process homogenisation
   treatment on the microstructure and phase transformations. The builds
   generally shows stress-induced cracks and residual porosity, which could
   be minimised through process optimisation. Nonetheless, the
   homogenisation treatment is essential to reduce the fraction of Ti2Ni
   intermetallics, which are known to disturb the B19'-chemistry, and hence
   the required phase transformation temperatures. The optimum process
   parameters are finally used to fabricate NPR structures, which were
   mechanically tested to validate the Poisson's ratio predictions. A
   higher ductility was observed in the structures that have undergone the
   homogenisation treatment. (C) 2016 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by

   included bulk modulus, shear modulus, Young's modulus and Poisson's

   that both of IrB0.9 in our work are ductile. For IrB0.9, orthorhombic
   structure has a higher Debye temperature (348 K) than hexagonal

Abstract = {{We revisit the universal behavior of crystalline membranes at and below
   the crumpling transition, which pertains to the mechanical properties of
   important soft and hard matter materials, such as the cytoskeleton of
   red blood cells or graphene. Specifically, we perform large-scale Monte
   Carlo simulations of a triangulated two-dimensional phantom network
   which is freely fluctuating in three-dimensional space. We obtain a
   continuous crumpling transition characterized by critical exponents
   which we estimate accurately through the use of finite-size techniques.
   By controlling the scaling corrections, we additionally compute with
   high accuracy the asymptotic value of the Poisson ratio in the flat
   phase, thus characterizing the auxetic properties of this class of
   systems. We obtain agreement with the value which is universally
   expected for polymerized membranes with a fixed connectivity.}},

Abstract = {{Scientific research activity produces the ``Matthew Effect{''} on
   resource allocation. Based on a data set in the life sciences field from
   the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) during the 11th
   Five-Year-Plan (2006-2010), this paper makes an empirical study on how
   the Matthew Effect of funding allocation at the institutional level and
   city level impact scientific research activity output. With Gini
   coefficient evaluation, descriptive statistic analysis, and the Poisson
   regression model, we found that there has been a rapid increase in the
   concentration degree of funding allocation among institutions and
   cities. Within a period of 5 years, the Gini coefficients of total
   funding of institutions and cities as the units of measurement have
   increased from 0.61 and 0.74 to 0.67 and 0.79 respectively. However,
   this concentration in funding allocation did not result in significant
   additional benefits. Institutions awarded with more funding did not
   produce the expected positive spillover effect on their scientific
   research activity output. Instead, an ``inverted U-shape{''} pattern of
   decreasing returns to scale was discovered, under which there was a
   negative effect on internal scientific research activity in the majority
   of institutions with concentrated funding allocation. Meanwhile, the
   result shows that Young Scholars projects under the NFSC produced
   high-level output. We conclude the study by discussing the possible
   reasons of the inverted U-shape pattern and its policy implications.}},

Abstract = {{Unimode metamaterials made from rotating rigid triangles are analysed
   mathematically for their mechanical and thermal expansion properties. It
   is shown that these unimode systems exhibit positive Poisson's ratios
   irrespective of size, shape and angle of aperture, with the Poisson's

   Poisson's ratio in one loading direction is larger than +1, the systems
   were found to exhibit the anomalous property of negative linear
   compressibility along this direction, that is, the systems expand in
   this direction when hydrostatically compressed. Also discussed are the
   thermal expansion properties of these systems under the assumption that
   the units exhibit increased rotational agitation once subjected to an
   increase in temperature. The effect of the geometric parameters on the
   aforementioned thermo-mechanical properties of the system, are
   discussed, with the aim of identifying negative behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{The nonlinear, in-plane, shear modulus of re-entrant hexagonal
   honeycombs under large deformation is analytically derived by studying
   the mechanical behavior of cell structures, which is later verified by
   numerical simulations. A nonlinear, modified factor is proposed to
   characterize the difference of the honeycomb's shear modulus under large
   and small deformation, revealing its independence from the honeycmhb's
   relative density. The effects of both strain and cell geometry on the
   honeycomb's shear modulus are investigated, exhibiting that the
   honeycomb's shear modulus increases with shear strain but decreases with
   the cell-wall-length ratio. For the effect of cell-wall angle, the
   re-entrant honeycomb's shear modulus decreases gradually with the
   cell-wall angle until reaching a minimum and then increases, which is
   highly different from the monotonically increasing relationship of
   conventional hexagonal honeycombs. When keeping the honeycomb's relative
   density constant, the re-entrant honeycomb's shear modulus monotonously
   increases with the cell-wall angle and reaches a maximum at h/l
   approximate to 3.25. Finally, the shear modulus of the re-entrant
   honeycombs is compared with that of conventional honeycombs. In contrast
   to the predictions of the classical continuum theory, the present study
   shows that the shear modulus of the re-entrant honeycomb with a negative
   Poisson's ratio is not always higher than that of the conventional
   honeycomb with a positive Poisson's ratio, which is dominated by the
   geometry of the cell structure. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Poisson's ratio of fibrous soft tissues is analyzed in this paper on the
   basis of constitutive models and experimental data. Three different
   up-to-date constitutive models accounting for the dispersion of fibre
   orientations are analyzed. Their predictions of the anisotropic
   Poisson's ratios are investigated under finite strain conditions
   together with the effects of specific orientation distribution functions
   and of other parameters. The applied constitutive models predict the
   tendency to lower (or even negative) out-of-plane Poisson's ratio. New
   experimental data of porcine arterial layer under uniaxial tension in
   orthogonal directions are also presented and compared with the
   theoretical predictions and other literature data. The results point out
   the typical features of recent constitutive models with fibres
   concentrated in circumferential-axial plane of arterial layers and their
   potential inconsistence with some experimental data. The volumetric
   (in)compressibility of arterial tissues is also discussed as an eventual
   and significant factor influencing this inconsistency. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{By means of extensive ab initio calculations, a new two-dimensional (2D)
   atomic material tin selenide monolayer (coined as tinselenidene) is
   predicted to be a semiconductor with an indirect gap (similar to 1.45
   eV) and a high hole mobility (of order 10000 cm(2)V(-1)S(-1)), and will
   bear an indirect-direct gap transition under a rather low strain (<0.5
   GPa). Tinselenidene has a very small Young's modulus (20-40 GPa) and an
   ultralow lattice thermal conductivity (<3 Wm(-1)K(-1) at 300 K), making
   it probably the most flexible and most heat-insulating material in known
   2D atomic materials. In addition, tinseleniden has a large negative
   Poisson's ratio of -0.17, thus could act as a 2D auxetic material. With
   these intriguing properties, tinselenidene could have wide potential
   applications in thermoelectrics, nanomechanics and optoelectronics.}},

Abstract = {{Obesity and smoking are independently associated with a higher mortality
   risk, but previous studies have reported conflicting results about the
   relationship between these 2 time-varying exposures. Using prospective
   longitudinal data (1987-2007) from the Atherosclerosis Risk in
   Communities Study, our objective in the present study was to estimate
   the joint effects of obesity and smoking on all-cause mortality and
   investigate whether there were additive or multiplicative interactions.
   We fit a joint marginal structural Poisson model to account for
   time-varying confounding affected by prior exposure to obesity and
   smoking. The incidence rate ratios from the joint model were 2.00 (95\%
   confidence interval (CI): 1.79, 2.24) for the effect of smoking on
   mortality among nonobese persons, 1.31 (95\% CI: 1.13, 1.51) for the
   effect of obesity on mortality among nonsmokers, and 1.97 (95\% CI:
   1.73, 2.22) for the joint effect of smoking and obesity on mortality.
   The negative product term from the exponential model revealed a
   submultiplicative interaction between obesity and smoking (beta = -0.28,
   95\% CI: -0.45, -0.11; P < 0.001). The relative excess risk of
   interaction was -0.34 (95\% CI: -0.60, -0.07), indicating the presence
   of subadditive interaction. These results provide important information
   for epidemiologists, clinicians, and public health practitioners about
   the harmful impact of smoking and obesity.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives:A large portion of anogenital cancers is caused by high-risk
   human papillomavirus (hrHPV) infections, which are especially common in
   HIV-infected men. We aimed to compare the incidence and clearance of
   anal and penile hrHPV infection between HIV-infected and HIV-negative
   MSM.Design:Analyses of longitudinal data from a prospective cohort
   study.Methods:MSM aged 18 years or older were recruited in Amsterdam,
   the Netherlands, and followed-up semi-annually for 24 months. At each
   visit, participants completed risk-factor questionnaires. Anal and
   penile self-samples were tested for HPV DNA using the SPF10-PCR
   DEIA/LiPA(25) system. Effects on incidence and clearance rates were
   quantified via Poisson regression, using generalized estimating
   equations to correct for multiple hrHPV types.Results:Seven hundred and
   fifty MSM with a median age of 40 years (interquartile 35-48) were
   included in the analyses, of whom 302 (40\%) were HIV-infected. The
   incidence rates of hrHPV were significantly higher in HIV-infected
   compared with HIV-negative MSM {[}adjusted incidence rate ratio (aIRR)
   1.6; 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.3-2.1 for anal and aIRR 1.4; 95\%CI
   1.0-2.1 for penile infection]. The clearance rate of hrHPV was
   significantly lower for anal {[}adjusted clearance rate ratio (aCRR)
   0.7; 95\%CI 0.6-0.9], but not for penile infection (aCRR 1.3; 95\%CI
   1.0-1.7). HrHPV incidence or clearance did not differ significantly by
   nadir CD4(+) cell count.Conclusion:Increased anal and penile hrHPV
   incidence rates and decreased anal hrHPV clearance rates were found in
   HIV-infected compared with HIV-negative MSM, after adjusting for sexual
   behavior. Our findings suggest an independent effect of HIV infection on
   anal hrHPV infections. Copyright (C) 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Abstract = {{Current stenting solutions commonly employ metal alloys and are
   permanent. This fact has the consequence of diverse long term risks for
   the patients, e.g. Restenosis, late-term stent Thrombosis, etc. One
   possible solution to attenuate these problems is the use of polymer or
   metallic based bioabsorbable stents that tend to be degraded by
   corrosion and completely eliminated after their scaffolding duties are
   fulfilled. Additionally, there is a need to find new ways of deploying
   these devices. A route to fulfill this goal, can be the design of stents
   that eliminate the necessity of balloon expansion and are able to
   self-expand by their own deformation mechanism, for example by
   possessing auxetic behavior. The objective of this study is the modeling
   of a stent that reveals auxetic behavior and is composed by a
   biodegradable material (AZ91D Magnesium alloy), to embrace both recent
   tendencies on stenting designs. It is shown that the defined stent
   modeling is able to expand when stretched (auxetic behavior) and reveals
   a deformation mechanism that may be interesting for further development.
   In conclusion, the combination of both biodegradable and auxetic
   characteristics shown in this study may be a future step in the
   evolution of these medical devices. (C) 2016 Portuguese Society of

Abstract = {{In this paper, the method of low-frequency internal friction (1...3 Hz),
   the investigation of behaviour of the dynamic modulus of torsion (G(ef))

   high-energy (18.eV) electrons. It is discovered that with increase in
   radiation dose, the internal friction and the dislocation velocity
   increase by a factor of 2-3. The stage character of microplastic strain
   of auxetic.. is established. With the aid of mathematical simulation it
   is demonstrated that strain in the irradiated material is due to
   accelerated motion of twinning dislocations at the initial stage which
   is changed to abnormal dynamic deceleration of full dislocations with
   increasing degree of strain at the second stage. It is shown that

Abstract = {{Online dictionary learning for sparse coding is an effective tool for
   data analysis. It incrementally learns a set of basis vectors with
   sparse linear combinations of these vectors when new samples appear.
   Previous work assumes that the samples embed Gaussian noises, which
   weaken the power of these methods in handling real applications with
   non-negative data (e.g., frequency data in word counts). Differently, in
   this paper, we concentrate on online learning for non-negative
   dictionary by using moment information for sparse Poisson coding. We
   exploit the non-negativity of Poisson models to learn a set of
   non-negative basis vectors and a non-negative sparse linear combination
   for the moment information of samples. Specifically, we first formulate
   the online learning problem via the maximum-a-posteriori (MAP)
   framework. We then propose a novel online algorithm which alternatively
   updates the sparse-coefficient vector and the basis vectors with
   non-negativity constraints when a new sample arrives. More importantly,
   we present sufficient convergence analyses to guarantee the performance
   of the proposed algorithm, which leads to convergence of a stable
   dictionary for characterizing the moment information of samples. We
   finally conduct a series of experiments on word-counts data and image
   data to show merits of the proposed online algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate a negative Poisson's ratio in carbon nanotube forest
   devices subjected to extension motion obtained by means of electrostatic
   actuation. Actuated devices were optically monitored, while
   electrostatic force was applied and the axial (parallel to the carbon
   nanotubes) and lateral (perpendicular to the carbon nanotubes) motions
   were extracted. Poisson's ratios were then calculated for the top,
   middle and bottom portions of the carbon nanotube forest devices. Since
   extension motion is associated with morphology change of enhancement of
   carbon nanotube alignment, negative Poisson's ratios were obtained.
   Large negative Poisson's ratios were obtained in the top portion (where
   morphology change is most significant), while other portions (where
   morphology change is less significant) demonstrated smaller value of
   negative Poisson's ratio. This property makes carbon nanotube forest
   attractive material for building of micro-electromechanical devices with
   versatile motion transformation.}},

Abstract = {{Negative Poisson's ratio cellular materials, with advantages of

   The important factors that affect mechanical properties and vibration
   reduction performance of auxetic cellular materials and structures are
   relative density, cell angle and aspect ratio. In this paper, the
   influences of cell angle and thickness on the Poisson's ratio and
   relative density of the foldable (the aspect ratio of the cell is 2)
   thick-wall re-entrant hexagonal auxetic cellular materials are studied
   through theoretical analysis and numerical simulations. The variation

Abstract = {{Metamaterials with extraordinary material properties, not easily found

   topology optimization with a reconciled level set method in order to

   been used to predict the effective properties of the periodically
   assembled metamaterial, which is based on the resulted unit cell. The
   sensitivity analysis is derived utilizing the adjoint variable method
   with the general linear elastic equation combined with a weak imposition
   of the Dirichlet boundary condition. 3D single-material and multi
   material designs have been generated showing the effectiveness of the
   proposed method. The advantage of the method can be located on the fact
   that the design can be manufactured by 3D printing, without any
   post-processing work on the result of the topology optimization, due to
   the clear boundaries between the different materials.}},

Abstract = {{Negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) materials, also known as auxetic
   materials, have many promising application areas. In recent years,
   various auxetic material structures have been designed and fabricated
   for diverse applications that utilized normal materials which follow
   Hooke's law but still show the properties of negative Poisson's ratios.
   In light of this, efforts are made to apply auxetic material structures
   to body protection pads that are comfortable to wear and effective in
   protecting body parts by reducing impact force and preventing injuries
   in high-risk individuals such as elderly people, industry workers, law
   enforcement and military personnel, and sport players. For those people,
   blunt impacts such as falls, bullets, and blast wave may reduce quality
   of life, increase the possibility of early death and generate an
   extremely high medical costs. Therefore, it is important to develop new
   body protectors that best combine each individual's requirements of
   wearing comfort (flexible, light weight), ease of fitting (customized),
   ensured protection, and cost-effectiveness. The developed protection pad
   would be made from multilayer materials with an adaptive structure to
   achieve a unique multifunctional properties such as high hardness,
   impact toughness, light weight, excellent shock absorption,
   self-assembly suitable for the needs.
   Particularly, an integrated computational (finite element analysis)
   approach is used to investigate the effect of three material structures
   (honeycomb or flexin structure, re-entrant hexagonal cells or reflexin
   structure, and arrowhead structure) in combination with three polymeric
   materials (Polylactic acid (PLA) and two thermoplastic polyurethane
   (TPU) materials). Efforts are made to relate the individual and/or
   combined effect of auxetic structure and materials to the overall
   stiffness and shock-absorption performance of the body protection pads.
   Initially, parametric 3D CAD models of auxetic polymeric structures are
   developed. Later, key structural characteristics of protectors are
   evaluated through static analyses of FEA models. Impact/shock analyses
   are conducted to validate the results obtained from the static analyses.
   The mechanism for ideal input force distribution or shunting is
   suggested for designing protectors using various shapes, thicknesses,
   and materials of auxetic materials to reduce the risk of injury. The
   results show that the auxetic material can be considered as an effective
   material structure for body protection pads.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper double-diffusive mixed convection in a heated lid driven
   cavity has been studied numerically using a finite element base code.
   Double-diffusive convection phenomenon is observed in many process
   industrial applications where essentially hot air is used to remove
   moisture or to aid any other process. In the current problem numerical
   investigations have been conducted on double-diffusive convection in a
   hot lid driven cavity with mass diffusive side walls. Galerkin's
   weighted residual method has been implemented to reduce the governing
   equations, namely vorticity transport, velocity, Poisson, energy, and
   solutal equations into weak form. Results have been obtained for
   different parameters like Reynolds number ranging from 100 to 500,
   Richardson number ranging from 0.1 to 3.0, and buoyancy ratio 50 to +50.
   Results show that an increase in Richardson number increased heat
   transfer rates when operated in a positive buoyancy ratio regime and the
   transverse is observed when operated in a negative regime. Increase in
   strength of buoyancy forces s to formation of a number of secondary
   circulations in the cavity, while an increase in inertial forces
   improved convective heat transfer rate from lid more effectively when
   buoyancy forces were weaker.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we touch on the mechanical behavior of casing-infill
   composite tubes, as potential new lightweight structural elements. The
   axial and the torsional behavior of composite tubes of circular
   cross-section, comprising a casing and an infill, is addressed
   analytically, to develop physical insight into the mechanical
   interactions between these two components, in the linear range. The
   influence of the material parameters of the infill, relative to those of
   the casing, and of geometry - such as the ratio of wall-thickness to
   diameter of the casing - on the structural stiffness and capacity of the
   composite are revealed and presented in a novel graphical form. It is
   shown that significantly improved overall stiffness and capacity at
   yield can be obtained by bonding a moderately softer, but highly
   auxetic, infill to the casing, which highlights the need to develop new
   lightweight auxetic materials, without compromising their stiffness.
   These predictions are verified in torsion and confirmed in bending by
   means of suitable computational models based on the finite element
   method.}},

   objects. Since 3D printing is nowadays significantly slower than other
   possibilities to manufacture items, such as die casting, it is often
   used for small parts that are produced in small numbers or for products
   that cannot be created in another way. Combinations of 3D printing with
   other objects, adding novel functionalities to them, are thus favourable
   to a complete primary shaping process. Textile fabrics belong to the
   objects whose mechanical and other properties can notably be modified by
   adding 3D printed forms. This article mainly reports on a new
   possibility to change the permeability of textile fabrics by 3D printing
   auxetic forms, e.g. for utilising them in textile filters. In addition,
   auxetic forms 3D printed on knitted fabrics can bring about mechanical
   properties that are conducive to tensile constructions.}},

Abstract = {{Soft materials are being adopted in robotics in order to facilitate
   biomedical applications and in order to achieve simpler and more capable
   robots. One route to simplification is to design the robot's body using
   `smart materials' that carry the burden of control and actuation.
   Metamaterials enable just such rational design of the material
   properties. Here we present a soft robot that exploits mechanical
   metamaterials for the intrinsic synchronization of two passive clutches
   which contact its travel surface. Doing so allows it to move through an
   enclosed passage with an inchworm motion propelled by a single actuator.
   Our soft robot consists of two 3D-printed metamaterials that implement
   auxetic and normal elastic properties. The design, fabrication and
   characterization of the metamaterials are described. In addition, a
   working soft robot is presented. Since the synchronization mechanism is
   a feature of the robot's material body, we believe that the proposed
   design will enable compliant and robust implementations that scale well
   with miniaturization.}},

Abstract = {{We develop a sparse image reconstruction method for Poisson distributed
   polychromatic X-ray computed tomography (CT) measurements under the
   blind scenario where the material of the inspected object and the
   incident energy spectrum are unknown. We employ our mass-attenuation
   spectrum parameterization of the noiseless measurements for
   single-material objects and express the mass-attenuation spectrum as a
   linear combination of B-spline basis functions of order one. A block
   coordinate descent algorithm is developed for constrained minimization
   of a penalized Poisson negative log-likelihood (NLL) cost function,
   where constraints and penalty terms ensure nonnegativity of the spline
   coefficients and nonnegativity and sparsity of the density-map image;
   the image sparsity is imposed using a convex total-variation (TV) norm
   penalty term. This algorithm alternates between a Nesterov' s
   proximal-gradient (NPG) step for estimating the density-map image and a
   limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno with box constraints
   (LBFGS-B) step for estimating the incident-spectrum parameters. We
   establish conditions for biconvexity of the penalized NLL objective
   function, which, if satisfied, ensures monotonicity of the NPG-BFGS
   iteration. We also show that the penalized NLL objective satisfies the
   Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz property, which is important for establishing local
   convergence of block-coordinate descent schemes in biconvex optimization
   problems. Simulation examples demonstrate the performance of the
   proposed scheme.}},

   a compressive camera. We exploit the inherent non-negativity of the data

Abstract = {{We report calculated elastic tensors, axial Gruneisen parameters, and
   thermal stress distributions in Al2Mo3O12, ZrMgMo3O12, Sc2Mo3O12, and
   Y2Mo3O12, a series of isomorphic materials for which the coefficients of
   thermal expansion range from low-positive to negative. Thermal stress in
   polycrystalline materials arises from interactions between thermal
   expansion and mechanical properties, and both can be highly anisotropic.
   Thermal expansion anisotropy was found to be correlated with elastic
   anisotropy: axes with negative thermal expansion were less compliant.
   Calculations of axial Gruneisen parameters revealed that the thermal
   expansion anisotropy in these materials is in part due to the Poisson
   effect. Models of thermal stress due to thermal expansion anisotropy in
   polycrystals following cooling showed thermal stresses of sufficient
   magnitude to cause microcracking in all cases. The thermal expansion
   anisotropy was found to couple to elastic anisotropy, decreasing the
   bulk coefficient of thermal expansion and leading to lognormal extremes
   of the thermal stress distributions.}},

Abstract = {{This study compares fabrication methods for auxetic foam intended for
   use in sports safety equipment. Thermo-mechanical conversion methods
   were applied using: i) cubic moulds (150x150x150 mm), ii) cuboidal
   moulds (150x150x30 mm) \& iii) cuboidal moulds (150x150x30 mm) with
   through-thickness pins. The cuboidal moulds having one reduced dimension
   relative to the cubic moulds enable faster heat transfer and more
   consistent through-thickness compression to the foam during conversion.
   The through-thickness pins allow greater control of in-plane compression
   throughout the bulk of the converted foam. Samples were compared using:
   i) density measurements and measurements of total surface folding
   (length multiplied by depth), ii) quasi-static compressive load/unload
   tests to obtain specific strain energy, stress/strain relationship and
   Poisson's ratio, iii) impact testing on a bespoke drop rig based on a
   standard for cricket pads (BS 6183-3: 2000, EN 2001) at 5, 10 and 15 J
   \& iv) microscopic images of dissected samples to confirm their auxetic
   (re-entrant) structure. Samples fabricated in cuboidal moulds show less
   variation in final density, axial compressive stiffness and specific
   strain energy between samples than those cut from monoliths fabricated
   in cubic moulds. Samples created with through-thickness pins exhibited
   reduced surface folding. Greater control over final properties paves the
   way for further work designing auxetic foams for sport safety equipment.

Journal = {{MECHANICS BASED DESIGN OF STRUCTURES AND MACHINES}},

Pages = {{514-522}},
Abstract = {{Where deflections of thick plates are concerned, sufficient studies have
   been performed on circular and rectangular plates using first-order
   shear deformation theory (FSDT). Less attention, however, has been
   placed on the use of higher-order theories and plates of other shapes.
   This article proposes a deflection model for a simply supported and
   under uniformly loaded equilateral triangular plate that fulfils the
   third-order shear deformation theory (TSDT). Comparison of maximum plate
   deflections using this exact TSDT model with the FSDT and the simplified
   TSDT models reveals that the former exhibits better correlation
   agreement with the exact TSDT. Using the plate deflection from the exact
   TSDT, a refined shear correction factor, which is a function of
   Poisson's ratio, relative thickness, and location on plate, is extracted
   for the FSDT model. Results suggest that the usual shear correction
   model of 5/6 in Mindlin plates is highly accurate when dealing with
   moderately thick triangular plates made from negative Poisson's ratio
   materials, while the prescription of the refined shear correction factor
   obtained herein is advised for very thick triangular plates made from
   large Poisson's ratio materials. The results avail an FSDT deflection
   model for very thick triangular plates with the accuracy of exact TSDT.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The aim of this study was to highlight major predictors of
   the frequency of sickness absence in a group of workers directly
   involved in customer service. Material and Methods: The study was
   carried out on a random sample of 229 women employed as assistants and
   clerks in post offices. The survey was based on the Subjective Work,
   Health Status and Life Style Characteristics Questionnaire, and sickness
   absence data for the years 2004-2006. Results: The negative binominal
   regression model of sickness absence risk revealed the following
   significant predictors of short-term absence spells (1-29 days): 1)
   marital status, sickness absence risk for single women was (rate ratio
   (RR)) = 1.56 (95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.01-2.39) vs. married
   women; 2) post offices employing 7 workers had a rate ratio of sickness
   absence of 1.6 (95\% CI: 1.04-2.42); 13-25 workers - RR = 2.03 (95\% CI:
   1.41-2.93); > 25 workers -RR = 1.82 (95\% CI: 1.15-2.88) compared with
   an average number of 8-12 workers; 3) shift work, RR = 1.57 (95\% CI:
   1.14-2.14); 4) breaks from work - the risk of absence in the case of any
   breaks amounted to RR = 1.5 (95\% CI: 1.07-2.07) in comparison with the
   statutory breaks; 5) self-rated health reported as moderate relative to
   good health, RR = 1.71 (95\% CI: 1.26-2.32); and 6) occurrence of
   respiratory diseases resulted in the risk of RR = 1.51 (95\% CI:
   1.08-2.08). The Poisson regression model of long-term sickness absence
   spells (>= 30 days) revealed the following significant predictors: 1)
   number of clients per shift: 51-100 clients, RR = 3.62 (95\% CI:
   1.07-22.6) compared with a lower number of clients; 2) self-rated
   health, assessed as moderate, RR = 1.97 (95\% CI: 1.06-3.78) and 3)
   household chores performed for at least 4 h a day, RR = 0.4 (95\% CI:
   0.18-0.79). Conclusions: Association between sickness absence and
   workload as well as work organization indicates directions of corrective
   actions, which could reduce the scale of the problem.}},

Abstract = {{In the presented paper, three types of auxetic structures were produced
   with direct 3D printing and their compressive mechanical properties were
   tested. Samples were prepared from acrylic material suitable for
   high-resolution direct printing. Three different structures exhibiting
   in-plane and volumetric negative strain-dependent Poisson's ratio were
   selected for the analysis: two-dimensional missing-rib cut,
   two-dimensional inverted (re-entrant) honeycomb and three-dimensional
   inverted (re-entrant) honeycomb. The samples were subjected to
   quasi-static compression, from which stress-strain relationships were
   established. For a proper strain evaluation, digital-image correlation
   was applied to measure full-field displacements on the sample surfaces.
   From the displacement fields, true strain/true stress curves were
   derived for each sample. Furthermore, for each structure a
   three-dimensional FE model was developed using beam elements and
   subjected to identical loading conditions. Then, experimentally obtained
   stress-strain relationships were compared with numerically obtained
   results. For all the tested auxetic structures, the compressive
   behaviour was predicted well by the FE models. This demonstrates that
   parametric FE models can be used to tune the design parameters of the
   structures with a negative Poisson's ratio to optimize their overall
   properties.}},

Abstract = {{Generalized linear models are often used to analyse discrete data. There
   are many proposed R2 measures for this class of models. For loglinear
   models for count data, Cameron and Windmeijer {[}An R-squared measure of
   goodness of fit for some common nonlinear regression models. J
   Econometrics. 1997; 77: 329-342] developed an R2-like measure based on a
   ratio of deviances. This quantity has since been adjusted to accommodate
   both overspecification and overdispersion. While these statistics are
   useful for Poisson and negative binomial regression models, count data
   often include many zeros, a phenomenon that is often handled via
   zero-inflated (ZI) regression models. Building on Cameron and
   Windmeijer's work, we propose R2 statistics for the ZI Poisson and ZI
   negative binomial regression contexts. We also propose adjusted R2-like
   versions of these quantities to avoid inflation of these statistics due
   to the inclusion of irrelevant covariates in the model. The properties
   of the proposed measures of fit are examined via simulation, and their
   use is illustrated on two data sets involving counts with excess zeros.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to determine the sample size needed to assess
   the severity of leaf blast in rice in experiments with different
   fungicide treatments. The severity and the area under the disease
   progress curve data of three chemical disease control treatments carried
   out in Rio Grande do Sul, were used in the study. Analysis of variance
   was performed to verify whether the severity of the disease differed
   between treatments. The spread of disease was was also found to be
   different between treatments and assessments, using the variance/mean
   ratio and Morisita index. The spatial distribution of the disease among
   the treatments and during the evaluations is important for the choice of
   the equation used to calculate the sample size. The spatial distribution
   of the disease was not the same across the experiments, and it varied
   between treatments and evaluations. Thus, we decided to use a formula
   that was not associated with distributions to indicate the spatial
   distribution (negative binomial or Poisson) of the disease in the field.
   The sample size to estimate the average of rice leaf blast severity
   varied between treatments and evaluations. The area under the disease
   progress curve is necessary to be determined to reduce the number of
   samples needed. Thus, it is recommended to assess 293 sheets to estimate
   severity, and 63 to estimate AUDPC at 20\% error.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of dental
   caries experience and the components of the decayed, missing and filled
   teeth (DMFT) index on oral health related quality of life (OHRQoL) among
   adolescents in southern Brazil. A cross-sectional study was conducted
   with 509 adolescents aged 11-14 years enrolled at public schools in the
   municipality of Osorio (southern Brazil). A calibrated examiner
   performed the clinical examination for caries (World Health
   Organization: DMFT index), malocclusion (Dental Aesthetic Index) and
   traumatic dental injuries {[}Andreasen et al., 2007]. The participants
   answered the Brazilian version of the Child Perceptions Questionnaire
   (CPQ(11.-14)) - Impact Short Form, and their parents/guardians answered
   a structured questionnaire addressing demographic and socioeconomic
   characteristics. Data analysis involved Poisson regression with robust
   variance, with the calculation of rate ratios adjusted for potential
   confounding variables. High severity of dental caries experience exerted
   a significant impact on OHRQoL, even after controlling for socioeconomic
   and clinical factors (rate ratio 1.30; 95\% confidence interval, CI
   1.12-1.51). All OHRQoL domains were affected by untreated dental caries.
   The multivariate analysis demonstrated that the CPQ(11-14) scores were
   33\% higher among adolescents with untreated caries (rate ratio 1.33;
   95\% Cl 1.17-1.50) and 24\% higher among those with missing teeth (rate
   ratio 1.24; 95\% Cl 1.06-1.47). No difference in OHRQoL was found
   between adolescents with filled teeth and those without dental caries.
   In conclusion, dental caries experience, untreated dental caries and
   missing teeth exerted a negative impact on OHRQoL among the adolescents.

Abstract = {{This paper presents a preliminary study of the dynamic performance of a

   and experimental analyses were conducted to reveal the effects of

   found that, by decreasing the relative density of reentrant honeycombs
   and increasing Poisson's ratio of them, excellent vibration isolation
   performance of the auxetic cellular base will be achieved. This analysis
   was followed by static, modal, and frequency response tests, which
   verified the results of the numerical analysis.}},

Abstract = {{This work presents a mechanism to generate energy dissipation by
   creating novel multilayer microstructure architectures via nano-inks and
   improving the mechanical, damping and dielectric performance of open
   cell foams. A multilayer carbon nano-ink containing -COOH functionalised
   multi-walled carbon nanotubes is produced and used to dip-coat pristine
   polyurethane open cell foam structures with the assistance of a silane
   coupling agent. Another layer of water-based polyurethane dispersion is
   coated on top of the MWCNT layer coated foam to transform the single
   foam ribs in multilayer structures. The nano-ink dipping and drying
   process developed in this work creates a porous MWCNT layer with a
   fairly high MWNT content that covers the foam ribs. These carbon
   nanotube multi-layer coated foams show a significant damping performance
   with loss modulus and loss factors 165\% and 100\% higher than those
   from high-dissipation nano-foams fabricated by conventional foaming
   techniques and auxetic phase transformation respectively. These nano-ink
   multilayer coated foams with only one layer also exhibit an increase in
   electrical conductivity by a factor of 2 compared to other existing
   nano-ink coated open cell foams with a substantially higher number of
   layers 20).}},

Abstract = {{The understanding of wave propagation in a metamaterial with
   hierarchical, auxetic rectangular perforations is presented in this
   work. The metamaterial is a 2D structure with chaining horizontal and
   vertical perforations exhibing auxetic in-plane behaviour. The unit cell
   of this lattice is identified as the reference level 0. Hierarchical
   structures are composed of structural elements which themselves have
   structure. At level 0, 4 rigid squares are present in the unit cell. In
   each square, the reference structure is used by applying a scale ratio
   to obtain the level 1. The same strategy is used to reach the upper
   level in each subunit. A geometric parametric investigation of these
   rectangular perforations using a numerical asymptotic homogenisation
   finite element approach is done. Some numerical eigenvalue tools are
   used for the dispersion analysis of this structure. It is first observed
   that the total width of Band gaps increases with the hierarchy. The
   porosity induced by the perforations is taken into account in the
   mechanical properties. The symmetry of the geometry in the x-y plane
   allow to define the entire geometry of the unit cell using only 2
   parameters: the void aspect ratio, the intercell spacing and the
   hierarchy level. When decreasing the intercell spacing, the total width
   of Band gaps increases and the effective stiffness in x and y directions
   decrease, allowing for increased rotations of the rigid sqares, so
   auxetic behaviour is greater. Hierarchical levels shift from isotropic
   to orthotropic, hierarchical levels are always auxetic.}},

Abstract = {{Mechanical metamaterials have attracted tremendous interests, owing to
   their fruitfulness of underlying physics and mechanics as well as
   diverse potential applications. Conventional soft mechanical
   metamaterials contain periodic distribution of holes having identical
   sizes, which can only display one mechanical function. Periodically
   dispersing a regular pattern of through-holes with two sizes into an
   elastomer results in metamaterials with more mechanical functions and
   deformation scenarios. We numerically investigate the deformation
   behaviors of this type of metamaterials. Switching of modes from the
   buckling-dominated deformation to a loss-of-instability deformation is
   emphasized. Replacing the pattern of holes with the same sizes by a
   pattern of holes with two sizes imposes higher compliance and even loss
   of negative Poisson's ratio of the material.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials with negative Poisson's ratio have recently attracted
   the interest of the scientific community. This is because these
   materials have the potential to deliver specific functions thanks to a
   discretization of their constitutive matter that is intended as an
   aggregation of macro-scaled cellular structures characterized by
   specific geometries. Many auxetic structures with different geometries
   and auxetic response have been proposed. Downscaling the cellular
   structures (e.g. micro scale) has the potential to improve the overall
   auxetic properties of the material, yet there is not enough research on
   the behavior of these structures at the microscale. This paper studies
   the auxetic behavior of a modified hexachiral structure formed by
   microscale elements. First an optimization study was performed to define
   the most appropriate geometrical dimensions. Then the auxeticity of the
   proposed cell was assessed carefully introducing a new Coefficient of
   Auxeticity which allowed to capture complex mechanical responses (e.g.
   including cellular rotations) as those faced with the proposed design.
   The proposed miniaturized design shows an outstanding stable auxetic
   response up to 20\% strain of the micro-cell. It is believed that this
   study has the potential to pave the way to a new class of auxetic
   materials.}},

Abstract = {{Hip fracture is one of the most serious and common health problems among
   elderly which may lead to permanent disability or death. Hip fracture
   commonly occurs in the femoral bone, the major bone in the hip joint.
   Microscopic age related changes in the structure of cortical bone is one
   of the factors that is considered to be partially responsible for the
   increase of fracture risk in elderly. It is of great interest to develop
   a predictable model of such fractures for the aging population in
   preparation of a suitable therapy. These micro structural changes
   influence mechanical properties and, therefore, behavior of bone and are
   critical to understand risk and mechanics of fracture of bone.
   Correlation between cortical bone strength and porosity, as a
   microscopic structural factor, has been examined frequently as a
   function of age and/or porosity. These studies have investigated the
   effect of porosity experimentally and have not studied the effect of
   porosity independently from other structural factors such as bone
   mineral density. In this study effect of porosity on elastic properties
   of human femoral cortical bone was studied independently using finite
   element analysis assuming transversely isotropic behavior in terms of
   elastic properties with the axis of elastic properties along the
   longitudinal axis of femur shaft. In this study, published standard
   mechanical tests for transversely isotropic materials were simulated
   using finite element computer simulation on models with different
   porosities. The developed finite element model utilized material
   properties based on the best fit regression in previously published
   articles. Pores' size, shape and distribution were also modeled based on
   previous experimental studies. The finite element model, in general,
   predicted behavior of five independent elastic mechanical properties,
   namely, longitudinal Young's modulus, transverse poisson's ratio,
   transverse shear modulus, transverse Young's modulus and longitudinal
   poisson's ratio, as a function of porosity. Furthermore, effect of
   porosity on the elastic properties across various age groups was
   investigated using published data on age-related changes in bone
   porosity. Mathematical models based on Finite Element Analysis results
   have been developed using linear least square regression. These models
   show negative linear relationship between studied elastic properties of
   human femoral cortical bone and porosity. The Finite Element Analysis
   results compared well with the previously published experimental data.
   Furthermore, the results obtained show the elastic properties as
   functions of age for females and males. The predicted values for elastic
   properties are lower for men compared to women of age 20 to 40 years
   old. However; after the age of 44, elastic properties of femoral
   cortical bone for men are higher than women. The Finite Element Model
   developed in this study will help to create a clinical bone model for
   the prediction of fracture risk or the selection of suitable therapy in
   orthopedic surgery.}},

Abstract = {{Cellular materials have two important properties: structures and
   mechanisms. This property enables one to design structures with proper
   stiffness and flexibility. Recent advance in 3D printing technologies
   enable engineers to manufacture complex cellular structures. In
   addition, use of smart materials, e.g., shape memory polymers (SMPs),
   for 3D printing enables us to construct mesostructures actively
   responsive to environmental stimuli with a programmable function, which
   may be termed `4D Printing' referring to additional dimension on
   time-dependent shape change after 3D printing. The objective of this
   study is to design and synthesize active reconfigurable cellular
   materials, which enables the advance of technology on intelligent
   reconfigurable cellular structures with 4D printing. A two layer hinge
   of a CPS functions through a programmed thermal expansion mismatch
   between two layers and shape memory effect of an SMP. Starting with
   thermo-mechanical constitutive modeling of a compliant porous hinge
   consisting of laminated elastomer composites, macroscopic behaviors of a
   reconfigurable compliant porous structure (CPS) will be constructed
   using the strain energy method. A finite element (FE) based simulation
   equipped with a user subroutine will be implemented with ABAQUS/Standard
   to simulate time dependent thermo mechanical behaviors of a CPS.
   The designed CPS with polymers shows an extremely high negative
   Poisson's ratio-120) and negative thermal expansion coefficient (-2,530
   x 10(-6)/C). When programmed with an appropriate thermo-mechanical
   procedure, the hinge of the CPS bends either in positive and negative
   sign, which enables to tailor the CPS into desired intermediate and
   final configurations, ending up with achieving a reconfigurable CPS.
   This paper demonstrates that actively reconfigurable compliant cellular
   materials (CCMs) with CPSes can be used for next-generation materials
   design in terms of tailoring mechanical properties such as modulus,
   strength, yield strain, Poisson's ratios and thermal expansion
   coefficient together with programmable characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{Two very important factors which determine the effectiveness of a pump
   are its volumetric and energy efficiencies. Yin and Ghoneim constructed
   a prototype of a flexible body pump with a very high volumetric
   efficiency or pumping potential (the relative volume reduction due to a
   relative input stroke) {[}1]. The high volumetric efficiency is
   attributed to the geometry of the pump's structure (hyperboloid) as well
   as the high negative effective Poisson's ratio of the 3 layer
   ({[}0/13/0]) flexible-matrix-composite (carbon/polyurethane) laminate
   adopted for the body of the pump. The energy efficiency was not
   evaluated. An important factor in assessing the energy efficiency of
   flexible-body pumps is the effective damping (a measure of the energy
   dissipation per cycle) of the flexible body material. An objective of
   the current work is to determine the effective damping inherent in the
   3-layer laminate, as a function of the two angle orientations 0 and (3,
   employed for the design of the flexible body pump. Thereby, the best
   fiber angle orientation, for the highest volumetric as well as energy
   efficiency, can be considered. The contribution of this `` work is
   twofold: 1) viscoelastic characterization (longitudinal, transverse, and
   shear complex moduli, as well as the in-plane complex Poisson's ratio)
   of the polyurethane/carbon composite, used in the Geo-polymer lab at
   RIT; the results may be utilized as benchmarks for other researchers
   using similar carbon/polyurethane in dynamic applications, and 2)
   provide a comprehensive study of the effect of the two angles 0 and 13
   on the effective damping factors of the three-layer laminate. Together
   with the similar study on the negative Poisson's ratio {[}1], a better
   design of the laminate for the most efficient flexible-body pump
   performance can be established.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, engineered metamaterials have aroused considerable interests
   in many fields, due to their distinctive characteristics different from
   conventional materials. This paper proposes a level-set based
   topological optimization method for design of the mechanical
   metamaterials with negative Poisson's ratio. The strain energy method is
   employed to predict the effective properties of the periodic
   microstructure. The adjoint variable method is applied to calculate the
   shape sensitivity, which is further used to construct the design
   velocity field. Finally, the level set method is applied to achieve
   shape evolution and topological changes of the microstructure until the
   desired materials properties like negative Poisson's ratios are
   achieved.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, we present and review equations which describe the
   evolutionary behavior of double and triple porosity elastic materials.
   Uniqueness and continuous dependence results are described for a double
   porosity anisotropic elastic body when the elastic coefficients are
   positive, in a precise sense. We then review work on uniqueness and
   continuous dependence when the elastic coefficients are not required to
   be sign definite. With the advent of auxetic materials, and other
   materials which have negative Poisson ratios, sign indefinite elastic
   coefficients are important. We further establish uniqueness for a double
   porosity elastic body which occupies an unbounded spatial domain. This
   is not a trivial extension from the bounded domain case since the
   pressures and deformation and their derivatives are allowed to have
   substantial growth in space at infinity and so classical techniques like
   the energy method fail. After this we review work on acceleration wave
   evolution in a linear elastic double porosity body and then in a
   nonlinear elastic one. For the linear elastic double porosity problem,
   it is seen that the amplitude of the acceleration wave will decay
   exponentially in time. In the nonlinear case, however, we see that
   shocks may develop in a finite time. Finally, we present models for the
   evolutionary behavior of a triple porosity linearly elastic body.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of a quarter-space under distributed normal and shear loads
   is considered. A mathematical model is formulated for the plane strain
   state. Theoretical background of the Mellin integral transform and
   calculation of residues is outlined. An analytical procedure involving
   the Mellin transform is presented for the general reduced problem of a
   quarter-plane. Numerical computation of residues allows for evaluation
   of the inverse transforms for the displacements and stresses. Simulation
   results are obtained for a special load case: a concentrated force. The
   deformation of the loaded boundary is analyzed for various values of
   Poisson's ratio. It turns out that auxetics exhibit locally negative
   stiffness, which leads to an anomalous behavior of the system. A simple
   explanation of the unusual deformation mechanism is proposed. The
   semianalytical solutions are compared with the results obtained by means
   of the finite element method.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. To investigate whether receipt of dental services, among
   attenders, reflects variations in dental health or whether and to what
   degree it is associated with socioeconomic status, with irregular or
   regular dental attendance and with the availability of dentists in
   residential areas. Materials and methods. This retrospective
   register-based study followed two Danish cohorts, aged 25 and 40, with a
   dental examination in 2009 (n = 32,351). The dental service data were
   registered during 2005-2009. The number of dental examinations,
   individual preventive services (IPS), tooth extractions, root fillings
   and composite fillings were analyzed in relation to socioeconomic
   status, irregular/regular dental attendance, inhabitant/dentist ratio
   and to DMFT at age 15 (DMFT15) and change in DMFT (Delta DMFT) from age
   15 to age 25 and age 40, respectively. Poisson regression and negative
   binomial regression analyses were used. Results. The variations in
   number of services received in the study population were small (SD =
   0.2-2.7). However, with a few exceptions, high levels of DMFT15 and
   DDMFT were associated with receipt of more dental services.
   Socioeconomically-privileged individuals received more dental
   examinations but fewer tooth extractions, root fillings and composite
   fillings compared to disadvantaged persons, when controlled for dental
   health levels. Irregular attenders received fewer IPS and composite
   fillings but had more extractions compared to regular attenders.
   Conclusions. Variations in dental care services were found to reflect
   variations in dental health, but the variations were also related to
   individual socioeconomic status, residential area and dental attendance
   patterns.}},

Abstract = {{We develop a sparse image reconstruction method for Poisson-distributed
   polychromatic X-ray computed tomography (CT) measurements under the
   blind scenario where the material of the inspected object and the
   incident energy spectrum are unknown. We employ our mass-attenuation
   spectrum parameterization of the noiseless measurements and express the
   mass attenuation spectrum as a linear combination of B-spline basis
   functions of order one. A block coordinate-descent algorithm is
   developed for constrained minimization of a penalized Poisson negative
   log-likelihood (NLL) cost function, where constraints and penalty terms
   ensure nonnegativity of the spline coefficients and nonnegativity and
   sparsity of the density map image; the image sparsity is imposed using a
   convex total-variation (TV) norm penalty term. This algorithm alternates
   between a Nesterov's proximal-gradient (NPG) step for estimating the
   density map image and a limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno
   with box constraints (L-BFGS-B) step for estimating the
   incident-spectrum parameters. To accelerate convergence of the density
   map NPG steps, we apply function restart and a step-size selection
   scheme that accounts for varying local Lipschitz constants of the
   Poisson NLL. Real X-ray CT reconstruction examples demonstrate the
   performance of the proposed scheme.}},

Abstract = {{AimThe present study examined whether knee pain was associated with
   decline in maximum gait speed (MGS) in a rural mountainous region.
   MethodsThis was a population-based 1-year prospective cohort study. A
   total of 658 men and women aged 60years and older participated in the
   baseline survey in 2006, and 400 individuals participated in the
   follow-up survey in 2007. We compared the incidence of meaningful
   decline in gait speed (0.1m/s) in older adults with different knee pain
   levels (none, mild, severe), estimating incidence rate ratio (IRR) by
   multivariable-adjusted Poisson regression model.
   ResultsMeaningful decline in MGS presented in 24.3\% of participants,
   especially in men (30.3\%). Baseline knee pain level was significantly
   related to meaningful decline in MGS after adjustment of potential
   confounders (IRR 1.79 for mild pain, 1.84 for severe pain; P for trend
   <0.01). In sensitivity analyses with change in MGS as the continuous
   variable, the association was not significant, but a similar negative
   association with knee pain was confirmed (mild pain =-0.040, severe pain
   =-0.088; P for trend=0.104). In addition, older adults with knee pain at
   both baseline and follow up had a higher risk of meaningful decline in
   MGS (IRR 2.33, 95\% CI 1.59-3.40) compared with those who had no pain at
   baseline or follow up.
   ConclusionsKnee pain was associated with a decline in gait speed at
   1-year follow up. Prevention and treatment of knee pain might be
   important for suppression of decline in physical function in older
   adults. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2016; 16: 55-64.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Relative survival (RS) for patients with laryngeal cancer in
   the US population has yet to be described. Additionally, survival of
   patients with laryngeal cancer has demonstrated socioeconomic and racial
   disparities which have not been previously examined through the lens of
   RS. Materials and Methods: Data on 58,814 patients with laryngeal cancer
   were obtained from the National Cancer Database. Patients were diagnosed
   between 1998 and 2006, and had at least 5 years of follow-up. Birth,
   year-, age-, sex- and race-specific matched life expectancies were used
   to estimate expected survival. Stage-stratified RS rates were calculated
   with multiple factors assessed for significance. Excess mortality ratios
   were estimated in multivariate analysis utilizing Poisson regression.
   Results: Younger age, African-American race, uninsured or Medicaid
   insurance, and treatment at an academic center were all significantly
   associated with stage IV disease. Uninsured and Medicaid patients
   demonstrated decreased RS when compared to privately insured
   individuals. Excess mortality was markedly pronounced in the first year
   for patients over 50 years old with stage II-IV disease, especially for
   the over 75-year-old cohort. Conclusion: Survival disparities for
   uninsured and Medicaid populations were found, with these patients
   exhibiting increased excess mortality. Additionally, RS calculations
   highlight the negative effects of increasing age on survival of patients
   with laryngeal cancer.}},

Title = {{On the correct interpretation of measured force and calculation of

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICAL BEHAVIOR OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{53}},
Pages = {{187-199}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Biaxial tests are commonly used to investigate the mechanical behaviour
   of soft biological tissues and polymers. In the current paper we uncover
   a fundamental problem associated with the calculation of material stress
   from measured force in standard biaxial tests. In addition to measured
   forces, localised unmeasured shear forces also occur at the clamps and
   the inability to quantify such forces has significant implications for
   the calculation of material stress from simplified force-equilibrium
   relationships. Unmeasured shear forces are shown to arise due to two
   distinct competing contributions: (1) negative shear force due to
   stretching of the orthogonal clamp, and (2) positive shear force as a
   result of material Poisson-effect. The clamp shear force is highly
   dependent on the specimen geometry and the clamp displacement ratio, as
   consequently, is the measured force-stress relationship. Additionally in
   this study we demonstrate that commonly accepted formulae for the
   estimation of material stress in the central region of a cruciform
   specimen are highly inaccurate. A reliable empirical correction factor
   for the general case of isotropic materials must be a function of
   specimen geometry and the biaxial clamp displacement ratio. Finally we
   demonstrate that a correction factor for the general case of non-linear
   anison-opic materials is not feasible and we suggest the use of inverse
   finite element analysis as a practical means of interpreting
   experimental data for such complex materials. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Objectives: Use of resorbable external reinforcement of the pulmonary
   autograft during the Ross operation has been suggested, but the
   differential regional potential for dilation of the aorta, mainly
   regarding the neo-root and the neo-Valsalva sinuses, represents an
   unresolved issue. Auxetic materials could be useful in preventing
   dilation given their favorable mechanical properties. We designed a
   composite semiresorbable armoured bioprosthesis constituted by
   polydioxanone and expanded polytetrafluoroethylene and evaluated its
   effectiveness as a pulmonary autograft reinforcement device in an animal
   model of the Ross procedure.
   Methods: An experimental model of the Ross procedure was performed in 20
   three-month-old growing lambs. The pulmonary autograft was alternatively
   non-reinforced (control group n = 10) or reinforced with composite
   bioprosthesis (reinforced group n = 10). Animals were followed up during
   growth for 6 months by angiography and echocardiography. Specific
   stainings for extracellular matrix and immunohistochemistry for
   metalloproteinase-9 were performed.
   Results: Reference aortic diameter increased from 14 +/- 1mm to 19 +/- 2
   mm over 6 months of growth. In the control group, pulmonary autograft
   distension (28 +/- 2 mm) was immediately noted, followed by aneurysm
   development at 6 months (40 +/- 2 mm, P <. 001 vs reference). In the
   reinforced group, an initial dilation to 18 +/- 1 mm was detected and
   the final diameter was 27 +/- 2 mm (42\% increase). Two deaths due to
   pulmonary autograft rupture occurred in the control group. On histology,
   the control group showed medial disruption with connective fibrous
   replacement, whereas in the reinforced group compensatory intimal
   hyperplasia was present in the absence of intimal tears. The
   bioprosthesis promoted a positive matrix rearrangement process favoring
   neoarterialization and elastic remodeling as demonstrated on specific
   staining for elastin collagen and metalloproteinase- 9.
   Conclusions: The device adapted and functionally compensated for the
   characteristics of autograft growth, guaranteeing a reasonable size of
   the autograft at 6 months, but more important, because the device is
   biocompatible, it did not disrupt the biological process of growth or
   cause inflammatory damage to the wall.}},

   This property however requires an unusual Poisson ratio, or Poisson
   function at finite strains, which has to vary with applied strain and
   exceed the familiar bounds: less than 0 in tension and above 1/2 in
   compression. Here, by combining mechanical tests and discrete element
   simulations, we show that a simple three-dimensional architected
   material, made of a self-entangled single long coiled wire, behaves in
   between discrete and continuum media, with a large and reversible
   dilatancy in both tension and compression. This unusual behaviour arises
   from an interplay between the elongation of the coiled wire and
   rearrangements due to steric effects, which, unlike in traditional
   discrete media, are hysteretically reversible when the architecture is
   made of an elastic fibre.}},

Abstract = {{Complex inertial Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) usually require
   the simultaneous motion of the masses in more than one direction and an
   overall linear behavior. Furthermore, since it is usually very difficult
   to actuate the device in all the required directions, complex spring
   configurations for the conversion of the motion are needed. Here we
   present possible solutions to this problem through auxetic structures.
   The goal of the work is to propose a new topology optimization procedure
   which can be used as a tool during the design phase of the optimal
   auxetic structure, that is completely compatible with the MEMS
   fabrication processes available so far and that allows the motion
   conversion in a MEMS device without entering the nonlinear regime.}},

Abstract = {{Masonry walls allow easy intrusion of the impacting vehicles into the
   impacted buildings. The cause of the damage due to vehicular impacts in
   masonry walls is the generation of tensile stresses due to ``Poisson's
   effect{''}. Auxetic foams, due to their negative Poisson's ratio, can
   eliminate these tensile stresses. In this study, masonry walls with and
   without Auxetic foam renders subject to lateral impact were analysed
   using an explicit finite element method incorporating shell elements.
   Masonry was considered as a homogenised continuum with distinct
   directional properties. The Poisson's ratio of the Auxetic layers was
   considered as -0.2 and -0.9. The impact scenario was simulated using
   applied velocities. The results show that Auxetic layer reduced stresses
   in the masonry wall. The detailed deformation and failure results of the
   numerical examples encourage the potential for developing Auxetic
   composite render material, and methods of design and application to
   masonry walls to mitigate vehicular intrusions.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic composites are non-conventional materials with negative
   Poisson's ratio (NPR). They have received great attention in recent
   years due to their particular properties and high application potential
   in different areas. In this study, a novel kind of auxetic composite was
   proposed and fabricated via an injecting and foaming process by using
   multilayer orthogonal auxetic structure as reinforcement and
   polyurethane foam as matrix. The NPR effect and mechanical behavior of
   the composite under quasi-static compression were investigated and
   compared with those of the pure polyurethane foam and non-auxetic
   composite. The results obtained show that the auxetic composite
   fabricated has an obvious NPR effect and behaves more like a damping
   material with a large range of deformation strain. The study has
   provided a simple way to design and fabricate auxetic composite
   materials by using suitable arrangement of reinforcement materials in a
   multilayer orthogonal structure. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{We employed a combination of theoretical and experimental techniques to
   study the metal-organic framework (MOF)-mechanics central to the
   paddle-wheel Cu-3(BTC)(2) porous structure, commonly designated as
   HKUST-1. Lattice dynamics of the hybrid framework at below 18 THz were
   measured by means of Raman and synchrotron far-infrared spectroscopy,
   and systematically correlated to collective vibrational modes computed
   from ab initio density functional theory (DFT). We have identified a
   number of intriguing lowenergy framework vibration mechanisms,
   reminiscent of the `trampoline-like' deformations and new oscillatory
   motions associated with Cu paddle-wheel `molecular rotors'. The three
   independent single-crystal elastic constants of the HKUST-1 (i.e. C-11,
   C-12 and C-44) were calculated using the DFT approach, taking into
   account the effects of dispersion corrections. We established the full
   elasticity solutions accompanying detailed deformation mechanisms that
   control its anisotropic mechanical properties, ranging from the Young's
   and shear moduli to linear compressibility and Poisson's ratio. Our
   results support the notion that the co-existance of soft modes and
   intrinsic shear distortions connected to the THz lattice dynamics
   dictate a range of anomalous elastic phenomena, for example: negative
   Poisson's ratio (auxeticity), negative thermal expansion (NTE), and
   exceedingly low shear moduli properties.}},

Abstract = {{The comprehensive elastic properties of Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks

   While the chemical compositions of ZIFs-1 to -4 are the same, each
   structure features a distinct network topology, crystal symmetry and
   porosity configuration, which translate into differential
   structure-function mechanical correlations. We elucidate the anisotropic
   mechanical response with respect to the directionally dependent Young's
   and shear moduli properties. Our theoretical results suggest that ZIF-3
   adopting a dft topology has an extremely low shear resistance (G(min) =
   0.1 GPa), which is also underpinning the flexible mechanism responsible
   for its negative Poisson's ratio (auxetic v(min) = -0.43).
   Interestingly, we identified that ZIF-1, ZIF-2, and ZIF-4 could exhibit
   a nearly zero Poisson's ratio for certain crystal orientations, which is
   reminescent of a rare ``cork-like{''} phenomenon where there is
   practically no lateral deformation corresponding to an applied axial

Abstract = {{The effect of rock properties such as velocity, porosity, and diagenesis
   processes was comprehensively investigated to analyse the Amplitude
   Variation with Offset (AVO) on Baturaja carbonate formation at the
   northern part of the West Java Basin. The AVO analysis consists of the
   subsurface condition modeling and the AVO data field. Firstly, the
   subsurface carbonate modeling was applied by Shuey equation and
   Aki-Richard formula using P-wave, S-wave, density, Poisson's ratio, and
   porosity as the parameters. In this simulation, the amplitude
   corresponding to the angle or offset for each layers were obtained. The
   AVO attributes such as intercept (A) and gradient (B) were produced by
   analysing the amplitude. Interestingly, the value of A was positive and
   the gradient was negative which can be related to the carbonate
   formation. The property of the attributes was AVO class-II and the
   product of A and B which would be negative in the value are important
   for hydrocarbon indicator. AVO data field was analyzed, the preserve
   amplitude was obtained, and the noise was reduced. The subsurface
   condition modeling was applied in two different well locations and also
   the facies. It was found that the two wells showed different AVO
   attributes although the porosity distribution was relatively same around
   18\% and 20\%. The AVO attributes in one of the wells was similar to the
   model with shifting polarization while another well has no shifting
   polarization. Overall, some parameters in AVO data analysis should be
   considered since not only the velocity and porosity can influence the
   amplitude but also the diagenesis processes of the rocks can do. We
   believe that our work is very useful to reduce some pitfalls and risks
   in AVO analysis on the carbonates formation.}},

Abstract = {{Using a global optimization evolutionary algorithm and density
   functional theory calculations we report, for the first time,
   two-dimensional tri-FeB6 as a global minimum ground state structure,
   opening the door for tailoring unique properties by manipulating
   transition metals. This novel tri-FeB6 consists of borophene-like layers
   and an Fe-layer with the Fe-layer being sandwiched between boron planes.
   Its dynamic stability, energetic stability, thermal stability, and
   mechanical stability have been carefully evaluated, suggesting it as a
   quite stable material to call for experimental realization. Furthermore,
   oxidization would retain the planar structural characteristics,
   resulting in an oxide sheet. Both tri-FeB6 and its oxide are found to
   have remarkable mechanical properties. In comparison with experimentally
   fabricated borophene, the in-plane stiffness in tri-FeB6 is greatly
   enhanced, showing the same stiffness as graphene. Oxidization brings
   about unusual negative Poisson's ratio properties, rendering the oxide
   sheet attractive in view of both scientific and technological
   investigations. In addition, both tri-FeB6 and its oxide are
   semiconductors with band gaps of about 2 eV. Furthermore, tensile strain
   can continuously tune the band gaps over a wide range, making tri-FeB6
   and its oxide attractive for advanced nanoelectronics.}},

Title = {{Screen detection of ductal carcinoma in situ and subsequent incidence of

Journal = {{LANCET ONCOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{17}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Background The value of screen detection and treatment of ductal
   carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a matter of controversy. At present, the
   extent to which the diagnosis and treatment of DCIS could prevent the
   occurrence of invasive breast cancer in the future is not clear. We
   sought to estimate the association between detection of DCIS at
   screening and invasive interval cancers subsequent to the relevant
   screen.
   Methods We obtained aggregate data for screen-detected cancers from 84
   local screening units within 11 regional Quality Assurance Reference
   Centres in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland from the National Health
   Service Breast Screening Programme. Data for DCIS diagnoses were
   obtained for women aged 50-64 years who were invited to and attended
   mammographic breast screening from April 1, 2003, to March 31, 2007 (4
   screening years). Patient-level data for interval cancer arising in the
   36 months after each of these were analysed by Poisson regression with
   invasive interval cancer screen detection rate as the outcome variable;
   DCIS detection frequencies were fitted first as a continuous and then as
   a categorical variable. We repeated this analysis after adjustment with
   both small size and high-grade invasive screen-detected cancers.
   Findings We analysed data for 5 243 658 women and on interval cancers
   occurring in the 36 months after the relevant screen. The average
   frequency of DCIS detected at screening was 1.60 per 1000 women screened
   (median 1.50 {[}unit range 1.54-3.56] per 1000 women). There was a
   significant negative association of screen-detected DCIS cases with the
   rate of invasive interval cancers (Poisson regression coefficient -0.084
   {[}95\% CI -0.13 to -0.03]; p=0.002). 90\% of units had a DCIS detection
   frequency within the range of 1.00 to 2.22 per 1000 women; in these
   units, for every three screen-detected cases of DCIS, there was one
   fewer invasive interval cancer in the next 3 years. This association
   remained after adjustment for numbers of small screen-detected invasive
   cancers and for numbers of grade 3 invasive screen-detected cancers.
   Interpretation The association between screen-detected DCIS and
   subsequent invasive interval cancers suggests that detection and
   treatment of DCIS is worthwhile in prevention of future invasive
   disease.}},

Title = {{Tuning the Performance of Metallic Auxetic Metamaterials by Using
   Buckling and Plasticity}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Metallic auxetic metamaterials are of great potential to be used in many
   applications because of their superior mechanical performance to
   elastomer-based auxetic materials. Due to the limited knowledge on this
   new type of materials under large plastic deformation, the
   implementation of such materials in practical applications remains
   elusive. In contrast to the elastomer-based metamaterials, metallic ones
   possess new features as a result of the nonlinear deformation of their
   metallic microstructures under large deformation. The loss of auxetic
   behavior in metallic metamaterials led us to carry out a numerical and
   experimental study to investigate the mechanism of the observed
   phenomenon. A general approach was proposed to tune the performance of
   auxetic metallic metamaterials undergoing large plastic deformation
   using buckling behavior and the plasticity of base material. Both
   experiments and finite element simulations were used to verify the
   effectiveness of the developed approach. By employing this approach, a
   2D auxetic metamaterial was derived from a regular square lattice. Then,
   by altering the initial geometry of microstructure with the desired
   buckling pattern, the metallic metamaterials exhibit auxetic behavior
   with tuneable mechanical properties. A systematic parametric study using
   the validated finite element models was conducted to reveal the novel
   features of metallic auxetic metamaterials undergoing large plastic
   deformation. The results of this study provide a useful guideline for
   the design of 2D metallic auxetic metamaterials for various
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{Mechanical cleavage, chemical intercalation and chemical vapor

   exfoliation for the fabrication of silica monolayers. Using a variety of

   single-layer silica with a tetragonal lattice, T-silica, can be
   thermally exfoliated from the stishovite phase in a clean environment at
   room temperature. The resulting single-layer silica is dynamically,
   thermally, and mechanically stable with exceptional properties,
   including a large band gap of 7.2 eV, an unusual negative Poisson's
   ratio, a giant Stark effect, and a high breakdown voltage. Moreover,
   other analogous structures like single-layer GeO2 can also be obtained
   by thermal exfoliation of its bulk phase. Our findings are expected to
   motivate experimental efforts on developing new techniques for the

Abstract = {{In this work, seven novel phases of phosphorene were predicted to be

   enantiomers corresponding to three kinds of structures with chirality.
   It is the first time to introduce chirality into two-dimensional (2D)
   phosphorus. The Poisson's ratios have been investigated and show normal
   behavior, rather than the negative one of monolayer or bulk black
   phosphorus, due to the structures being non-puckered. Phase
   transformations of these enantiomers have been studied, revealing that
   there exists the possibility of transformations between them because of
   the energy barriers being low, which opens doors to possible
   applications in shape memory devices. This work may inspire new ideas of
   developing novel applications based on 2D phosphorus nanomaterials.}},

Abstract = {{Background In response to increasing HIV and other sexually
   transmissible infection (HIV/STI) notifications in Australia, a social
   marketing campaign Drama Downunder (DDU) was launched in 2008 to promote
   HIV/STI testing among men who have sex with men (MSM). We analyzed
   prospective data from (1) an online cohort of MSM and (2) clinic-level
   HIV/STI testing to evaluate the impact of DDU on HIV, syphilis,
   gonorrhea, and chlamydia testing.
   Materials and Methods (1) Cohort participants who completed 3 surveys
   (2010-2014) contributed to a Poisson regression model examining
   predictors of recent HIV testing. (2) HIV, syphilis, gonorrhea, and
   chlamydia tests among MSM attending high caseload primary care clinics
   (2007-2013) were included in an interrupted time series analysis.
   Results (1) Although campaign awareness was high among 242 MSM
   completing 726 prospective surveys, campaign recall was not associated
   with self-reported HIV testing. Reporting previous regular HIV testing
   (adjusted incidence rate ratio, 2.4; 95\% confidence interval, 1.3-4.4)
   and more than 10 partners in the previous 6 months (adjusted incidence
   rate ratio, 1.2; 95\% confidence interval, 1.1-1.4) was associated with
   recent HIV testing. (2) Analysis of 257,023 tests showed increasing
   monthly HIV, syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia tests pre-DDU. Post-DDU,
   gonorrhea test rates increased significantly among HIV-negative MSM,
   with modest and nonsignificant increasing rates of HIV, syphilis, and
   chlamydia testing. Among HIV-positive MSM, no change in gonorrhea or
   chlamydia testing occurred and syphilis testing declined significantly.
   Conclusions Increasing HIV/STI testing trends among MSM occurred pre-
   and post-DDU, coinciding with other plausible drivers of testing. Modest
   changes in HIV testing post-DDU suggest that structural changes to
   improve testing access may need to occur alongside health promotion to
   increase testing frequency.}},

Abstract = {{A two-dimensional auxetic lattice structure was fabricated from a PZT

   electric field perpendicular to the lattice plane were analyzed by a 2D
   image data detection analysis. The auxetic lattice structure exhibits
   orthotropic deformation behavior with a negative in-plane Poisson's
   ratio of -2.05. Compared to PZT bulk material the piezoelectric auxetic
   lattice revealed a strain amplification by a factor of 30-70. Effective
   transversal coupling coefficients d(31)(al) of the PZT lattice exceeding
   4 x 10(3) pm V-1 were determined which result in an effective
   hydrostatic coefficient d(h)(al) 66 times larger than that of bulk PZT.}},

Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{135}},
Pages = {{339-352}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Sandwich panels composed of auxetic cellular cores and metal facets are
   presented for blast resistance applications. The performance of this
   hybrid composite structure under impulsive loading is numerically
   studied, taking into account the rate-dependent effects. The Johnson
   Cook law is used to model the behaviours of composite materials at high
   strain rates. Parametric analyses are performed to evaluate the
   performances of different designs of composite panels and compared with
   equivalent monolithic panels of identical areal masses in terms of
   deformations and dissipated plastic energy of the metal facets and
   auxetic crushable cores. Various design parameters are considered,
   including the auxetic unit cell effective Poisson's ratio, material
   properties, thickness of facet, and diameter of the unit cell truss
   member. To reduce the computational time, a quarter of the panel is
   modelled with shell elements for the facets and beam elements for the
   core. In blast events, auxetic composite panels are found to effectively
   absorb double the amount of impulsive energy via plastic deformation,
   and reduce up to 70\% of the back facet's maximum velocity when compared
   with monolithic ones. The maximum back facet displacement is also
   noticeably reduced by up to 30\% due to the densification and plastic
   deformation of the auxetic cores. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{111}},
Pages = {{322-327}},

Abstract = {{Elastic simulations of single-crystal copper nanobeams, of different
   cross section sizes and with crystal-lographic orientations {[}100] and
   {[}110] along their length directions, have been performed applying
   tensile mechanical loading. The molecular dynamics code LAMMPS was
   employed for the simulations. The Poisson's ratio, which is one of the
   fundamental measures of the elastic deformation behavior of materials,
   has been determined. In this paper we present numerical evidence that
   the Poisson's ratio of nanobeams loaded by finite strains varies with
   both size and crystallographic orientation. In particular, we provide
   numerical evidence for that, of the two Poisson's ratio that naturally
   can be defined for nanobeams loaded in the {[}110]-direction, one is
   negative whereas the other one remains almost constant, irrespective of
   applied strain. We also show that for nanobeams loaded in the
   {[}100]-direction the values of Poisson's ratio initially decrease,
   reaches a minimum and thereafter increase with applied strain. For the
   smallest {[}100] cross sections the Poisson's ratios are initially
   negative, but turn positive at larger strains. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {{Design of auxetic sandwich panel faceplates comprising cellular networks
   with high stiffness and negative Poisson's ratio}},
Journal = {{ADVANCED COMPOSITE MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{175-196}},
Month = {{DEC 31}},
Abstract = {{In the present work, a novel design is presented for producing auxetic
   laminated faceplates for structures that contain auxetic cores in order
   to produce fully auxetic sandwich structures. The design is based on the
   use of periodic cellular networks that are embedded in a
   fibre-reinforced polymer matrix. These networks have a high in-plane
   negative Poisson's ratio and a high in-plane stiffness. Two auxetic
   networks were chosen for this purpose: a classical re-entrant hexagonal
   network and an anti-tetra chiral auxetic network. The finite elements
   method was used to model the auxetic network and the faceplate. For the
   auxetic network, the relative modulus (E-s/E-m) was investigated to
   determine its effect on the behaviour of the faceplate. The auxetic
   behaviour of the faceplate occurs when the auxetic network has a high
   relative modulus. For example, for a classical re-entrant hexagonal
   network faceplate, the auxetic behaviour starts to appear when
   E-s/E-m>33, while for an anti-tetra chiral auxetic network faceplate,
   the auxetic behaviour starts to appear when E-s/E-m>24. Analytical
   expressions for the elastic constants of the faceplates were developed
   using the representative volume element model (RVE) and a semi-empirical
   formula of the rule of mixtures (ROMs). The results of the analytical
   expressions were compared with the finite elements results for various
   values of the relative density parameter rho({*}). The relative density
   had a significant effect on the elastic constants of the faceplate. The
   model produced with the representative volume element method had higher
   values for the elastic constants than did that created with the finite
   elements model, but the semi-empirical rule of mixtures gave more
   accurate results for both types of faceplates. A modified design for the
   classical re-entrant hexagonal network that increases the in-plane
   stiffness of the auxetic network is presented since it has been found
   that it plays a major role in producing a high negative Poisson's ratio.
   The modified networks are an oval re-entered and a stiffened re-entered
   network. Experiments were carried out on the oval re-entered faceplates
   to obtain the in-plane moduli and the Poisson's ratios. The tested
   faceplate samples clearly showed auxetic behaviour. A good agreement
   between the finite elements results and the experimental data was
   obtained.}},

Title = {{Ground state of bilayer h alpha-silica: mechanical and electronic

Abstract = {{The family of two-dimensional (2D) crystals was recently joined by
   silica, one of the most abundant resources on earth. So far two
   different polymorphs of this material, namely a tetrahedra-shaped
   monolayer and a fully saturated bilayer structure, have been synthesized
   on various metal substrates and their fascinating properties enable 2D
   silica to hold promise in nanoelectronic device applications. In this
   paper a new ground state of bilayer-AAr-stacking ha-silica-has been
   discovered by first principles calculations. The new structure is
   featured with a formation of Si-Si bonds between all sp(3) hybridized
   SiO3 triangular pyramids, lying respectively in different silica layers,
   with an intrinsic rotational angle of about 12.5 degrees along the
   out-of-plane Si-Si bond. Due to the doubled number of Si-Si bonds in the
   new structure, the system energy is lowered by nearly three times more
   than that reported recently in literature (0.8 eV) (Ozcelik et al 2014
   Phys. Rev. Lett. 112 246803), when compared with the single layer
   ha-silica. A mechanical property investigation shows that the
   AAr-stacking bilayer ha-silica possesses high in-plane stiffness and a
   negative Poisson's ratio, which stems from the intrinsic rotational
   angle of the SiO3 triangular pyramids. Strikingly, the negative
   Poisson's ratio evolves into positive at a critical tensile strain
   epsilon approximate to 1.2\%. Such negative-to-positive evolvement is
   associated with the adaptation of the rotational angle to the applied
   strain and the structure transition into the nearby valley of the energy
   landscape. The detailed transition process has been thoroughly analyzed.
   The electronic properties of the new ground state are also calculated,
   along with their response to the external strain. Our new ground state
   structure introduces a new member to the family of 2D bilayer silica
   materials and is expected to facilitate experimental studies identifying
   the related structures and exploring further physical and chemical
   properties of nanoscale systems.}},

Abstract = {{Most conventional materials expand in transverse directions when they
   are compressed uniaxially resulting in the familiar positive Poisson's
   ratio. Here we develop a new class of two dimensional (2D) metamaterials
   with negative Poisson's ratio that contract in transverse directions
   under uniaxial compressive loads leading to auxeticity. This is achieved
   through mechanical instabilities (i.e., buckling) introduced by
   structural hierarchy and retained over a wide range of applied
   compression. This unusual behavior is demonstrated experimentally and
   analyzed computationally. The work provides new insights into the role
   of structural organization and hierarchy in designing 2D auxetic
   metamaterials, and new opportunities for developing energy absorbing
   materials, tunable membrane filters, and acoustic dampeners.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{DEC 16}},
Abstract = {{In this study, we report a novel periodic material with negative
   Poisson's ratio (also called auxetic materials) fabricated by denting
   spherical dimples in an elastic flat sheet. While previously reported
   auxetic materials are either porous or comprise at least two phases, the
   material proposed here is nonporous and made of a homogeneous elastic
   sheet. Importantly, the auxetic behavior is induced by a novel mechanism
   which exploits the out-of-plane deformation of the spherical dimples.
   Through a combination of experiments and numerical analyses, we
   demonstrate the robustness of the proposed concept, paving the way for
   developing a new class of auxetic materials that significantly expand
   their design space and possible applications.}},

   foundations}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITES PART B-ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{83}},

Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Thermo-mechanical buckling analysis of the orthotropic auxetic plates
   (with negative Poisson ratios) has not been performed so far,
   especially, in the hygrothermal environments. The complexity increases
   when the auxetic plate is fabricated from functionally graded
   orthotropic materials and surrounded by an elastic foundation. The
   aforementioned analyses are carried out in the present research, for the
   first time. The buckling loads may be uniaxial or biaxial ones.
   Moreover, temperature and moisture dependent material properties are
   considered. The pre-buckling effects are also considered in the paper.
   The high-order shear-deformation governing differential equations are
   solved based on a new differential quadrature method (DQM). The
   resulting solution may cover many practical simpler applications. A
   comprehensive parametric study is accomplished for a wide range of
   geometric and material properties parameters and various boundary
   conditions. Results reveal that the hygrothermal conditions lead to
   degradations in the material properties and buckling strengths,
   especially for higher gradation exponents, the elastic foundation may
   enhance the buckling behavior through monitoring the buckling pattern,
   the buckling load decreases as the orthotropy angle increases, and the
   auxeticity has reduced the buckling strength for the employed material
   and environmental information. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   monolayer, it is found that the static permittivity, besides acquiring a
   dependence on the interlayer distance, is comparatively higher than in
   the 3D system. In contrast, it is found that elastic properties are
   little changed by the lower dimensionality. Poisson ratios relating
   in-plane deformations are close to zero, and the existence of a negative
   Poisson ratio is also predicted for the GeS compound. Finally, the
   monolayer shows piezoelectricity, with piezoelectric constants higher
   than those recently predicted to occur in other 2D systems, such as
   hexagonal BN and transition-metal dichalcogenide monolayers.}},

Title = {{First-principles studies on the properties of Cu2ZnSnS4 grain-boundaries
   due to photovoltaic effect}},
Journal = {{ACTA PHYSICA SINICA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{64}},

Abstract = {{Microstructures and electronic structures of Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS)
   grain-boundaries (GB) are studied by the first-principles electronic
   structure method. Some special twist grain-boundaries have low
   grain-boundary energies and exhibit similar electronic structure as that
   in a perfect crystal. The twist grain-boundaries such as Sigma 3{[}221]
   and Sigma 6{[}221] have grain-boundary planes parallel to (112) plane,
   the easiest cleavage plane, so that they have small damages to the
   crystal structure and small influence on the properties of the
   materials. Grain-boundary plays two roles in CZTS thin-films: (1)
   capturing and trapping holes from p-n junctions, and (2) providing fast
   channels for transportation of majority carriers. As the majority of
   carriers, the positively charged holes need override a barrier before
   being trapped by a potential-well in the grain-boundary region. For the
   minority of carriers, the grain boundary is a high barrier to prevent
   electrons from transporting across it. The intrinsic nature of the
   potential barrier is not very clear. By calculating the distributions of
   static potentials across different grain boundaries of CZTS and also by
   comparing them with those across different surfaces, we find that the
   potential barriers at grain boundaries are the remnants of the potential
   barriers of surfaces, which trap the electrons in the bulk and prevent
   the electrons from escaping from the bulk to vacuum. When two surfaces
   get contact to form a grain boundary the corresponding surface barriers
   will be merged together as one potential barrier of the grain boundary.
   It is obvious that if a grain boundary intersects with the surface, the
   escaping work function near the grain boundary is lower than that near
   the prefect crystal surface. Experiment shows the coexistence of Sn4+
   and Sn2+ ions. The Sn4+ ions are located in the bulk by bonding 4 S
   atoms as neighbors. Our results show that Sn2+ ions can appear in the
   grain-boundary regions, on the surfaces or in the bulk with lattice
   defects so that Sn2+ ions have the lower coordination number by bonding
   3 S atoms. The Sn atom is favored to be at the center of S octahedron
   with six neighboring S (or O) atoms in most sulfides (oxides) of tin. In
   CZTS, Sn atom is at the center of tetrahedron with 4 neighboring S atoms
   so that Sn atom is very active to move by structural relaxations. Most
   importantly the conduction-bands in CZTS are formed by the
   hybridizations between the s electrons of Sn and p electrons of S so
   that the conduction-bands of CZTS are sensitively dependent on the
   distributions and properties of Sn atoms. The appearing of Sn2+ ions and
   the strong structural relaxations of Sn atoms in grain-boundary regions
   and on surfaces induce extra in-gap states as a new source for the
   recombination of electron-hole pairs that are un-favored to the
   photo-voltage effects. Generally, the grain boundary plays a negative
   role in brittle photo-voltage materials such as Si and GaAs, and the
   positive role in ductile photo-voltage materials such as CdTe and CIGS
   (Cu(InGa)Se-2). It means that the growth of the hard and brittle films
   is very difficult, the micro-cracks and micro-pores are easily created.
   Our calculations show that CdTe, CIGS and CZTS are all ductile with
   Poisson-ratio greater than 0.33. This means that CZTS can be used as the
   absorber of flexible solar cell.
   By comparing the optical absorption-coefficients of crystals,
   grain-boundaries, surfaces and nano-particles, we find that the internal
   surfaces in thin-films with high pore-ratio can create new energy-levels
   in band-gap, which enhances the recombination between electrons and
   holes and decreases the optical absorption-coefficients (>1.3 eV). As a
   result, the high dense CZTS thin-film is required for high-efficient
   CZTS solar-cell. The positive role of grain boundary is more important
   if the CZTS film has the large, unique oriented grains and the uniform
   distribution of grain sizes. The simple and regular grain-boundary
   network is more beneficial to the coherent transport of majority
   carriers.}},

Abstract = {{The linearized Poisson-Boltzmann (L-PB) equation is examined for its
   -range of validity (, Debye reciprocal length). This is done for the
   Debye-Huckel (DH) theory, i.e., using a single ion size, and for the SiS
   treatment (D. Fraenkel, Mol. Phys. 2010, 108, 1435), which extends the
   DH theory to the case of ion-size dissimilarity (therefore dubbed
   DH-SiS). The linearization of the PB equation has been claimed
   responsible for the DH theory's failure to fit with experiment at>0.1 m;
   but DH-SiS fits with data of the mean ionic activity coefficient, (+/-)
   (molal), against m, even at m>1 (>0.33 angstrom(-1)). The SiS
   expressions combine the overall extra-electrostatic potential energy of
   the smaller ion, as central ion(a>b)(), with that of the larger ion, as
   central ion(b>a)(); a and b are, respectively, the counterion and co-ion
   distances of closest approach. (a>b) and (b>a) are derived from the L-PB
   equation, which appears to conflict with their being effective up to
   moderate electrolyte concentrations (approximate to 1 m). However, the
   L-PB equation can be valid up to 1.3 angstrom(-1) if one abandons the 1/
   criterion for its effectiveness and, instead, use, as criterion, the
   mean-field electrostatic interaction potential of the central ion with
   its ion cloud, at a radial distance dividing the cloud charge into two
   equal parts. The DH theory's failure is, thus, not because of using the
   L-PB equation; the lethal approximation is assigning a single size to
   the positive and negative ions. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Title = {{A novel impact hardening polymer with negative Poisson's ratio for
   impact protection}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS TODAY COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Pages = {{50-59}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Although lots of impact protective materials reported exhibited better
   impact protective performance thanking to their excellent mechanical
   performance, their applications were still seriously impeded due to
   absence of soft-stiffness switch smartness. Herein, a novel impact
   hardening polymer (IHP) with negative Poisson's ratio was synthesized
   via a condensation polymerization, followed by a simple thermal
   annealing to achieve a perfect soft-stiffness switch characteristic and
   self-healing capacity. Its soft-stiffness switch ability sigma, defined
   as G'(max)/G'(min) in rheological analysis, can reach 9000, which is
   never reported so far. The result of laser speckle scatter measurement
   elucidates that IHP has negative Poisson's ratio, which is the root
   cause why IHP exhibits soft-stiffness switch capacity. Finally, 3D
   composite anti-impact fabrics were prepared by dip-coating IHP
   dispersion onto a 3D porous polyester fabric. Not only the impact
   protective performance of anti-impact fabrics finished with the IHP is
   significantly improved, but also the flexibility and hand feeling of
   anti-impact fabrics finished with the IHP are obviously very good
   because the IHP is flexible without impact. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Among the options to control Alabama argillacea (Hubner, 1818) and
   Heliothis virescens (Fabricius, 1781) on cotton, insecticide spraying
   and biological control have been extensively used. The GM `Bt' cotton
   has been introduced as an extremely viable alternative, but it is yet
   not known how transgenic plants affect populations of organisms that are
   interrelated in an agroecosystem. For this reason, it is important to
   know how the spatial arrangement of pests and beneficial insect are
   affected, which may call for changes in the methods used for sampling
   these species. This study was conducted with the goal to investigate the
   pattern of spatial distribution of eggs of A. argillacea and H.
   virescens in DeltaOpal (TM) (non-Bt) and DP90B (TM) Bt cotton cultivars.
   Data were collected during the agricultural year 2006/2007 in two areas
   of 5,000 m(2), located in in the district of Nova America, Caarapo
   municipality. In each sampling area, comprising 100 plots of 50 m(2), 15
   evaluations were performed on two plants per plot. The sampling
   consisted in counting the eggs. The aggregation index (variance/mean
   ratio, Morisita index and exponent k of the negative binomial
   distribution) and chi-square fit of the observed and expected values to
   the theoretical frequency distribution (Poisson, Binomial and Negative
   Binomial Positive), showed that in both cultivars, the eggs of these
   species are distributed according to the aggregate distribution model,
   fitting the pattern of negative binomial distribution.}},

   understand and predict the self-folding abilities of weft knit textiles.
   A wide range of self-folding weft knit structures was produced, and
   relationships between the angles and ratios of the knit and purl stitch
   types were determined. Mechanical testing was used as a means to
   characterize differences produced by stitch patterns, and to further
   understand the relationships between angles and folding abilities. By
   defining a formulaic method for predicting the nature of the folds that
   occur due to stitch architecture patterns, we can better design
   self-folding fabrics for smart textile applications.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Thanks to the presence of a transverse magnetic flux density (B-x and
   B-y where z is the extraction axis), the undesired extraction of
   electrons from a negative ion source is reduced and it is due to
   collisions. The electron transport is studied with a kinetic model,
   including Vlasov-Poisson effects and atomic collisions. The
   integrodifferential equations (IDE) resulting from a reduction to a
   one-dimensional problem (1-D) by integration on characteristic orbits
   are strongly affected by the trapped orbits, as here evaluated; a kernel
   calculation with a partial wave approximation is introduced.
   Dependencies from the local drift velocity v(d) and effective Larmor
   radius L-e are found. Solutions are investigated in simple cases with a
   constant electron current (no additional electron production).
   Equilibrium solution and electron conductivity are analytically
   obtained. Presheath solutions are discussed; the approximated conversion
   to differential equations that are adequate for presheath only (with
   moderated electric field gradient E-z,E-z > -eB(x)(2)/m) and their
   numeric solutions coupled to Poisson equation are reported, and compared
   to iterative IDE solutions. Examples with different values of L-e and

   foraging behavior of mesocarnivores in these human-created habitats. We
   assessed how differences in prey abundance between native forests and
   exotic plantations in southern Chile may explain the prey selection of
   four mesocarnivores, as analyzed from their scats. Using a spatial
   zero-inflated Poisson model, we determined that the abundance of most
   small mammals was lower in plantations than native forests, except for
   three common species, which had similar or larger abundances in exotic
   plantations. We assessed mesocarnivores' prey selection by assessing the
   coefficients and log-ratios of use and availability of a Bayesian
   Resource Selection Function. We determined that in native forest, the
   preferences of kodkod (Leopardus guigna) for arboreal prey was stronger,
   whereas chilla fox (Pseudalopex griseus) and Darwin's fox (Pseudalopex
   fuhdpes) exhibited a selective preference for ground prey. Darwin's fox
   also exhibited a habitat-dependent changes in their selection for
   Darwin's leaf-eared mouse (Phyllotis darwini), from a positive log ratio
   in native forest to a negative ratio in exotic plantations. Conversely,
   culpeo fox (Pseudalopex culpaeus) selected long-tailed colilargo
   (Oligoriaomys longicaudatus) and Chilean climbing mouse (Irenomys
   tarsalis) in plantations only, even though these prey were more abundant
   in native forests. Although mature commercial forest plantations may
   provide feeding grounds for mesocarnivores, depending on their
   species-specific ability to capture available prey, the decline of small
   mammal availability in plantations may modify the prey selection of
   mesocarnivores. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In global Earth models such as the preliminary reference Earth model
   (PREM), seismic attenuation is dominated by shear friction, which is
   expressed by the relation Q(K) >> Q(mu) between the bulk and shear Q
   factors. Weak bulk attenuation appears to be one of the most general
   observations for Earth materials, which is often used as an assumption
   for building attenuation models. Nevertheless, we consider three
   observations suggesting that Q(K) may generally be comparable to or
   below Q(mu). First, shear-dominated dissipation is a stringent limit
   requiring ``auxetic{''} behavior of materials in respect to internal
   friction, that is, analogous to elastic materials with extreme negative
   Poisson's ratios. Although possible, auxetic behavior is extremely rare
   in elasticity, and it is unlikely that it is common for internal
   friction. To avoid pervasive auxetic effects, the quality factors should
   generally satisfy Q(K) < 3: 6Q(mu). Second, the relation between Q(K)
   and Q(mu) may depend on the wave modes in which these quantities are
   measured. Knopoff (1964) observed that in mantle surface waves, Q(K) may
   be lower than Q(S) despite Q(K) >> Q(mu) in free oscillations. Third,
   many observations and micromechanics-based models of Q(K) exist,
   particularly for rock containing grains, fractures, pores, and fluids.
   Almost all of these models show Q(K) values comparable to or below Q(mu)
   within the seismic frequency band. Thus, seismic attenuation is broadly
   variable and likely not shear dominated. The relation Q(K) >> Q(mu)
   inverted for the whole Earth could be caused by the use of a constant-Q
   parameterization, whereas the Q(S) can be strongly frequency dependent
   for free oscillations. In addition, key mechanisms of anelasticity
   (nonlinear viscosity, grain-boundary sliding, effects of partial melts)
   are not of viscoelastic type and cannot be accurately described by Q
   factors.}},

Abstract = {{In the present work, two new designs of honeycomb structures were
   presented based on the basic re-entrant structure namely,
   splined-reentrant and stiffened-reentrant honeycombs. The new structures
   were designed in order to enhance the in-plane stiffness and maintaining
   the auxetic behavior of the structure. In this study, finite elements
   modeling and experimental work were carried out to evaluate the in-plane
   properties of the new designs. The effect of the geometrical parameters
   such as rib length and rib thickness of the unit cell of the new designs
   on the in-plane properties was investigated. Finite elements results
   showed that the in-plane stiffness of the new designs was improved
   significantly compared to the basic re-entrant structure. Also, the
   stiffened-reentrant structure showed better enhancement of the stiffness
   than the splined-reentrant structure. For example the modulus of
   elasticity of the stiffened-reentrant structure exceeds 16x that of the
   basic re-entrant structure in x-direction and was over two times in the
   y-direction with lower values of the negative Poisson's ratio.
   Compression tests were carried on honeycomb samples made of steel using
   laser cutting technique with different geometrical parameters. Test
   results for the three designs were compared with the finite element
   results and they were in a good agreement.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{249}},
Pages = {{51-58}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{We analyzed hundreds of P-wave receiver function data recorded by 53
   portable seismic stations to investigate the crustal structure beneath
   the NE Tibetan plateau. The Moho depths identified by this study reveal
   that the crustal thickness decreases laterally from the Qilian Orogen
   (similar to 63 km) to east Kunlun fault (EKLF) area (similar to 44 km).
   The Moho depth becomes obviously deeper northeast of Songpan-Ganzi
   terrane and beneath the Qilian Orogen. A remarkable contrast is observed
   in the measured Poisson's ratio between the Qilian Orogen and EKLF area.
   The Qilian Orogen is characterized by lower Poisson's ratio. In general,
   the higher Poisson's ratios (v > 0.30) in the EKLF area can be
   considered as the evidence for dominantly mafic rocks in the crust. The
   measured low Poisson's ratio and the negative correlations between
   V-p/V-s and the crustal thickness beneath the Qilian Orogen suggest
   dominantly felsic crust beneath the Qilian Orogen, which is in contrast
   with the mid-to-lower low-velocity crustal model beneath the NE margin
   of the Tibetan plateau indicating that the low velocity zone terminates
   beneath the east Kunlun area. The seismic evidence suggests that the
   thickened crust is probably resulted from superposition of the
   successive intracrustal thrusts. Our results reveal the lateral
   inhomogeneity of crustal structure in this area and are inconsistent
   with the scenario of an inflated crust due to extrusion of lower crust
   material from the central Tibetan plateau. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{This paper presents a comparative study on the size optimization of four
   mesostructures to meet the design requirements for a nonpneumatic tire's
   (NPT) shear beam with 10\% shear flexure (SF) at 10 MPa effective shear
   modulus. The need for such comparison is motivated from the previous
   research wherein a systematic design method is proposed to design a
   mesostructure with high SF by studying the strain energy distribution
   pattern in honeycomb, auxetic, and sinusoidal auxetic mesostructure.
   Based upon the distribution pattern, a new type of mesostructure termed
   S-type is invented. Although it exhibited higher SF than the other
   mesostructures for a comparable set of geometry, it is not possible to
   validate the design method without exploring the complete design space
   of both existing and newly invented mesostructures. In order to address
   this limitation, these four mesostructures are optimized using the
   following optimization algorithms: (i) particle swarm; (ii) genetic
   algorithm (GA); and (iii) FAST-SIMPLEX (using response surface method).
   The results show the S-type mesostructure can be configured to meet the
   design requirements, thereby validating the design method presented in
   previous research. Additionally, it is also observed that auxetic
   mesostructure is only 5\% less than the required design target, which
   presents an opportunity in future, to develop an alternate design method
   to maximize SF other than the one that is being validated in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{This paper evaluates the effect of auxeticity on the extent of shear
   deformation in isotropic beams. It is herein shown that the ratio of
   maximum deflection by Timoshenko theory to the maximum deflection by the
   Euler-Bernoulli theory reduces as the Poisson's ratio of the beam
   material becomes more negative. The obtained results suggest that the
   ratio of shear deformation to bending deformation is lower in auxetic
   beams than in conventional beams, and that the use of Euler-Bernoulli
   beam theory for quantifying the deflection in auxetic beams gives lesser
   deviation from the Timoshenko beam theory than in conventional beams.
   Specifically, the shear deformation becomes insignificant for square
   beams with Poisson's ratio of -1. A set of design equations that allows
   the use of simpler Euler-Bernoulli beam theory instead of the Timoshenko
   beam theory for the considered cases are proposed herein to justify the
   use of the former theory on beam analysis on the basis of reduced shear
   deformation as the beam's Poisson's ratio becomes more negative. The
   findings obtained herein also suggest that in comparison with
   conventional beams (of equal Young's modulus, load distributions, and
   boundary conditions) the lower shear deformation in auxetic beams
   translates into smaller transverse deflections and hence better
   dimensional stability.}},

   coefficients in Voight notation and the parameters of crystal
   orientation. Numerical calculations are performed using these formulas
   and data on the elastic constants from the Landolt-Bornstein Handbook.
   Possible types of Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio are analyzed. More
   than eighty tetragonal crystals were studied. About 60\% of them are
   characterized by negative Poisson's ratio for certain particular
   orientations of the crystals. Such auxetics are listed in the Tables.
   Ten crystals can have Poisson's ratio greater than unity, and Poisson's
   ratio for six crystals is less than -0.5. The same six crystals are
   characterized by high variability of Young's modulus. Young's modulus
   for more than ten crystals exceeds 300 GPa.}},

Abstract = {{The Phase I applications of the statistical profile monitoring have
   recently been extended to the case when the response variable is binary.
   We are motivated to undertake the current research in an attempt to try
   to provide a unified framework for the Phase I control in the context of
   statistical profile monitoring that can be used to tackle a large class
   of response variables, such as continuous, count, or categorical
   response variables. The unified framework is essentially based on
   applying the change point model to the class of generalized linear
   models. The proposed Phase I control chart is assessed and compared with
   the existing charts under binomial and Poisson profiles. Some diagnostic
   procedures are also discussed. A real data set obtained from a test lab
   concerning the dispersion of carbon black filler in a rubber mix is used
   to demonstrate how the proposed chart can be used in practical
   applications. Some future research directions are also discussed.

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Although various hybrid 3D carbon-based architectures are reported by
   covalently connecting low dimensional carbon allotropes, the effect of
   junction configuration on deformation and mechanical properties of the
   hybrid carbon architectures remain elusive. Here, we focus on Pillared
   Graphene Nanostructure (PGN) as a model system with symmetric and
   asymmetric junctions to explore its diverse elastic and inelastic
   properties via first-principles and molecular dynamics simulations. By
   introducing heptagonal and octagonal rings in the junctions, our
   findings demonstrate that in contrast to the stacked of graphene sheets,
   which exhibit weak out-of-plane properties, both junction types impart a
   cooperative two-regime deformation mechanism that provides a number of
   superior characteristics in PGN, including 3D balance of strength and
   toughness as well as an outstanding similar to 42\% out-of-plane
   ductility preceding the failure. Furthermore, asymmetric junctions
   impose wrinkles in the PGN sheets, which add extra in-plane flexibility
   and shear compliance, result in a nearly zero/negative in-plane
   Poisson's ratio in PGN, and cause the octagonal rings to act as hotspot
   for initiating of fracture. Our results provide the first atomistic
   ``lens{''} on fundamental understanding of junction-induced deformation
   mechanisms in pillared graphene and can potentially provide a new phase
   space to better control and design mechano-mutable hybrid carbon
   nanostructures. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Large-scale carbon nanotube (CNT) films fabricated by floating catalyst
   chemical vapor deposition (FCCVD) are promising reinforcement materials
   for high performance composites. However, little research has been
   reported on the four independent in-plane engineering constants of FCCVD
   CNT films, which are essential for understanding and prediction of
   mechanical behavior of FCCVD CNT film-based structures. The tensile
   strength in CNT-oriented direction is 127 MPa and the tensile modulus in
   oriented and transverse directions are 3.0 and 0.3 GPa, respectively.
   These mechanical properties are mainly attributed to the as-grown
   CNT-to-CNT contacts in the films. The Poisson's ratio in the oriented
   direction at 5 \% strain is 0.75. A negative Poisson's ratio of -0.99 is
   observed at 0.1 \% strain in CNT-oriented direction. The in-plane shear
   modulus is 0.57 GPa, which is derived from the coordinate transformation
   between the on-axis and 45A degrees off-axis compliance matrices. The
   in-situ scanning electron microscopy is adopted to observe the
   microstructure at different tensile strains. During the tensile testing,
   the reorientation of CNT bundles in CNT film is evaluated by numerical
   image processing and Raman spectroscopy.}},

Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{We propose compliant cellular material (CCM), a mechanical metamaterial,
   with compliant porous structure (CPS) generated from a modified
   hexagonal topology. The objective of this study is to explore the
   synthesis of three-dimensional (3D) CCMs with CPSes and to understand
   the mechanical behaviors of CCMs. An orthotropic constitutive model of
   CCMs is constructed using the strain energy method, which uses the
   deformation of hinges around holes and rotation of links. Nonlinear
   behavior of a finite element (FE) based simulation is conducted to
   validate the analytical model. The moduli and yield strains of the 3D
   CCMs with an aluminum alloy are about 1.2 GPa and 0.4\% in the
   longitudinal direction and about 0.08 MPa and 30\% in the lateral
   direction. The CCMs have extremely high positive and negative Poisson's
   ratios (v(xy){*} similar to +/- 30) due to the large rotation of the
   link member in the transverse direction caused by an input displacement
   in the longitudinal direction. This paper demonstrates that compliant
   mesostructures can be used for next generation's mechanical
   metamaterials design in tailoring mechanical properties such as modulus,
   strength, yield strain, and Poisson's ratios. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In the present paper, distributions of lateral deflections and in-plane
   normal and transverse shear stresses of circular/annular sandwich plates
   with orthotropic composite face sheets and auxetic (with negative
   Poisson's ratio) cores are determined, for the first time, employing a
   zigzag theory whose results are corrected based on the three-dimensional
   theory of elasticity. The governing equations are developed based on the
   principle of minimum total potential energy and solved using a
   differential transform whose center is located at the outer radius of
   the plate. A comprehensive parametric study including evaluation of
   effects of various geometric and material parameters, lamination
   schemes, and boundary conditions is accomplished. Accuracy of the
   results is verified by results of the 3D theory of elasticity extracted
   from the ABAQUS code. Results reveal that the core auxeticity increases
   the rigidity of the soft core drastically and consequently, decreases
   the lateral deflection of the plate and moderates the interfacial jumps
   in the through-thickness distribution of the transverse shear stress, so
   that a semi-continuous parabolic distribution may be established. The
   core auxeticity may considerably reduce the maximum radial stresses of
   the face sheets and influence of the auxeticity is more remarkable for
   plates with more rigid constructions or boundary conditions. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The work describes a structural composite damper concept based on a
   chiral auxetic configuration. Chiral structures couple uniaxial and
   rotational deformations to provide a negative Poisson's ratio behaviour
   and high dissipation through shear strain energy, and this feature is
   exploited by up-scaling the deformation mechanism of the chiral cell to
   design a damper that dissipates energy in the edgewise/shear modes, like
   the ones occurring in wind turbine blades. The damper concept and its
   configuration are evaluated through a series of Finite Element
   parametric and probabilistic models. A small-scale demonstrator is
   manufactured and subjected to compressive cyclic loading at increasing
   maximum displacements. Good agreement between the numerical and
   experimental force displacement and energy dissipated-displacement
   curves is observed, showing the feasibility of the chiral composite
   damper concept for vibration damping-related applications at low
   frequencies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper the influence of out-of-plane ply waviness on elastic
   properties of composite laminates subjected to uniaxial loading is
   investigated. A three-dimensional analytical method based on the
   classical lamination theory is developed to quantitatively determine the
   effective elastic constants of thick composite laminates with ply
   waviness. Various influential factors associated with ply waviness, such
   as the waviness geometry, the off-axis angle, the extent of wavy region,
   and the waviness pattern, are incorporated in the multi-parameter model.
   Analytical results for the Young's moduli, the shear moduli and the
   Poisson's ratios of wavy fiber composite laminates are obtained and
   discussed for a specific range of fiber volume fractions and two
   different lay-ups. Negative Poisson's ratios are found for
   unidirectional laminates nested wavy ply/plies. The present method
   provides a useful and effective tool to evaluate the effects of
   out-of-plane ply waviness on three-dimensional elastic properties of
   composite laminates. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: The aim of this study was to explore factors associated with
   the perceived availability of, and reported participation in workplace
   health promotion activities implemented in the Tasmanian State Service,
   Australia. Methods: Data from 3228 employees were collected in 2013 on
   sociodemographic and work characteristics, health-related behaviors, and
   employee-reported availability of and participation in health-related
   activities. Ratios of prevalence for reported availability and
   participation by each factor were estimated using negative binomial
   regression (availability) and Poisson regression (participation).
   Results: Significant differences in availability of different activity
   types were found for numerous factors. Compared with the reference
   categories, only administrative staff or respondents reporting any
   leisure-time physical activity were more likely to participate, and
   smokers and respondents with variable work schedules or cardiometabolic
   conditions were less likely. Conclusions: Employees with suboptimal
   health-related factors were less likely to engage with activities
   offered through this comprehensive workplace health promotion
   initiative.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Uganda has an unmet need for family planning of 34\% and a
   total fertility rate of 6.2. We assessed the desire for female
   sterilization among sexually active women who wanted to stop
   childbearing in rural Rakai district, Uganda.
   Study design: 7192 sexually active women enrolled in a community cohort
   between 2002 and 2008 were asked about fertility intentions. Those
   stating that they did not want another child (limiters) were asked
   whether they would be willing to accept female sterilization, if
   available. Trends in desire for sterilization were determined by
   chi-square test for trend, and Modified Poisson regression was used to
   estimate prevalence rate ratios and 95\% confidence intervals of the
   associations between desire for sterilization and socio-demographic
   characteristics and HIV status.
   Results: From 2002 to 2008, the proportion of limiters dropped (from
   47.2\% to 43.7\%; p<.01). Use of pills and injectables among limiters
   significantly increased, 38.9\% to 50.3\% (p<.0001), while use of
   intrauterine devices and implants declined from 3.3\% to 1.7\%
   (p<0.001). The desire for sterilization significantly increased from
   54.2\% to 63.1\% (p<0.0001), and this was consistently higher among the
   HIV-positive (63.6-70.9\%, p<0.01) than HIV-negative women (53.3-61.2\%,
   p<0.0001). Factors significantly associated with the desire for
   sterilization included higher number of living children (> = 3), being
   HIV-infected and having received HIV counseling and testing.
   Conclusion: There is latent and growing desire for sterilization in this
   population. Our findings suggest a need to increase permanent
   contraception services for women who want to limit childbearing in this
   setting. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the throughput for wireless network with
   full-duplex radios using stochastic geometry. Fullduplex (FD) radios can
   exchange data simultaneously with each other. On the other hand, the
   downside of FD transmission is that it will inevitably cause extra
   interference to the network compared to half-duplex (HD) transmission.
   Moreover, the residual self-interference has negative effects on the
   network throughput. In this paper, we focus on a wireless network of
   nodes with both HD and FD capabilities and derive and optimize the
   throughput in such a network. Our analytical result shows that if the
   network is adopting an ALOHA protocol, the maximal throughput is
   achieved by scheduling all concurrently transmitting nodes to work in
   either FD mode or HD mode depending on one simple condition. Moreover,
   the effects of imperfect self-interference cancellation on the
   signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) loss and throughput are also analyzed
   based on our mathematical model. We rigorously quantify the impact of
   imperfect self-interference cancellation on the throughput gain,
   transmission range, and other metrics, and we establish the minimum
   amount of self-interference suppression needed for FD to be beneficial.}},

Abstract = {{By carrying out triaxial unloading test under different stress paths on
   rock, the complete stress-strain curves, deformation characteristics and
   its strength criterion are studied. The test results show that the
   relation between lateral strain and confining pressure firstly is
   linear, and then is nonlinear in the total stage of unloading confining
   pressure. And its growth rate is about 3 to 5 times the growth rate of
   the axial strain. It shows obvious lateral dilatancy, and the degree of
   dilatancy is related to the unloading path. According to the area that
   is enclosed by confining pressure and volumetric strain curve, it can be
   seen that the greater the confining pressure is before unloading, the
   more the energy releases. Deformation modulus decreases gradually with
   the unloading confining pressure, and increases with the initial
   confining pressure; the relation between deformation modulus and
   confining pressure shows negative exponential distribution overall. At
   the same unloading paths, the reduction of the deformation modulus
   increases with the increase of initial confining pressure. The Poisson's
   ratio rises up continually, and the variation law with the confining
   pressure can be well described by nonlinear. Failure characteristics of
   rock are mainly shear failure. The strength characteristics of rock can
   be well characterized by using the Mohr strength criterion of power
   function. These conclusions provide reliable theoretical reference and
   guiding significance for the deep mining of the underground metal mine.}},

Abstract = {{A comprehensive characterization of the novel class of anti-tetrachiral
   cellular solids, both considering the static and the dynamic response,
   is provided in the paper.
   The heterogeneous material is characterized by a periodic microstructure
   made of equi-spaced rings each interconnected by four ligaments. In the
   most general case, rings and ligaments are surrounded by a softer matrix
   and the rings can be filled by a different material.
   First, the first order linear elastic homogenized constitutive response
   is estimated resorting to two different microstructural models: a
   discrete model, in which the ligaments are modeled as beams and the
   presence of the matrix is neglected and the equivalent elastic
   properties are evaluated through a simplified analytical approach, and a
   more detailed continuous model, where the actual properties of matrix,
   ligaments and rings, varying in the 2D domain, are considered and the
   first order computational homogenization is adopted. Special attention
   is given to the dependence of the 2D overall Cauchy-type elastic
   constants on the mechanical and geometrical parameters characterizing
   the microstructure. The results, indeed, show the existence of large
   variations in the linear elastic constants and degree of anisotropy. A
   comparison with available experimental results confirms the validity of
   the analytical and numerical approaches adopted.
   Finally, the rigorous Floquet-Bloch approach is applied to the periodic
   cell of the cellular solid to evaluate the dispersion of propagation
   waves along the orthotropic axes in the framework of elasticity and to
   detect band gaps characterizing the material. A numerical approach,
   based on the first order computational homogenization, is also adopted
   and the rigorous and approximate solutions are compared. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Introduction: The co-occurrence of alcohol use and smoking during
   pregnancy has been shown to have a negative synergistic effect on fetal
   and perinatal risks. The objectives were to: 1) obtain an estimate of
   the prevalence of smoking during pregnancy in Canada by province and
   territory from 2003 to 2011/12; 2) determine if the prevalence of
   smoking during pregnancy has increased or decreased over time; 3)
   investigate whether smoking status is differentially associated with
   alcohol use during pregnancy; and 4) examine the risk factors predictive
   of alcohol use only, smoking only, and the co-occurrence of alcohol use
   and smoking during pregnancy. Methods: Secondary data analysis was
   conducted using five cycles of the Canadian Community Health Survey
   (CCHS; 2003, 2005, 2007/08, 2009/10 and 2011/12). The prevalence of
   smoking during pregnancy, and 95\% confidence interval (CI) was
   calculated by province and territory and by year. The likelihood ratio
   test was used to determine if the prevalence of smoking during pregnancy
   has increased or decreased over time. The relationship between smoking
   status and alcohol use during pregnancy was explored using a
   quasi-Poisson regression model. A mulfinomial logistic regression model
   was utilized to determine which factors were predictive of alcohol use
   only, smoking only, and the co-occurrence of alcohol use and smoking
   during pregnancy. Results: In Canada, between 2003 and 2011/12, the
   weighted pooled prevalence of smoking during pregnancy was 143\% (95\%
   Cl: 13.6\%-15.0\%). Women who smoked daily during pregnancy,
   occasionally during pregnancy, or had a lifetime history of smoking (but
   did not smoke while pregnant) were 2.54 (95\% CI: 2.11-3.06, P <
   0.0001), 2.71 (95\% CI: 2.25-327, P < 0.0001), and 2.09 (95\% CI:
   1.85-237, P < 0.0001), respectively, times more likely to have consumed
   alcohol during pregnancy, compared to pregnant women who were lifetime
   non-smokers when controlling for age, household income, ethnicity and
   CCHS cycle. Risk factors that predicted alcohol use only, smoking only,
   and the co-occurrence of alcohol use and smoking during pregnancy
   differed. Conclusion: It is apparent that smoking in any capacity,
   whether during pregnancy or not, increases the likelihood that a woman
   consumed alcohol while pregnant. Ascertaining smoking status among
   pregnant women and women of childbearing age could be a useful screening
   method for identifying those at-risk of consuming alcohol during
   pregnancy, and vice versa. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we establish the negative spontaneous magnetization in Mn
   and Zn substituted cobalt ferrite Co0.6Zn0.4Fe1.7Mn0.3O4 (CZFMO). It is
   suggested that the origin of negative spontaneous magnetization is due
   to the substitution of small sized Mn+4 ions (compared to Fe+3 ions) at
   the octahedral B site in compound Co0.6Zn0.4 Fe2O4. The low value of
   Poisson's ratio similar to 0.202 for this compound possibly contributes
   towards the easy distortion in the bond length and bond angle, causing
   increase in Fe-O bond distance/decrease in Fe-O-Fe bond angle with Mn
   substitution, leading to considerably weak Fe-O-Fe superexchange
   interaction at the octahedral B site. The neutron diffraction data
   clearly illustrated the significant reduction in ordered magnetic moment
   at the B site, with the resultant negative spontaneous magnetization (M
   = M-B - M-A) in this mixed spinel system. The spin disorder also gives
   rise to an interesting semi-spin glass behavior in CZFMO. (C) 2015 AIP

Abstract = {{As an effective candidate for enhancing energy absorption, a range of
   foam materials have gained considerable popularity, in which the
   density, Young's modulus and plasticity of foam materials are considered
   critical to crashworthiness. Relatively speaking, less attention has
   been paid to the roles played by the Poisson's ratio of foam or cellular
   materials. More importantly, the interaction between different Poisson's
   ratios and thin-walled structures has been a critical yet under-studied
   issue. This paper aims to explore the effects of negative, zero and
   positive Poisson's ratio of auxetic foams, ranging from -1 to 0.5, on
   structural crashworthiness and seek optimal design for different
   foam-filled square, circular and conic tubes. In this study the specific
   energy absorption (SEA) and mean crushing force (MCF) are taken as the
   objective functions by using mathematical regression analysis. The
   sequential quadratic programming (SQP) and the Non-dominated Sorting
   Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) are employed for single and
   multiobjective design of foam-filled tubes with different Poisson's
   ratios, respectively. The optimal Poisson's ratio is obtained for these
   three different types of foam-filled tubes. By comparison we found that
   the crashworthiness of foam filled conic tube is the best, followed by
   circular and then squared tubes. The study provides new insights into
   material selection and design with a more favorable Poisson's ratio for
   crashworthiness. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Auxetic polyurethane stents and stent-grafts for the palliative

Abstract = {{Squamous cell carcinoma is usually cancer of the upper oesophagus and is
   very aggressive cancer. The cancer of the cervical oesophagus causes a
   serious complication called dysphagia, which is difficulty in eating or
   swallowing and which is indicative of incurability. Oesophageal stents
   have been used as a relatively better palliative method for patients who
   are suffering from advanced stage squamous cell carcinomas of oesophagus
   and also for the effective relief of dysphagia. There are still problems
   in currently available self-expanding metals and plastic stents, which
   are associated with high rates of early and late complications. This
   research work is aimed to use Auxetic (rotating-squares) geometry for
   the production of a novel Auxetic oesophageal stents and stent-grafts
   relevant to the palliative treatment of squamous cell carcinomas of the
   proximal and mid oesophagus and also for the prevention of dysphagia.
   This study also endeavoured to manufacture a significantly small
   diameter Auxetic oesophageal stent and stent-graft. In order to easily
   deploy the Auxetic stent orally using a commercial balloon dilatational
   catheter, and hence it also obviates the need of an expensive dedicated
   delivery system. A novel manufacturing route was employed in this
   research to develop both Auxetic films and Auxetic oesophageal stents,
   which ranged from conventional subtractive techniques to new generative
   manufacturing methods. Polyurethane was selected as a material for the
   fabrication of Auxetic films and Auxetic oesophageal stents because of
   its good biocompatibility and non-toxicological properties. The
   developed Auxetic films were later used for the fabrication of seamed
   Auxetic oesophageal stents. The flexible polyurethane tubular grafts
   were also attached to the inner luminal side of the seamless Auxetic
   oesophageal stents, in order to prevent tumour in-growth. (C) 2014 The

Abstract = {{Soil nitrogen and phosphorus are commonly limiting elements affecting
   plant species richness in temperate zones. Our species
   richness-ecological study was performed in alder-dominated forests
   representing temperate floodplains (streamside alder forests of Alnion
   incanae alliance) and swamp forests (alder carrs of Alnion glutinosae
   alliance) in the Western Carpathians. Species richness (i.e., the number
   of vascular plants in a vegetation plot) was analyzed separately for
   native and alien vascular plants in 240 vegetation plots across the
   study area covering Slovakia, northern Hungary and southern Poland. The
   relationship between the species richness of each plant group and total
   soil nitrogen content, plant-available phosphorus and carbon to nitrogen
   (C/N) ratio was analyzed by generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) with
   Poisson error distribution and log-link function. The number of recorded
   native and alien species was 17-84 (average 45.4) and 0-9 (average 1.5)
   species per plot, respectively. The GLMMs were statistically significant
   (p < 0.001) for both plant groups, but the total explained variation was
   higher for native (14\%) than alien plants (9\%). The richness of native
   species was negatively affected by the total soil nitrogen content and
   plant-available phosphorus, whereas the C/N ratio showed a positive
   impact. The alien richness was predicted only by the total soil nitrogen
   content showing a negative effect.}},

Abstract = {{The critical buckling loads of pinned-pinned and cantilever beams are

   Poisson ratio that define the limit between buckling loads that approach
   the classical buckling load from above or below are discussed. (C) 2015

Volume = {{47}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic materials exhibit a negative Poisson's ratio behavior that makes
   them useful for a variety of structural applications by virtue of their
   ability to counterintuitively deform due to a reentrant cellular
   structure. This property allows the cellular material to expand
   laterally when pulled in the longitudinal direction or, conversely,
   contract laterally when compressed, with the manner of deformation of
   the internal structure depending upon the configuration of the cellular
   structure. The purpose of this research was to develop carbon black
   nanoparticle-reinforced natural rubber vulcanizates and to investigate
   the effects of carbon black reinforcement on the mechanical behavior of
   an idealized auxetic foam structure using modeling and numerical
   simulation techniques. This has been achieved by mechanically
   characterizing vulcanized natural rubber of various nanoparticle
   loadings and then using the test data to perform finite element (FE)
   simulations on the foam models. Material models have been developed in
   the FE simulation software ANSYS by curve fitting experimental data
   (hyperelastic) to theoretical material models. Large deformation
   analysis of this foam structure has been carried out to determine
   structural reorganizations and negative Poisson's ratio effect in the
   foam structure.}},

Title = {{Benzodiazepine use as an independent risk factor for HIV infection in a

Journal = {{DRUG AND ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{155}},
Pages = {{190-194}},

Abstract = {{Background: Although the harms of prescription drug diversion are of
   growing international concern, the potential impact of prescription drug
   use on HIV infection has not been well assessed. We evaluated whether
   benzodiazepine use was associated with HIV seroconversion among a cohort
   of persons who inject drugs (PWID) in a Canadian setting.
   Methods: Between May, 1996 and November, 2013, data were derived through
   a prospective cohort study of PWID in Vancouver, Canada. A total of 1682
   baseline HIV negative participants were followed for a median of 79.5
   months (interquartile range: 32.1-119.1), among whom 501 (29.8\%)
   reported benzodiazepine use at baseline, and 176 seroconverted during
   follow-up, equal to an incidence density of 1.5 (95\% Confidence
   Interval {[}CI]: 1.3-1.7) cases per 100 person-years. Poisson regression
   with time-dependent variables was used to assess whether benzodiazepine
   use was associated with the time to HIV seroconversion.
   Results: After adjustment for potential confounders, benzodiazepine use
   (Adjusted Rate Ratio: 1.50; 95\% CI: 1.01-2.24) was independently
   associated with a higher rate of HIV seroconversion.
   Conclusions: Benzodiazepine use was an independent risk factor for HIV
   seroconversion among PWID in this setting. Greater recognition of the
   safety concerns related to benzodiazepine medications including
   diversion are needed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

Volume = {{71}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, pattern transformation behaviors of shape memory polymer
   (SMP) periodic cellular structures are investigated through numerical
   simulations. In order to describe SMP cellular structures behavior in
   the shape memory cycle, generalized thermo-mechanical viscoelasticity
   theory coupling time-temperature effect are utilized with the
   generalized Maxwell model and the Williams-Landel-Fe rry (WLF) equation.
   Similar to other normal periodic cellular structures, SMP periodic
   cellular structures also display the interesting phenomenon of novel
   pattern transformation when the structures are loaded by compression
   force beyond a critical value. Different from other periodic cellular
   materials, novel transformed pattern for SMP material can be fixed via
   cooling to a temperature below the glass transition temperature T-g, and
   this fixed pattern can further be recovered to its original pattern by
   reheating to a temperature above T-g. Moreover, viscous property of SMP
   during shape memory cycle is taken into account by considering the
   effects of nominal strain rate and temperature on the pattern
   transformation. Time-temperature superposition principle is adopted to
   explain these effects. On the other hand, this transformation phenomenon
   for SMP can be triggered even by the stress relaxation process. It is
   also observed that the auxetic behavior (negative Poisson ratio) exists
   in the pattern transformation during both the compression process and
   the stress relaxation process for SMP periodic cellular structures. With
   present study, we are able to gain deeper insights and explain some of
   the new interesting physical phenomena observed in reported experiments
   for SMP periodic cellular structures. Besides, these new findings can be
   used to design appropriate SMP structures in special applications. (C)

Abstract = {{With the third innovation in science and technology worldwide, China has
   also experienced this marvelous progress. Concerning the longwall mining
   in China, the ``masonry beam theory{''} (MBT) was first proposed in the
   1960s, illustrating that the transmission and equilibrium method of
   overburden pressure using reserved coal pillar in mined-out areas can be
   realized. This forms the so-called ``121 mining method{''}, which lays a
   solid foundation for development of mining science and technology in
   China. The ``transfer rock beam theory{''} (TRBT) proposed in the 1980s
   gives a further understanding for the transmission path of stope
   overburden pressure and pressure distribution in high-stress areas. In
   this regard, the advanced 121 mining method was proposed with smaller
   coal pillar for excavation design, making significant contributions to
   improvement of the coal recovery rate in that era. In the 21st century,
   the traditional mining technologies faced great challenges and, under
   the theoretical developments pioneered by Profs. Minggao Qian and Zhenqi
   Song, the ``cutting cantilever beam theory{''} (CCBT) was proposed in
   2008. After that the 110 mining method is formulated subsequently,
   namely one stope face, after the first mining cycle, needs one advanced
   gateway excavation, while the other one is automatically formed during
   the last mining cycle without coal pillars left in the mining area. This
   method can be implemented using the CCBT by incorporating the key
   technologies, including the directional pre-splitting roof cutting,
   constant resistance and large deformation (CRLD) bolt/anchor supporting
   system with negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) effect material, and remote
   real-time monitoring technology. The CCBT and 110 mining method will
   provide the theoretical and technical basis for the development of
   mining industry in China. (C) 2015 Institute of Rock and Soil Mechanics,

Abstract = {{Using ab initio density functional theory, the effect of hydrogen
   arrangement on the elastic properties of silicene-graphene hybrid is
   studied. Mechanical stability, elastic constants and sound velocities of
   pure and five configurations of hydrogenated SiC sheet, namely, chair,
   table, boat, zigzag and armchair, are explicitly examined. To reveal the
   anisotropic properties of the six structures, the polar plots of Young's
   modulus, Poisson ratio and acoustic waves speed are given. Compared to
   graphene, it is shown that all the isotropic systems are less stiffer
   with lower in-plane Young's modulus and stronger with their larger
   Poisson ratio, moreover, their compressional and shear waves propagate
   faster. The analysis of linear elastic behavior shows that the armchair
   configuration has an auxetic structure. The result of this work could be
   used for the design of future silicane-graphane based nanodevices with
   potentially large technological impact in nanomechanics. (C) 2015

Journal = {{COMPOSITES PART B-ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{80}},
Pages = {{84-91}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Chiral honeycombs are one of the most important and oft studied classes
   of auxetic systems due to their vast number of potential applications
   which range from stent geometries to composites, sensors and satellite
   components. Despite numerous works on these systems, however, relatively
   few studies have investigated the effect of structural disorder on these
   structures. In view of this, in this study, the effect of translational
   disorder on hexachiral honeycombs were investigated through a Finite
   Element approach. It was found that this type of disorder has minimal
   effect on the Poisson's ratios of these systems provided that the
   ligament length to thickness ratio remains sufficiently large and the
   overall length to width ratio of the disordered system does not differ
   considerably from that of its ordered counterpart. This makes it ideal
   for use in various applications and products such as sandwich composites
   with an auxetic core. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   structure for composites}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITES SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},

Volume = {{117}},
Pages = {{257-267}},

Abstract = {{Functional auxetic composite materials can be fabricated from
   conventional or from auxetic components. The helical auxetic yarn (HAY)
   is a recently invented auxetic reinforcing component for composite
   materials. This paper investigates the Poisson's ratio behaviour of a
   further development of the HAY, needed for many practical applications.
   The 3-component auxetic yarn is based on a stiff wrap fibre (the first
   component) helically wound around an elastomeric core fibre (the second
   component) coated by a sheath (the third component). The resultant
   structure can overcome problems such as slippage of the wrap and changes
   in wrapping angles previously encountered during the manufacture and
   utilisation of the two-component HAY. The mechanical performance of
   conventional and novel systems is investigated; with emphasis on the
   differences between the engineering and true Poisson's ratio. The
   importance of the utilisation of a true tensile modulus and a true
   Poisson's ratio is demonstrated. This is the first time reported in the
   literature that an experimental auxetic effect analysis of HAYs was
   carried out by comparing true and engineering Poisson's ratio. We show
   that depending on the coating thickness of the third component, the
   3-component auxetic system can demonstrate auxetic behaviour, and the
   coating thickness can be employed as a new design parameter to tailor
   both the Poisson's ratio and modulus of this novel composite
   reinforcement for a wide range of applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{Prevalence of sexual coercion and its association with unwanted
   pregnancies among young pregnant females in Kampala, Uganda: a facility
   based cross-sectional study}},
Journal = {{BMC WOMENS HEALTH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},

Abstract = {{Background: Sexual coercion is associated with sexually transmitted
   infections and unwanted pregnancies with consequential unsafe abortions
   and increased maternal morbidity and mortality. Current literature
   focuses mainly on its risk factors but less on its resultant deleterious
   health effects. We conducted a study to determine the prevalence of
   sexual coercion and its association with unwanted pregnancies among
   young pregnant women.
   Methods: In a cross-sectional study, four hundred and sixteen (416)
   consenting pregnant females aged 15-24 years attending antenatal clinics
   in Lubaga division Kampala district in Uganda were enrolled using
   systematic sampling. Quantitative and qualitative data on sexual
   coercion were collected by female interviewers. Adjusted Prevalence
   Proportion Ratios (Adj. PPRs) of unwanted pregnancy and associated 95 \%
   confidence intervals were estimated by generalized linear models with
   log link function and Poisson family distribution using robust variance
   estimator. Quantitative data were analyzed using Stata version 10.0,
   while qualitative data were analyzed using manifest content analysis.
   Results: Prevalence of sexual coercion was 24 \% and was higher among
   those who had non consensual sexual debut (29.0 \%) compared with those
   who had consensual sexual debut (22.6 \%). The prevalence of unwanted
   pregnancy was 18.3 \% and was higher among participants who had been
   sexually coerced relative to their counterparts (p < 0.001). History of
   sexual coercion in the past 12 months and non consensual sexual debut
   were associated with unwanted pregnancy {[}adj.PPR = 2.23, 95 \% CI:
   (1.49-3.32)] and 1.72, 95 \% CI: (1.16-2.54)] respectively. Qualitative
   results indicated that different forms/contexts of sexual coercion, such
   as deception, transactional sex and physical force influenced unwanted
   pregnancies.
   Discussion: This study highlights that a quarter of our participants in
   our quantitative study had experienced sexual coercion in the past
   twelve months and nearly a third of these, had history of non consensual
   sexual debut. Unwanted pregnancy was higher among the sexually coerced
   and those who had non consensual sexual debut.
   Conclusion: Sexual coercion among pregnant women aged 15-24 years in
   Kampala, Uganda is high and is significantly associated with unwanted
   pregnancy. Comprehensive sex education targeting young people (< 25
   years), along with availability and access to youth friendly centers may
   be useful in addressing sexual coercion and its negative outcomes.}},

Title = {{Negative Poisson's ratios in tendons: An unexpected mechanical response}},
Journal = {{ACTA BIOMATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{24}},

Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{Tendons are visco-elastic structures that connect bones to muscles and
   perform the basic function of force transfer to and from the skeleton.
   They are essential for positioning as well as energy storing when
   involved in more abrupt movements such as jumping. Unfortunately, they
   are also prone to damage, and when injuries occur, they may have
   dilapidating consequences. For instance, there is consensus that
   injuries of tendons such as Achilles tendinopathies, which are common in
   athletes, are difficult to treat. Here we show, through in vivo and ex
   vivo tests, that healthy tendons are highly anisotropic and behave in a
   very unconventional manner when stretched, and exhibit a negative
   Poisson's ratio (auxeticity) in some planes when stretched up to 2\%
   along their length, i.e. within their normal range of motion.
   Furthermore, since the Poisson's ratio is highly dependent on the
   material's microstructure, which may be lost if tendons are damaged or
   diseased, this property may provide a suitable diagnostic tool to assess
   tendon health.
   Statement of significance
   We report that human tendons including the Achilles tendons exhibits the
   very unusual mechanical property of a negative Poisson's ratio (auxetic)
   meaning that they get fatter rather than thinner when stretched. This
   report is backed by in vivo and ex vivo experiments we performed which
   clearly confirm auxeticity in this living material for strains which
   correspond to those experienced during most normal everyday activities.
   We also show that this property is not limited to the human Achilles
   tendon, as it was also found in tendons taken from sheep and pigs. This
   new information about tendons can form the scientific basis for a test
   for tendon health as well as enable the design of better tendon
   prosthesis which could replace damaged tendons. (C) 2015 Acta Materialia

   crystal structures composed entirely of pentagons. In addition,
   electronic band dispersion calculations indicate that while p-graphene
   and p-AgN3 are semiconductors with indirect bandgaps, p-BN structures
   display metallic behavior. We also investigate the mechanical properties
   (in-plane stiffness and the Poisson's ratio) of four different
   pentagonal structures under uniaxial strain. p-graphene is found to have
   the highest stiffness value and the corresponding Poisson's ratio is
   found to be negative. Similarly, p-B2N4 and p-B4N2 have negative
   Poisson's ratio values. On the other hand, the p-AgN3 has a large and
   positive Poisson's ratio. In dynamical stability tests based on
   calculated phonon spectra of these pentagonal monolayers, we find that
   only p-graphene and p-B2N4 are stable, but p-AgN3 and p-B4N2 are
   vulnerable against vibrational excitations. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{A self-developed rotary multi-cutter device cuts stainless steel wire
   ropes into segments to fabricate twisted wires. Stainless steel porous
   twisted wire materials (PTWMs) with a spatial composite intertexture
   structure are produced by the compaction and subsequent vacuum
   solid-phase sintering of twisted wires. The stainless steel PTWMs show
   two types of typical uniaxial tensile failure modes, i.e., a 45 degrees
   angle fracture mode and an auxetic failure mode (the PTWMs expand along
   the direction perpendicular to the tension). The effects of the
   sintering parameters, porosities, wire diameters, and sampling direction
   on the tensile properties of the PTWMs are carefully investigated. By
   increasing the sintering temperature from 1130 degrees C to 1330 degrees
   C, the tensile strength of the PTWMs with 70\% target porosity increased
   from 7.7 MPa to 28.6 MPa and the total failure goes down to 50\%. When
   increasing the sintering time from 90 min to 150 min, the tensile
   strength increases from 12.4 MPa to 19.1 MPa and the total failure
   elongation drops to 78.6\%. The tensile strength of the PTWMs increases
   from 28.9 MPa to 112.7 MPa with decreasing porosity from 69.5\% to
   46.0\%, and the total failure elongation also increases from 14.8\% to
   40.7\%. The tensile strength and the failure strain of the PTWMs with
   fine wires are higher than those of the PTWMs with coarse wires under
   the same porosity. Sampling direction has a small influence on the
   tensile properties of the PTWMs.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE. To evaluate seasonal variation in the rate of surgical site
   infections (SSI) following commonly performed surgical procedures.
   design. Retrospective cohort study.
   METHODS. We analyzed 6 years (January 1, 2007, through December 31,
   2012) of data from the 15 most commonly performed procedures in 20
   hospitals in the Duke Infection Control Outreach Network. We defined
   summer as July through September. First, we performed 3 separate Poisson
   regression analyses (unadjusted, multivariable, and polynomial) to
   estimate prevalence rates and prevalence rate ratios of SSI following
   procedures performed in summer versus nonsummer months. Then, we
   stratified our
   RESULTS to obtain estimates based on procedure type and organism type.
   Finally, we performed a sensitivity analysis to test the robustness of
   our findings. results. We identified 4,543 SSI following 441,428
   surgical procedures (overall prevalence rate, 1.03/100 procedures). The
   rate of SSI was significantly higher during the summer compared with the
   remainder of the year (1.11/100 procedures vs 1.00/100 procedures;
   prevalence rate ratio, 1.11 {[}95\% CI, 1.04-1.19]; P=.002).
   Stratum-specific SSI calculations revealed higher SSI rates during the
   summer for both spinal (P=.03) and nonspinal (P=.004) procedures and
   revealed higher rates during the summer for SSI due to either
   gram-positive cocci (P=. 006) or gram-negative bacilli (P=.004).
   Multivariable regression analysis and sensitivity analyses confirmed our
   findings.
   CONCLUSIONS. The rate of SSI following commonly performed surgical
   procedures was higher during the summer compared with the remainder of
   the year. Summer SSI rates remained elevated after stratification by
   organism and spinal versus nonspinal surgery, and rates did not change
   after controlling for other known SSI risk factors.}},

Abstract = {{It is the aim of the paper to present a new point of view on rotational
   elasticity in a nonlinear setting using orthogonal matrices. The
   proposed model, in the linear approximation, can be compared to the
   well-known equilibrium equations of static linear elasticity. An
   appropriate kinetic energy is identified, and we present a dynamical
   model of rotational elasticity. The propagation of elastic waves in such
   a medium is studied and we find two classes of waves, transversal
   rotational waves and longitudinal rotational waves, both of which are
   solutions of the nonlinear partial differential equations. For certain
   parameter choices, the transversal wave velocity can be greater than the
   longitudinal wave velocity. Moreover, parameter ranges are identified
   where the model describes an auxetic material. However, in all cases the
   potential energy functional is positive definite. Finally, we couple the
   rotational waves to linear elastic waves to study the behaviour of the
   coupled system. We find wave-like solutions to the coupled equations and
   can visualise our results with the help of suitable figures.}},

Title = {{Band gap analysis of star-shaped honeycombs with varied Poisson's ratio}},
Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, star-shaped honeycombs are analyzed in terms of their
   equivalent mechanical behaviors and band gap properties. Firstly, by
   applying Castigliano's second theorem, the effective Young's modulus and
   Poisson's ratio are derived by an analytical method used in structural
   mechanics. On the basis of Bloch's theorem, the dispersion
   characteristics are then analyzed by the dynamic matrix in conjunction
   with the Wittrick-Williams (W-W) algorithm. It should be noted that the
   presented method can form a more simple stiffness and mass matrices of
   the proposed structures, compared with the traditional finite element
   (FE) method. Thereafter, the effects of the geometrical parameters on
   the effective constants and band gaps are investigated and discussed.
   Numerical results demonstrate that the negative Poisson's ratio provides
   an enhanced effective Young's modulus of the considered honeycombs.
   Furthermore, the band gap exists in a much lower frequency region with
   an unchanged summing band gap width when the Poisson's ratio is in
   negative values. In general, the work can serve as a guide for the
   optimal design of cellular structures.}},

Abstract = {{This article details steps in creating low-power artificial muscles
   using 3D printing. It describes a manufacturing system that can be used
   to fabricate seamless tubular dielectric elastomer actuators (DEA), for
   eventual use in biorobotic devices. The focus is on producing passive
   elastomeric components of DEA and the dimensional changes that occur
   after printing is complete. A four-axis printing system is described,
   capable of spray depositing multilayer tubular silicone membranes onto
   an air-permeable mandrel. Mechanical strain was imparted in the
   membranes by means of inflation. A laser measurement system was
   constructed to act as a 3D scanner, which measured the shape of the
   inflated ``balloon.'' The surface shape was reconstructed in software
   using the parametric modeling tool Grasshopper. Seamless auxetic
   tessellations were calculated across the entire surface, and then
   converted to CNC GCode. These toolpaths were then physically extruded
   over the surface of the balloon, stacked five layers high. When the
   extruded silicone structure was completely cured, the pneumatic strain
   was released, allowing the structure to collapse evenly. The compression
   in the printed structure was balanced by the tension in the stretched
   membranes, thus producing a minimum energy structure.}},

Abstract = {{Most of the auxetic materials that have been characterized

   their possible applications, as they need to be carefully oriented

   cuts arranged to form a periodic pattern with either six-fold or
   three-fold symmetry. Moreover, we also show that the auxetic behavior
   can be easily tuned by varying the length of the cuts and that it is
   retained even under large levels of applied deformation beyond the limit
   of small strains. This novel, simple and scalable design can serve as an
   important guideline for designing and fabricating isotropic auxetic

Journal = {{EXTREME MECHANICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{4}},

Abstract = {{We analyse the propagation of elastic waves in soft materials subjected
   to finite deformations. We derive explicit phase velocity relations for
   matter with pronounced stiffening effect, namely Gent model, and apply
   these results to study elastic wave propagation in (a) nearly
   incompressible materials such as biological tissues and polymers, (b)
   highly compressible and (c) negative Poisson's ratio or auxetic
   materials. We find, that for nearly incompressible materials transverse
   wave velocities exhibit strong dependence on the direction of
   propagation and initial strain state, whereas the longitudinal wave
   velocity is not affected significantly until extreme levels of
   deformation are attained. For highly compressible materials, we show
   that both longitudinal and transversal wave velocities depend strongly
   on deformation and direction of propagation. Moreover, the dependence
   becomes stronger when stiffening effects increase. When compression is
   applied, the longitudinal wave velocity decreases regardless the
   direction of wave propagation in highly compressible materials, and
   increases for most of the directions in materials with negative
   Poisson's ratio behaviour. We demonstrate that finite deformations can
   influence elastic wave propagation through combinations of induced
   effective compressibility and stiffness. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMPACT ENGINEERING}},

Volume = {{83}},
Pages = {{47-58}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Double arrowhead honeycombs (DAHs) are auxetic cellular materials with
   negative Poisson's ratio (NPR). The quasi-static and impact behaviors of
   both uniform and functionally graded DAHs are explored. Analytical
   expressions for the in-plane Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio and
   quasi-static yield stress of uniform DAHs are derived and are found to
   be consistent with finite element (FE) predictions, showing that the
   quasi-static yield stress of DAHs is dependent upon the geometrical
   parameters and NPR. Systematical simulations of uniform DAHs subject to
   different impact velocities reveal that there exists a critical impact
   velocity beyond which the dynamic plateau stress is insensitive to the
   effect of NPR. A semi-empirical expression of the plateau stress is
   obtained. For functionally graded DAHs, they are shown to only have
   improved energy absorption capacity under high velocity impacts.
   Moreover, the results of uniform DAHs are shown to be able to be adopted
   to interpret the simulated plateau stress of functionally graded DAHs
   under impact loading. The deformation mechanisms associated with the
   impact resistance of DAHs are also discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The objective of the present study was to investigate the association
   between the milk fat-protein ratio and the incidence rate of clinical
   mastitis including repeated cases of clinical mastitis to determine the
   usefulness of this association to monitor metabolic disorders as risk
   factors for udder health. Herd records from 10 dairy herds of Holstein
   cows in Saxony, Germany, from September 2005-2011(36,827 lactations of
   17,657 cows) were used for statistical analysis. A mixed Poisson
   regression model with the weekly incidence rate of clinical mastitis as
   outcome variable was fitted. The model included repeated events of the
   outcome, time-varying covariates and multilevel clustering. Because the
   recording of clinical mastitis might have been imperfect, a
   probabilistic bias analysis was conducted to assess the impact of the
   misclassification of clinical mastitis on the conventional results.
   The lactational incidence of clinical mastitis was 38.2\%. In 36.2\% and
   34.9\% of the lactations, there was at least one dairy herd test day
   with a fat-protein ratio of <1.0 or >1.5, respectively.
   Misclassification of clinical mastitis was assumed to have resulted in
   bias towards the null. A clinical mastitis case increased the incidence
   rate of following cases of the same cow. Fat-protein ratios of <1.0 and
   >1.5 were associated with higher incidence rates of clinical mastitis
   depending on week in milk. The effect of a fat-protein ratio >1.5 on the
   incidence rate of clinical mastitis increased considerably over the
   course of lactation, whereas the effect of a fat-protein ratio <1.0
   decreased. Fat-protein ratios <1.0 or >1.5 on the precedent test days of
   all cows irrespective of their time in milk seemed to be better
   predictors for clinical mastitis than the first test day results per
   lactation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Creating complex spatial objects from a flat sheet of material using
   origami folding techniques has attracted attention in science and
   engineering. In the present work, we use the geometric properties of
   partially folded zigzag strips to better describe the kinematics of
   known zigzag/herringbone-base folded sheet metamaterials such as
   Miura-ori. Inspired by the kinematics of a one-degree of freedom zigzag
   strip, we introduce a class of cellular folded mechanical metamaterials
   comprising different scales of zigzag strips. This class of patterns
   combines origami folding techniques with kirigami. Using analytical and
   numerical models, we study the key mechanical properties of the folded
   materials. We show that our class of patterns, by expanding on the
   design space of Miura-ori, is appropriate for a wide range of
   applications from mechanical metamaterials to deployable structures at
   small and large scales. We further show that, depending on the geometry,
   these materials exhibit either negative or positive in-plane Poisson's
   ratios. By introducing a class of zigzag-base materials in the current
   study, we unify the concept of in-plane Poisson's ratio for similar
   materials in the literature and extend it to the class of zigzagbase
   folded sheet materials.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic metamaterials are synthetic materials with microstructures
   engineered to achieve negative Poisson's ratios. Auxetic metamaterials
   are of great interest because of their unusual properties and various
   potential applications. However, most of the previous research has been
   focused on auxetic behaviour of elastomers under elastic deformation.
   Inspired by our recent finding of the loss of auxetic behaviour in
   metallic auxetic metamaterials, a systematic experimental and numerical
   investigation has been carried out to explore the mechanism behind this
   phenomenon. Using an improved methodology of generating buckling-induced
   auxetic metamaterials, several samples of metallic auxetic metamaterials
   have been fabricated using a 3D printing technique. The experiments on
   those samples have revealed the special features of auxetic behaviour
   for metallic auxetic metamaterials and proved the effectiveness of our
   structural modification. Parametric studies have been performed through
   experimentally validated finite element models to explore the auxetic
   performance of the designed metallic metamaterials. It is found that the
   auxetic performance can be tuned by the geometry of microstructures, and
   the strength and stiffness can be tuned by the plasticity of the base
   material while maintaining the auxetic performance.}},

Abstract = {{The behavior of chiral elastic materials is of interest to the fields of

   elasticity. In this paper we study the deformation of isotropic chiral
   solids by using the theory of Cosserat elasticity. We investigate the
   behavior of a bar composed by two different materials. The intended
   applications of the solution are to bone implants and various compound
   cylinders. The bar is reinforced by a longitudinal rod and is subjected
   to extension, bending and torsion. It is shown that the compression of
   the composed cylinder, in contrast with the result predicted by the
   theory of achiral materials, is accompanied by torsion and bending. The
   method is used to investigate the case of a circular cylinder reinforced
   by a circular rod. In this case the compression of the bar produces only
   a twist around its axis. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The introduction of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in the
   United States and Europe has led to changes in the incidence of cancers
   among HIV-infected persons, including dramatic decreases in Kaposi
   sarcoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and increases in Hodgkin lymphoma,
   liver, and anogenital malignancies. We sought to evaluate whether
   increasing availability of ART is associated with changing cancer
   incidence in Uganda.
   Methods: Incident cases of 10 malignancies were identified from Kampala
   Cancer Registry from 1999 to 2008. ART coverage rates for Uganda were
   abstracted from the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS reports.
   Negative binomial and Poisson regression modeled the association between
   ART coverage and age-adjusted cancer incidence.
   Results: ART coverage in Uganda increased from 0\% to 43\% from 1999 to
   2008. With each 10\% increase in ART coverage, incidence of Kaposi
   sarcoma decreased by 5\% {[}incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 0.95, 95\%
   confidence interval: 0.91 to 0.99, P = 0.02] and stomach cancer
   decreased by 13\% {[}IRR = 0.87 (95\% CI: 0.80 to 0.95), P = 0.002].
   Conversely, incidence of non-Hodgkin lymphoma increased by 6\% {[}IRR =
   1.06 (95\% CI: 1 to 1.12), P = 0.05], liver cancer by 12\% {[}IRR = 1.12

   1.05 (95\% CI: 1 to 1.10), P = 0.05], and breast cancer by 5\% {[}IRR =
   1.05 (95\% CI: 1 to 1.11), P = 0.05]. ART coverage was not associated
   with incidence of invasive cervical cancer, lung, colon, and Hodgkin
   disease. These findings were similar when restricted to histologically
   confirmed cases.
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that AIDS-defining malignancies and
   other malignancies are likely to remain significant public health
   burdens in sub-Saharan Africa even as ART availability increases.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{30}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Background. Poisson regression is commonly used to analyze
   hospitalization data when outcomes are expressed as counts (e.g. number
   of days in hospital). However, data often violate the assumptions on
   which Poisson regression is based. More appropriate extensions of this
   model, while available, are rarely used.
   Methods. We compared hospitalization data between 206 patients treated
   with hemodialysis (HD) and 107 treated with peritoneal dialysis (PD)
   using Poisson regression and compared results from standard Poisson
   regression with those obtained using three other approaches for modeling
   count data: negative binomial (NB) regression, zero-inflated Poisson
   (ZIP) regression and zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) regression.
   We examined the appropriateness of each model and compared the results
   obtained with each approach.
   Results. During a mean 1.9 years of follow-up, 183 of 313 patients
   (58\%) were never hospitalized (indicating an excess of `zeros'). The
   data also displayed overdispersion (variance greater than mean),
   violating another assumption of the Poisson model. Using four criteria,
   we determined that the NB and ZINB models performed best. According to
   these two models, patients treated with HD experienced similar
   hospitalization rates as those receiving PD \{NB rate ratio (RR): 1.04
   {[}bootstrapped 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.49-2.20]; ZINB summary
   RR: 1.21 (bootstrapped 95\% CI 0.60-2.46)\}. Poisson and ZIP models fit
   the data poorly and had much larger point estimates than the NB and ZINB
   models {[}Poisson RR: 1.93 (bootstrapped 95\% CI 0.88-4.23); ZIP summary
   RR: 1.84 (bootstrapped 95\% CI 0.88-3.84)].
   Conclusions. We found substantially different results when modeling
   hospitalization data, depending on the approach used. Our results argue
   strongly for a sound model selection process and improved reporting
   around statistical methods used for modeling count data.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Motorized traffic may discourage people walking. This study
   analyses the influence of motorization on pedestrian mobility in the
   neighbourhoods of a European city, controlling for environmental,
   socio-demographic, mobility and road safety characteristics of the
   neighbourhood in which each trip was made. Methods: Cross-sectional
   ecological study using the 38 neighbourhoods of Barcelona as the unit of
   analysis. Mobility information was obtained from the 2006 Daily Mobility
   Survey. Walking rates were calculated for 32.343 men and women who made
   walking trips, per 1000 men and women who made trips in the 38
   neighbourhoods. Data were aggregated to calculate the total number of
   motorized trips made in each neighbourhood. beta coefficients and their
   confidence intervals were calculated using Poisson regression, in order
   to study the relationship between walking and motorization, in the
   different tertiles of motorization and adjusting for contextual factors
   and their corresponding interactions with motorization. Results: Levels
   of motorization in the neighbourhood negatively influence walking, even
   when environmental variables of the neighbourhood are considered. In men
   we observe a gradient whereby walking rates fall as motorization rises
   (beta = -0.248; P < 0.001 and beta = -0.363; P < 0.001 in the second and
   third quartiles of motorization, respectively). In the case of women we
   find that only high levels of motorization have a negative influence on
   the rates of women who walk. (beta = -0.256; P < 0.001). Conclusion:
   Motorized traffic discourages people walking. Motorization is a
   modifiable environment-related factor which should be taken into account
   when designing policies to promote safe active travel.}},

Title = {{Time dependence of Poisson's effect in wood IV: influence of grain angle}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF WOOD SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{61}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{372-383}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Off-axis tensile creep tests were conducted on woods taken from Japanese
   cypress and Kalopanax by changing the angle of load to the grain
   direction in the longitudinal-tangential (LT) plane. The dependence of
   the Poisson's ratio and trend of the viscoelastic Poisson's ratio on
   grain angle were investigated. The Poisson's ratios were found to reach
   their extrema when the grain angle was around 30 degrees. Moreover, the
   Poisson's ratio in the LT plane was observed to be negative when the
   grain angle was in the range of 15 degrees-45 degrees. Comparing the
   experimental results with theoretical values obtained from the theory of
   orthotropic elasticity, it was revealed that, although the Poisson's
   ratio reached an extremum in both cases, the specific values did not
   match, especially when the angle was between 15 degrees and 45 degrees.
   Furthermore, the temporal variation of the viscoelastic Poisson's ratio
   was found to depend on the grain angle and the measurement plane. It
   also appeared to be affected by the Poisson's ratio, showing an
   increasing tendency above a specific Poisson's ratio (Japanese cypress:
   0.196, Kalopanax: 0.102) and a decreasing tendency below it, regardless
   of the grain angle and measurement plane. Additionally, the increment in
   the viscoelastic Poisson's ratio after 24 h of creep was observed to
   reach its extremum when the grain angle was around 30 degrees. Finally,
   by improving the six-element Frandsen-Muszynski viscoelastic model,
   which simultaneously considers the longitudinal and transverse strains,
   an eight-element model was presented, and the trend of the viscoelastic
   Poisson's ratio was well reproduced by this model.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{99}},
Pages = {{130-142}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The Miura-ori pattern possesses intriguing mechanical features, namely,
   the one Degree Of Freedom mobility, auxetic in-plane behavior and energy
   absorption capability, for applications such as core to sandwich
   structure, shock absorber, airless tire, etc. To realize the folding
   mechanism of Miura-ori, in this paper a Miura-ori patterned sheet was
   made from copolymer Elvaloy by compression molding, and then its
   deformation behavior was investigated experimentally and by using finite
   element analysis. The intrinsic mechanical properties of Elvaloy were
   obtained by tensile and four-point-bending tests, respectively, and
   subsequently used in the finite element (FE) simulation. For utilizing
   the sheet in all the principal directions, three types of tests were
   conducted: out-of-plane compression, three-point-bending and in-plane
   compressions. FE simulations using Abaqus/Explicit were carried out to
   analyze the deformations of the patterned sheet under the same loading
   as that in the tests. The simulation results were then compared with the
   tests, which show good agreements. Based on the simulation results, the
   deformation patterns of the patterned sheet under different loading
   conditions were examined, as well as the energy absorption capacity. (C)

Abstract = {{Small and large deformation in-plane elastic response of a new class of
   hierarchical fractal-like honey-combs inspired by the topology of the
   ``spiderweb{''} were investigated through analytical modeling, detailed
   numerical simulations, and mechanical testing. Small deformation
   elasticity results show that the isotropic in-plane elastic moduli
   (Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio) of the structures are controlled
   by dimension ratios in the hierarchical pattern of spiderweb, and the
   response can vary from bending to stretching dominated. In large
   deformations, spiderweb hierarchy postpones the onset of instability
   compared to stretching dominated triangular honeycomb (which is indeed a
   special case of the proposed spiderweb honeycomb), and exhibits
   hardening behavior due to geometrical nonlinearity. Furthermore, simple
   geometrical arguments were obtained for large deformation Poisson's
   ratio of first order spiderweb honeycombs, which show good agreement
   with numerical and experimental results. Spiderweb honeycombs exhibit
   auxetic behavior depending on the non-dimensional geometrical ratio of
   spiderweb. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Associations between HIV and schizophrenia and their effect on HIV
   treatment outcomes: a nationwide population-based cohort study in
   Denmark}},
Journal = {{LANCET HIV}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{2}},

Abstract = {{Background Associations between HIV and schizophrenia in people with and
   without substance use disorders and the effect on timeliness of HIV
   diagnosis, antiretroviral therapy (ART), and treatment outcomes are
   poorly understood. We aimed to assess the association between HIV and
   schizophrenia and the effect on HIV treatment outcomes in people with
   and without substance use disorders.
   Methods We did a population-based cohort study with data from nationwide
   registries in Denmark to investigate the risk of schizophrenia after a
   diagnosis of HIV and the risk of HIV after a diagnosis of schizophrenia,
   accounting for substance misuse, timeliness of HIV diagnosis, and
   treatment success in relation to schizophrenia. We selected the cohort
   from people born in Denmark between Jan 1, 1955, and Dec 31, 1995, who
   we followed up from their 16th birthday or Jan 1, 1995 (whichever
   occurred last) until their death, emigration from Denmark, onset of
   schizophrenia, or Dec 31, 2011 (whichever came first). We estimated
   incidence rate ratios (IRRs) with Poisson and Cox regression, with
   adjustment for calendar period, and age and its interaction with sex.
   Findings We identified 2 786 286 individuals, of whom we included 2 646
   154 people in analyses of risk of schizophrenia diagnosis and 2 658 662
   people in analyses of risk of HIV diagnosis. In 35 353 633 person-years
   of follow up, HIV was associated with an increased risk of schizophrenia
   (IRR 4.09, 95\% CI 2.73-5.83) and acute psychosis (7.15, 4.45-10.8); the
   IRR was highest within the first year of HIV diagnosis for both
   disorders (8.24, 2.95-17.7 and 12.7, 3.15-32.9, respectively).
   Schizophrenia was not associated with an increased risk of HIV in
   individuals without substance misuse disorders (IRR 1.42, 95\% CI
   0.81-2.27). The risk of schizophrenia in individuals with HIV decreased
   after ART (IRR 0.53, 0.32-0.87). The risk of acute psychosis did not
   differ between HIV-infected individuals receiving antiretroviral
   regimens with and without efavirenz (IRR 0.70, 95\% CI 0.32-1.54). We
   recorded no differences in CD4 cell counts, time to ART, or viral
   suppression between individuals with schizophrenia with HIV and those
   without schizophrenia when substance use was taken into account. Between
   1999 and 2011, the mortality rate ratio comparing HIV-infected
   individuals with schizophrenia with HIV-negative individuals without
   schizophrenia was 25.8 (95\% CI 18.8-34.3).
   Interpretation Our findings emphasise the need for interventions to
   prevent HIV in people with schizophrenia, especially for those with
   substance use disorders, and for accessible mental health services for
   individuals with HIV.}},

Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{We show that a mechanically driven magnetocaloric effect (MCE) in
   magneto-auxetic systems (MASs) in the vicinity of room temperature is
   possible and the effect can be colossal. Even at zero external magnetic
   field, the magnetic entropy change in this reversible process can be a
   few times larger in magnitude than in the case of the giant MCE
   discovered by Pecharsky and Gschneidner in Gd-5(Si2Ge2). MAS represent a
   novel class of metamaterials having magnetic insertions embedded within
   a non-magnetic matrix which exhibits a negative Poisson's ratio. The
   auxetic behaviour of the non-magnetic matrix may either enhance the
   magnetic ordering process or it may result in a transition to the
   disordered phase. In the MAS under consideration, a spin 1/2 system is
   chosen for the magnetic component and the well-known Onsager solution
   for the two-dimensional square lattice Ising model at zero external
   magnetic field is used to show that the isothermal change in magnetic
   entropy accompanying the auxetic behaviour can take a large value at
   room temperature. The practical importance of our findings is that MCE
   materials used in present engineering applications may be further
   enhanced by changing their geometry such that they exhibit auxetic
   behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Highly skewed count data with excess zeros challenge the
   application of conventional statistical methods. Additional problems
   arise from repeated zero-inflated measures. Longitudinal zero-inflated
   Poisson (ZIP-mixed) models are mixtures of logistic and Poisson models
   that accommodate excess zeros and repeated counts. We compared a
   ZIP-mixed model with traditional Poisson and negative binomial models
   using data on problems with female condom use reported by women at high
   risk of sexually transmitted diseases.
   Methods: The follow-up experience of this cohort represents a mixture of
   ``perfect use{''} (no opportunity to report problems), represented by
   the structural zeros, and use experience that bears the risk of condom
   use problems, represented by a Poisson distribution.
   Results: The ZIP-mixed model provided better fit and richer results than
   other models. The odds of being in the zero problem category increased
   with age (odds ratio {[}OR] = 1.1 per additional year, 95\% confidence
   interval {[}CI]: 1.0-1.3) and with follow-up (OR = 3.0 per additional
   month, 95\% CI: 1.4-6.0). The nonzero problem rate was lower among women
   who believed in the benefits of condom use (rate ratio {[}RR] = 0.9,
   95\% CI: 0.7-1.0) and had no sexually transmitted diseases at baseline
   (RR = 0.7, 95\% CI: 0.6-0.9), and it decreased during follow-up (RR =
   0.8 per additional month, 95\% CI: 0.7-0.9).
   Conclusions: Using ZIP-mixed model provided further insights into the
   determinants of condom failure. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

   the simply supported nanoplates are parallel to {[}110] direction but as

   orientation effect is also discussed for possibility of self-instability
   occurrence In nanoplates. The results in simpler cases are compared with

Number = {{27}},

Abstract = {{Simulations of a flexible coarse-grained model are used to study silica
   aerogels. This model, introduced in a previous study (J. Phys. Chem. C
   2007, 111, 15792), consists of spherical particles which interact
   through weak nonbonded forces and strong interparticle bonds that may
   form and break during the simulations. Small-deformation simulations are
   used to determine the elastic moduli of a wide range of material models,
   and large-deformation simulations are used to probe structural evolution
   and plastic deformation. Uniaxial deformation at constant transverse
   pressure is simulated using two methods: a hybrid Monte Carlo approach
   combining molecular dynamics for the motion of individual particles and
   stochastic moves for transverse stress equilibration, and isothermal
   molecular dynamics simulations at fixed Poisson ratio. Reasonable
   agreement on elastic moduli is obtained except at very low densities.
   The model aerogels exhibit Poisson ratios between 0.17 and 0.24, with
   higher-density gels clustered around 0.20, and Young's moduli that vary
   with aerogel density according to a power-law dependence with an
   exponent near 3.0. These results are in agreement with reported
   experimental values. The models are shown to satisfy the expected
   homogeneous isotropic linear-elastic relationship between bulk and
   Young's moduli at higher densities, but there are systematic deviations
   at the lowest densities. Simulations of large compressive and tensile
   strains indicate that these materials display a ductile-to-brittle
   transition as the density is increased, and that the tensile strength
   varies with density according to a power law, with an exponent in
   reasonable agreement with experiment. `Auxetic behavior is observed at
   large tensile strains in some models. Finally, at maximum tensile stress
   very few broken bonds are found in the materials, in accord with the
   theory that only a small fraction of the material structure is actually
   load-bearing.}},

Abstract = {{Existent rigid unit mode (RUM) models based on rotating squares, which
   may explain the phenomenon of negative thermal expansion (NTE), are
   generalized so as to assess the NTE potential for novel systems made
   from rectangular or rhombic rigid units. Analytical models for the area
   coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE) of these innovative networks are
   derived in an attempt to determine the optimal geometrical parameters
   and connectivity for maximum NTE. It was found that all systems exhibit
   NTE, the extent of which is determined by the shape and connectivity of
   the elemental rigid units (side lengths ratio or internal angle). It was
   also found that some of the networks proposed here should exhibit
   significantly superior NTE properties when compared with the well-known
   network of squares, and that for optimal NTE characteristics,
   pencil-like rigid units should be used rather than square-shaped ones,
   as these permit larger pore sizes that are more conducive to NTE. All
   this compliments earlier work on the negative Poisson's ratio (auxetic)
   potential of such systems and may provide a route for the design of new
   materials exhibiting superior thermo-mechanical characteristics
   including specifically tailored CTEs or giant NTE characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Psychological disorders may affect the pain experience of
   women with vulvodynia, but evidence remains limited. The present study
   aimed to describe the magnitude of the association of depression and
   posttraumautic stress disorder (PTSD) with the presence of vulvodynia in
   a nonclinical population from southeastern Michigan. Methods: Baseline
   data from 1,795 women participating in the Woman to Woman Health Study,
   a multiethnic population-based study, was used for this analysis.
   Validated screening questionnaires were conducted to assess vulvodynia,
   depression, and PTSD. Modified Poisson regression models with a robust
   variance estimation were used to estimate prevalence ratios (PR) and
   their 95\% confidence intervals (CI) for the association between
   vulvodynia status and two mental health conditions, depression and PTSD.
   Results: In the adjusted models, women who screened positive for
   depression had a 53\% higher prevalence of having vulvodynia (PR=1.53;
   95\% CI: 1.12, 2.10) compared with women who screened negative for
   depression. Women who screened positive for PTSD had more than a
   two-fold increase in the prevalence of having vulvodynia (PR=2.37; 95\%
   CI: 1.07, 5.25) compared with women who screened negative for PTSD.
   Conclusions: The increased prevalence of vulvodynia among those
   screening positive for depression or PTSD suggests that these disorders
   may contribute to the likelihood of reporting vulvodynia. Alternatively,
   vulvodynia, depression, and PTSD may have a common pathophysiological
   and risk profile. Prospective studies are needed to improve our
   understanding of the temporal relation between mental health conditions
   and vulvar pain.}},

Abstract = {{The stable Ordos Plateau, extensional Weihe Graben, and Qinling orogenic
   belt are located at the northeast margin of the Tibetan Plateau. They
   have been thought to play different roles in the eastward expanding of
   the Tibetan Plateau. Peking University deployed a linear seismic array
   across the western end of the Weihe Graben to investigate the crustal
   structures of the tectonic provinces of this structure. Receiver
   function analyses revealed low-to-moderate Poisson's ratios and
   anticorrelations between Poisson's ratios and topography beneath the
   Qinling Orogen. These features may indicate a tectonic thickening of the
   felsic upper crust by folding and thrusting within the Qinling Orogen.
   We observed a strong horizontal negative signal at the midcrust beneath
   the Ordos Plateau which may indicate a low-velocity zone. This
   observation would suggest the stable cratonic Ordos Plateau had been
   modified due to the compression between the Tibetan Plateau and the
   Ordos Plateau. We also observed an abrupt 4km Moho offset across the
   Weihe Fault, changing from similar to 44km beneath the Ordos Plateau to
   similar to 40km beneath the Qinling Orogen. We conclude that the Weihe
   Fault is a lithosphere-scale fault/shear zone, which extends into the
   upper mantle beneath the Weihe Graben. It acts as the major boundary
   separating the stable Ordos Plateau and the active Qinling Orogen.}},

Abstract = {{Developments in design and technology in the engineering and medical
   fields necessitate the use of smart and high-performance materials to
   meet higher engineering specifications. The general requirements of such
   materials include a combination of high stiffness and strength with
   significant weight savings, resistance to corrosion, chemical
   resistance, low maintenance, and reduced costs. Over the last three
   decades, it has been demonstrated that auxetic materials offer a huge
   potential for the fields of engineering, natural sciences, and
   biomedical engineering, and for many other industries, including the
   aerospace and defense industries, through their unique deformation
   mechanism and measured enhancements in mechanical properties. To meet
   future engineering challenges, auxetic materials are increasingly being
   recognized as integral components of smart and advanced materials.
   Although materials with a negative Poisson's ratio have been known since
   the early 1900s, they did not capture researchers' attention until the
   late 1980s. Since 1991, these materials have been known as auxetic
   materials. Since then, their benefits and applications have been
   expanded to all major classes of materials such as metals, ceramics,
   polymers, and composites, and they are also now being used in
   engineering applications. The goal of this review was to present the
   development of auxetic polymers, which were first fabricated in the form
   of polyurethane foam approximately three decades ago and are now used in
   the fabrication of non-woven nano/micropolymeric structures. This review
   could provide useful information for the future development of auxetic
   polymers.}},

Abstract = {{Integer-valued generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity
   (GARCH) models have played an important role in time series analysis of

   to the existing models. In this paper, we study a local influence
   diagnostic analysis in the log-linear integer-valued GARCH models. The
   slope-based diagnostic and stepwise curvature-based diagnostics in a
   framework of the modified likelihood displacement are proposed. Under
   five perturbation schemes the corresponding local influence measures are
   derived. Two simulated data sets and a real-world example are analyzed
   to illustrate our method. In addition, the fitted model for this example
   has a negative coefficient for one of the two covariates, which is
   particularly illustrative of the extra flexibility of the considered
   model.}},

Abstract = {{The rise in the use of statistical models for non-Gaussian data, such as
   generalized linear models (GLMs) and generalized linear mixed models
   (GLMMs), is pushing aside the traditional approach of transforming data
   and applying least-squares linear models (LMs). Nonetheless, many
   least-squares statistical tests depend on the variance of the sum of
   residuals, which by the Central Limit Theoremconverge to a Gaussian
   distribution for large sample sizes. Therefore, least-squares LMs will
   likely have good performance in assessing the statistical significance
   of regression coefficients. Using simulations of count data, I compared
   GLM approaches for testing whether regression coefficients differ from
   zero with the traditional approach of applying LMs to transformed data.
   Simulations assumed that variation among sample populations was either
   (i) negative binomial or (ii) log-normal Poisson (i.e. log-normal
   variation among populations that were then sampled by a Poisson
   distribution). I used the simulated data to conduct tests of the
   hypotheses that regression coefficients differed from zero; I did not
   investigate statistical properties of the coefficient estimators, such
   as bias and precision. For negative binomial simulations whose
   assumptions closely matched the GLMs, the GLMs were nonetheless prone to
   type I errors (false positives) especially when there was more than one
   predictor (independent) variable. After correcting for type I errors,
   however, the GLMs provided slightly better statistical power than LMs.
   For log-normal-Poisson simulations, both a GLMM and the LMs performed
   well, but under some simulated conditions the GLMs had high type I error
   rates, a deadly sin for statistical tests. These results show that,
   while GLMs have slight advantages in power when they are properly
   specified, they can lead to badly wrong conclusions about the
   significance of regression coefficients if they are mis-specified. In
   contrast, transforming data and applying least-squares linear analyses
   provide robust statistical tests for significance over a wide range of
   conditions. Thus, the traditional approach of transforming data and
   applying LMs is still useful.}},

Abstract = {{The article presents the advancements in the technological processes
   developed to produce chiral honeycombs made of thin composite laminates.
   An original technological process, which was applied to produce chiral
   components for aerospace morphing structures, is critically analysed and
   a new approach is proposed. The objective of such approach is the
   production of thin-walled chiral composite structures with enhanced
   strength properties by using a more feasible technology. According to
   the new methodology, chiral honeycombs with polygonal nodes are obtained
   by assembling thin-walled prismatic composite tubes. Numerical models
   are developed to investigate the behaviour of such topologies. A
   comparison with the performances of chiral honeycombs with cylindrical
   nodes is presented, showing that the new configuration can provide
   negative Poisson's ratios that tend to the theoretical limit of -1 as
   the stiffness of the polygonal nodes is increased. Thereafter, a method
   to fill partially the nodes is proposed and numerically assessed, to
   enhance at the same time the auxetic behaviour and the mechanical
   properties of the chiral honeycomb. Finally a complete manufacturing
   process is developed. Hexa-chiral structural units are manufactured and
   subsequently tested to assess the auxetic response. Results are in
   acceptable agreement with numerical predictions and indicate that the
   novel technological route provides a significant contribution for the
   application of composite chiral honeycomb to morphing structures. y(C)

Abstract = {{We describe here a heat-compression protocol used on needle-punched
   commercial nonwoven fabrics which induces an out-of-plane auxetic
   response in these treated fabrics. The as-received samples, however, are
   not auxetic and show a decrease in thickness when stretched uniaxially.
   Using micro-CT imaging it was found that the vertical fiber
   bundles/columns, produced in the needle punching step of fabric
   manufacture, are tilted and buckled as a result of the heat-compression
   treatment. It is suggested that it is likely the reorientation of these
   columns during subsequent uniaxial strain that drives thickness increase
   (auxetic response). Variation of instantaneous Poisson's ratio with
   axial strain for as-received and treated nonwovens. (C) 2015 WILEY-VCH

   each of the three concurrent models (two 2-mode models where dilation
   acts with each rotation mechanism (the CTM1 and CTM2 models), and the
   model where all three mechanisms operate (CTM3)) to explore the
   Poisson's ratio dependency on the key model geometrical and deformation
   strength parameters. Predictions in good agreement with all experimental
   on-axis Poisson's ratios specifically for silica -cristobalite are
   possible for the new CTM3 model comprising two tetrahedral rotation
   mechanisms acting concurrently with tetrahedral dilation when
   direction-dependent strength parameters are employed. This is a
   significant improvement over the previous analytical model incorporating
   the tetrahedral dilation and first tetrahedral rotation mechanisms and

Abstract = {{alpha-cristobalite is a metastable polymorph of silica which has the
   remarkable property of exhibiting a negative Poisson's ratio (auxetic).
   In this study, the mechanical properties and deformation mechanisms of
   this system were investigated through a force-field based approach.
   Besides simulations on the actual structure of -cristobalite, a number
   of simulations where the rigidity of SiO2 tetrahedra was increased, were
   also conducted. This was done in order to obtain a clearer picture of
   the role which these tetrahedra play in determining the mechanical
   properties of this system. These systems were loaded in an off-axis
   direction in a number of planes about the {[}001] direction and the
   deformations observed were compared with those of type II rotating
   rectangle systems. It was discovered that the mechanical properties of
   -cristobalite can be accurately described through the semi-rigid version
   of this model, even for cases where the tetrahedra were fully rigid. (C)

Abstract = {{We present the results of an atomistic study on the Poisson's ratios of
   face-centered cubic metal (001) nanoplates under tensile loading. Here,
   we find that the behavior of the Poisson's ratios of metal nanoplates is
   strongly dependent on the characteristics of a phase transformation that
   takes place in their bulk counterparts as well as on the amount of
   compressive stress induced in the nanoplates. In addition, we discuss
   the effects of the nanoplate thickness and temperature on the mechanical
   behavior of the nanoplates. As the thickness decreases, the amount of
   compressive stress increases. As a result, the metal nanoplates become
   more auxetic. Higher temperatures cause the phase transformation to
   occur sooner. Thus, strongly auxetic nanoplates can be obtained by
   raising the temperature. In addition to investigating the effects of the
   thickness and temperature, we compare the behaviors of the Poisson's
   ratios of (001) nanoplates of six different metals. Interestingly, the
   behaviors of the Poisson's ratios of the metal nanoplates differ, even
   though their corresponding bulks have similar and positive Poisson's
   ratios. This is because the six metals exhibit large differences in
   their surface stresses as well as in the critical strains for the phase
   transformation. (C) 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA, Weinheim}},

Abstract = {{Monte Carlo simulations of mono- and polydisperse two-dimensional
   crystals are reported. The particles in the studied system, interacting
   through hard-core repulsive Yukawa potential, form a solid phase of
   hexagonal lattice. The elastic properties of crystalline Yukawa systems
   are determined in the NpT ensemble with variable shape of the periodic
   box. Effects of the Debye screening length (-1), contact value of the
   potential (epsilon), and the size polydispersity of particles on elastic
   properties of the system are studied. The simulations show that the
   polydispersity of particles strongly influences the elastic properties
   of the studied system, especially on the shear modulus. It is also found
   that the elastic moduli increase with density and their growth rate
   depends on the screening length. Shorter screening length leads to
   faster increase of elastic moduli with density and decrease of the
   Poisson's ratio. In contrast to its three-dimensional version, the
   studied system is non-auxetic, i.e., shows positive Poisson's ratio. (C)

Abstract = {{Deformation/deflection of thin shells/membranes with clamped boundaries
   is a common material behaviour relevant to many engineering and medical
   conditions. A detailed understanding of the deformation mechanisms of
   different materials/structures with different Poisson's ratios under
   such a loading condition is of great significance to materials testing
   and product development. In this work, the deformation of circular
   elastic membranes with a clamped edge under point loading and finite
   contact conditions is systematically studied incorporating auxeticity
   behaviours. The effect of Poisson's ratio on the deformation of the
   material is investigated and the influence of parameters including
   sample thickness, indentation depth and indenter size is analysed. The
   feasibility and limitation of an analytical solution is evaluated. The
   work shows that the P/(3) relationship is applicable to describe the
   force-displacement data over the membrane domain for both point loading
   and finite contact conditions. It is shown that negative Poisson's
   ratios have direct influence on the membrane deformation domain,
   including the force-displacement curve, the deflection profile and the
   contact area. Critical factors affecting the P-h curves and the
   deformation mechanisms are discussed with reference to potential use of
   the Poisson's ratio effects. (C) 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA,

Abstract = {{Effective properties and dynamic response of a sandwich panel made of
   two face sheets and auxetic core are analyzed in this study by computer
   simulations. The inner composite layer is made of a cellular auxetic
   structure immersed in a filler material of a given Poisson's ratio
   (filler material fills the voids in structure). Each cell is composed of
   an auxetic structure (re-entrant honeycomb or rotating square), i.e.,
   exhibiting negative Poisson's ratio without any filler. Influence of
   filler material on the effective properties of the sandwich panel is
   investigated. The proposed structure shows interesting structural
   characteristics and dynamic properties. Our results clearly show that it
   is possible to create auxetic sandwich panels made of two solid
   materials with positive Poisson's ratio. This is even possible if the
   filler material is nearly incompressible, but can move in out-of-plane
   direction. Moreover, effective Young's modulus of such sandwich panels
   becomes very large if the Poisson's ratio of the filler material tends

   The composite consists of matrix material and a stack of inclusions. The

   inclusions, the global structure exhibits unusual properties over a wide
   range of applied deformations. The overall Poisson's ratio of the
   composite is significantly reduced comparing with its constituents, and
   an overall hardening effect is achieved. Moreover, according to the
   results of a parametric finite element analysis, the specific properties
   of this composite structure can be tailored by controlling the geometry

Abstract = {{The analysis of auxetic structural elements undergoing transverse shear
   deformation has so far been largely confined to the first-order shear
   deformation theory (FSDT), which requires a shear correction factor;
   analysis using the third-order shear deformation theory (TSDT), which
   does not require a shear correction factor, is currently lacking in
   regard to auxetic structural elements. This paper adopts the TSDT to
   evaluate the elastic stability of isotropic columns with special
   emphasis on auxetic ones for pinned-pinned columns with springs of equal
   rotational stiffness at both ends. Results on columns with pinned-pinned
   (zero stiffness) and fixed-fixed (infinite stiffness) end conditions
   with square and circular cross sections reveal that auxeticity (i)
   reduces the transverse shear deformation, (ii) allows the use of
   classical theories, and (iii) provides higher elastic stability. (C)

Abstract = {{Special soliton analytical solutions are seeked for the so-called double
   dispersion equation (or Porubov's equation), which describes the
   propagation of longitudinal waves in an elastic rod. Using the
   F-expansion method, a new interesting class of traveling solitary waves
   is obtained. As a byproduct, the results obtained by other authors for
   some special cases are regained. Some numerical simulations are also
   performed. Splitting of various initial pulses during propagation into a
   sequence of solitary waves is considered. The dependence of the
   amplitude and the velocity of the solitary waves on Poisson's ratio is
   discussed in detail. Collisions between some obtained solitary waves are
   also presented. The simulation results are compared with the obtained
   exact analytical solutionsthe latter reflect the perfect balance between
   the nonlinearity and dispersion. The comparison indicates that the
   obtained exact solutions are useful for describing more complicated wave
   fields studied by numerical simulations. It also indicates that the
   numerical results for auxetic materials are in better agreement with
   theoretical solutions than in the case of ordinary materials.
   Furthermore, one can conclude that the Secant pulse generates solitary
   waves closer to the analytical predictions than a Gaussian pulse. This
   is similar to the case of variational method, where the Secant trial
   function is also more proper than the Gaussian one. (C) 2015 WILEY-VCH

Abstract = {{The dynamics of the inner surface of an infinitely long
   circular-cylindrical cavity in an isotropic elastic medium is studied in
   the whole range of the Poisson's ratio including negative values
   characteristic of auxetic materials. The existence of the unique
   long-lived propagation mode (true surface wave, TSW) has been confirmed
   on the clean surface with the following properties: (i) existence of a
   low frequency cut-off for all the azimuthal indices n except for n=1
   (flexural mode), (ii) polarization tending to that of the Rayleigh wave
   in the short wavelength limit, (iii) Airy phases (inflection points of
   dispersion curves) for n<6 that shift towards short wave region when the
   Poisson's ratio becomes negative. A number of propagation modes with
   complex frequencies, i.e., with finite life times (surface leaky waves,
   pseudo surface waves) are found. The torsional leaky mode transforms
   into the skimming shear-horizontal wave (Love wave) in the short
   wavelength limit. An axial-radial leaky mode, similar to the Rayleigh
   wave but with reverse elliptical polarization turns out a physical
   solution except for extremely short wavelengths. A strong radial
   component of the longitudinal resonance occurs at wavelengths comparable
   to the cavity's radius especially in the incompressible limit. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Propagation of infinitely-lived true surface waves (TSW) and of the
   evanescent surface resonances (pseudo surface waves, PSW) on the inner
   surface of a cylindrical cavity in an elastic medium coated with a thin
   elastic membrane is studied. An analogous flat surface with the same
   coating is considered as a reference system. The dispersion relations of
   the true surface waves and of the surface resonances are shown to depend
   on the interplay between the sound speeds in the substrate and in the
   covering layer. The short-wavelength limit of the excitations in the
   cavity is checked to be consistent with the case of the flat surface.
   Analytical expressions are obtained for the cut-offs and for the
   asymptotic behaviors of the excitations in the long-wavelength and short
   wavelength limits. The local surface densities of states (LDOS) as well
   as the real parts of the Green's functions, i.e., analogues of the
   reactive power, are calculated. The most eminent anomalies of LDOS,
   which correspond to the longitudinal resonance, are shown to be located
   close to the apparently spurious roots of the secular determinant of the
   surface equations of motion. The roots correspond generally to the total
   conversion of the longitudinal to transverse bulk waves. These roots
   show cut-offs, where the life time of the longitudinal resonance
   increases to infinity. For still lower wave vectors the maxima of LDOS
   follow the lines of total conversion transverse-to-longitudinal with
   finite life-times. The radius dependence of the cut-off wave vector in
   the small-radius limit for a fully symmetric torsional mode is 1/root a
   and for a fully symmetric high-frequency axial-radial TSW follows a 1/a
   behavior, whereas the analogous dependence for a quasi-Rayleigh surface
   wave is proportional to 1/root alna except for a certain range of
   parameters, where the high-frequency TSW does not exist. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The Helmholtz wave equation is derived for longitudinal waves in an
   elastic plate of arbitrary thickness placed in a rigid gantry ensuring a
   constant width. The whole range of Poisson's ratio allowed for isotropic
   elastic media constrained in this way is considered. The wave speed is
   shown to increase under a constant longitudinal compressive stress
   applied to the front face of the plate and to decrease when the applied
   stress is tensile. The effect is most pronounced for zero Poisson's
   ratio and it vanishes for the limiting permitted values, i.e., 1 or -1.
   The reported results also describe the combined effect of longitudinal
   stress and Poisson's ratio on the wave speed. These findings provide
   guidelines for designing devices aimed at a passive control of
   propagation of longitudinal waves in thin-walled structures. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Using both mathematical and numerical methods, the optimal distributions
   of material characterized by the Young modulus and Poisson ratio (as
   well as other moduli of isotropy) maximizing the overall stiffness of an
   inhomogeneous isotropic elastic 3D body transmitting a given surface
   loading to a given support are constructed. The overall stiffness of the
   body is defined as the inverse of the work of external forces on
   displacements, called here the compliance of the structure. The
   isoperimetric condition bounds the integral of the trace of the Hooke
   tensor. It is proved that isotropic composite materials forming the
   bodies of extremely high stiffness exhibit negative Poisson ratio in
   large subdomains, which points at the significance of the auxetic
   material in modern structural design. The obtained results show that the
   whole range of possible variation of the Poisson ratio is used, from -1
   to 1/2, which proves usefulness of the auxetic materials. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Composite materials containing negative-stiffness inclusions embedded in
   positive-stiffness matrix may exhibit unconventional (anomalous)
   effective coupled-field properties through interactions of the two
   phases. Effective coupled-field properties are calculated with the
   finite element methods under the quasi-static assumption. Stability
   boundaries are determined by applying 10Hz sinusoidal loading on
   boundary surfaces, and the system is unstable if its energy becomes
   divergent for a chosen inclusion Young's modulus ratio ((E)) or bulk
   modulus ratio ((K)). Effective viscoelastic properties and their
   stability are studied for negative (E) at 10Hz, while the Poisson's
   ratio of the purely elastic inclusion is kept constant. For small
   inclusion volume fractions, their stability boundary is at
   (E)approximate to-0.3, and extreme large effective damping and
   viscoelastic modulus are in the unstable regime. Furthermore, in the
   viscoelastic case, inclusion shapes have no effects on stability. As for
   the effective coupled-field properties, all anomalous peaks are in the
   unstable regime for negative (E) or (K), except for an anomalous peak in
   effective thermal expansion coefficient with electrically insulated
   inclusions. Insulated inclusions may cause charge accumulation at the
   inclusion-matrix interface and boundary surface effects may serve as
   stabilizing agents to the composite system. (C) 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag

Abstract = {{BackgroundRelapse is common in patients with alcohol dependence, even
   after detoxification. The aims of this prospective study were to
   investigate changes affecting patients during the first 6months after
   discharge from hospitalization for detoxification and to determine the
   influence of these changes on the likelihood of alcohol-related
   emergency room (ER) visits in the following 18-month period.
   MethodsThe study included 88 patients hospitalized for participation in
   a detoxification program in the addiction department of a university
   hospital in Rennes, France. Alcohol consumption, psychiatric symptoms,
   and life events were investigated by addiction specialists during
   hospitalization and 6months afterward. For each patient, the number of
   alcohol-related ER visits in the last 6months was prospectively recorded
   at the hospital 12, 18, and 24months after hospitalization. The rate
   ratios of ER visits as a function of sociodemographic variables and
   changes observed 6months after discharge were estimated using Poisson
   regression with autoregressive errors.
   ResultsNearly half of the patients (47.7\%) had ER visits in the 12- to
   24-month period following discharge. The likelihood of ER visits was
   higher for patients living with friends/parents and for those with
   aggravated psychiatric symptoms, negative changes in their family life,
   and who had a medical follow-up in the 6months after discharge. In
   contrast, the likelihood of ER visits was lower for patients living with
   children and those with improved psychiatric morbidity. Alcohol
   consumption and psychiatric symptoms at baseline had no significant
   effect.
   ConclusionsMonitoring changes in psychiatric symptoms and family life
   early after a detoxification program may help identify patients who are
   vulnerable to relapse in the subsequent 18-month period. Systematic
   screening for these changes as early as possible, in combination with
   appropriate treatment and the establishment of a social support system,
   could be fundamental in avoiding further relapses and ER visits.}},

Abstract = {{Using a melt electrospinning technique, stretchable force sensors were
   designed for use in an application of hand rehabilitation. The main
   purpose of this study was to verify that the use of auxetic sensors
   improved hand rehabilitation practices when compared to their absence.
   For this study, novel stretchable poly (epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL)
   force sensors were fabricated into the following formations: auxetic
   microfiber sheets (AMSs), auxetic solid sheets (ASSs), microfiber sheets
   (MSs), and solid sheets (SSs). A femtosecond laser device was used to
   make an auxetic structure in the MSs and SSs. Subsequently, these
   sensors were coated with gold particles to make them conductive for the
   electrical current resistance assays. Through the cycles of applied
   stress and strain, auxetic structures were able to retain their original
   shape once these forces have been dissipated. This stretchable sensor
   could potentially measure applied external loads, resistance, and strain
   and could also be attachable to a desired substrate. In order to verify
   the workability and practicality of our designed sensors, we have
   attempted to use the sensors on a human hand. The AMS sensor had the
   highest sensitivity on measuring force and resistance among the four
   types of sensors. To our knowledge, this is the first study to form a
   stretchable force sensor using a melt electrospinning technique.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECT The relationship between time of year and surgical site infection
   (SSI) following neurosurgical procedures is poorly understood. Authors
   of previous reports have demonstrated that rates of SSI following
   neurosurgical procedures performed during the summer months were higher
   compared with rates during other seasons. It is unclear, however, if
   this difference was related to climatological changes or inexperienced
   medical trainees (the July effect). The aim of this study was to
   evaluate for seasonal variation of SSI following spine surgery in a
   network of nonteaching community hospitals.
   METHODS The authors analyzed 6 years of prospectively collected
   surveillance data (January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2012) from all
   laminectomies and spinal fusions from 20 hospitals in the Duke Infection
   Control Outreach Network of community hospitals. Surgical site
   infections were defined using National Healthcare Safety Network
   criteria and identified using standardized methods across study
   hospitals. Regression models were then constructed using Poisson
   distribution to evaluate for seasonal trends by month. Each analysis was
   first performed for all SS's and then for SSIs caused by specific
   organisms or classes of organisms. Categorical analysis was performed
   using two separate definitions of summer: June through September
   (definition 1), and July through September (definition 2). The
   prevalence rate of SSIs during the summer was compared with the
   prevalence rate during the remainder of the year by calculating
   prevalence rate ratios and 95\% confidence intervals.
   RESULTS The authors identified 642 SSIs following 57,559 neurosurgical
   procedures (overall prevalence rate = 1.11/100 procedures); 215 occurred
   following 24,466 laminectomies (prevalence rate = 0.88/100 procedures),
   and 427 following 33093 spinal fusions (prevalence rate = 1.29/100
   procedures). Common causes of SSI were Staphylococcus aureus (n = 380;
   59\%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 90; 14\%), and Escherichia
   coli (n = 41; 6.4\%). Poisson regression models demonstrated increases
   in the rates of SSI during{''}each of the summer months for all SSIs and
   SSIs due to gram-positive cocci, S. aureus, and methicillin-sensitive S.
   aureus. Categorical analysis confirmed that the rate of SSI during the
   4-month summer period was higher than the rate during the remainder of
   the year, regardless of which definition for summer was used (definition
   1, p = 0.008; definition 2, p = 0.003). Similarly, the rates of SSI due
   to gram-positive cocci and S. aureus were higher during the summer
   months than the remainder of the year regardless of which definition of
   summer was used. However, the rate of SSI due to gram-negative bacilli
   was not.
   CONCLUSIONS The rate of SSI following fusion or spinal
   laminectomy/laminoplasty was higher during the summer in this network of
   community hospitals. The increase appears to be related to increases in
   SS's caused by gram-positive cocci and, more specifically, S. aureus.
   Given the nonteaching nature of these hospitals, the findings
   demonstrate that increases in the rate of SSI during the summer are more
   likely related to ecological and/or environmental factors than the July
   effect.}},

   Resistance Mutations in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study From 1998 to 2012}},

Abstract = {{Background. Transmitted human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV) drug
   resistance (TDR) mutations are transmitted from nonresponding patients
   (defined as patients with no initial response to treatment and those
   with an initial response for whom treatment later failed) or from
   patients who are naive to treatment. Although the prevalence of drug
   resistance in patients who are not responding to treatment has declined
   in developed countries, the prevalence of TDR mutations has not.
   Mechanisms causing this paradox are poorly explored.
   Methods. We included recently infected, treatment-naive patients with
   genotypic resistance tests performed <= 1 year after infection and
   before 2013. Potential risk factors for TDR mutations were analyzed
   using logistic regression. The association between the prevalence of TDR
   mutations and population viral load (PVL) among treated patients during
   1997-2011 was estimated with Poisson regression for all TDR mutations
   and individually for the most frequent resistance mutations against each
   drug class (ie, M184V/L90M/K103N).
   Results. We included 2421 recently infected, treatment-naive patients
   and 5399 patients with no response to treatment. The prevalence of TDR
   mutations fluctuated considerably over time. Two opposing developments
   could explain these fluctuations: generally continuous increases in the
   prevalence of TDR mutations (odds ratio, 1.13; P =.010), punctuated by
   sharp decreases in the prevalence when new drug classes were introduced.
   Overall, the prevalence of TDR mutations increased with decreasing PVL
   (rate ratio {[}RR], 0.91 per 1000 decrease in PVL; P =.033).
   Additionally, we observed that the transmitted high-fitness-cost
   mutation M184V was positively associated with the PVL of nonresponding
   patients carrying M184V (RR, 1.50 per 100 increase in PVL; P <.001).
   Such association was absent for K103N (RR, 1.00 per 100 increase in PVL;
   P =.99) and negative for L90M(RR, 0.75 per 100 increase in PVL; P
   =.022).
   Conclusions. Transmission of antiretroviral drug resistance is
   temporarily reduced by the introduction of new drug classes and driven
   by nonresponding and treatment-naive patients. These findings suggest a
   continuous need for new drugs, early detection/treatment of HIV-1
   infection.}},

Abstract = {{Background In January, 2014, the Same-Sex Marriage Prohibition Act was
   signed into law in Nigeria, further criminalising same-sex sexual
   relationships. We aimed to assess the immediate effect of this
   prohibition act on stigma, discrimination, and engagement in HIV
   prevention and treatment services in men who have sex with men (MSM) in
   Nigeria.
   Methods The TRUST cohort study uses respondent-driven sampling to assess
   the feasibility and effectiveness of engagement of MSM in HIV prevention
   and treatment services at a clinical site located with a community-based
   organisation trusted by the MSM community. TRUST is a prospective
   implementation research cohort of MSM (>= 16 years) in Abuja, Nigeria.
   We compared HIV clinical outcomes and stigma, including fear and
   avoidance of health care, across baseline and quarterly visits before
   and after implementation of the the Same-Sex Marriage Prohibition Act.
   Outcomes assessed were measures of stigma and discrimination, loss to
   follow-up, antiretroviral therapy status, and viral load. We compared
   outcomes before and after the legislation with chi(2) statistics, and
   estimated incident stigma-related events and loss to follow-up with
   Poisson regression.
   Findings Between March 19, 2013, and Aug 7, 2014, 707 MSM participated
   in baseline study procedures, contributing to 756 before legislation
   (prelaw) and 420 after legislation (postlaw) visits. Reported history of
   fear of seeking health care was significantly higher in postlaw visits
   than in prelaw visits (n=161 {[}38\%] vs n=187 {[}25\%]; p<0.0001), as
   was avoidance of health care (n=118 {[}28\%] vs n=151 {[}20\%];
   p=0.001). In incidence analyses, of 192 MSM with follow-up data and no
   history of an event at baseline, reported fear of seeking health care
   was higher in the postlaw than the prelaw period (n=144; incidence rate
   ratio 2.57, 95\% CI 1.29-5.10; p=0.007); loss to follow-up and incident
   healthcare avoidance were similar across periods. Of the 161 (89\%) of
   181 HIV-infected MSM with HIV viral loads available, those who had
   disclosed sexual behaviour with a health-care provider were more often
   virally suppressed at baseline than those with no previous disclosure
   (18 {[}29\%] of 62 vs 13 {[}13\%] of 99 men; p=0.013).
   Interpretation These analyses represent individual-level, quantitative,
   real-time prospective data for the health-related effects resulting from
   the enactment of legislation further criminalising same-sex practices.
   The negative effects of HIV treatment and care in MSM reinforce the
   unintended consequences of such legislation on global goals of HIV
   eradication. Strategies to reach MSM less likely to engage in HIV
   testing and care in highly stigmatised environments are needed to reduce
   time to HIV diagnosis and treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Analytical and numerical features of the elastic properties of
   curvilinearly anisotropic six-constant tetragonal nano/microtubes are
   considered. The analytical formulas for Young's modulus and Poisson's
   ratio are obtained in the case of axial extension. Numerical
   calculations are performed using these formulas and data on the elastic
   constants from the Landolt-Bornstein Handbook. The parametric
   dependences of Young's modulus and Poisson's ratios for nano/microtubes
   are analyzed in detail. The basic parameters are elastic compliances,
   chiral angles, and ratios of the radii of hollow cylindrical tubes. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper reports quasi-static and low-kinetic energy impact testing of
   auxetic and conventional open-cell polyurethane foams. The auxetic foams
   were fabricated using the established thermo-mechanical process
   originally developed by Lakes. Converted foams were subject to
   compression along each dimension to 85\% and 70\% of the unconverted
   dimension during the conversion process, corresponding to linear
   compression ratios of 0.85 and 0.7, respectively. The 0.7 linear
   compression ratio foams were confirmed to have a re-entrant foam cell
   structure and to be auxetic. Impact tests were performed for kinetic
   energies up to 4J using an instrumented drop rig and high speed video. A
   flat dropper was employed on isolated foams, and a hemispherical-shaped
   dropper on foams covered with a rigid polypropylene outer shell layer.
   The flat dropper tests provide data on the rate dependency of the
   Poisson's ratio in these foam test specimens. The foam Poisson's ratios
   were found to be unaffected by the strain rate for the impact energies
   considered here. Acceleration-time data are reported along with
   deformation images from the video footage. The auxetic samples displayed
   a six times reduction in peak acceleration, showing potential in impact
   protector devices such as shin or thigh protectors in sports equipment
   applications. (C) 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA, Weinheim}},

   With a nonzero chiral angle, all nano/microtubes can have negative

Abstract = {{Topological defects can markedly alter nanomaterial properties. This
   presents opportunities for ``defect engineering,{''} where desired
   functionalities are generated through defect manipulation. However,
   imaging defects in working devices with nanoscale resolution remains
   elusive. We report three-dimensional imaging of dislocation dynamics in
   individual battery cathode nanoparticles under operando conditions using
   Bragg coherent diffractive imaging. Dislocations are static at room
   temperature and mobile during charge transport. During the structural
   phase transformation, the lithium-rich phase nucleates near the
   dislocation and spreads inhomogeneously. The dislocation field is a
   local probe of elastic properties, and we find that a region of the
   material exhibits a negative Poisson's ratio at high voltage. Operando
   dislocation imaging thus opens a powerful avenue for facilitating
   improvement and rational design of nanostructured materials.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{448}},
Pages = {{492-500}},

Abstract = {{Hypotheses: Particle rejection from porous membranes will increase when
   particle and membrane carry like charges. The influence of charge on
   particle rejection can be modeled by first solving the Poisson-Boltzmann
   equation for the electrostatic particle-pore wall interaction energy,
   enabling one to predict the cross sectional particle concentration in a
   pore. Rejection coefficients can then be predicted by combining the
   Boltzmann factor with a hydrodynamic lag coefficient.
   Experiments: Rejection experiments were conducted with three different
   spherical colloidal silica particles, a spherical virus (PRD1) and gold
   nanorods of two different aspect ratios (ratio of length to diameter).
   Track-etched polycarbonate microfiltration and ultrafiltration membranes
   having nearly parallel pores of cylindrical cross-section were used.
   Experiments were conducted under conditions where both particle and
   membrane carried a negative charge as well as under conditions where
   surface charges had minimal impact. Experiments were designed to cover a
   broad range of dimensionless particle sizes under conditions when
   convection dominated particle transport.
   Findings: Model predictions and experimental measurements demonstrate
   that particle rejection can be enhanced significantly when particle and
   pore carry like charges. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{Using dispersion-corrected density functional theory calculations, we
   investigate the structural and electronic properties of arsenic (As)
   nanosheet, which is a cousin of phosphorene. We find that the
   black-phosphorus like structure is dynamically unstable for As, which
   has an out-of-plane soft mode from its flat As zigzag lines. Hence
   different from phosphorene, the stable As monolayer possesses a unique
   buckling along the zigzag direction, which leads to a surface
   corrugation of 0.20 angstrom and a robust dynamic stability. The zigzag
   buckling alters the band feature of As nanosheet, transforming it from
   an indirect band gap semiconductor to a direct one for the buckled
   structure. Strain engineering can further tune the surface corrugation
   and band structure of As nanosheet, for which the direct or indirect gap
   feature can be switched by the zigzag-directional strains, while the
   strains along armchair direction could modulate the band gap and induce
   a metallic behaviour. Prominent anisotropic Dirac-like electronic
   structures and orientation-dependent elastic behaviours with a
   remarkable negative Poisson ratio are both found in the As nanosheets,
   enabling the system promising applications for nano-electrics and
   devices.}},

Month = {{JUN 4}},
Abstract = {{We introduce a principle unique to disordered solids wherein the
   contribution of any bond to one global perturbation is uncorrelated with
   its contribution to another. Coupled with sufficient variability in the
   contributions of different bonds, this ``independent bond-level
   response{''} paves the way for the design of real materials with unusual
   and exquisitely tuned properties. To illustrate this, we choose two
   global perturbations: compression and shear. By applying a bond removal
   procedure that is both simple and experimentally relevant to remove a
   very small fraction of bonds, we can drive disordered spring networks to
   both the incompressible and completely auxetic limits of mechanical
   behavior.}},

Title = {{Association of a Bundled Intervention With Surgical Site Infections
   Among Patients Undergoing Cardiac, Hip, or Knee Surgery}},
Journal = {{JAMA-JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION}},

Abstract = {{IMPORTANCE Previous studies suggested that a bundled intervention was
   associated with lower rates of Staphylococcus aureus surgical site
   infections (SSIs) among patients having cardiac or orthopedic
   operations.
   OBJECTIVE To evaluate whether the implementation of an evidence-based
   bundle is associated with a lower risk of S aureus SSIs in patients
   undergoing cardiac operations or hip or knee arthroplasties.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Twenty hospitals in 9 US states
   participated in this pragmatic study; rates of SSIs were collected for a
   median of 39 months (range, 39-43) during the preintervention period
   (March 1, 2009, to intervention) and a median of 21 months (range,
   14-22) during the intervention period (from intervention start through
   March 31, 2014).
   INTERVENTIONS Patients whose preoperative nares screens were positive
   for methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA) or methicillin-susceptible S
   aureus (MSSA) were asked to apply mupirocin intranasally twice daily for
   up to 5 days and to bathe daily with chlorhexidine-gluconate (CHG) for
   up to 5 days before their operations. MRSA carriers received vancomycin
   and cefazolin or cefuroxime for perioperative prophylaxis; all others
   received cefazolin or cefuroxime. Patients who were MRSA-negative and
   MSSA-negative bathed with CHG the night before and morning of their
   operations. Patients were treated as MRSA-positive if screening results
   were unknown.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcomewas complex (deep
   incisional or organ space) S aureus SSIs. Monthly SSI counts were
   analyzed using Poisson regression analysis.
   RESULTS After a 3-month phase-in period, bundle adherence was 83\%(39\%
   full adherence; 44\% partial adherence). Overall, 101 complex S aureus
   SSIs occurred after 28 218 operations during the preintervention period
   and 29 occurred after 14 316 operations during the intervention period
   (mean rate per 10 000 operations, 36 for preintervention period vs 21
   for intervention period, difference, -15 {[}95\% CI, -35 to -2]; rate
   ratio {[}RR], 0.58 {[}95\% CI, 0.37 to 0.92]). The rates of complex S
   aureus SSIs decreased for hip or knee arthroplasties (difference per 10
   000 operations, -17 {[}95\% CI, -39 to 0]; RR, 0.48 {[}95\% CI, 0.29 to
   0.80]) and for cardiac operations (difference per 10 000 operations, -6
   {[}95\% CI, -48 to 8]; RR, 0.86 {[}95\% CI, 0.47 to 1.57]).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this multicenter study, a bundle comprising
   S aureus screening, decolonization, and targeted prophylaxis was
   associated with a modest, statistically significant decrease in complex
   S aureus SSIs.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we discuss Bayesian nonconvex penalization for sparse
   learning problems. We explore a nonparametric formulation for latent
   shrinkage parameters using subordinators which are one-dimensional Levy
   processes. We particularly study a family of continuous compound Poisson
   subordinators and a family of discrete compound Poisson subordinators.
   We exemplify four specific subordinators: Gamma, Poisson, negative
   binomial and squared Bessel subordinators. The Laplace exponents of the
   subordinators are Bernstein functions, so they can be used as
   sparsity-inducing nonconvex penalty functions. We exploit these
   subordinators in regression problems, yielding a hierarchical model with
   multiple regularization parameters. We devise ECME
   (Expectation/Conditional Maximization Either) algorithms to
   simultaneously estimate regression coefficients and regularization
   parameters. The empirical evaluation of simulated data shows that our
   approach is feasible and effective in high-dimensional data analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic-like strain states were generated in self-assembled
   nanocomposite thin films of (Ba0.6Sr0.4TiO3)(1-x) - (Sm2O3)(x)(BSTO -
   SmO). A switch from auxetic-like to elastic-like strain behavior was
   observed for x > 0.50, when the SmO switched from being nanopillars in
   the BSTO matrix to being the matrix with BSTO nanopillars embedded in
   it. A simple model was adopted to explain how in-plane strain varies
   with x. At high x (0.75), strongly enhanced ferroelectric properties
   were obtained compared to pure BSTO films. The nanocomposite method
   represents a powerful new way to tune the properties of a wide range of
   strongly correlated metal oxides whose properties are very sensitive to

Abstract = {{Smart biomaterials are designed to act as an `on-off' switch for various
   applications from macro- to nanometer scale which self-heals or responds
   to the changes in the environment when one of its property changes by
   the external conditions like temperature, light, pressure or
   electricity. This change is reversible and can be repeated for several
   times. When used for healthcare, it improves its performances in medical
   devices thus promoting desired biological responses like healing, tissue
   growth etc. Smart materials can deliver therapeutics to the designated
   site of the body. It is a challenging task to sketch out the
   classification of smart materials due to its different approaches and
   quantity of publications related to this topic, is almost impossible to
   provide a comprehensive review. There are various types of smart
   materials namely piezoelectric materials, shape memory polymers or
   alloys, temperature responsive polymers, photomechanical materials,
   self-healing materials, thermoelectric materials etc. The current review
   has been focused on smart biomaterials primarily on auxetic materials
   which are automatically adjustable with strength and thickness in
   response to the applied forces as they have memorial ability to return
   to its original state on dissipation of the stresses. Here, the main
   emphasize is on biomedical applications of auxetic materials which comes
   under the category of 16 smart materials of the twenty first century
   having a great impact in biomedical area. The information provided
   through this review may be beneficial for the future development of
   biomedical devices and their clinical applications consequently

Journal = {{AEROSPACE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{43}},
Pages = {{406-414}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{A novel strategy of dynamic stall control for rotor airfoil via variable
   droop leading-edge (VDLE) has been conducted based upon the optimization
   method. As foundations, body-fitted grids around oscillatory rotor
   airfoil with VDLE are regenerated by solving Poisson equations, and
   flowfield around airfoil is simulated based on unsteady Reynold averaged
   Navier-Stokes (URANS) equations. To improve computational accuracy and
   efficiency, ROE-MUSCL scheme, S-A turbulence model and implicit LU-SGS
   scheme are adopted. The verified results of VR-12 airfoil indicate that
   dynamic stall vortex could be remarkably suppressed by VDLE control.
   Additionally, parametric analyses for dynamic stall control of airfoil
   indicate that aerodynamic characteristics of an oscillatory airfoil
   could be significantly improved when non-dimensional frequency (k{*}) of
   VDLE is about 1.0 and mean droop angle (delta(0)) and angular amplitude
   (delta(m)) of VDLE are between 2 degrees and 7 degrees. Furthermore,
   multi-objective optimizations are conducted by employing the surrogate
   model. The maximum drag and negative moment coefficients of VR-12
   airfoil can be reduced by about 79.2\% and 81.2\% respectively via
   control of VDLE with k{*} = 1.06 and delta(m)(delta(0)) = 8.46 degrees.
   By multi-objective optimization, it indicates that ``upward{''}
   leading-edge at some instant helps to optimize control effects of VDLE
   on dynamic stall of rotor airfoil. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. All

Abstract = {{ObjectivesTo examine trends in tuberculosis (TB) incidence and to
   compare demographic and clinical characteristics of nursing home (NH)
   residents and community-dwelling older adults.
   DesignProspective TB surveillance.
   SettingTB cases reported in California from 2000 to 2009.
   ParticipantsTB patients aged 65 and older.
   MeasurementsTrends in TB incidence per 100,000 population were assessed
   using Poisson regression. Demographic and clinical characteristics were
   compared using the chi-square or Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Among NH
   residents, risk factors for death during TB treatment were identified
   using logistic regression.
   ResultsFrom 2000 to 2009, TB incidence rates decreased significantly,
   from 15.9/100,000 to 8.4/100,000 (-44\%, 95\% confidence interval
   (CI)=-66\% to -7\%) for NH residents and from 21.2/100,000 to
   15.0/100,000 (-27\%, 95\% CI=-29\% to -24\%) for community-dwelling
   older adults. Overall, 211 TB cases among NH residents and 6,518 cases
   among community-dwelling older adults were reported. NH residents were
   more likely than community-dwelling older adults to be older (median age
   81 vs 75, P<.001), have a negative acid-fast bacilli sputum smear and
   positive culture (37\% vs 28\%, P<.001), and die while undergoing TB
   treatment (44\% vs 14\%, P<.001), and were less likely to have a
   positive tuberculin skin test (TST) (28\% vs 44\%, P<.001) and have TB
   care provided by a health department (20\% vs 59\%, P<.001). In
   multivariable analysis, NH residents who had a positive TST were less
   likely to die while undergoing TB treatment (odds ratio=0.39, 95\%
   CI=0.16-0.96).
   ConclusionTB incidence rates were lower, and reductions in incidence
   were greater among NH residents; community-dwelling older adults had
   higher TB rates and smaller reductions in incidence. Interventions that
   promote timely detection and treatment of TB infection and disease may
   be needed to reduce morbidity and mortality among NH residents.}},

Title = {{Fluid prediction using AVO analysis and forward modelling of deep

Abstract = {{Amplitude versus offset AVO analysis and forward modelling were used to
   predict the fluid type and seismic signature in a deep gas reservoir in
   faith field, Niger Delta. Well A, which identified the major deeper gas
   bearing reservoir in this field, was used in the modelling to predict
   what the seismic response would be away from this well at varying
   thickness and porosity ranges. The entire well was blocked into
   alternate layers of sand and shale lithotypes; the sands were fluid
   substituted from its initial in situ condition to 100\% brine
   saturation, and from the brine case, fluid substituted to 100 \% oil and
   100 \% gas saturations. The elastic properties of these fluid
   substituted sands were estimated using the Gassmann equations and Batzle
   and Wang. The results were used in AVO analysis. Seismic forward
   modelling to determine the seismic wiggle signatures of these sands were
   also conducted. The variations of pertinent rock properties with depth
   of burial were also investigated. The results show that sand alpha
   (interval 10,400-10,650 ft) exhibited a typical class 3 AVO signature.
   Seismic wiggle response from top of this sand shows a distinct negative
   trough on the near angle stack and a much larger trough on the far
   stack. Sand beta (interval 11,700-12,050 ft) exhibited a typical class
   2n AVO signature. Sand wedge model response shows increasing amplitudes
   from tops and bases of these sands as a function of thickness with the
   limits of seismic resolution shown by the tuning thickness. The
   gradient-stack plots, Hiltermann's acoustic impedance (HAI) versus
   Poisson's ratio (PR) plots and the AVO models suggest that the
   hydrocarbon-bearing sands will be distinguishable from sands with 100 \%
   brine saturations. There is significant overlap between oil and gas
   plots because the oil was modelled as having a high gas oil ratio (GOR)
   of 3,586. The reservoirs at this level in Faith Field are either
   condensate or gas bearing. Seismic direct hydrocarbon indicator (DHI)
   and lithologic delineation are better defined in the shallower sand
   alpha than the deeper sand beta. These models have shown that any good
   quality seismic acquired over this prospect would be useful in deriving
   reservoir properties from seismic (RPFS) for these reservoirs and would
   be effective in lithologic differentiation or hydrocarbon
   identification.}},

Abstract = {{A stochastic micromechanical framework for multiphase composites is
   proposed to characterize the probabilistic behaviors of effective
   properties of composite materials. Based on our previous work, the
   deterministic micromechanical model of the multiphase composites is
   derived by introducing the strain concentration tensors. By modeling the
   volume fractions and properties of constituents as stochastic, we extend
   the deterministic framework to stochastic to incorporate the inherent
   randomness of effective properties among different specimens. A new
   simulation framework, consisting of univariate approximation for
   multivariate function, Newton interpolations, and Monte Carlo
   simulation, is developed to quantitatively evaluate the stochastic
   characteristics of the effective properties of composites. Numerical
   examples including limited experimental validations, comparisons with
   existing micromechanical models, and the Monte Carlo simulations
   indicate that the proposed models provide an accurate and
   computationally efficient framework in characterizing the effective
   properties of multiphase composites. Finally, the effects of the
   correlation between the constituents' material parameters are discussed
   based on our proposed stochastic micromechanical model, which shows that
   the negative correlation between Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of
   the constituents can enhance the effective properties of the composites.}},

Abstract = {{Anal condylomata are common in HIV-positive individuals and among men
   who have sex with men (MSM). Generally attributable to infection by
   low-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs), condylomata are considered
   benign low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (SILs). However, anal
   condylomata have occasionally been linked to high-grade SIL and to
   oncogenic, high-risk HPVs. Here we describe the range of intraepithelial
   lesions and of the associated HPVs in heterosexual men and women and
   MSM. Perianal and anal condylomata were collected from 243 patients (56
   heterosexual women, 61 heterosexual men and 126 MSM, including 41
   HIV-positive MSM). We assessed lesion histology and HPV genotype.
   Prevalence estimates and Poisson models were used. Irrespective of HIV
   infection status, MSM showed a higher proportion of condylomata as
   high-grade SILs compared to heterosexual men/women. High-grade SILs were
   also more prevalent in anal than in perianal lesions in all patient
   groups. HIV-positive MSM exhibited increased prevalence ratio (4.6; 95\%
   confidence interval 2.1-10.0) of perianal low-grade SILs containing only
   high-risk HPVs compared to HIV-negative MSM. In addition, more than 64\%
   of anal SILs with a high-grade component, regardless of HIV infection,
   were exclusively associated with low-risk HPVs. In anal condylomata,
   both high-grade and low-grade SILs can be associated with high-risk
   and/or low-risk HPVs. Particularly, low-grade perianal SILs associated
   with high-risk HPVs were common in HIV-positive MSM, while presence of
   only low-risk HPVs in high-grade SILs were common in both MSM groups.
   Our findings sound a note of caution for the common clinical practice
   for the treatment of anal condylomata as benign lesions in MSM and
   HIV-positive patients.

Abstract = {{Auxetic metamaterials have enhanced indentation and penetration
   resistance due to their high shear strength and modulus. Its auxetic
   performance under dynamic loading cases is an important property for
   shields and armour applications. In the present study, compressive tests
   at different impact velocities on buckling-induced auxetic metamaterials
   were conducted for two different initial geometries. A photographic
   technique was applied to measure the Poisson's ratio. When the dynamic
   data were compared with those of quasi-static experiments, it was found
   that the negative Poisson's ratio for the buckling-induced metamaterial
   is sensitive to the rate of loading, while the negative Poisson's ratio
   for the metamaterial with initial auxetic behaviour is insensitive to
   the loading rate. It was also found that the deformation pattern is
   similar to that in the quasi-static loading condition when the impact
   force measured by the test machine is dominated by the inertia force of
   the metamaterials.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Although acquired immune deficiency syndrome-associated
   morbidity has diminished due to excellent viral control, multimorbidity
   may be increasing among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected
   persons compared with the general population.
   Methods. We assessed the prevalence of comorbidities and multimorbidity
   in participants of the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS) compared with the
   population-based CoLaus study and the primary care-based FIRE (Family
   Medicine ICPC-Research using Electronic Medical Records) records. The
   incidence of the respective endpoints were assessed among SHCS and
   CoLaus participants. Poisson regression models were adjusted for age,
   sex, body mass index, and smoking.
   Results. Overall, 74 291 participants contributed data to prevalence
   analyses (3230 HIV-infected; 71 061 controls). In CoLaus, FIRE, and
   SHCS, multimorbidity was present among 26\%, 13\%, and 27\% of
   participants. Compared with nonsmoking individuals from CoLaus, the
   incidence of cardiovascular disease was elevated among smoking
   individuals but independent of HIV status (HIV-negative smoking:
   incidence rate ratio {[}IRR] = 1.7, 95\% confidence interval {[}CI] =
   1.2-2.5; HIV-positive smoking: IRR = 1.7, 95\% CI = 1.1-2.6;
   HIV-positive nonsmoking: IRR = 0.79, 95\% CI = 0.44-1.4). Compared with
   nonsmoking HIV-negative persons, multivariable Poisson regression
   identified associations of HIV infection with hypertension (nonsmoking:
   IRR = 1.9, 95\% CI = 1.5-2.4; smoking: IRR = 2.0, 95\% CI = 1.6-2.4),
   kidney (nonsmoking: IRR = 2.7, 95\% CI = 1.9-3.8; smoking: IRR = 2.6,
   95\% CI = 1.9-3.6), and liver disease (nonsmoking: IRR = 1.8, 95\% CI =
   1.4-2.4; smoking: IRR = 1.7, 95\% CI = 1.4-2.2). No evidence was found
   for an association of HIV-infection or smoking with diabetes mellitus.
   Conclusions. Multimorbidity is more prevalent and incident in
   HIV-positive compared with HIV-negative individuals. Smoking, but not
   HIV status, has a strong impact on cardiovascular risk and
   multimorbidity.}},

Abstract = {{Kerogen content and kerogen porosity play a significant role in elastic
   properties of organic-rich shales. We construct a rock physics model for
   organic-rich shales to quantify the effect of kerogen content and
   kerogen porosity using the Kuster and Toksoz theory and the
   self-consistent approximation method. Rock physics modeling results show
   that with the increase of kerogen content and kerogen-related porosity,
   the velocity and density of shales decrease, and the effect of kerogen
   porosity becomes more obvious only for higher kerogen content. We also
   find that the Poisson's ratio of the shale is not sensitive to kerogen
   porosity for the case of gas saturation. Finally, for the seismic
   reflection responses of an organic-rich shale layer, forward modeling
   results indicate the fifth type AVO responses which correspond to a
   negative intercept and a positive gradient. The absolute values of
   intercept and gradient increase with kerogen content and kerogen
   porosity, and present predictable variations associated with velocities
   and density.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: There has been both greater recognition and scrutiny of the
   increased use of advanced imaging. Our aim was to determine whether
   there has been a change over time in the use of computed tomography
   (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound (US) modalities in
   the intensive care units (ICUs).
   Materials and Methods: A retrospective review of 75657 admissions to 20
   ICUs was conducted. Results were analyzed with multivariate linear,
   negative binomial, and Poisson regressions. Primary outcomes were rates
   of use of CT, MRI, and US per 1000 ICU admissions every 6 months.
   Secondary outcomes were changes in radiology use associated with impacts
   on mortality, hospital length of stay (LOS), ICU LOS, and hospital
   charges.
   Results: The rate of imaging use decreased by 13.5\% between 2007 and
   2011 (incidence rate ratio {[}IRR], 0.982; P < .001). Most of this
   decrease was by CTs (21.0\%; IRR, 0.973; P < .001). Use of MRI decreased
   by 6.0\% (IRR, 0.991; P = .04), whereas US increased by 18.9\% (IRR,
   1.012; P < .001). The charges associated with imaging decreased by \$ 74
   per ICU admission, which would save an estimated \$ 1.2 million in
   charges during 2011. Decreased imaging was not associated with changes
   in mortality, hospital, and ICU LOS.
   Conclusion: Advanced imaging use decreased for 5 years in the ICUs,
   resulting in decreased charges without negative effects on patient
   outcomes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Study of magnetic domain evolution in an auxetic plane of Galfenol using
   Kerr microscopy}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{117}},
Number = {{17}},
Month = {{MAY 7}},
Abstract = {{Galfenol (Fe(x)Ga100-(x)), a magnetostrictive alloy (3/2 lambda 110-400
   ppm) of Iron and Gallium exhibits an in-plane auxetic response in the <
   110 > crystallographic direction. Negative Poisson's ratios have been
   observed in response to application of stress fields, where values of as
   low as -0.7 have been reported for compositions of greater than roughly
   20\% Ga {[}Zhang et al., J. Appl. Phys. 108(2), 023513 (2010)] and in
   response to application of magnetic fields, where values of as low as
   -2.5 have been reported to be expected for compositions of less than
   roughly 20\% Ga {[}G. Raghunath and A. B. Flatau, IEEE Trans. Magn. (in
   press)]. Several models have been proposed to understand these two
   distinct phenomena. Galfenol samples with less than 20\% Ga also exhibit
   an unusual response to an increasing magnetic field applied along the <
   110 > direction. The longitudinal strain which increases initially with
   applied field experiences a dip (until similar to 10 mT) before
   increasing again to reach saturation. The transverse strain increases
   and reaches a maximum value (at the same field of similar to 10 mT) and
   then drops from the maximum by 5\%-10\% as magnetic saturation is
   approached {[}G. Raghunath and A. B. Flatau, IEEE Trans. Magn. (in
   press)]. This work deals with discussing the evolution of magnetic
   domains in a 16 at.\% Ga single crystal Galfenol sample when subjected
   to magnetic fields in the < 110 > direction in the (100) plane. The
   magnetic domains on the surface of mechanically polished Galfenol
   samples were imaged using Magneto-Optic Kerr Effect microscopy.
   Simultaneously, the strains along the longitudinal and transverse < 110
   > directions were recorded using a bi-directional strain gauge rosette
   mounted on the unpolished bottom surface of the planar samples. The
   energy from the applied magnetic field is expected to grow the < 110 >
   oriented domains at the expense of domains oriented along all other
   directions. But since the plane has an easy < 100 > axis, we expect the
   domains to orient along the easy direction before saturating along the
   applied magnetic field direction. A correlation between the images
   recorded and the strains observed will be used to understand this shift
   of domains and bump in strain at low fields. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing

   show analytically and experimentally that the Poisson's ratio changes
   from positive to negative and vice versa during its folding motion. In
   addition, we verify the bistable mechanism of the reentrant 3D TMP under
   rigid origami configurations without relying on the buckling motions of
   planar origami surfaces. This study forms a foundation in designing and
   constructing TMP-based metamaterials in the form of bellowslike

Abstract = {{Tolerance intervals for discrete variables are widely used, especially
   in industrial applications. However, there is no thorough treatment of
   tolerance intervals when sampling without replacement. This paper
   proposes methods for constructing one-sided tolerance limits and
   two-sided tolerance intervals for hypergeometric and negative
   hypergeometric variables. Equal-tailed tolerance intervals (i.e.,
   tolerance intervals that control the percentages in both tails) are
   studied followed by a small adjustment to the nominal coverage level to
   obtain tolerance intervals that control a specified inner percentage of
   the sampled distribution. The tolerance interval calculations implicitly
   use confidence bounds for M, the unknown number of elements possessing a
   certain attribute in the finite population of size N. Three different
   methods for obtaining such confidence bounds are suggested: a large
   sample approach, an approach with a continuity correction, and an exact
   method based on nonrandomization. The intervals are examined for
   desirable coverage probabilities and expected widths. The methods are
   also illustrated using some examples.}},

Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{In this study we present an improved approach for the development of
   auxetics based on the use of deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) after a
   high-precision mask fabrication procedure. The whole process stands out
   for its precision (reaching nanometric detail), for the high aspect
   ratio (AR) attainable and for the possibility of promoting mass
   production. The quality of the proposed strategy is verified by the
   manufacture of an auxetic cantilever and bridged structures using two
   common planar auxetic geometries. The present process significantly
   increases the precision and AR of the micro-auxetics obtained when
   compared to state-of-the-art micromachining procedures and solves common
   challenges linked to structure adhesion to the substrate. The potential
   of the manufactured structures for the development of resonant
   structures is analyzed by means of finite-element-method-(FEM) based
   simulations, showing resonances in the megahertz range. A final
   application example, linked to monitoring cell culture processes upon
   auxetic scaffolds, is also proposed and analyzed by computational
   procedures. The initial cell culture results are also included and help
   to validate the scaffolds obtained and the materials used for future

Title = {{The epidemiology of regional and widespread musculoskeletal pain in
   rural versus urban settings in those >= 55 years}},
Journal = {{BRITISH JOURNAL OF PAIN}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{86-95}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: To examine whether the prevalence of regional and chronic
   widespread pain (CWP) varies with rurality and to determine the
   characteristics of persons in rural locations in whom pain is found to
   be in excess.
   Methods: Participants, aged >= 55 years, from participating general
   practices in seven different geographical locations in Scotland were
   sent a postal questionnaire. The 1-month prevalence of 10 regional pain
   conditions plus CWP was identified using body manikins. Differences in
   the prevalence of pain with differing rurality were examined using
   Chi(2) test for trend. Thereafter, among the rural population, the
   relationships between pain and putative risk factors were examined using
   Poisson regression. Thus, results are described as risk ratios.
   Results: There was some evidence to suggest that the prevalence of CWP
   increased with increasing rurality, although the magnitude of this was
   slight. No large or significant differences were observed with any
   regional pain conditions. Factors associated with the reporting of CWP
   included poor general health, feeling downhearted most of the time and
   selected measures of social contact. Factors independently associated
   with CWP included female gender (risk ratio: 1.24; 95\% confidence
   interval (CI): 0.997-1.55), poor self-rated health (risk ratio: 3.50;
   95\% CI: 1.92-6.39) and low mood (risk ratio: 1.54; 95\% CI: 1.07-2.20).
   Also, having fewer than 10 people to turn to in a crisis was associated
   with a decrease in the risk of CWP - risk ratio: 0.68 (95\% CI:
   0.50-0.93) and 0.78 (95\% CI: 0.60-1.02) for those with 5-10 and <5
   people, respectively.
   Conclusions: This study provides no evidence that the prevalence of
   regional musculoskeletal pain is increased in rural settings, although
   there is some evidence of a modest increase in CWP. Risk factors for CWP
   are similar to those seen in the urban setting, including markers of
   general health, mental health and also aspects of social contact. It may
   be, however, that social networks are more difficult to maintain in
   rural settings, and clinicians should be aware of the negative effect of
   perceived social isolation on pain in rural areas.}},

Title = {{A Targeted Infection Prevention Intervention in Nursing Home Residents
   With Indwelling Devices A Randomized Clinical Trial}},
Journal = {{JAMA INTERNAL MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{175}},

Pages = {{714-723}},

Abstract = {{IMPORTANCE Indwelling devices (eg, urinary catheters and feeding tubes)
   are often used in nursing homes (NHs). Inadequate care of residents with
   these devices contributes to high rates of multidrug-resistant organisms
   (MDROs) and device-related infections in NHs.
   OBJECTIVE To test whether a multimodal targeted infection program (TIP)
   reduces the prevalence of MDROs and incident device-related infections.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Randomized clinical trial at 12
   community-based NHs from May 2010 to April 2013. Participants were
   high-risk NH residents with urinary catheters, feeding tubes, or both.
   INTERVENTIONS Multimodal, including preemptive barrier precautions,
   active surveillance for MDROs and infections, and NH staff education.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was the prevalence
   density rate of MDROs, defined as the total number of MDROs isolated per
   visit averaged over the duration of a resident's participation.
   Secondary outcomes included new MDRO acquisitions and new clinically
   defined device-associated infections. Data were analyzed using a
   mixed-effects multilevel Poisson regression model (primary outcome) and
   a Cox proportional hazards model (secondary outcome), adjusting for
   facility-level clustering and resident-level variables.
   RESULTS In total, 418 NH residents with indwelling devices were
   enrolled, with 34 174 device-days and 6557 anatomic sites sampled.
   Intervention NHs had a decrease in the overall MDRO prevalence density
   (rate ratio, 0.77; 95\% CI, 0.62-0.94). The rate of new
   methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus acquisitions was lower in
   the intervention group than in the control group (rate ratio, 0.78; 95\%
   CI, 0.64-0.96). Hazard ratios for the first and all (including
   recurrent) clinically defined catheter-associated urinary tract
   infections were 0.54 (95\% CI, 0.30-0.97) and 0.69 (95\% CI, 0.49-0.99),
   respectively, in the intervention group and the control group. There
   were no reductions in new vancomycin-resistant enterococci or resistant
   gram-negative bacilli acquisitions or in new feeding tube-associated
   pneumonias or skin and soft-tissue infections.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Our multimodal TIP intervention reduced the
   overall MDRO prevalence density, new methicillin-resistant S aureus
   acquisitions, and clinically defined catheter-associated urinary tract
   infection rates in high-risk NH residents with indwelling devices.
   Further studies are needed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of this
   approach as well as its effects on the reduction of MDRO transmission to
   other residents, on the environment, and on referring hospitals.}},

Abstract = {{Double arrowhead honeycombs (DAHs) are a type of auxetic materials,
   i.e., showing negative Poisson's ratio (NPR), and are promising for
   energy absorption applications. Their in-plane impact responses are
   theoretically and numerically explored. Theoretical models for the
   collapse stress under quasi-static, low-velocity, and high-velocity
   impacts are developed, based upon the corresponding microstructural
   deformation modes. Obtained results show that the collapse stress under
   quasi-static and low velocity impacts depends upon the two re-entrant
   angles responsible for NPR, while it is insensitive to them under
   high-velocity impact. The developed theoretical models are employed to
   analyze the energy absorption capacity of DAHs, showing the absorbed
   energy under high-velocity impact approximately proportional to the
   second power of velocity. Extension of the high-velocity impact model to
   functionally graded (FG) DAHs is also discussed. Good agreement between
   the theoretical and finite element (FE) predictions on the impact
   responses of DAHs is obtained.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic yarn was successfully produced by a wrap filament and a core
   filament based on a ring-spinning system, which showed an auxetic effect
   when stretched, that is, expanding transversely under tension. Yarns
   were spun by different structural parameters of the core filament and
   the wrap filament, including diameter ratio, helical angle and tensile
   modulus of the wrap filament. Corresponding tensile tests were utilized
   to analyze the effects of structural parameters and performance on outer
   contour deformation of auxetic yarn. Experimental results showed that
   the outer contour of auxetic yarn expanded transversely under tension
   and there existed significant negative Poisson's ratio values in the
   Poisson's ratio-strain curve, and it was found that the auxetic effect
   became more observable with a higher diameter ratio of the core filament
   to the wrap filament, and lower helical angle and larger tensile modulus
   of the wrap filament. Moreover, compared with theoretical results by
   theoretical modeling in Part I, good relations of Poisson's ratio-strain
   curves were obtained between experimental and theoretical results. This
   proves the effectiveness of spinning auxetic yarn by selecting
   reasonable components of yarn and it is feasible to design yarn with a
   negative Poisson's ratio effect.}},

Abstract = {{Composite materials with periodic microstructures are commonly used in
   engineering. Numerical homogenization with finite element method (FEM)
   has proven fairly effective to determine the mechanical properties of a
   range of composite materials. However, traditional FEM fails to evaluate
   the effective mechanical properties for incompressible constituents due
   to volumetric locking problem in numerical analysis. In this paper, a
   novel selective smoothed finite element method (S-FEM) in multi-material
   domain using triangular and tetrahedral elements is proposed to overcome
   the locking problem in the numerical homogenization of incompressible
   materials. The implementation of S-FEM is easy without additional
   parameters. A number of characterization examples for porous,
   multiphase, tissue scaffold composites are presented to demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the proposed SFEM homogenization in handling

Title = {{Anemia among Primary School Children in Eastern Ethiopia}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 22}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Anemia during childhood impairs physical growth, cognitive development
   and school performance. Identifying the causes of anemia in specific
   contexts can help efforts to prevent negative consequences of anemia
   among children. The objective of this study was to assess prevalence and
   identify correlates of anemia among school children in Eastern Ethiopia.
   Methods
   A cross sectional study was conducted from January 2012 to February 2012
   in Kersa, Eastern Ethiopia. The study included randomly selected primary
   school students. Hemoglobin concentration was measured using a Hemocue
   haemoglobinometer. A child was identified as anemic if the hemoglobin
   concentration was < 11.5 g/dl for children (5-11 yrs) and < 12 g/dl for
   child older than 12 years age. Poisson regression model with robust
   variance was used to calculate prevalence ratios.
   Result
   The overall prevalence of anemia was 27.1\% (95\% CI: 24.98, 29.14):
   13.8\% had mild, 10.8\% moderate, and 2.3\% severe anemia. Children with
   in the age group of 5-9 years (APR, 1.083; 95\% CI, 1.044-1.124) were at
   higher risk for anemia. Paternal education (Illiterate, 1.109; 1.044
   -1.178) was positively associated with anemia. Children who had
   irregular legume consumption (APR, 1.069; 95\% CI, 1.022 -1.118) were at
   higher risk for anemia.
   Conclusion
   About a quarter of school children suffer from anemia and their
   educational potential is likely to be affected especially for those with
   moderate and severe anemia. Child age, irregular legume consumption, and
   low paternal schooling were associated with anemia. Intervention
   programmes aimed to reduce anemia among school children are crucial to
   ensure proper growth and development of children.}},

Title = {{Relationship between Guillain-Barre syndrome, influenza-related

Journal = {{VACCINE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{17}},
Pages = {{2045-2049}},
Month = {{APR 21}},
Abstract = {{Some studies reported an increased risk of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS)
   within six weeks of influenza vaccination. It has also been suggested
   that this finding could have been confounded by influenza illnesses. We
   explored the complex relationship between influenza illness, influenza
   vaccination, and GBS, from an ecologic perspective using nationally
   representative data. We also studied seasonal patterns for GBS
   hospitalizations.
   Monthly hospitalization data (2000-2009) for GBS, and pneumonia and
   influenza (P\&I) in the Nation-wide Inpatient Sample were included.
   Seasonal influenza vaccination coverage for 2004-2005 through the
   2008-2009 influenza seasons (August-May) was estimated from the National
   Health Interview Survey data. GBS seasonality was determined using
   Poisson regression. GBS and P\&I temporal clusters were identified using
   scan statistics. The association between P\&I and CBS hospitalizations
   in the same month (concurrent) or in the following month (lagged) were
   determined using negative binomial regression.
   Vaccine coverage increased over the years (from 19.7\% during 2004-2005
   to 35.5\% during 2008-2009 season) but GBS hospitalization did not
   follow a similar pattern. Overall, a significant correlation between
   monthly P\&I and GBS hospitalizations was observed (Spearman's
   correlation coefficient=0.7016, p < 0.0001). A significant (p = 0.001)
   cluster of P\&I hospitalizations during December 2004-March 2005
   overlapped a significant (p = 0.001) cluster of GBS hospitalizations
   during January 2005-February 2005. After accounting for effects of
   monthly vaccine coverage and age, P\&I hospitalization was significantly
   associated (p < 0.0001) with GBS hospitalization in the concurrent month
   but not with GBS hospitalization in the following month. Monthly vaccine
   coverage was not associated with GBS hospitalization in adjusted models
   (both concurrent and lagged). CBS hospitalizations demonstrated a
   seasonal pattern with winter months having higher rates compared to the
   month of June.
   P\&I hospitalization rates were significantly correlated with
   hospitalization rates for GBS. Vaccine coverage did not significantly
   affect the rates of GBS hospitalization at the population level.

Abstract = {{In coming decades, increasing temperatures are expected to impact crop
   yield and seed quality. To develop low input systems, the effects of
   temperature and sulfur (S) nutrition in oilseed rape, a high S demanding
   crop, need to be jointly considered. In this study, we investigated the
   effects of temperatures {[}High Temperature (HT), 33 degrees C/day, 19
   degrees C/night vs. Control Temperature (Ctrl T), 20 degrees C/day, 15
   degrees C/day] and S supply {[}High S (HS), 500 mu m SO42- vs. Low S
   (LS), 8.7 mu M SO42-] during seed filling on (i) yield components
   {[}seed number, seed dry weight (SDVV) and seed yield], (ii) grain
   composition {[}nitrogen (N) and S contents] and quality {[}fatty acid
   (FA) composition and seed storage protein (SSP) accumulation] and (iii)
   germination characteristics (pre-harvest sprouting, germination rates
   and abnormal seedlings). Abscisic acid (ABA), soluble sugar contents and
   seed conductivity were also measured. HT and LS decreased the number of
   seeds per plant. SDW was less affected due to compensatory effects since
   the number of seeds decreased under stress conditions. While LS had
   negative effects on seed composition by reducing the FA contents and
   increasing the ratio S-poor SSPs (12S globulins)/S-rich SSPs (2S
   albumins) ratio, HT had positive effects by increasing S and FA contents
   and decreasing the C18:2/C18:3 ratio and the 12S/2S protein ratio. Seeds
   produced under HT showed high pre-harvest sprouting rates along with
   decreased ABA contents and high rates of abnormal seedlings. HT and LS
   restriction significantly accelerated germination times. High
   conductivity, which indicates poor seed storage capacity, was higher in
   HT seeds. Consistently, the lower ratio of (raffinose +
   stachyose)/sucrose in HT seeds indicated low seed storage capacity. We
   demonstrated the effects of HT and LS on grain and on germination
   characteristics. These results suggest that hormonal changes might
   control several seed characteristics simultaneously.}},

Title = {{HIV Shedding from Male Circumcision Wounds in HIV-Infected Men: A
   Prospective Cohort Study}},
Journal = {{PLOS MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{12}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Background
   A randomized trial of voluntary medical male circumcision (MC) of
   HIV-infected men reported increased HIV transmission to female partners
   among men who resumed sexual intercourse prior to wound healing. We
   conducted a prospective observational study to assess penile HIV
   shedding after MC.
   Methods and Findings
   HIV shedding was evaluated among 223 HIV-infected men (183 self-reported
   not receiving antiretroviral therapy {[}ART], 11 self-reported receiving
   ART and had a detectable plasma viral load {[}VL], and 29 self-reported
   receiving ART and had an undetectable plasma VL {[}< 400 copies/ml]) in
   Rakai, Uganda, between June 2009 and April 2012. Preoperative and weekly
   penile lavages collected for 6 wk and then at 12 wk were tested for HIV
   shedding and VL using a real-time quantitative PCR assay. Unadjusted
   prevalence risk ratios (PRRs) and adjusted PRRs (adjPRRs) of HIV
   shedding were estimated using modified Poisson regression with robust
   variance. HIV shedding was detected in 9.3\% (17/183) of men not on ART
   prior to surgery and 39.3\% (72/183) of these men during the entire
   study. Relative to baseline, the proportion shedding was significantly
   increased after MC at 1 wk (PRR = 1.87, 95\% CI = 1.12-3.14, p = 0.012),
   2 wk (PRR = 3.16, 95\% CI = 1.94-5.13, p < 0.001), and 3 wk (PRR = 1.98,
   95\% CI = 1.19-3.28, p = 0.008) after MC. However, compared to baseline,
   HIV shedding was decreased by 6 wk after MC (PRR = 0.27, 95\% CI =
   0.09-0.83, p = 0.023) and remained suppressed at 12 wk after MC (PRR =
   0.19, 95\% CI = 0.06-0.64, p = 0.008). Detectable HIV shedding from MC
   wounds occurred in more study visits among men with an HIV plasma VL >
   50,000 copies/ml than among those with an HIV plasma VL < 400 copies/ml
   (adjPRR = 10.3, 95\% CI = 4.25-24.90, p < 0.001). Detectable HIV
   shedding was less common in visits from men with healed MC wounds
   compared to visits from men without healed wounds (adjPRR = 0.12, 95\%
   CI = 0.07-0.23, p < 0.001) and in visits from men on ART with
   undetectable plasma VL compared to men not on ART (PRR = 0.15, 95\% CI =
   0.05-0.43, p = 0.001). Among men with detectable penile HIV shedding,
   the median log(10) HIV copies/milliliter of lavage fluid was
   significantly lower in men with ART-induced undetectable plasma VL
   (1.93, interquartile range {[}IQR] = 1.83-2.14) than in men not on ART
   (2.63, IQR = 2.28-3.22, p < 0.001). Limitations of this observational
   study include significant differences in baseline covariates, lack of
   confirmed receipt of ART for individuals who reported ART use, and lack
   of information on potential ART initiation during follow-up for those
   who were not on ART at enrollment.
   Conclusion
   Penile HIV shedding is significantly reduced after healing of MC wounds.
   Lower plasma VL is associated with decreased frequency and quantity of
   HIV shedding from MC wounds. Starting ART prior to MC should be
   considered to reduce male-to-female HIV transmission risk. Research is
   needed to assess the time on ART required to decrease shedding, and the
   acceptability and feasibility of initiating ART at the time of MC.}},

Abstract = {{Using first-principles calculations we demonstrate for the first time
   that few-layer orthorhombic arsenic possesses a negative Poisson's
   ratio. For a single layer of arsenic, the negative Poisson's ratio is
   predicted to be similar to-0.09. As the number of layers increases, the
   magnitude of the negative Poisson's ratio increases and finally
   approaches a limit at four layers, becoming very close to the bulk value
   of -0.13. To understand these layerdependent negative Poisson's ratios,
   we propose a rigid mechanical model in which the intra-layer bond
   lengths and the normal Poisson's ratio of the in-layer plane play key
   roles. (C) 2015 The Japan Society of Applied Physics}},

Abstract = {{Systematic engineering of components that employ metamaterials has
   expanded the mechanical design field in recent years. Yet, topology
   optimization remains a burdensome tool to utilize within a systematic
   engineering paradigm. In this work, the design of a metamaterial shear
   beam for a nonpneumatic wheel using a systematic, two-level design
   approach is discussed. A top-level design process is used to determine
   the geometric and effective material properties of the shear beam, and
   linking functions are established and validated for the design of a
   shear layer mesoscale structure. At the metamaterial design level,
   innovative homogenization and topology optimization methods are employed
   to determine a set of locally optimal geometric designs for the shear
   layer. One geometry, the auxetic honeycomb, is shown to be an optimum to
   the minimum volume topology optimization problem for materials subjected
   to pure shear boundary conditions. As such, this geometry is identified
   as a candidate for the shear layer.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{89}},
Pages = {{100-120}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{We consider hybrid materials consisting of auxetic (material with
   negative Poisson's ratio) and non-auxetic phases. The auxetic phase is
   represented by either spherical or cubic inclusions. We analyse the
   effective characteristics (the Young's and shear moduli and the
   Poisson's ratio) computed using either the differential scheme for the
   effective moduli of composites or the direct finite element simulations.
   The results are verified through Hashin-Shtrikrnan bounds. We
   demonstrate that by creating hybrids from auxetic and non-auxetic phases
   one can obtain considerable increase in stiffness over the stiffnesses
   of the phases. The stiffening effect is controlled by the value of the
   Poisson's ratios of the phases, shape of the auxetic inclusions and
   their concentration. Depending upon the concentration, the hybrid can be
   made both auxetic and non-auxetic. Even when the inclusions are cubic
   the hybrid is still nearly isotropic; it becomes truly orthotropic only
   when the Poisson's ratio of the auxetic phase is very close to the
   thermodynamic limit of -1. These findings can be applied directly in
   designing a new class of hybrid materials with enhanced stiffness. (C)

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{137}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{This short brief develops a model for the velocity of longitudinal wave
   propagation in auxetic rods. Due to the large density change in auxetic
   solids and significant lateral deformation for Poisson's ratio between
   -1 and -0.5, this note takes into consideration density correction and
   lateral inertia. Results show that deviation from the elementary wave
   propagation model becomes more significant the more the Poisson's ratio
   of the rod material deviates from 1/4, in which the deviation of wave
   velocity is insignificant for Poisson's ratio in the positive range, but
   significant in the negative range. Specifically, the tensile and
   compressive wave velocity increases and decreases, respectively, for
   Poisson's ratio less than 1/4, but this trend reverses for Poisson's
   ratio greater than 1/4. In addition to showing that the elementary wave
   propagation model is invalid for describing the longitudinal wave
   velocity in auxetic rods, the results also suggest that auxetic
   materials are useful for applications that require slowing down and
   speeding up of compressive and tensile wave propagations, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{The influences of the cell-wall angle on the indentation resistance of
   the re-entrant hexagonal honeycombs with negative Poisson's ratio are
   studied by employing both the numerical tests and the theoretical
   analysis. In the numerical tests, two groups of honeycombs are
   investigated, i.e. the same-density group and the same-cell-wall group.
   It is shown that the honeycomb's indentation resistance increases with
   the cell-wall angle in the same-density group, while the cell-wall angle
   plays a minor role in the same-cell-wall group. The theoretical analysis
   is employed to explain the phenomena. The effect of the negative
   Poison's ratio is calculated to increase with the cell-wall angle. The
   average stress of the re-entrant honeycomb during compression is deduced
   as a function of the cell-wall angle and the cell-wall size or the
   honeycomb's relative density. The analytical results are consistent with
   the numerical tests and give an explanation for the phenomena in tests.}},

Title = {{Prevalence and correlates of HPV among women attending family-planning

Journal = {{BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{MAR 27}},
Abstract = {{Background: Cervical cancer is the most common cancer among women of
   reproductive age in Thailand. However, information on the prevalence and
   correlates of anogenital HPV infection in Thailand is sparse.
   Methods: HPV genotype information, reproductive factors, sexual
   behavior, other STI and clinical information, and cervical cytology and
   histology were assessed at enrollment among one thousand two hundred and
   fifty-six (n = 1,256) HIV negative women aged 20-37 from Thailand
   enrolled in a prospective study of the natural history of HPV. The
   type-specific prevalence of HPV was estimated using cervical swab
   specimens from healthy women and women with a diagnosis of CIN 2/3 at
   baseline. Prevalence ratios (95\% CI) were estimated using Poisson
   regression to quantify the association of demographic, behavioral, and
   clinical correlates with prevalent HPV infection.
   Results: Overall, 307 (24.6\%) and 175 (14.0\%) of women were positive
   for any HPV type and any HR-HPV type, respectively; the most common
   types were 72, 52, 62, and 16. Among women diagnosed with CIN 2/3 at
   enrollment (n = 11), the most prevalent HPV types were 52 and 16. In
   multivariate analysis, HPV prevalence at enrollment was higher among
   women with: long-term combined oral contraceptive use, a higher number
   of lifetime sexual partners, a prior Chlamydia infection, and a current
   diagnosis of Bacterial Vaginosis.
   Conclusion: The study findings provide important information that can be
   used in the evaluation of primary and secondary interventions designed
   to reduce the burden of cervical cancer in Thailand.}},

Abstract = {{The negative binomial (NB) is frequently used to model overdispersed
   Poisson count data. To study the effect of a continuous covariate of
   interest in an NB model, a flexible procedure is used to model the
   covariate effect by fixed-knot cubic basis-splines or B-splines with a
   second-order difference penalty on the adjacent B-spline coefficients to
   avoid undersmoothing. A penalized likelihood is used to estimate
   parameters of the model. A penalized likelihood ratio test statistic is
   constructed for the null hypothesis of the linearity of the continuous
   covariate effect. When the number of knots is fixed, its limiting null
   distribution is the distribution of a linear combination of independent
   chi-squared random variables, each with one degree of freedom. The
   smoothing parameter value is determined by setting a specified value
   equal to the asymptotic expectation of the test statistic under the null
   hypothesis. The power performance of the proposed test is studied with
   simulation experiments.}},

Abstract = {{The method for determining the Poisson's ratio of isotropic spheres was
   studied via resonant ultrasound spectroscopy (RUS). To that end, The

   via finite element method over the full range of Poisson's ratio (-1 to
   +0.5). RUS measurements for spherical samples (indium, steel, SiO2, 13.5
   wt\% In-Sn, and copper foam) were compared with the numerical results
   and the Poisson's ratios were determined as +0.4, +03, +0.2, -0.08, and
   -0.3, respectively. The effects of slight shape imperfection upon the
   first 12 modes were analyzed for various Poisson's ratios, and were
   found to be negligible in interpretation of the experimental results.

   polypropylene with branched shish-kebabs}},
Journal = {{POLYMER}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{60}},
Pages = {{274-283}},
Month = {{MAR 9}},
Abstract = {{Branched shish-kebabs (bimodal orientation of lamellae) were
   successfully fabricated in oriented isotactic polypropylene (iPP) by a
   strong shear flow provided by a modified injection molding (OSIM)
   technique. Simultaneous with the uniaxial tensile, the deformation
   behavior of this unique branched shish-kebabs was probed by in situ
   synchrotron X-ray scattering. Compared with the isotropic counterpart,
   branched shish-kebabs exhibited enhanced strength and modulus without
   obvious necking. During deformation, the initial separation of kebabs
   drove the rotation of branched lamellae towards the tensile direction
   with constant distance herein, which turned out to be an auxetic
   behavior. Subsequently, partial destruction of branched lamellae and
   significant lamellae slip of kebabs occurred, followed by reordering of
   kebabs and the residual branched lamellae accompanying the formation of
   new crystals with their c-axis along the tensile direction. On the
   whole, this work testified the validation of `stress-induced crystal
   fragmentation and recrystallization process' principle in the
   deformation of oriented samples. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Effect of roflumilast on exacerbations in patients with severe chronic
   obstructive pulmonary disease uncontrolled by combination therapy
   (REACT): a multicentre randomised controlled trial}},

Abstract = {{Background Roflumilast reduces exacerbations in patients with severe
   chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Its effect in patients using
   fixed combinations of inhaled corticosteroids and longacting beta(2)
   agonists is unknown. We postulated that roflumilast would reduce
   exacerbations in patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary
   disease at risk for exacerbations, even in combination with inhaled
   corticosteroid and longacting beta(2) agonist treatment.
   Methods For this 1-year double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel
   group, multicentre, phase 3-4 trial, the Roflumilast and Exacerbations
   in patients receiving Appropriate Combination Therapy (REACT) study, we
   enrolled patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease from
   203 centres (outpatient clinics, hospitals, specialised pulmonologists,
   and family doctors) in 21 countries. Eligible patients were 40 years of
   age or older with a smoking history of at least 20 pack-years and a
   diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with severe airflow
   limitation, symptoms of chronic bronchitis, and at least two
   exacerbations in the previous year. We used a computerised central
   randomisation system to randomly assign patients in a 1:1 ratio to the
   two treatment groups: roflumilast 500 mu g or placebo given orally once
   daily together with a fixed inhaled corticosteroid and longacting
   beta(2) agonist combination. Background tiotropium treatment was
   allowed. All patients and investigators were masked to group assignment.
   The primary outcome was the rate of moderate to severe chronic
   obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations per patient per year,
   analysed by intention to treat. This study is registered with
   ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT01329029.
   Findings Between April 3, 2011, and May 27, 2014, we enrolled 1945
   eligible participants and randomly assigned 973 to the roflumilast group
   and 972 to the placebo group. The rate of moderate-to-severe chronic
   obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations was 13.2\% lower in the
   roflumilast group than in the placebo group according to a Poisson
   regression analysis (roflumilast 0.805 vs placebo 0.927; rate ratio
   {[}RR] 0.868 {[}95\% CI 0.753-1.002], p=0.0529), and 14.2\% lower
   according to a predefined sensitivity analysis using negative binomial
   regression (0.823 vs 0.959; 0.858 {[}0.740-0.995], p=0.0424). Adverse
   events were reported by 648 (67\%) of 968 patients receiving roflumilast
   and by 572 (59\%) of 967 patients in the placebo group; adverse
   event-associated patient withdrawal from the study was also more common
   in the roflumilast group (104/968 {[}11\%]) than in the placebo group
   (52/967 {[}5\%]). The most frequently reported serious adverse events
   were chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations and pneumonia,
   and 17 (1.8\%) deaths occurred in the roflumilast group compared with 18
   (1.9\%) in the placebo group.
   Interpretation Our findings suggest that roflumilast reduces
   exacerbations and hospital admissions in patients with severe chronic
   obstructive pulmonary disease and chronic bronchitis who are at risk of
   frequent and severe exacerbations despite inhaled corticosteroid and
   longacting beta(2) agonist therapy, even in combination with tiotropium.}},

Abstract = {{Aims: To assess reports of dental pain in a school-based sample of
   children in South Brazil and test its association with socioeconomic,
   demographic, psychosocial, and clinical variables. Also, the
   consequences of dental pain on oral health perception and its impact on
   daily life were investigated. Methods: A two-stage cluster procedure was
   used to select 1,199 children in 20 public and private schools in
   Pelotas, Brazil. Children were interviewed to obtain self-reports of
   dental pain. They were also asked about perception of their oral health
   and dental fear. Mothers answered a questionnaire on socioeconomic
   characteristics. A clinical oral examination was conducted to assess
   dental caries, malocclusion, and dental trauma. Multivariate Poisson
   regression analysis was used to investigate factors associated with
   dental pain in the previous 6 months and its effect on oral health
   perception. Results: The prevalence of dental pain was 35.7\% (95\%
   confidence interval {[}CI] 33.0-38.5) in the previous 6 months. A higher
   prevalence of dental pain was observed for children from lower-income
   families (prevalence ratio {[}PR] 1.39; 95\% CI 1.10-1.76), for girls
   (PR 1.24; 95\% CI 1.06-1.46), for those living in overcrowded houses (PR
   1.23; 95\% CI 1.01-1.49), for those who reported dental fear (PR 1.19;
   95\% CI 1.00-1.42), and for those with caries experience (PR 1.57; 95\%
   CI 1.34-1.84), after adjustments. Dental pain presence influenced oral
   health perception (PR 2.56; 95\% CI 1.55-3.29) and impacted the
   children's daily life (PR 1.89; 95\% CI 1.64-2.17). Conclusion: A high
   percentage of schoolchildren suffered from dental pain, which was
   influenced by demographic, socioeconomic, psychosocial, and clinical
   characteristics, causing a negative impact on oral health perception.}},

Abstract = {{Consider a real-valued discrete-time stationary and ergodic stochastic
   process, called the noise process. For each dimension n, we can choose a
   stationary point process in R-n and a translation invariant tessellation
   of R-n. Each point is randomly displaced, with a displacement vector
   being a section of length n of the noise process, independent from point
   to point. The aim is to find a point process and a tessellation that
   minimizes the probability of decoding error, defined as the probability
   that the displaced version of the typical point does not belong to the
   cell of this point. We consider the Shannon regime, in which the
   dimension n tends to infinity, while the logarithm of the intensity of
   the point processes, normalized by dimension, tends to a constant. We
   first show that this problem exhibits a sharp threshold: if the sum of
   the asymptotic normalized logarithmic intensity and of the differential
   entropy rate of the noise process is positive, then the probability of
   error tends to 1 with n for all point processes and all tessellations.
   If it is negative then there exist point processes and tessellations for
   which this probability tends to 0. The error exponent function, which
   denotes how quickly the probability of error goes to 0 in n, is then
   derived using large deviations theory. If the entropy spectrum of the
   noise satisfies a large deviations principle, then, below the threshold,
   the error probability goes exponentially fast to 0 with an exponent that
   is given in closed form in terms of the rate function of the noise
   entropy spectrum. This is obtained for two classes of point processes:
   the Poisson process and a Matern hard-core point process. New lower
   bounds on error exponents are derived from this for Shannon's additive
   noise channel in the high signal-to-noise ratio limit that hold for all
   stationary and ergodic noises with the above properties and that match
   the best known bounds in the white Gaussian noise case.}},

Volume = {{14}},

Abstract = {{Clinical studies in overactive bladder have traditionally used analysis
   of covariance or nonparametric methods to analyse the number of
   incontinence episodes and other count data. It is known that if the
   underlying distributional assumptions of a particular parametric method
   do not hold, an alternative parametric method may be more efficient than
   a nonparametric one, which makes no assumptions regarding the underlying
   distribution of the data. Therefore, there are advantages in using
   methods based on the Poisson distribution or extensions of that method,
   which incorporate specific features that provide a modelling framework
   for count data. One challenge with count data is overdispersion, but
   methods are available that can account for this through the introduction
   of random effect terms in the modelling, and it is this modelling
   framework that leads to the negative binomial distribution. These models
   can also provide clinicians with a clearer and more appropriate
   interpretation of treatment effects in terms of rate ratios. In this
   paper, the previously used parametric and non-parametric approaches are
   contrasted with those based on Poisson regression and various extensions
   in trials evaluating solifenacin and mirabegron in patients with
   overactive bladder. In these applications, negative binomial models are
   seen to fit the data well. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECOLOGICAL STATISTICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{1, SI}},
Pages = {{145-160}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The presence and abundance of standing dead trees (SDTs) in forests is
   typically characterized by an excess number of zeros and high variation.
   The variability inherent in SDT data naturally leads to the assessment
   of novel quantitative methods to represent SDT populations and their
   role in contributing to forest ecosystem structure. This analysis
   assessed the performance of count regression methods fit with Bayesian
   mixed-effects models that estimate SDTs (all dead trees with a diameter
   at breast height >= 12.7 cm found on plots 0.07-ha in size) on over
   17,000 forest inventory plots across the US Lake States (Michigan,
   Minnesota, and Wisconsin). Random effects models that used the
   independent variables basal area, mean annual temperature, and plot
   ownership (i.e., publicly- or privately-owned) as fixed effects and
   forest type as a random effect outperformed a method which used
   fixed-effects, alone. Standard and zero-inflated negative binomial
   models were effective in accounting for overdispersion present in the
   data (variance/mean ratio for SDT counts was 72.6), whereas Poisson
   count models were not. Random effects were calibrated on a new
   population of SDTs. Employing informative prior distributions from the
   developed model led to improved estimates of SDT abundance by reducing
   root mean square error by seven percent. This analysis highlights an
   approach that uses existing models for representing population averages
   while calibrating their local random effects with new data to arrive at
   improved estimates of SDTs across the region.}},

Abstract = {{There are concerns that emerging resistance to fluoroquinolones (FQ) may
   be leading to increasing rates of gram-negative rod (GNR) bacteremia in
   hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients. We set out to describe
   time trends in the incidence rates of GNR bacteremia and FQ-resistant
   GNR bacteremia in HCT recipients during an era of levofloxacin
   prophylaxis. We conducted a longitudinal retrospective study of adults
   undergoing allogeneic HCT between 2003 and 2012 at the Seattle Cancer
   Care Alliance (SCCA). Annual trends in the incidence rates of GNR
   bacteremia and FQ-resistant GNR bacteremia through 100 days after
   transplantation were assessed using Poisson regression. Cox proportional
   hazards regression was used to compare 30-day mortality between patients
   with FQ-resistant and those with FQ-sensitive GNR bacteremia. Of the
   2306 patients included in this cohort, 280 (12.1\%) had GNR bacteremia.
   The incidence rates of GNR bacteremia and FQ-resistant GNR bacteremia
   increased from 2003 to 2009 and decreased afterwards; however, the
   overall annual trends were not significant (incidence rate ratio
   {[}IRR], 1.01; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI], .98 to 1.05; IRR, 1.01;
   95\% CI, .95 to 1.08, respectively). FQ-resistant GNR bacteremia was
   associated with increased mortality compared with FQ-sensitive GNR
   bacteremia, even after adjustment for underlying disease severity,
   conditioning regimen, and age at transplantation (hazard ratio, 2.11;
   95\% CI, 1.06 to 4.23). On average, rates of FQ-resistant GNR bacteremia
   have not significantly changed over 10 years of FQ prophylaxis, although
   FQ-resistant GNR bacteremia is associated with increased mortality
   compared with FQ-sensitive GNR bacteremia. (C) 2015 American Society for

Abstract = {{The main content dealt with in the paper is to make a theoretical
   analysis of the contour diameter of auxetic yarn under tension, which
   expands transversely under axial tension. The auxetic yarn is designed
   by two components, that is, a core filament and a wrap filament.
   Compared with the wrap filament, the core filament is thicker, softer
   and much more extensible. In the initial status, the core filament is
   straight in the center of the auxetic yarn and the wrap filament wraps
   the core filament helically in a certain helical angle. Based on
   theoretical analysis, the formula of negative Poisson's ratio of
   stretched auxetic yarn is obtained. It is found that the value of
   Poisson's ratio is related to axial strain, helical angle and the
   diameter ratio of the core filament to the wrap filament. An applied
   example is presented to verify the Poisson's ratio value-strain curve of
   auxetic yarn. In order to better investigate effects on negative
   Poisson's ratio, the effect of different parameters of yarn, including
   mesh size, diameter ratio, tensile modulus and helical angle of the wrap
   filament, is investigated using finite element analysis based on ABAQUS
   software to analyze the negative Poisson's ratio of auxetic yarn when
   stretched. It verified that yarn spun by two different components
   produced a negative Poisson's ratio effect under tension and structure
   parameters of auxetic yarn significantly affected negative Poisson's
   ratio values. It is expected that this study could help us understanding
   the deformation mechanism of auxetic yarn under axial tension load.}},

Abstract = {{A numerical analysis using the finite element (FE) method was conducted
   to investigate the deformation behavior of a novel three-dimensional
   (3D) textile structure made by a special arrangement of the weft and
   warp yarns in a 3D orthogonal structure to achieve negative Poisson's
   ratio (NPR). The minimum number of unit cells required for the FE
   analysis was first determined by comparing the calculating results of
   Poisson's ratio values based on the FE models built with fixed
   structural parameters and yarn properties. Then Poisson's ratio values
   of the 3D textile structure with different structural parameters and
   yarn properties under compression were calculated using the FE models
   built with the determined unit cells. The calculating results show that
   the 3D structure can achieve NPR in one direction if the weft and warp
   yarns used have different bending stiffness and radii. This numerical
   analysis can provide useful information for the design and fabrication
   of this kind of 3D textile structure, which has high potential
   applications in composite reinforcement and other technical areas.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE. To assess the impact of a novel, silver-coated needleless
   connectors (NCs) on central-line-associated bloodstream infection
   (CLABSI) rates compared with a mechanically identical NCs without a
   silver coating.
   DESIGN. Prospective longitudinal observation study
   SETTING. Two 500-bed university hospitals
   PATIENTS. All hospitalized adults from November 2009 to June 2011 with
   non-hemodialysis central lines
   INTERVENTIONS. Hospital A started with silver-coated NCs and switched to
   standard NCs in September 2010; hospital B started with standard NCs and
   switched to silver-coated NCs. The primary outcome was the difference
   revealed by Poisson multivariate regression in CLABSI rate using
   standard Centers for Disease Control and Prevention surveillance
   definitions. The secondary outcome was a comparison of organism-specific
   CLABSI rates by NC type.
   RESULTS. Among 15,845 hospital admissions, 140,186 central-line days and
   221 CLABSIs were recorded during the study period. In a multivariate
   model, the CLABSI rate per 1,000 central-line days was lower with
   silver-coated NCs than with standard NCs (1.21 vs 1.79; incidence rate
   ratio = 0.68 {[}95\% CI: 0.52-0.89], P=.005). A lower CLABSI rate per
   1,000 central-line days for the silver-coated NCs versus the standard
   NCs was observed with S. aureus (0.11 vs 0.30, P=.02), enterococci (0.10
   vs 0.27, P=.03), and Gram-negative organisms (0.28 vs 0.63, P=.003) but
   not with coagulase-negative staphylococci (0.31 vs 0.36) or Candida spp.
   (0.42 vs 0.40).
   CONCLUSIONS. The use of silver-coated NCs decreased the CLABSI rate by
   32\%. CLABSI reduction efforts should include efforts to minimize
   contamination of NCs.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Multi-drug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase
   (KPC)-2-producing K. pneumoniae are an increasing cause of
   healthcare-associated infections worldwide.
   Aims: To investigate the impact of clinical infection on mortality, and
   examine the effect of use of KPC-2-specific polymerase chain reaction
   (PCR) on the time to contact isolation during an outbreak.
   Methods: Cases were defined as patients clinically infected or colonized
   with KPC-2-producing K. pneumoniae between June 2010 and July 2012.
   Cases were described by demographic and health characteristics, and the
   association between infection and mortality, adjusted for comorbidities
   and demographic characteristics, was determined using Poisson regression
   with robust standard errors. A comparison was made between the time to
   contact isolation with a culture-based method and PCR using Wilcoxon's
   rank sum test.
   Findings: Of 72 cases detected, 17 (24\%) had undergone transplantation
   and 21 (29\%) had a malignancy. Overall, 35 (49\%) cases were clinically
   infected, with pneumonia and sepsis being the most common infections.
   Infection was an independent risk factor for mortality (risk ratio 1.67,
   95\% confidence interval 0.99-2.82). The median time to contact
   isolation was 1.5 days (range 0-21 days) using PCR and 5.0 days (range
   0-39 days) using culture-based methods (P = 0.003). Intermittent
   negative tests were observed in 48\% (14/29) of cases tested using
   culture-based methods.
   Conclusion: KPC-2-producing K. pneumoniae mainly affect severely ill
   patients. Half of the cases developed clinical infection, associated
   with increased risk of death. As PCR accelerates isolation and provides
   the opportunity for preventive measures in colonized cases, its use
   should be implemented promptly during outbreaks. Further studies are
   needed to enhance knowledge about KPC detection patterns and to adjust
   screening guidelines. (C) 2015 The Healthcare Infection Society.

Abstract = {{Background In patients with HIV, immune reconstitution after
   antiretroviral therapy (ART) is often incomplete. We assessed the
   probability of patients reaching a CD4/CD8 ratio of 1 or more after the
   start of ART and its association with the onset of non-AIDS-defi ning
   events and death.
   Methods We did an analysis of the ICONA cohort, which recruited
   treatment-naive patients with HIV in Italy. We included participants in
   the cohort who started ART, reached an undetectable viral load (<= 80
   copies per mL), and had a CD4/CD8 ratio of less than 0.8 at the time of
   an undetectable viral load. We defined ratio normalisation in patients
   as two consecutive values of 1 or more. We used Kaplan-Meier curves to
   estimate the cumulative probability of ratio normalisation. We then used
   Poisson regression models to identify factors independently associated
   with normalisation and with progression to non-AIDS-defi ning events or
   death.
   Findings We included 3236 participants, enrolled between Jan 22, 1997,
   and Feb 25, 2013. At the start of ART, median CD4/CD8 ratio in our
   population was 0.39 (IQR 0.26-0.55). 458 (14\%) patients reached a
   CD4/CD8 ratio of 1 or more; the estimated probability of normalisation
   was 4.4\% (95\% CI 3.7-5.2) by 1 year from baseline, 11.5\% (10.2-13.0)
   by 2 years, and 29.4\% (26.7-32.4) by 5 years. Factors associated with
   normalisation were high pre-ART CD4 cell counts, a high CD4/CD8 ratio at
   baseline, and negative cytomegalovirus serological findings. The
   incidence rate of non-AIDS-defi ning events for patients with a CD4/CD8
   ratio of less than 0.30 (4.2 per 100 patient-years, 95\% CI 3.4-5.3) was
   double that for those with a ratio of 0.30-0.45 (2.3, 2.1-2.5) or more
   than 0.45 (2.2, 1.7-2.9). A ratio of less than 0.30 was independently
   associated with an increased risk of non-AIDS-defi ning events or death
   compared with one of more than 0.45.
   Interpretation Few patients had normalised CD4/CD8 ratios, even though
   they had viral suppression. Low ratios were associated with increased
   risk of serious events and deaths. The CD4/CD8 ratio could be used by
   clinicians to identity patients at risk of non-AIDS-related events.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports the tensile deformation behavior of an auxetic
   warp-knitted spacer fabric structure by using the finite element (FE)
   method. The precise geometry of the outer layer structure of the fabric
   was firstly obtained from a micro X-ray computerized tomography scan and
   then inputted to an ANSYS 13.0 software to generate geometrical models.
   The geometrical models were then meshed using the PLANE 183 element to
   build FE models. Based on the FE models built, deformation behaviors of
   the auxetic fabric in the course direction and wale direction were
   simulated and compared with experimental results. The FE analysis showed
   that the simulated fabric deformations at different tensile strains were
   very close to the real fabric deformations and the FE-generated
   Poisson's ratio-strain curves agreed well with the experimental ones.
   Therefore, the FE models could be used for predicting the deformation
   behaviors of the auxetic warp-knitted spacer fabric stretched in
   different fabric plane directions.}},

Abstract = {{We use first-principles method to investigate the effects of external
   strain epsilon on the structural, mechanical and electronic properties
   for the superconductor Nb2InC. The results show that the tensile strain
   induces an isostructural phase transition in Nb2InC. The elastic
   constants C-ij, bulk modulus B, shear modulus G, Young's moduli E, and
   Poisson ratio v(ij) of Nb2InC were also investigated in the range from
   epsilon=-10\% to epsilon=10\%. It indicates that Nb2InC is mechanically
   stable under external strain, and its brittle-ductile transition occurs
   at epsilon=3.5\%. Moreover, Nb2InC gets a negative Poisson ratio at
   epsilon=4\%. The calculated electronic structures indicate that the Nb-C
   bonding is stronger than Nb-In bonding in Nb2InC. The energy band
   structures and densities of states of strained Nb2InC were also
   calculated and discussed in detail. From these calculations, it is clear
   that the related properties of Nb2InC can be easily tuned by strain.
   Therefore, our findings are very useful to tailor the physical
   properties of Nb2InC by using strain engineering. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The thermodynamic, elastic, and electronic properties of D0(22)-type
   Al3V and Al3Nb intermetallics were studied using the first-principle
   method. The results showed the pressure has profound effects on the
   structural, mechanical and electronic properties in both Al3V and Al3Nb.
   Thermodynamically, the formation enthalpies for Al3V and Al3Nb were
   derived, which agreed well with available experimental and theoretical
   values. Comparably, Al3Nb was a more stable phase with the more negative
   H-f than Al3V. Mechanically, the calculated elastic constants showed
   linearly increasing tendencies, and satisfied the Born's criteria from
   0-20 GPa, indicating the mechanically stability of Al3V and Al3Nb under
   this pressure range. Further, the mechanical parameters (i.e., bulk
   modulus (B), shear modulus (G), and Young's modulus (E)) were derived
   using the Voigt-Reuss-Hill (VRH) method, and in good agreement with
   available experimental results at the ground state. All these parameters
   presented the linearly increasing dependences on the external pressure.
   The B/G ratios and Poisson's ratio indicated that the Al3V and Al3Nb
   crystals should exhibit brittle behavior at 0-20 GPa. Additionally, the
   bulk modulus can be obtained through fitting the Birch-Murnaghan
   equation (B-0), computing by VRH method (B-H), and deriving from the
   elastic theory (B-relax) in both intermetallics. The uniformity of these
   calculated bulk moduli in each compound exhibited the excellent
   reliability and self-consistency. In addition, Debye temperature was
   estimated from the average sound velocity. The Debye temperature showed
   an increasing dependence on the pressures. Finally, through density of
   states analysis, Al3V and Al3Nb were suggested to possess naturally
   metallic behavior. Under pressures, it was noted that the shapes of
   peaks and pseudogaps exhibited relative few changes, suggesting Al3V and
   Al3Nb has kept structurally stable up to 20 GPa. At zero pressure, Al3Nb
   was considered as a more structurally stable phase with the more number
   of bonding electrons per atom than Al3V. This conclusion was in
   consistent with the one drawn from the thermodynamic analysis. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{A 2D metastable carbon allotrope, penta-graphene, composed entirely of
   carbon pentagons and resembling the Cairo pentagonal tiling, is
   proposed. State-of-the-art theoretical calculations confirm that the new
   carbon polymorph is not only dynamically and mechanically stable, but
   also can withstand temperatures as high as 1000 K. Due to its unique
   atomic configuration, penta-graphene has an unusual negative Poisson's
   ratio and ultrahigh ideal strength that can even outperform graphene.
   Furthermore, unlike graphene that needs to be functionalized for opening
   a band gap, penta-graphene possesses an intrinsic quasi-direct band gap
   as large as 3.25 eV, close to that of ZnO and GaN. Equally important,
   penta-graphene can be exfoliated from T12-carbon. When rolled up, it can
   form pentagon-based nanotubes which are semiconducting, regardless of
   their chirality. When stacked in different patterns, stable 3D twin
   structures of T12-carbon are generated with band gaps even larger than
   that of T12-carbon. The versatility of penta-graphene and its
   derivatives are expected to have broad applications in nanoelectronics
   and nanomechanics.}},

Abstract = {{Metamaterials are inherently advantageous in achieving designable
   auxeticity since their Poisson' ratios are determined by the geometry of

   printing. The effects of material selections and stiff material fraction
   on the Poisson's ratio, equivalent Young's Modulus, and maximum volume
   reduction were investigated. The results from finite element analysis
   (FEA) and mechanical testing indicated that the auxeticity and
   mechanical properties of this dual-material auxetic metamaterial (DMAM)
   are distinctly different from those of traditional single-material
   auxetic metamaterials (SMAMs). The interesting properties of DMAMs could
   be valuable to various engineering applications such as smart materials,

Title = {{Hierarchical Auxetic Mechanical Metamaterials}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{FEB 11}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic mechanical metamaterials are engineered systems that exhibit the
   unusual macroscopic property of a negative Poisson's ratio due to
   sub-unit structure rather than chemical composition. Although their
   unique behaviour makes them superior to conventional materials in many
   practical applications, they are limited in availability. Here, we
   propose a new class of hierarchical auxetics based on the rotating rigid
   units mechanism. These systems retain the enhanced properties from
   having a negative Poisson's ratio with the added benefits of being a
   hierarchical system. Using simulations on typical hierarchical
   multi-level rotating squares, we show that, through design, one can
   control the extent of auxeticity, degree of aperture and size of the
   different pores in the system. This makes the system more versatile than
   similar non-hierarchical ones, making them promising candidates for
   industrial and biomedical applications, such as stents and skin grafts.}},

Title = {{Targeted screening for third-generation cephalosporin-resistant
   Enterobacteriaceae carriage among patients admitted to intensive care
   units: a quasi-experimental study}},
Journal = {{CRITICAL CARE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{19}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Identification of third-generation,
   cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (3GC-RE) carriers by rectal
   screening at admission seems to be an important step in the prevention
   of transmission and outbreaks; however, little is known about its
   effectiveness. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of
   `targeted screening' at patient admission to intensive care units (ICUs)
   on the incidence of 3GC-RE hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) and
   compare it to `universal screening'.
   Methods: We undertook a quasi-experimental study of two ICUs (unit A:
   intervention group; unit B: control group) at a university-affiliated
   hospital between 1 January 2008 and 31 December 2011. In unit A,
   patients were screened universally for 3GC-RE at admission during period
   1 (1 January 2008 through 30 September 2010). During period 2 (2011
   calendar year), the intervention was implemented in unit A; patients
   transferred from another unit or hospital were screened selectively. In
   unit B, all patients were screened throughout periods 1 and 2.
   3GC-RE-related HAI incidence rates were expressed per 1,000
   patient-days. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were examined by multivariate
   Poisson regression modelling.
   Results: In unit A, 3GC-RE-related HAI incidence rates decreased from
   5.4 (95\% confidence interval (CI), 4.1 to 7.0) during period 1 to 1.3
   (95\% CI, 0.5 to 2.9) during period 2 (P < 0.001). No changes were
   observed in unit B between periods 1 and 2 (P = 0.5). In unit A, the
   adjusted incidence of 3GC-RE-related HAIs decreased in period 2 compared
   with period 1 (adjusted IRR, 0.3; 95\% CI, 0.1 to 0.9; P = 0.03)
   independently of temporal trend, trauma and age. No changes were seen in
   unit B (P = 0.4). The total number of rectal swabs taken showed an 85\%
   decrease in unit A between period 1 and 2 (P < 0.001).
   Conclusions: Targeted screening of 3GC-RE carriers at ICU admission was
   not associated with an increase in 3GC-RE-related HAI incidence compared
   with universal screening. Total number of rectal swabs decreased
   significantly. These findings suggest that targeted screening may be
   worth assessing as an alternative to universal screening.}},

Journal = {{MALARIA JOURNAL}},

Volume = {{14}},

Abstract = {{Background: Intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy
   (IPTp) with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) decreases placental
   parasitaemia, thus improving birth outcomes. Zambian policy recommends
   monthly SP-IPTp doses given presumptively during pregnancy at each
   antenatal examination, spaced one month apart after 16 weeks of
   gestation. The effectiveness of SP-IPTp was evaluated in Zambia where a
   recent study showed moderate prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum
   parasites with genetic mutations that confer SP resistance.
   Methods: HIV-negative women were enrolled at the time of delivery at two
   facilities in Mansa, Zambia, an area of high malaria transmission. Women
   were interviewed and SP exposure was determined by antenatal card
   documentation or self-reports. Using Poisson regression modelling, the
   effectiveness of SP-IPTp was evaluated for outcomes of parasitaemia
   (microscopic examination of maternal peripheral, cord, and placental
   blood films), maternal anaemia (Hb < 11 g/dl), placental infection
   (histopathology), and infant outcomes (low birth weight (LBW), preterm
   delivery, and small for gestational age) in women who took 0-4 doses of
   SP-IPTp.
   Results: Participants included 435 women, with a median age of 23 years
   (range 16-44). Thirty-four women took zero doses of SP-IPTp, while 115,
   142 and 144 women took one, two, or >= three doses, respectively.
   Multivariate Poisson regression models considering age, mosquito net
   usage, indoor residual spraying, urban home, gravidity, facility, wet
   season delivery, and marital status showed that among paucigravid women
   >= two doses of SP-ITPp compared to one or less doses was associated
   with a protective effect on LBW (prevalence ratio (PR) 0.33, 95\%
   confidence interval (CI) 0.12-0.91) and any infection (PR 0.76, CI
   0.58-0.99). Multivariate models considering SP-IPTp as a continuous
   variable showed a protective dose-response association with LBW
   (paucigravid women: PR 0.54, CI 0.33-0.90, multigravid women: PR 0.63,
   CI 0.41-0.97).
   Conclusions: In Mansa, Zambia, an area of moderate SP resistance, >= two
   doses of SP-IPTp were associated with a protective effect from malaria
   in pregnancy, especially among paucigravid women. Each dose of SP-IPTp
   contributed to a 46 and 37\% decrease in the frequency of LBW among
   paucigravid and multigravid women, respectively. SP-IPTp remains a
   viable strategy in this context.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND Cholesterol- overloaded high- density lipoprotein ( HDL)
   particles exert a negative impact on the antiatherogenic function of HDL
   in experimental studies. However, it remains unclear whether
   cholesterol- overloaded HDL particle is involved in the development of
   atherosclerosis in humans. OBJECTIVES The objective of this study was to
   explore whether cholesterol- overloaded HDL particles are associated
   with the progression of carotid atherosclerosis in a cardiovascular
   disease- free population. METHODS Baseline HDL particle number was
   measured using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy in 930
   participants ages 45 to 74 years in a community- based cohort study. An
   estimate of cholesterol molecules per HDL particle ( HDL- C/ P ratio)
   was calculated as the ratio of HDL cholesterol to HDL particles. HDL- C/
   P ratio was categorized as < 41.0 ( lowest), 41.0 to 46.9, 47.0 to 52.9,
   and \$ 53.0 ( highest) using a fixed increment method. Modified Poisson
   regression was used to assess the association between HDL- C/ P ratio
   and 5- year progression of carotid atherosclerosis as indicated by
   progression of carotid plaques and change in total plaque area ( TPA).
   RESULTS Mean baseline HDL- C/ P ratio was 46.4 9.3 ( range 23.8 to
   86.9). Baseline HDL- C/ P ratio was significantly associated with 5-
   year progression of carotid atherosclerosis. Participants with the
   highest HDL- C/ P ratio had 1.56- fold ( 95\% confidence interval: 1.14
   to 2.13; p 0.006) increased progression compared with those with the
   lowest level. Among participants without baseline plaque, TPA in re-
   examination was larger by 9.4 mm2 in the subgroup with the highest level
   when compared with the lowest level. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest
   that cholesterol- overloaded HDL particles are independently associated
   with the progression of carotid atherosclerosis. This may explain why in
   recent trials raising HDL cholesterol was not beneficial. This study
   strongly suggests that the combination of cholesterol content and
   particle number determines the antiatherogenic function of HDLs, rather
   than either parameter alone. ( J Am Coll Cardiol 2015; 65: 355- 63) c

Title = {{Determining the elastic constants of hydrocarbons of heavy oil products

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},

Pages = {{124-130}},

Abstract = {{We have performed a molecular dynamics study in order to verify the
   assumption that saturated hydrocarbons can be characterized by
   generalized Hook's law using the fourth rank tensor of elastic
   constants. In this study normal paraffins were treated as crystals of
   hexagonal symmetry. Thus, we obtained original numerical values of
   Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio in both anisotropic and isotropic
   planes and the values of the shear modulus at three different
   temperatures.
   Negative Poisson's ratio of n-paraffins is of a particular interest. The
   author believes that auxetic behavior of saturated hydrocarbons is the
   result of their liquid-crystalline nature. Another remarkable point is
   the non-linear elasticity of n-paraffins detected in a wide temperature
   range. This provides an additional experimental confirmation of the
   phase transition process of hydrocarbons earlier reported in scientific
   works.
   We have shown that the matrix of elasticity of a particular heavy
   petroleum product can be estimated using the elastic parameters of the
   n-paraffins obtained. The numerical values of five independent elastic
   constants are directly proportional to the composition of a heavy
   petroleum product. The simplified representation of the composition can
   be defined by a few saturated hydrocarbons with different carbon
   numbers.
   The numerical results obtained in this research may be useful for those
   interested in heavy petroleum fractions rheology as well as those who
   perform numerical studies in petroleum hydrodynamics and acoustics. (C)

Abstract = {{Chiral systems may exhibit auxetic behavior, i.e. they may have a
   negative Poisson's ratio. This particular property has led to their
   being studied extensively by several authors. A Finite Elements Study is
   presented here, investigating the mode of connection between the nodes
   and ligaments in the anti-tetrachiral structure. The results show that
   the amount of gluing material used to attach the ligaments to the node
   will not affect the Poisson's ratio, but may have a large influence on
   the observed stiffness of the structure (Young's modulus). It is also
   shown that the stiffness of the glue will have a large effect on the
   mode of deformation of the chiral system. This change in mechanism was
   found to effect the stiffness of the structure but not its Poisson's

Abstract = {{Background: Men who have sex with men (MSM) represent over half of new
   HIV infections in the United States. It is important to understand the
   factors associated with engaging in risky sexual behavior to develop
   effective prevention interventions. Binge drinking (>= 5 drinks on >= 1
   occasion) is the most common form of excessive alcohol consumption. This
   study examines the relationship between binge drinking and sexual risk
   behaviors among MSM who are current drinkers and who were either
   HIV-negative or unaware of their HIV status.
   Methods: Using the 2011 National HIV Behavioral Surveillance system and
   multivariable Poisson models with robust error estimates, we assessed
   the association between binge drinking and sexual risk behaviors among
   current drinkers. Prevalence ratios (PR) and 95\% confidence intervals
   (CI) are presented.
   Results: Overall, 85\% of MSM were current drinkers, and 59\% of MSM who
   drank reported >= 1 episode of binge drinking in the preceding 30 days.
   In multivariable models, binge drinking was associated with condomless
   anal intercourse (CAI) at last sex with an HIV-positive or unknown
   status partner (receptive: PR 1.3,95\% CI 1.1-1.6; insertive: PR
   1.2,95\% CI 1.0-1.4), having exchanged sex for money or drugs at last
   sex (PR: 1.4, 95\% CI 1.1-1.7), having concurrent partners in the past
   year (PR: 1.1, 95\% CI 1.1-1.2), and having more CAI partners in the
   past year (PR: 1.2, 95\% CI 1.0-1.4) compared to non-binge drinkers.
   Conclusions: Evidence-based strategies for reducing binge drinking could
   help reduce risky sexual behavior among MSM. Published by Elsevier

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOLIDS AND STRUCTURES}},

Pages = {{192-214}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a study on the auxetic behaviour of the materials
   composed of hollow spheres. Although, as a newly developed material, the
   hollow sphere structures have gained a great deal of scientific
   attention, few studies have acknowledged its auxetic performance.
   Auxetic materials or materials with a negative Poisson's ratio have been
   a subject of intensive research due to their unusual and, in many
   extents, superior mechanical properties. A number of different auxetic
   systems that have been developed commonly based on designing special
   geometry of the material microstructure. However, in the hollow sphere
   structures, this mechanism is essentially different and the auxetic
   effect is attributed to the peculiarities of deformation of a thin-wall
   hollow sphere and to the interaction between the spheres in the
   assembly. In this study it is shown that the negative Poisson's ratio in
   this material is due to the high ratio between tangential to normal
   stiffnesses of a thin-wall hollow sphere. To evaluate the mechanical
   properties of these materials a homogenisation procedure based on the
   Cosserat 3D continuum theory is adopted. In this procedure, an assembly
   of the flexible thin-wall spheres is modelled as a stack of rigid
   spheres connected by a set of linear springs. The developed continuum
   model is validated against the direct finite element analysis of a
   regular assembly of the hollow spheres. Influence of the various design
   parameters on the macroscopic mechanical behaviour of the hollow sphere
   materials is investigated. The numerical study is focused on the auxetic
   behaviour of various kinds of packing arrangements of the hollow
   spheres. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Numerical Investigation on Dynamic Crushing Behavior of Auxetic
   Honeycombs with Various Cell-Wall Angles}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic honeycombs have proven to be an attractive advantage in actual
   engineering applications owing to their unique mechanical characteristic
   and better energy absorption ability. The in-plane dynamic crushing
   behaviors of the honeycombs with various cell-wall angles are studied by
   means of explicit dynamic finite element simulation. The influences of
   the cell-wall angle, the impact velocity, and the edge thickness on the
   macro/microdeformation behaviors, the plateau stresses, and the specific
   energy absorption of auxetic honeycombs are discussed in detail.
   Numerical results show, that except for the impact velocity and the edge
   thickness, the in-plane dynamic performances of auxetic honeycombs also
   rely on the cell-wall angle. The ``><{''}-mode local deformation bands
   form under low-ormoderate-velocity impacting, which results in lateral
   compression shrinkage and shows negative Poisson's ratio during the
   crushing. For the given impact velocity, the plateau stress at the
   proximal end and the energy-absorbed ability can be improved by
   increasing the negative cell angle, the relative density, the impact
   velocity, and the matrix material strength. When the microcell
   parameters are the constant, the plateau stresses are proportional to
   the square of impact velocity.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To determine the absolute and relative risk of acute
   appendicitis during the antepartum and postpartum periods compared with
   the time outside pregnancy among women of childbearing age.
   Background: Acute appendicitis is the most common nonobstetric surgical
   emergency during pregnancy. Estimates of the incidence of acute
   appendicitis in pregnancy remain imprecise and inconsistent.
   Methods: All potential fertile women aged 15 to 44 years registered
   within Clinical Practice Research Datalink with linkages to the Hospital
   Episodes Statistics between 1997 and 2012 were identified. Absolute
   rates of acute appendicitis were calculated during the antepartum and
   postpartum periods and were compared with the time outside pregnancy in
   terms of incidence rate ratio (IRR) using a Poisson regression model.
   Results: Among 1,624,804 women, there were 362,219 pregnancies resulting
   in live or stillbirths. Compared with the time outside pregnancy, the
   rate of acute appendicitis was 35\% lower during the antepartum period
   {[}IRR, 0.65; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 0.55-0.76], with the lowest
   rate reported during the third trimester (IRR, 0.47; 95\% CI, 0.35-0.64)
   for all ages; no increased risk of acute appendicitis was observed in
   the postpartum period compared with the time outside pregnancy among
   women aged 15 to 34 years but an 84\% increased risk for women older
   than 35 years (IRR, 1.84; 95\% CI, 1.18-2.86). The highest and lowest
   rates of negative appendectomy were encountered in the second and the
   third trimesters, respectively.
   Conclusions: Pregnant women are less likely to be diagnosed with acute

Abstract = {{Mechanical metamaterials are artificial structures with unusual
   properties, such as negative Poisson ratio, bistability or tunable
   vibrational properties, that originate in the geometry of their unit
   cell(1-5). Often at the heart of such unusual behaviour is a soft mode:
   a motion that does not significantly stretch or compress the links
   between constituent elements. When activated by motors or external
   fields, soft modes become the building blocks of robots and smart
   materials. Here, we demonstrate the existence of topological soft modes
   that can be positioned at desired locations in a metamaterial while
   being robust against a wide range of structural deformations or changes
   in material parameters(6-10). These protected modes, localized at
   dislocations in deformed kagome and square lattices, are the mechanical
   analogue of topological states bound to defects in electronic
   systems(11-14). We create physical realizations of the topological modes
   in prototypes of kagome lattices built out of rigid triangular plates.
   We show mathematically that they originate from the interplay between
   two Berry phases: the Burgers vector of the dislocation and the
   topological polarization of the lattice. Our work paves the way towards
   engineering topologically protected nanomechanical structures for
   molecular robotics or information storage and read-out.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetics are materials showing a negative Poisson's ratio. This
   characteristic leads to unusual mechanical properties that make this an
   interesting class of materials. So far no systematic approach for
   generating auxetic cellular materials has been reported. In this
   contribution, we present a systematic approach to identifying auxetic
   cellular materials based on eigenmode analysis. The fundamental
   mechanism generating auxetic behavior is identified as rotation. With
   this knowledge, a variety of complex two-dimensional (2D) and
   three-dimensional (3D) auxetic structures based on simple unit cells can
   be identified.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports a theoretical analysis of deformation behavior of an
   innovative 3D auxetic structure. Both bending deformation and
   cross-sectional deformation of the yarns in a representative unit of the
   structure were first analyzed to establish the relationships among
   different geometrical parameters and yarn modulus. Then, the Poisson's
   ratio values of the structure under different compression strains were
   theoretically calculated and compared with the experimental results.
   Based on the validation of the theoretical analysis, the effects of
   different structural parameters and yarn modulus on the negative
   Poisson's ratio behavior of the structure were finally predicted and
   discussed. The results obtained from the analysis would be very useful
   for the optimization of the negative Poisson's ratio behavior of 3D
   auxetic structure.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials are characterized by getting thiner/larger in
   tension/compression. This counterintuitive behavior is advantageous in
   specific applications such as self-expandable stents. There are
   currently some stents that make use of this behavior, nevertheless there

   Additionally, Pure Magnesium is a promising material to manufacture
   bioabsorbable stents. This study presents the modelation of novel
   auxetic self-expanding stents based in Reentrant and Chiral geometries.
   They are simulated using Finite Element analysis to determine the
   presence of negative Poisson's ratios and if they are a possible
   solution for further stent development. It is concluded that such
   modelations show low values of Poisson's ratio and may be a viable
   possibility to obtain a new generation of self-expanding stents.}},

Abstract = {{Advances in biotechnology have made possible the production of a large
   number of new proteins important to the food, pharmaceutical, and
   chemical industry. The significance of aqueous two-phase systems (ATPSs)
   in downstream processing with commercial application has been reported
   for the separation of a large number of biopharmaceutical products. For
   both industrial-and laboratory-scale purposes it is essential to know
   the partitioning behaviour of biomolecules and which parameters lead to
   an optimal separation {[}1]. ATPS process design and implementation at a
   large scale is limited by the poor understanding of the molecular
   mechanism behind the solute partitioning. A better understanding of the
   molecular mechanism of the factors, which govern partitioning,
   contributes for the prediction of the partitioning behaviour in ATPSs.
   The approach is based on a thermodynamic cycle where the polar and
   nonpolar contributions to the free energy of transfer are assumed to be
   additive. The total free energy of transfer was experimentally obtained
   by determination of the proteins partitioning coefficient. Electrostatic
   energy contributions were estimated using a Poisson-Boltzmann
   computational method. The nonpolar contribution was obtained as a
   difference between the total free energy of transfer and the
   electrostatic contribution and related with the solvent accessible
   surface area. This methodology was already successfully applied to the
   partitioning of amino acids in ATPSs {[}2]. In this study partitioning
   of a 14 globular proteins, was examined in 4 different polymer/polymer
   ATPSs. The model performance was analysed regarding to the influence of
   different PDB structure and protein charges. Nonpolar energy
   contribution was related with the solvent accessible surface area, by
   linear relationship. Using a semi-empirical model, it was possible to
   predict the partition coefficient of several proteins in four different
   polymer/polymer systems. The model shows improved prediction capacity
   when applied to the group of protein with the same electrostatic
   characteristic (positive or negative charge proteins).}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic foam was a new kind of material which exhibit negative Poisson's
   ratio effect. It has a wide application prospect. However, auxetic foam
   would gradually expand to its original volume with time increasing, and
   the negative Poisson's ratio effect will disappear. The practical use of
   the auxetic foam has been limited, and it becomes an urgent problem to
   be solved before its application. The preparation conditions and the
   recovery ability of auxetic foam, the 60 ppi open cell polyurethane (PU)
   foam was used as the parent material. The PU foams were compressed in
   three dimensions and been heat treated at setting temperatures. After
   cooling down, the auxetic foams were made. In this study, all samples
   were set with the same radial compression ratio, but three different
   axial compression ratios. During the heat treatment process, the setting
   temperatures were 140 degrees C, 150 degrees C and 160 degrees C
   respectively. It was found that the setting temperature in the condition
   of this study should be heated until 150 degrees C to obtain the
   re-entrant structure.}},

Abstract = {{The Poisson's ratio of materials describes the ratio of the transverse
   to axial strain. While most materials exhibit non-negative Poisson
   ratio, here we focus on the topological properties of negative ratio
   materials also known as auxetic constructs. Digital modelling and
   physical fabrication are employed to generate and test experimental
   auxetic configurations. The first set of studies employ 2D space-filling
   tessellations integrating both negative and positive Poisson ratio
   cells. The tessellations are designed through binary state transitions
   and gradual morphing transitions. A second set of studies explores the
   topological optimization of a single negative Poisson cell configuration
   following the logic that a cell constitutes the building block of
   auxetic materials. The third set of studies focuses on the translation
   of heterogeneous Poisson ratio 2D tessellations into 3D constructs.
   Here, two methods of fabrication are explored: lamination method and
   cellular grading. The precision of the cellular grading method renders
   it particularly suitable for multi-material 3D printing fabrication
   which is theoretically studied and proposed. Space-filling heterogeneous
   tessellation studies are applied to architectural and product design
   proposals. These proposals exhibit properties that could serve to design
   and develop further research on real-world applications.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials are modern class of materials that have recently been
   gaining popularity within the research community due to their enhanced
   mechanical properties. Unlike conventional materials, they exhibit a
   negative Poisson's ratio when subjected to a uniaxial loading. This
   present research experimentally investigates the crush response and
   energy absorption performances of auxetic foam-filled square tubes under
   axial loading. For comparison, the crush response and energy absorption
   of empty and conventional foam-filled squares tubes have also been
   examined with respect to deformation modes and force displacement curve.
   Standard compression tests were conducted on a series number of
   thin-walled tube samples. An additional compression test on conventional
   and auxetic foam has also been conducted to observe the behavior of foam
   itself. It is evident that the auxetic foam-filled square tubes are
   superior to empty and conventional foam-filled square tubes in terms of
   energy absorption capacity. It shows that such tube is preferable as an
   impact energy absorber due to their ability to withstand axial loads
   effectively. Furthermore, it is found that the load capacity increases
   as the crush length increases. The primary outcome of this study is
