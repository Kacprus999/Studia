Journal = {{CARBON}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{We investigated through fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulations,
   the mechanical behavior (compressive and tensile) and energy absorption
   properties of two families (primitive (P688 and P8bal) and gyroid (G688
   and G8bal)) of carbon-based schwarzites. Our results show that all
   schwarzites can be compressed (with almost total elastic recovery)
   without fracture to more than 50\%, one of them can be even remarkably
   compressed up to 80\%. One of the structures (G8bal) presents negative
   Poisson's ratio value (auxetic behavior). The crush force efficiency,
   the stroke efficiency and the specific energy absorption (SEA) values
   show that schwarzites can be effective energy absorber materials.
   Although the same level of deformation without fracture observed in the
   compressive case is not observed for the tensile case, it is still very
   high (30-40\%). The fracture dynamics show extensive structural
   reconstructions with the formation of linear atomic chains (LACs). (C)

   solid solution: From unary to quaternary}},
Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{172}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{Bridging both the edges and the center of multicomponent space, which
   have been widely investigated in traditional alloys and high entropy
   alloys respectively, is significant but difficult in the design of
   alloys. In this paper, the single-crystal elastic constant model of the
   quaternary BCC Nb-Ti-V-Zr system across full composition space was
   established using first principles combined with the CALPHAD model. The
   accuracy of the model was confirmed by comparing with previous
   calculations and experiments. Using the fitted model, the alloying
   effect on stability and polycrystalline elastic properties of the
   current research system was analyzed. We find that there exists an area
   where BCC becomes unstable, and all the instability is caused by
   breaking C-11-C-12 > 0. And all of the stable Nb-Ti-V-Zr is ductile. In
   addition, there lies a surface on which the alloys are completely
   isotropic in elasticity. Furthermore, some alloys promising in some
   special aspects are predicted, such as gum metal, directional auxetic
   properties and biomedical application materials.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{172}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{The stability, elastic moduli and deformation behavior of graphene-based
   diamond-like phases are examined by molecular dynamics simulations.
   Three important criteria are considered to study stability of the
   structure within applied methods. Molecular dynamics simulations are
   performed to derive stiffness and compliance coefficients, and
   stress-strain curves under hydrostatic compression of diamond-like
   phases. The analysis of elastic properties (Poisson's ratio, Young's
   modulus and shear modulus) is carried out. Analytical calculations are
   used. From the obtained stability criteria, it is found that only two
   graphene-based diamond-like phases, LA3 and LA6, instead of eight known,
   can be considered stable in molecular dynamics approach. Young's
   modulus, measured in linear elastic regime, of stable phases
   orientationally dependent: values in different directions can differ two
   times. Analysis of the variability of shear modulus showed that for LA6
   values are much higher than for LA3. Again, shear modulus are
   orientation-dependent for some directions. In non-elastic regime, stable
   diamond-like phases can be stretched until 0.012 and compressed until
   0.1. The main mechanisms of non-elastic deformation is stretching of the
   covalent bonds and valent angles.}},

Abstract = {{This paper extends the univariate zero-and-one inflated Poisson (ZOIP)
   distribution (Melkersson \& Olsson, 1999; Zhang et al., 2016) to its
   multivariate version, which can be used to model correlated multivariate
   count data with large proportions of zeros and ones marginally. More
   importantly, this new multivariate ZOIP distribution possesses a
   flexible dependency structure: i.e., the correlation coefficient between
   any two random components could be either positive or negative depending
   on the values of the parameters. The important distributional properties
   are explored and some useful statistical inference methods without and
   with covariates are developed. Simulation studies are conducted to
   evaluate the performance of the proposed methods. Finally, two real data
   sets on healthcare and insurance are used to illustrate the proposed

Abstract = {{Metamaterials are engineered structural materials with special
   mechanical properties (e.g., negative Poisson's ratio) that are not
   found in nature materials. The properties of the metamaterials can be
   tailored by designing the cellular structure at the mesoscale.
   Additively manufactured metamaterial structures provide new
   opportunities for the development of next-generation functional
   lightweight vehicle components. This paper proposes a general method for
   the design optimization of the metamaterial infilled structure component
   under transient, dynamic loads (i.e., when gradient information is not
   available). We propose to integrate the addition correction-based
   multi-fidelity approach with the Probabilistic Multi-Phase Sampling
   Strategy, which maximizes the information gain of a limited number of
   sample points. The propose method continuously improves the
   predictability of the multi-fidelity surrogate model during the
   iterative optimal search process. This method is demonstrated on two
   benchmark problems: optimization of a 2D cellular metamaterial structure
   under static tensile loads and optimization of a pseudo 3D cellular
   metamaterial structure under transient dynamic loads. In both cases, the
   proposed method finds the optimal design with fewer number of expensive,
   high-fidelity design evaluations than the traditional design
   optimization methods.}},

Abstract = {{The geometry of a composite frusta-conical structure with 20 degrees

   topology solver was used to perform optimization process. The structure
   was subjected to an axial compressive quasi-static loading where the
   criterion of optimization is the largest absorption of energy per unit
   volume. The optimization resulted in concave shell geometry with a
   volume reduction of 15\%. To compare the effect of geometry on energy
   absorption capability, two types of GFRP specimen with different
   thickness were fabricated using filament winding and hand lay-up
   methods. The axial crushing test results were validated with numerical
   analysis using the commercial finite element software ABAQUS. The
   collapse mode and failure mechanism were investigated and identified.
   The presented methodology helps to find the better geometry instead of
   testing different geometries.}},

Abstract = {{The nonlinear bending behavior of nanocomposite laminated plates with
   negative Poisson's ratios (NPR) is reported. Each ply of the plate is
   made of carbon nanotube-reinforced composites (CNTRCs) and may have
   different CNT volume fractions and the CNTRC plies are arranged in the
   thickness direction in a piece-wise functionally graded pattern. The
   plate is supposed to be rested on a two-parameter elastic foundation and
   is exposed in a thermal environment. The temperature-dependent material
   properties of the CNTRCs are evaluated using an extended Voigt (rule of
   mixture) model. The governing equations for the nonlinear bending of
   FG-CNTRC laminated plates are based on Reddy's third order shear
   deformation plate theory and solved by using a two-step perturbation
   approach. Analytical solutions are obtained which include the
   geometrical nonlinearity in the von Karman sense, the thermal effects
   and the plate-foundation interaction. The effect of NPR on the nonlinear
   bending responses of FG-CNTRC laminated plates under different loading
   conditions are investigated comparatively according to the graphical
   results. It is explicitly shown that NPR has a significant effect on the
   nonlinear bending responses of CNTRC laminated plates.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports the tensile and impact deformation behavior of an
   auxetic warp-knitted fabric by using the finite element method. The
   geometrical model of the fabric was obtained from experimental fabric.
   Tensile and impact deformation behaviors of different auxetic
   geometrical models were simulated based on the Abaqus software. The
   finite element (FE) analysis showed that the FE simulation could well
   predict the tensile and impact behaviors of the auxetic fabric. The
   auxetic effect of auxetic fabric structural model is related to the
   angle theta and the long/short rib ratios. The impact resistance of
   auxetic fabric structural model is also related to angle theta and
   impact velocity; however it is nothing to do with the long/short rib
   ratios.}},

Abstract = {{This study aimed to explore the association between schoolchildren's

   Perceptions Questionnaire (CPQ) and examined for oral health conditions.
   Contextual variables were obtained from school coordinators regarding
   the social environment. Data analysis was performed through multilevel
   Poisson regression. A high negative impact on OHRQoL was found for
   participants who were girls, older, had very severe malocclusion, had
   dental trauma and caries, and had mothers with less schooling. A
   negative impact on OHRQoL was also found for children who attended
   schools in which police security was required (rate ratios {[}RR] =

   in the last year (RR = 1.17; 95\% CI: 1.02-1.35). The need for police
   security was associated with a negative impact on the emotional

Month = {{APR 30}},
Abstract = {{Profiling analysis aims to evaluate health care providers, such as
   hospitals, nursing homes, or dialysis facilities, with respect to a
   patient outcome. Previous profiling methods have considered binary
   outcomes, such as 30-day hospital readmission or mortality. For the
   unique population of dialysis patients, regular blood works are required
   to evaluate effectiveness of treatment and avoid adverse events,
   including dialysis inadequacy, imbalance mineral levels, and anemia
   among others. For example, anemic events (when hemoglobin levels exceed
   normative range) are recurrent and common for patients on dialysis.
   Thus, we propose high-dimensional Poisson and negative binomial
   regression models for rate/count outcomes and introduce a standardized
   event ratio measure to compare the event rate at a specific facility
   relative to a chosen normative standard, typically defined as an
   ``average{''} national rate across all facilities. Our proposed
   estimation and inference procedures overcome the challenge of
   high-dimensional parameters for thousands of dialysis facilities. Also,
   we investigate how overdispersion affects inference in the context of
   profiling analysis. The proposed methods are illustrated with profiling
   dialysis facilities for recurrent anemia events.}},

Title = {{Mechanical characterization of 3D printed, non-planar lattice structures
   under quasi-static cyclic loading}},
Journal = {{RAPID PROTOTYPING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{707-717}},
Month = {{JAN 27}},
Abstract = {{Purpose
   While additive manufacturing via melt-extrusion of plastics has been
   around for more than several decades, its application to complex
   geometries has been hampered by the discretization of parts into planar
   layers. This requires wasted support material and introduces anisotropic
   weaknesses due to poor layer-to-layer adhesion. Curved-layer
   manufacturing has been gaining attention recently, with increasing
   potential to fabricate complex, low-weight structures, such as
   mechanical metamaterials. This paper aims to study the fabrication and
   mechanical characterization of non-planar lattice structures under
   cyclic loading.
   Design/methodology/approach
   A mathematical approach to parametrize lattices onto Bezier surfaces is
   validated and applied here to fabricate non-planar lattice samples via
   curved-layer fused deposition modeling. The lattice chirality, amplitude
   and unit cell size were varied, and the properties of the samples under
   cyclic-loading were studied experimentally.
   Findings
   Overall, lattices with higher auxeticity showed less energy dissipation,
   attributed to their bending-deformation mechanism. Additionally,
   bistability was eliminated with increasing auxeticity, reinforcing the
   conclusion of bending-dominated behavior. The analysis presented here
   demonstrates that mechanical metamaterial lattices such as auxetics can
   be explored experimentally for complex geometries where traditional
   methods of comparing simple geometry to end-use designs are not
   applicable.
   Originality/value
   This work presents an experimental approach to study the mechanical
   properties of non-planar lattice structures via quasi-static cyclic
   loading, comparing variations across several lattice patterns including
   auxetic sinusoids, disrupted sinusoids and their equivalent-density
   quadratic patterns.}},

Title = {{Structural topology optimization with positive and negative Poisson's
   ratio materials}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING COMPUTATIONS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1805-1822}},
Month = {{JAN 25}},
Abstract = {{Purpose
   Negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) material has huge potential applications
   in various industrial fields. However, lower Young's modulus due to the
   porous form limits its further applications. Based on the topology
   optimization technique, this paper aims to optimize the structure
   consisting two isotropic porous materials with positive Poisson's ratio
   (PPR) and NPR and void.
   Design/methodology/approach
   Under prescribed dual-volume fraction constraints, the structural
   compliance is taken as the objective. Young's modulus and Poisson's
   ratio are, respectively, interpolated and expressed with Lame's
   parameters for easier programming. Accordingly, the sensitivities can be
   derived through the chain rule. Several two- and three-dimensional
   illustrative examples are presented to demonstrate the capability and
   effectiveness of the proposed approach. The influences of Poisson's
   ratios, volume fractions and Young's moduli on the optimized results are
   investigated.
   Findings
   For NPR materials having unique load responses, the resulting topologies
   of PPR and NPR materials have distinct material distributions in
   comparison of the results from two PPR materials. Furthermore, it is
   observed that higher structural stiffness can be achieved from the
   hybrid of PPR and NPR materials than that obtained from the structures
   made of individual constituent materials.
   Originality/value
   A topology optimization methodology is proposed to design structures
   composed of PPR and NPR materials.}},

Title = {{Modelling the number of antenatal care visits in Bangladesh to determine
   the risk factors for reduced antenatal care attendance}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 24}},
Abstract = {{The existence of excess zeros in the distribution of antenatal care
   (ANC) visits in Bangladesh raises the research question of whether there
   are two separate generating processes in taking ANC and the frequency of
   ANC. Thus the main objective of this study is to identify a proper count
   regression model for the number of ANC visits by pregnant women in
   Bangladesh covering the issues of overdispersion, zero-inflation, and
   intra-cluster correlation with an additional objective of determining
   risk factors for ANC use and its frequency. The data have been extracted
   from the nationally representative 2014 Bangladesh Demographic and
   Health Survey, where 22\% of the total 4493 women did not take any ANC
   during pregnancy. Since these zero ANC visits can be either structural
   or sampling zeros, two-part zero-inflated and hurdle regression models
   are investigated along with the standard one-part count regression
   models. Correlation among response values has been accounted for by
   incorporating cluster-specific random effects in the models. The hurdle
   negative binomial regression model with cluster-specific random
   intercepts in both the zero and the count part is found to be the best
   model according to various diagnostic tools including likelihood ratio
   and uniformity tests. The results show that women who have poor
   education, live in poor households, have less access to mass media, or
   belong to the Sylhet and Chittagong regions are less likely to use ANC
   and also have fewer ANC visits. Additionally, women who live in rural
   areas, depend on family members' decisions to take health care, and have
   unintended pregnancies had fewer ANC visits. The findings recommend
   taking both cluster-specific random effects and overdispersion and
   zero-inflation into account in modelling the ANC data of Bangladesh.
   Moreover, safe motherhood programmes still need to pay particular
   attention to disadvantaged and vulnerable subgroups of women.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Little is known about the impact of psychosocial factors and
   substance use on viral suppression among human immunodeficiency virus
   (HIV)-infected key populations in resource-limited settings.
   Accordingly, we examined the association and interactions between
   depression, alcohol use, and recreational drug use on viral suppression
   among men who have sex with men (MSM) and people who inject drugs (PWID)
   in India.
   Methods. MSM and PWID were recruited across India using
   respondent-driven sampling (RDS). Correlates of viral suppression were
   determined using Poisson regression models incorporating RDS-II weights.
   Two-way multiplicative interactions were assessed with separate models
   of all combinations of the 3 variables of interest using interaction
   terms; 3-way interactions were evaluated by stratifying 2-way
   interactions by the third variable.
   Results. Among 1454 treatment-eligible HIV-infected MSM and 1939 PWID,
   older age (adjusted prevalence ratio {[}aPR], 1.14 for MSM; 1.41 for
   PWID) and higher HIV treatment literacy (aPR, 1.58 for MSM; 3.04 for
   PWID) were positively associated with viral suppression. Among MSM,
   there was evidence of a synergistic negative association between severe
   depression and recreational drug use (aPR, 0.37 {[}95\% confidence

Title = {{Mechanical responses of 3D cross-chiral auxetic materials under uniaxial
   compression}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{186}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic material is a metamaterial engineered to achieve negative
   Poisson's ratios through special design of microstructure. As a typical
   3D auxetic material, 3D cross-chiral structures (CCS) possesses
   significant auxetic behavior and the mechanical properties can be tuned
   over a wide range. In this paper, mechanical responses of CCS are
   systematically investigated by experiments, numerical simulations and
   theoretical analysis. Three typical failure modes are observed during
   the compression process. As the tilt angle of struts increases, the CCS
   shows a transition from the compression-dominated to the
   bending-dominated deformation mechanism. The Young's modulus of the CCS
   can be enhanced 8.5 times, simply by changing the angle of the strut by
   20 degrees. The CCS can also show a higher energy absorption capacity
   with absorption efficiency of about 50\%, which is higher than most
   previously reported cellular materials. Additionally, a new theoretical
   model based on large deformation theory is established to predict the
   plastic yield stress, and good agreement is obtained with the numerical
   simulations and experiments, which indicates that the present model can
   significantly improve the accuracy of the estimation. The results of
   this paper may be helpful for designing of energy absorbing devices and
   personal protection with 3D auxetic materials. (c) 2019 The Authors.

Abstract = {{Auxetic metamaterials have received wide attention due to their
   idiosyncratic physical properties. In this paper, experiments and
   simulations were performed to study the mechanical and acoustic
   properties of a 3D anti-chiral auxetic metamaterial subjected to
   quasi-static loading. The results shows that Poisson's ratio of the
   designed metamaterial can be changed from -0.45 to 0.35 with different
   cell parameters. Acoustic tests show that the designed metamaterial
   provides an ultra-wide phononic bandgap and exhibits outstanding wave
   attenuation properties. By applying rational tensile/compression force,
   the bandgap is widened/narrowed, which indicates the tunability of the
   bandgap through deformation. Moreover, the bandgap tuning is through all
   high symmetry points in the Brillouin zone due to the iso-auxeticity of
   the metamaterial. This study provides a possible way for controlling the
   bandgap with the deformable metamaterial.}},

   physical properties of concrete}},
Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{230}},
Month = {{JAN 10}},
Abstract = {{The plastic because of its lightweight and flexibility to adopt the
   required shapes has led in an enormous increase in production of plastic
   products during recent years. To minimize the negative environmental
   impacts of plastic waste, many industrial sectors have tried to recycle
   and utilize the plastic waste. Among the other sectors, concrete
   industry can be considered as one of the alternatives such as to use the
   recycled plastic as aggregate replacement in concrete. A processed
   lightweight aggregates (PLA) has been manufactured using the plastic
   waste and other local materials using a compression moulding press
   technique. The detailed characterization of the PLA was also conducted.
   In addition, the effect of PLA incorporation on the physical properties
   of concrete along with effect of curing temperature on the compressive
   strength was also tested. The addition of manufactured aggregate in
   concrete has increased the Poisson's ratio, thermal conductivity values
   while the density, and compressive strength were found to be reduced as
   compared to control mix. It was also noticed that PLA concrete can be
   cured at temperatures up to 30 degrees C, without significantly
   affecting compressive strength. The PLA has shown the prospective to be
   used in lightweight concrete applications. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All

Journal = {{ADVANCED ENGINEERING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Metamaterials can be designed to contain functional gradients with
   negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) that have counterintuitive behavior
   compared with monolithic materials. These NPR materials, referred to as
   auxetics, are relevant to engineering sciences because of their unique
   mechanical expansion. Previous studies have explored compliant actuators
   using analytical and numerically derived mechanics of materials
   principles. However, the control of compliant gradient mechanisms
   frequently uses complex analytical equations combined with traditional
   control algorithms, making them difficult to design. To confront the
   design processes and computational load, herein, machine learning is
   used to predict errors in compliant auxetic designs based on a
   mathematically optimal deformation. Finite element analysis and
   experimental specimens validate the theoretical mechanical behavior of a
   specific auxetic configuration as well as demonstrate the capabilities
   of additive manufacturing of graded auxetic materials. Pseudorandomized
   images and their respective computational deformation results are used
   to train a regressive model and predict the deviation from optimal
   behavior. The model predicts the deviation from the desired behavior
   with a mean average percent error below 5\% for the validation set.
   Subsequently, a scalable workflow design process connecting the unique
   performance of auxetics to machine learning design predictions is
   proposed.}},

Month = {{JAN 9}},
Abstract = {{Following the advent of electromagnetic metamaterials, researchers
   working in wave physics have translated concepts of engineered media to
   acoustics, elastodynamics and diffusion processes. In elastodynamics,
   seismic metamaterials have emerged in the last decade for soft soils
   structured at the meter scale, and have been tested with full-scale
   experiments on holey soils. Born in the soil, seismic metamaterials have
   emerged from the field of tuned-resonators buried in the soil, around
   building's foundations or near the soil-structure interface as local
   seismic isolators. Forests of trees have been interpreted as
   above-surface resonators, and coined natural seismic metamaterials. We
   first review some advances made in seismic metamaterials and dress an
   inventory of which material parameters can be achieved and which cannot,
   from the effective medium theory perspective. We envision future
   developments of large scale auxetic metamaterials for building's
   foundations, above surface resonators for seismic protection and
   metamaterial-like transformed urbanism at the city scale. (C) 2019

Abstract = {{Designing new two-dimensional (2D) materials, exploring their unique
   properties and diverse potential applications are of paramount
   importance to condensed matter physics and materials science. In this
   work, we predicted a novel 2D SN2 monolayer (S-SN2) by means of density
   functional theory (DFT) computations. In the S-SN2 monolayer, each S
   atom is tetracoordinated with four N atoms, and each N atom bridges two
   S atoms, thus forming a tri-sublayer structure with square lattice. The
   monolayer exhibits good stability, as demonstrated by the moderate
   cohesive energy, all positive phonon modes, and the structural integrity
   maintained through 10 ps molecular dynamics simulations up to 1000 K. It
   is an indirect-bandgap semiconductor with high hole mobility, and the
   bandgap can be tuned by changing the thickness and external strains (the
   indirect-bandgap to direct-bandgap transition occurs when the biaxial
   tensile strain reaches 4\%). Significantly, it has large Young's modulus
   and three-dimensional auxetic properties (both in-plane and out-of-plane
   negative Poisson's ratios). Therefore, the S-SN2 monolayer holds great
   potential applications in electronics, photoelectronics and mechanics.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the cyclic response of the wrought magnesium alloy ZM21
   is investigated. The microstructure of the original extruded bar
   consists of equiaxed grains with a grain size range of 15-18 mu m. The
   anelasticity was measured using a method in which the elastic modulus in
   every loop is obtained by calculating the slope of lines fitted to the
   loading and unloading parts of the curves. The cyclic test for ZM21
   shows that the anelastic strain increases with the strain, reaching its
   maximum between 2-4\% applied strain and then levels off. The anelastic
   strain reaches a maximum between 2-4\% at which point the fraction of
   extension twins also reaches a maximum. Twins were separated from their
   parent grains in order to quantify twin evolution during cyclic loading.
   Overall, it was found that most of the twins observed are extension
   twins up to 8\% accumulative strain. Beyond 8\% strain, exhaustion of
   90\% of extension twins occurred and contraction twins appeared in the
   microstructure. Moreover, double twins were identified after a strain of
   8\%. These twins were composed of extension twins and contraction twins
   which can contribute to softening. Such softening can result in the
   reduction of uniform elongation in tension for the cyclic loading in
   comparison with the monotonic loading. It was possible for the material
   to sustain continued straining without failure to over double this
   value, that is, 15\%.}},

Abstract = {{The paper deals with a 2D metamaterial constructed from chiral elements
   comprising rings and ligaments (ribs). The behavior of the metamaterial
   during tension was studied by numerical modeling. The shear deformation
   appears within the tetrachiral honeycomb under uniaxial loading. It is
   found that coupling exists between the elongation and inclination of the
   sample with tetrachiral honeycomb structure and this causes some
   ambiguity when calculating the effective Poisson's ratio. The coupling
   effect depends on both the honeycomb's deformation and the geometric
   parameters of the cell structure. This special coupling effect of
   tetrachiral honeycombs provides a new idea for designing new
   metamaterials. An analytical expression for this effective Poisson's
   ratio is derived. In the process of uniaxial loading, the reason for the
   elongation of the specimen was found.}},

Abstract = {{The research on existence, bifurcation, and number of periodic solutions
   is closely related to Hilbert's 16th problem. The main goal of this
   chapter is to investigate the nonlinear dynamic response and periodic
   vibration characteristic of a simply supported concave hexagonal
   honeycomb sandwich plate with negative Poisson's ratio. The plate is
   subjected to its in-plane and transverse excitation. The curvilinear
   coordinate frame, Poincare map, and improved Melnikov function are
   proposed to detect the existence and number of the periodic solutions.
   The theoretical analyses indicate the existence of periodic orbits and
   can guarantee at most four periodic orbits under certain conditions.
   Numerical simulations are performed to verify the theoretical results.
   The relative positons as well as the vibration characteristics can also
   be clearly found from the phase portraits. The periodic motion for the
   equation is closely related to the amplitude modulated periodic
   vibrations of the plate. The results will provide theoretical guidance
   to nonlinear vibration control for the metamaterial honeycomb sandwich
   structures.}},

Title = {{In-vitro fragmentation of ovarian tissue activates primordial follicles
   through the Hippo pathway}},
Journal = {{HUMAN REPRODUCTION OPEN}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{2020}},
Number = {{4}},
Abstract = {{STUDY QUESTION: What is the role of the Hippo and PI3K/Akt pathway in
   follicles during ovarian tissue culture in tissue derived from
   oncological patients and transgender men?
   SUMMARY ANSWER: Results highlight a Hippo pathway driven primordial
   follicle activation in vitro, predominantly from Day 0 to Day 4.
   WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: In-vitro ovarian tissue culture aims at
   activating and maturing primordial follicles for fertility restoration
   in patients with a threatened ovarian reserve. Not all patients are
   eligible for ovarian cortex transplantation and therefore several groups
   are attempting to culture ovarian tissue in-vitro. Cortex fragmentation
   disrupts the Hippo pathway, leading to increased expression of
   downstream growth factors and follicle growth. The PI3K/Akt pathway is
   considered the intracellular pathway to where different extracellular
   factors involved in primordial follicle activation in-vivo converge. In
   order to optimise current ovarian tissue culture models, information on
   progression of these pathways during tissue culture is mandatory.
   STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: The first step of a multistep cortex
   culture system was performed using 144 ovarian cortex pieces from a
   total of six patients. Per patient, 24 cortical strips were cultured for
   6 days and six pieces per patient were collected for downstream analysis
   of follicle development and Hippo and PI3K/Akt pathway targets every
   second day.
   PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Ovarian tissue was obtained
   from oncological (N = 3; 28.67 +/- 4.51 years) and transgender (N = 3;
   23.33 +/- 1.53 years) patients. Follicles were analysed using
   haematoxylin-eosin staining and pathways were studied using
   immunohistochemistry and precise follicle excision by laser capture
   micro-dissection for RT-qPCR analysis. MIQE guidelines for RT-qPCR were
   pursued. Reference gene selection (GAPDH, RPL3A, 18s rRNA) was performed
   using GeNorm Reference Gene Selection Kit. Statistical analysis was
   conducted with IBM SPSS Statistics 23 (Poisson regression, negative
   binomial regression, ANOVA and paired t-test).
   MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Immunohistochemical analysis
   confirmed a Hippo pathway driven primordial follicle activation due to
   mechanical manipulation of the cortical strips. Ovarian tissue
   preparation and culture induced the inhibitory phosphorylated
   Yes-associated protein (pYAP) to disappear in granulosa cells of
   primordial follicles on Day 2. The stimulatory YAP on the contrary
   appeared in primordial granulosa cells over increasing culture days.
   Looking at the YAP target connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), a
   significantly up-regulated CTGF was noted in primordial follicles when
   comparing Day 2 and Day 4 (ratio Day 2/4 = 0.082; P < 0.05), clearly
   showing an effect on the Hippo pathway in primordial follicles during
   tissue culture. Follicle classification showed a significant drop in
   estimated primordial follicle counts in the oncological cohort ( -78\%;
   P = 0.021) on Day 2 and in the transgender cohort on Day 4 (-634\%; P =
   0.008). Intermediate follicle counts showed a non-significant increasing
   trend to during culture and this follicle recruitment and growth
   resulted in a significant rise in estimated primary follicle counts on
   Day 6 in oncological patients (170\%; P = 0.025) and, although limited
   in absolute numbers, a significant increase in secondary follicles on
   Day 4 (367\%; P = 0.021) in the transgender cohort. Subsequent antral
   follicle development could not be observed.
   LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: A limitation is the small sample size,
   inherent to this study subject, especially as a large amount of tissue
   was needed per patient to reduce inter-patient variation in different
   downstream analysis techniques. A particular and specific weakness of
   this study is the inability to include an age-matched control group.
   WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: These findings support an adapted
   tissue preparation for Hippo pathway disruption and a shorter first
   phase of tissue culture. This work may also have implications for
   transplantation of cryopreserved tissue as larger strips (and thus
   slower burnout due to less Hippo pathway disruption) could be a benefit.}},

Abstract = {{Positron emission tomography (PET) is a widely used imaging modality in
   clinical environment and research studies. In clinical, long-scanned
   dynamic PET is usually adopted for an acceptable image quality with
   increasing radioactive risk. Therefore, low-dose PET (LdPET) has
   attracted much attention, recently model-based image reconstruction
   (MBIR) and convolutional neural network (CNN) have been demonstrated the
   efficiency of noise reduction. In this study, we employed a deep
   learning based Poisson negative log-likelihood problem to model the
   physical PET imaging. Following that, model was solved and split into
   three sub-problems by Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM)
   algorithm with convergence guarantee. Then multiple ADMM iterations were
   mapped in a deep network architecture for optimizing each sub-problem,
   i.e., reconstruction, nonlinear and multiplier modules, dubbed as
   ADMM-net. For data acquisition, human brain data was acquired. In
   training phase, data pairs of Poisson down sampled sinogram and
   full-dose MLEM reconstructed image were used as network input and ground
   truth. The learnable parameters were optimized by minimizing the loss
   function of normalized mean square error (NMSE) using Adam. In order to
   demonstrate the generalization ability of proposed network, we trained
   network with 2D data pairs and tested it with sinograms. Moreover,
   different down sampling ratio were applied in training and testing. In
   results, our proposed ADMM-net outperformed the traditional EM
   reconstruction and existing algorithms for LdPET, such as nonlocal mean
   (NLM) and TV regularized methods in terms of MSE, as well as improved
   the computational speed.}},

Abstract = {{3D printing has had a significant impact on the research in structural
   dynamics. In recent years this research has been primarily focused on
   periodic structures where the 3D printing was used to develop advanced
   meta-materials with properties classical materials do not have (e.g.
   acoustic stop-band filters, negative Poisson ratio). This research is
   focused on fused filament fabrication (FFF) 3D printing technology,
   where, recently introduced conductive PLA (Polylactic Acid) filaments,
   have been researched for the effect of piezoresistivity in dynamics
   measurements (e.g. strain measurement). Piezoresistivity denotes the
   phenomenon where electrical resistivity changes under the influence of
   mechanical strain and can be therefore used for dynamic sensing.
   However, several difficulties arise when FFF is used, such as
   heterogenity, anisotropy, and high influence of process parameters. In
   this research, the theoretical principles of piezoresistive sensing of
   FFF structures are presented. Additionally, the importance of high
   conductivity of 3d printed conductors is disscussed.}},

Abstract = {{As a kind of protective equipment, obstruction block is playing an
   important role in traffic accidents. In this work, a novel re-entrant
   honeycomb obstruction block (RHOB) with negative Poisson's ratio was
   proposed. The energy-absorbing performances under static compression
   were examined and the influences of re-entrant angle a, material
   thickness t and aspect ratio y on deformation behaviours of RHOB were
   investigated with finite element method (FEM). It is demonstrated that
   RHOB has distinguished bearing capacities and energy absorbing
   properties compared to traditional honeycomb obstruction block (THOB).
   Besides, with the reduction of re-entrant angle a, the negative
   Poisson's ratio of RHOB is decreased. Also, RHOB has notable
   bi-directional stabilities with a proper range of aspect ratio y. And
   the increasing material thickness t enhances stiffness of RHOB. These
   findings highlight that a well-constructed re-entrant honeycomb
   obstruction block has extraordinary mechanical properties and can be
   widely applied in practical engineering.}},

   gradually.
   In this research, we developed our original smart chair called

   space. Our chair is made with 3D-printed soft auxetic patterns. It is
   morphable allowing users to sit in various ways. Also, our chair is
   equipped with two sensors, which collect data stream to distinguish four
   different states of the chair. Long-term sensor stream can be stored and
   used to refine the furniture.
   In this paper, we propose our concept, prototypes, sensing methods and

Abstract = {{This study aims to identify the composition of the pyrolysis products
   obtained through pyrolysis in the structure of different auxetic
   designs. Two design specimens of auxetic nano-carbon fibers with
   different directional load were fabricated, solid carbon fibers and
   hexagonal auxetic carbon fibers. The deformation behavior is well-known
   and has been analyzed. 3D finite element (FE) models were used to
   investigate both structures. There was some impact on the specimens
   used, and the behavior of the strain and stress line was captured. The
   main purpose of the experiment was to define and test the auxetic
   structure's use in industries that require nano-carbon fiber material
   that has excessively good mechanical and thermal properties. In order to
   prevent the deterioration of the properties caused by this phenomenon,
   sizing of the yarns and bundles was carried out. Moreover, to form a
   sizing coating on the elementary fibers, DMA tests have been conducted,
   and both the thermal and mechanical properties investigated. In this
   case, the sizing agent must be in a sufficiently softened state. The
   compositions can improve nano-carbon vs the adhesion of the polymer
   matrix for auxetic nano-carbon fibers, which allows the use of such
   fibers for the reinforcement of plastics without extra processing.}},

Abstract = {{A novel auxetic metamaterial which is organized in the lattice is
   presented in this paper. Dynamic uniaxial impact behavior of the auxetic
   lattice using experiment and finite element simulation is investigated.
   The corresponding results have proved that the plastic beam-based finite
   element model has good agreement with the experiment. To explore the
   rate sensitivity of the auxetic lattice metamaterial, impact simulations
   of auxetic metamaterials at 13.07\% relative density are firstly
   conducted under six velocities range from 1 to 100m/s. The comparison of
   deformation exhibits that deformation pattern depends on impact
   velocities. The shock wave effect can be obviously observed in the
   impact procedure which results in the loss of negative Poisson's ratio
   effect at high velocity. The effective impact indices including plateau
   stress and densification strain can be extracted from the stress-strain
   curves. The simplified theory model based on the rigid,
   perfectly-plastic, locking model is utilized to fit data from the
   simulation. Furthermore, the effect of relative density on impact
   mechanical properties is investigated. The basic theoretical model is
   developed by considering the relative density which accords with
   simulation data well in four relative densities respectively 7.35\%,
   13.07\%, 20.42\%, 29.41\%. Finally, the formula of plateau stress with
   respect to impact velocity and relative density can be obtained. The
   researches herein are aiming to reveal the dynamic properties of the
   auxetic lattice metamaterial and provide a constitutive model for
   potential application.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents design considerations of an adjustable flexible
   auxetic structure used in soft wearable suits with a Cross Chiral
   Honeycomb (CCH) structure. In order to design a macro-auxetic structure
   with elastic flexibilities in the soft wearable suit, it is important to
   develop an auxetic unit cell with adjustability of stiffness. Airbag
   inflation and deflation mechanisms on the adjustable stiffness pads with
   auxetic foam play key roles in either the protection of the human body
   or the assistance of human motion through the reversible configurations
   of the structure. Periodic cellular structures used in auxetic foam were
   first considered in the field of lightweight construction due to their
   high specific stiffness, damping, and energy absorbing properties. The
   development of new manufacturing processes, especially the development
   of modern 3D-printers, has allowed the creation of 3D auxetic
   structures. Experiments of several specimens were conducted to verify
   mechanical structural characteristics of a CCH structure. Through this
   approach, valid geometric parameters of the macro-auxetic structure used
   in the soft wearable suit could be designated.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic metamaterials have unique structural designs exhibiting zero or
   negative Poisson' ratios during stretch/compression processes, which
   enable many critical applications such as sensing technology, wearable
   devices, and weight reduction parts. However, it is difficult to achieve
   ideal performance of various structural designs through geometry
   manipulation due to the beam/wall buckling under large strain. One way
   to minimize the occurrence of buckling is by introducing the high
   elasticity on the joints, but trade-offs exist among different
   mechanical behaviors. To this end, this study proposes to use a
   multi-material combining with the structure optimization to design an
   auxetic structure. The basic re-entrant structure is employed due to its
   simplicity, and finite element method (FEM) is adopted to demonstrate
   the effectiveness of this newly proposed strategy regarding the auxetic
   behaviors. For this multi-material structure, a different Young's
   modulus is designed to apply on the additional arch structure. A series
   of simulations, which consider the influence of the mechanical
   properties, are conducted to investigate the change of auxetic behaviors
   such as stress distribution, Poisson's ratio, and equivalent Young's
   modulus against the applied material properties. The results indicate
   that the mechanical properties are strongly affected by the geometry
   design and the applied materials properties. Meanwhile, the buckling
   effect of the beam/wall could be eliminated if the hinge strength is
   small enough. The trade-off between equivalent mechanical properties and
   Poisson's ratio could also be tuned through this newly material-based
   design.}},

Abstract = {{This research is aimed at proposing an enhanced re-entrant hexagonal
   structure and examining its auxetic behavior in compressive or tensile
   load conditions. An integrated experimental and finite element analysis
   (FEA) approach was used to investigate the behavior of the proposed
   structures in combination with polymeric materials (thermoplastic
   polyurethane (TPU) materials such as Ninjaflex (R) and Semiflex (R)). We
   focused on the effect of nonlinearity of the structure on the overall
   stiffness and shock-absorption performance of the body protection pads.
   FEA models were used to examine how the stiffness and Poisson's ratio
   are affected by static load conditions and also how the dynamic loads
   are transmitted through the auxetic structure. The static FEA models
   were verified through experimental testing. Advanced additive
   manufacturing (3D printing) techniques such as Fused Deposition Modeling
   (FDM) were used to build fixtures and prototypes of the auxetic
   polymeric structures. Structural stiffness and Poisson's ratio were
   examined not only in tensile loading condition but also in compression.
   Axial and lateral deformations were measured for given axial forces on
   the experimental model, and the measured values of Poisson's ratio were
   compared with the computational results. It was shown that the enhanced
   re-entrant hexagonal structures had nonlinear behavior, which could be a
   useful property for developing body protection pads and
   stiffness-varying structures.}},

Abstract = {{The auxetic honeycomb core exhibits geometric nonlinearity under the

   The elastoplastic model of the auxetic honeycombs with constant wall
   thickness is introduced based on nonlinear beam theory and elastoplastic
   theory. The solution algorithm is established. The elastoplastic
   properties of the auxetic honeycombs with different ratios of the
   thickness of honeycomb wall to the length of the inclined wall t/l,
   different ratios of the height of the vertical wall to the length of the
   inclined wall h/l, and different inclination angle theta are obtained.
   The results suggest that with the increase of strain, the geometric
   nonlinearity causes the overall stiffness of honeycombs to increase.
   Then it decreases gradually due to the plastic deformation.}},

   maximise the stiffness and negative Poisson's ratio of the lattice

   by the energy homogenisation method. A modified optimality criteria
   method is employed to update design variables. The energy absorption and

   analysed by finite element simulation and compression experiment,

   monolithically, without requiring support material and postprocessing,
   using a low-cost and open-source fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D
   printer that employs a commercially available thermoplastic polyurethane
   (TPU). The soft fingers of the gripper were optimized using finite
   element modeling (FEM). The FE simulations accurately predicted the
   performance of the fingers in terms of deformation and blocked force.
   Also, FEM was used to predict the behavior of the auxetic structure and
   its compliant ribs to prove that it highly decreases the contact
   pressure by increasing the contact area between the soft fingers and the
   grasped objects. The contact pressure can be decreased by up to 8 times
   with the implementation of the auxetic structure. Also, the
   configuration of the highly conformal gripper can be easily modulated by
   changing the number of fingers attached to its base to tailor it for
   specific manipulation tasks. A wide variety of objects with different
   weights, shapes, sizes, textures and stiffnesses can be grasped using

Abstract = {{In this work, a hybrid laminated plate is developed by changing ply
   orientations and stacking sequences. The hybrid laminated plate is
   composed of carbon nanotube reinforced composite and fiber reinforced
   composite layers. Negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) is obtained for the
   case of {[}22(F)/(22(C)/-22(C))(3T)/-22(F)] laminate. A theoretical
   laminated model considering geometric nonlinearity and shear deformation
   is presented. Based on a two-step perturbation method, the solutions of
   the motion equations are obtained to capture the non-linear frequencies
   and load-deflection curves. On this basis, the fourth-order Runge-Kutta
   method is used to obtain the dynamic response of hybrid laminated
   plates. The presented model is verified by comparing the results
   obtained analytically and numerically. Several factors such as loading
   and distribution of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and foundation type are
   considered in parametric study. Numerical results indicate that the
   thermal-mechanical behavior of hybrid laminated plates significantly
   improved by properly adjusting the CNT distribution. In addition, the
   results reveal that changes in temperature and foundation stiffness have
   pronounced influence on the nonlinear vibration characteristics of
   hybrid laminate plates with NPR as compared to those with positive
   Poisson's ratio.}},

Abstract = {{Control of structural topology, via a bottom-up approach, is now
   possible through the advent and continuing maturation of additive
   manufacturing techniques. For example, new classes of porous materials
   with increased strength-to- density ratios, novel thermal and acoustic
   properties, and even ``metamaterial{''} properties such as negative
   Poisson ratios have been recently realized by tailoring deformation
   mechanisms and structural instabilities. It is the control of organizing
   features at the mesoscale (100s nm- mu m's) that has led to a revolution
   in tailoring materials mechanical properties and function. While many
   examples exist in which the low strain rate mechanical responses of
   materials have been tailored, extensions to dynamic, high strain rate,
   large strain conditions have been scarcely explored. Here, we present
   the results of traditional plate impact methods applied to organized
   polymer architectures, using velocimetry and X-ray phase contrast
   imaging at the Advanced Photon Source. These methods allowed for the
   characterization of the mechanisms of shock wave propagation,
   localization, and compaction in the structures. In particular, we have
   investigated the role of interfaces on stress localization within the
   structures. The experimental results will be discussed in the context of
   finite element simulations of the same structures, including progress on
   topological optimization for desired dynamic response.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes the technique for the analysis of weak shock wave
   influence on the dynamic stress state of foam materials with negative
   and positive Poisson's ratio. The investigation of the dynamic behavior
   of foam materials under the action of weak shock waves is performed in
   the framework of couple stress elasticity, where one can account for the
   influence of shear rotation deformation in structurally inhomogeneous
   media. For the solution of the non-stationary problem, Fourier
   transforms are used. The calculation of transforms of dynamic stresses
   in the foam medium is performed by using the boundary integral equation
   method and the theory of complex variable functions in the framework of
   couple stress elasticity. The numerical implementation of the developed
   algorithm is based on the method of mechanical quadrature and
   collocation technique. For calculation of originals of dynamic stresses
   discrete, Fourier transform is used. The distribution of dynamic hoop
   stresses in a positive and negative Poisson's ratio foam medium with
   tunnel cavities under the action of a weak shock wave is investigated.
   The algorithm is effective in the analysis of the dynamic behavior of
   the foam media with tunnel defects of various cross-sections.}},

Abstract = {{The machinery degradation process is described by a random process in
   which failures occur with constant intensity, and with each failure the
   rate of benefits generated by the machinery item reduces by a random
   amount. If the machinery item begins to generate negative benefits, it
   is subject to decommissioning. We get explicit expressions for the
   average life of the machinery items and the coefficient of variation of
   the service life. Machine's value is determined by discounting the flow
   of benefits from its future use. This allows to link this value with the
   rate of benefits that the machinery item brings. In cases where there is
   no information on the amount of such benefits, appraisers rely on the
   machine's age. However, different machinery items of the same age may be
   found in a different condition and therefore are characterized by
   different values. We offer formulas for calculating the percent good
   factors reflecting the average decrease in the equipment's value with
   age. To take into account the effects of income tax, property tax and
   inflation, it suffices to adjust the discount rate in the constructed
   model. It has been verified that the proposed dependencies are in a
   fairly good agreement with market price data for two different types of
   construction equipment.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic structures are inherently advantageous in achieving tailored
   auxeticity and associated mechanical properties since their deformation
   modes are dictated by the architectures of the building block unit
   cells. Apparently, the analyses of geometrical parameters become
   critical for enhanced overall mechanical attributes. In the current
   research work a novel chiral type S-shaped structure was evaluated
   considering variations in the most critical geometrical parameter,
   length to the radius ratio. The changes in the length to radius ratios
   led to the change in the shape of the otherwise circular S-cells to the
   elliptical Sshaped structures. The results from the finite element
   simulations of compressive loading on these new structural forms
   indicated improvements in the stress distribution patterns, together
   with reduced stress concentration effects. However, the oblong
   structural variation proved to have relatively no significant effect on
   the auxeticity of the overall structure. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Purpose: Metabolic syndrome (MetS) has become a public health challenge
   in low-income countries due to changing lifestyle and the food
   environment. However, studies on the prevalence of metabolic syndrome
   and associated factors are limited in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study
   assessed the prevalence of MetS and its associated factors among working
   adults in eastern Ethiopia.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted involving 1,164 working
   adults from December 2018 to February 2019. Data were collected
   following the World Health Organization (WHO) STEPwise approach. The
   data collection tools include a structured questionnaire,
   anthropometric, and biochemical measurements. Prevalence was calculated
   using International Diabetes Federation criteria. A Poisson regression
   model with robust variance estimation was used to investigate the
   independent variable's association with MetS. An adjusted prevalence
   ratio with 95\% confidence interval was reported to show associations.
   Results: The prevalence of MetS was 20.1\% (95\% CI=17.8-22.4) among the
   participants. It was more prevalent among females (APR:=1.62, 95\%
   CI=1.31-2.00), those of 35-44 years of age (APR:=3.14, 95\%
   CI=1.19-8.28), 45-54 years of age (APR=4.42, 95\% CI=1.66-11.77), and
   55-64 years of age (APR=6.03, 95\% CI=2.27-16.06), khat chewers
   (APR=1.30, 95\% CI=1.06-1.60), those with 8 or more hours of sedentary
   behavior (APR=2.29, 95\% CI=1.88-2.80), and those consuming alcohol 5-6
   days per week (APR=1.81, 95\% CI=1.20-2.74). The prevalence was
   significantly lower in those eating five or more fruits and vegetables
   servings per day (APR=0.04, 95\% CI=0.01-0.27).
   Conclusion: A high prevalence of MetS was observed among working adults
   in eastern Ethiopia. Strengthening workplace health promotion programs
   is necessary to reduce the negative consequences of MetS in workplaces
   and protect productivity.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetics occupy a special place among structural products working under
   cyclic loads, such as orthopedic implants, elements of building
   structures, etc. In this work, a three-dimensional auxetic structure
   (with Poisson's ratio of -0.450) was proposed and the mechanical
   characteristics were analyzed using static and low-cycle compression
   tests (up to 2000 cycles) by both testing physical samples obtained by
   3D-printing using SLM method and by running a computer simulation (FEA).
   The studied properties of auxetics were compared with the properties of
   a non-auxetic hexagonal honeycomb structure. It has been demonstrated
   that the auxetic structure is deformed uniformly during cyclic tests
   with a maximum load of 12 kN at a failure; accordingly, a non-auxetic
   structure loses stability at a load of 8 kN. The results can be used in
   the development of structural elements of biomedical devices operating
   under increased cyclic loads (spinal implants, bone implants for
   supporting limbs). (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Plane elasticity has allowed the development of the current knowledge on
   fracture mechanics since the dawn of this discipline. Linear elastic
   fracture mechanics (LEFM) has taken advantage of the possibility to
   obtain analytical closed-form solutions. Indeed, three dimensional
   effects, related basically to the Poisson's ratio and the plate
   thickness, have been mostly neglected for a long time. The proof of the
   existence of corner point singularities, i.e. stress singularity at the
   intersection of crack front with a free surface, has contributed to
   explain fracture phenomena, such as the bowed crack fronts and the
   behavior of stress intensity factors along the thickness of a
   cracked/notched body. Although fatigue crack growth is Mode I dominated
   and corner point singularities become insignificant, for the estimation
   of brittle failure of cracked/notched they may represent a substantial
   source of error, both in terms of magnitude of the stress field and
   failure location. In this paper we provide before a brief overview on 3D
   corner point singularities. By exploiting of 3D finite element (FE)
   modeling, to understand the theoretical basis of this phenomenon,
   numerical experiments on sharply-V-notched linear elastic plates under
   mode 1 loading are performed. A quantitative and qualitative description
   of the causes and effects of 3D vertex singularities under mode 1 in
   relation with Poisson's ratio is given, including negative values of
   this latter material parameter, never before investigated. Besides, by
   means of numerical simulations of the same notched plates subjected to
   mode 3 loading, observations on the possible connection between 3D
   corner point singularities and the out-of-plane shear stress
   distribution near the model surface are discussed. Finally, future
   perspectives on this research field are addressed. (C) 2020 The Authors.

Abstract = {{This paper develops an auxetic cantilever beam energy harvester (ACBEH)
   to enhance the harvesting power from ambient vibration sources. A finite
   element analysis was performed to verify the power increase mechanism of
   the ACBEH. The simulation model of the ACBEH comprises of three main
   components: support, tip mass, and cantilever beam with a re-entrant
   hexagonal auxetic structure in which a piezoelectric element bonded to
   top of the auxetic region by using a thin elastic layer of epoxy. The
   performance of the ACBEH was computationally investigated and compared
   with an equivalent conventional energy harvester with a plain cantilever
   beam where they are attached to a bridge stay cable. The simulation
   result shows that the ACBEH excited by a harmonic acceleration of 1
   m/s(2) at 3 Hz is able to produce electric power of 427.22 mu W, which
   is 2.51 times that of the power produced by the equivalent plain
   cantilever beam energy harvester (170.17 mu W). This paper opens up a
   great potential of using auxetic cantilever beam applications for
   different energy harvesting systems in Metamaterials, Acoustics, Civil,
   Electrical, Aerospace, Biomedical, and Mechanical Engineering.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a creative metamaterial-based substrate (MetaSub)

Abstract = {{Elastic mechanical metamaterials exhibit unusual frequency contingent
   properties like negative mass, negative Young's modulus, and negative
   Poisson's ratio in a particular band of the excitation frequency.
   Locally resonant units in the designed metamaterial enable bandgap
   formation virtually at any frequency for wavelengths much higher than
   the lattice length of the unit. Due to out of phase motion of multiple
   resonating units with lattice, there is a change in the dynamic
   properties (stiffness or mass or density) of the material as these
   properties become frequency-dependent. On another side, at higher
   frequencies for wavelengths equal to the lattice size of the medium, the
   Bragg scattering phenomenon occurs, which also helps in the bandgap
   formation. Therefore, these extreme frequency contingent physical
   properties modulate wave propagation through designed metamaterials. In
   this research, the band structure of piezo-embedded negative stiffness
   metamaterial is derived using generalized Bloch theorem. Bloch theorem
   is used to solve various periodic media problems in different fields.
   The relationship between frequency and wave number can be established
   using this theory. The results elucidate that the insertion of the
   piezoelectric material in the resonating unit can provide not only
   better tunability but also several unusual band structures that can be
   perceived. The attenuation bandwidth of the designed metamaterial can be
   tailored through critical parameters derived from the extensive
   non-dimensional study of the system. This research can be considered as
   a contribution towards designing the active elastic mechanical
   metamaterials.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, the vibration transmissibility behavior of novel dome
   shaped auxetic structures with different cellular configurations are
   numerically simulated and subsequently studied experimentally. The
   dynamic behavior of domes with honeycomb and auxetic structures are
   studied within the frequency bandwidth of 5-500 Hz by using base
   excitation technique. The auxetic samples are subjected to broadband
   excitation at low dynamic strain, followed by sine sweep around the
   resonance of the system. The dynamic and modal behaviors are
   experimentally analyzed by using 3D Laser Doppler Vibrometer. The system
   is shown to develop specific wave propagation and attenuation bands,
   outline of which is important for developing strategies for
   damping/energy harvesting. Further, analysis has been carried out to
   analyze the mechanical wave propagation behavior when the system is
   subjected to broadband excitation frequency at low dynamic strains.
   Here, we have arranged a large periodic repeating units of double-dome
   shape auxetics with lumped mass inside it placed in the form of metal
   ring. The equivalent spring-mass-damper mechanical circuit has been
   developed simplifying our system. The Nonlinear stiffness of double-dome
   structure depend upon constitutive cellular cells i.e. auxetic, regular
   honeycomb and plane, which is evident for getting broader bandgap
   formation than the linear one. The lumped mass is considered here as
   locally resonating metamaterial enabling low-frequency vibration
   attenuation. Furthermore, the analysis is being done for bandgap
   expressions depending upon the added mass ratio and target frequency.
   Further study is proposed for attenuation and transmission band analysis
   to steer the waves which roots the idea of vibration sink, in which we
   can damp the mechanical waves effectively at a specific location. The
   Auxetic meta-materials are envisaged to have a significant role in wave
   attenuation and wave steering, and can be used effectively for vibration
   control.}},

Abstract = {{Mechanical metamaterials can be designed to give rise to exotic
   properties such as negative stiffness, negative Poisson's ratio
   (auxeticity), and tailorable buckling by selectively designing the
   geometry of the host material. However, these behaviors are typically
   fixed and cannot be changed once the metamaterial has been fabricated.
   Motivated by the goal of post-manufactured application-specific
   adaptability, we present a soft mechanical metamaterial with pressurized
   circular voids for in-situ tunable mechanical properties. Prototypes are
   created by curing a two-component silicone rubber in a 3D printed mold.
   The circular voids are sealed at one end and independently connected to
   a pressure source on the opposite side, allowing any subset of the voids
   to be pressurized. Uniaxial compression tests are then conducted on a
   universal testing machine. Through selective pressurization of the
   voids, we demonstrate tunability of the material's stiffness profiles
   and the critical loads that lead to the onset of auxeticity and/or
   buckling. Numerical investigations allow deeper insight, revealing that
   selective pressurization affects the qualitative shape of the first
   buckling mode and illustrating how pressurization can break the auxetic
   behavior of the nominal, unpressurized specimen. Overall, the outcomes
   demonstrate that soft elastomers with selectively pressurized voids can
   express quantitatively and qualitatively tunable responses, offering
   potential for new types of mechanical metamaterials with predictable,
   in-situ tunability.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To compare the Edmonton Frail Scale (EFS) and
   Clinical-Functional Vulnerability Index-20 (CFVI-20) instruments
   regarding degree of agreement and correlation and compare descriptive
   models with frailty-associated variables in community-dwelling older
   people in Brazil.
   METHODS: Cross-sectional study, nested in a population-based and
   household cohort. Baseline sampling was calculated based on a
   probabilistic approach by conglomerate in two stages. In the first
   stage, census tract was used as sampling unit. In the second, the number
   of households was defined according to the population density of
   individuals aged >= 60 years. The Kappa statistic evaluated the
   agreement between instruments and Pearson's coefficient their
   correlation. Factors associated with frailty and high risk of
   clinical-functional vulnerability were identified by multiple analysis
   of Poisson regression with robust variance.
   RESULTS: Kappa statistics was 0.599 and Pearson's correlation
   coefficient 0.755 (p < 0.001). The EFS found a 28.2\% prevalence of
   frailty, and the CFVI-20 found a 19.5\% prevalence of high risk of
   clinical-functional vulnerability. Age equal to or greater than 80
   years, history of stroke, polypharmacy, negative self-perceived health,
   fall in the past 12 months, and hospitalization in the past 12 months
   were variables associated with frailty in both instruments after
   multiple analysis. Less than four years of education, osteoarticular
   disease, and weight loss were associated with frailty only by EFS, and
   having a caregiver was associated with a high risk of
   clinical-functional vulnerability only by CFVI-20.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although the analyses show moderate agreement and strong
   positive correlation between the instruments, the indicated prevalence
   of frailty is discrepant. Our results attest the need to standardize the
   instrument for assessing frailty in community-dwelling older people.}},

   Reflections from the interface of such layers exhibit the well-defined
   background trend of decrease in AVO. Layers with V-p and V-s not
   honoring the mudrock equation are elastically anomalous.
   Hydrocarbon-saturated sands and the carbonate rocks are two of the
   several cases which do not honor the mudrock equation, and therefore,
   their V-p/V-s (Poisson ratio) is different for the same V-p than had
   they been honoring the mudrockline relation. Such layers when interfaced
   with layers honoring the mudrock equation generate the seismic responses
   anomalous to the background AVO response. Low-impedance and low-Poisson
   ration hydrocarbon-saturated sands in clastic regime reflect negative
   amplitudes increasing with offsets (termed as class III AVO anomaly).
   First offshore well in deepwater in Mahanadi Basin was drilled to probe
   the amplitude anomaly showing increase in amplitudes with offsets. Well
   encountered limestone encased in incompacted shale generating increasing
   amplitude with offset. AVO response was computed from well logs to help
   explaining the observed AVO anomaly of increase in amplitudes with
   offset from limestone. Anomaly could not be explained from approximated
   Aki and Richards (Quantitative seismic: theories and methods. W. H.
   Freeman and Company \& Co. New York 1980) relations of Zoeppritz
   equation alone. Angle of incidence approaching critical 40 degrees at
   about offset of 2000 m at shale-limestonetop interface depth caused the
   amplitude to increase with offset. Case study is presented to show how
   such expressions can, prior to drilling, be inferred as generated by
   other than hydrocarbon sands.}},

Abstract = {{In mechanical metamaterials, geometry and material properties dictate
   the structural response to mechanical loads. These materials are
   comprised of a tessellated array of repeat unit cells, which form a
   lattice that populates the domain of the structure. While the mechanical
   behavior of 2D lattices is well understood, recent advances in polymer
   based Additive Manufacturing (AM) usher in a new era of metamaterials
   research. However, previous work in this area has failed to address the
   effects of time and temperature on the transient response of
   polymerbased mechanical metamaterials. We seek to investigate the
   effects of thermal loads on the mechanical properties of mechanical
   metamaterials, in particular, the stiffness and damping properties of
   lattice structures comprised of bowtie and honeycomb representative unit
   cells. Towards this goal, in the present paper, an experimental approach
   is used to investigate the mechanical behaviour of 2D lattice
   structures. Experimental samples are prepared using Fused Deposition
   Modeling (FDM) AM. These samples are subject to quasi-static mechanical
   tests at room temperature. Additionally, we investigate the effects of
   mismatched unit cells (defects) on the mechanical behavior of the
   lattice. Mechanical metamaterials with adjustable stiffness and damping
   properties have applications in the aerospace and automotive industries,
   including sandwich composites, damping and impact protection.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic foams have a variety of unique properties due to their negative
   Poisson ratio such as high energy absorption and fracture toughness for
   applications such as sports safety equipment, packing material, and shoe
   soles. The viscoelastic behavior of this relatively new material has not
   been extensively studied and modeled. Better knowledge of the
   viscoelastic behavior over a broad range of deformation rates is
   critical when considering the mechanical properties of the material.
   Previous modeling for positive Poisson ratio materials has been
   completed successfully to characterize the behavior. This same modeling
   was applied to auxetic foams with less success. The influence of
   nonlinear compressibility effects greatly improved calibration and
   prediction. Model simulations across several orders of magnitude in
   deformation rates are validated against data. All results are
   statistically validated using maximum entropy methods to obtain
   posterior densities for the hyperelastic and fractional order
   parameters. Importantly, a maximum entropy algorithm is used such that
   heterogeneous data can be fused to inform and validate the model and
   quantify its uncertainty.}},

Abstract = {{Featured Application
   A potential application of this work is in the manufacture of energy
   absorbing, light-weight structures such as crash protection safety wear.
   The mechanical response of steel auxetic structures manufactured using
   laser-powder bed fusion was explored. The level of control exerted by
   the key design parameters of vertical strut length (H), re-entrant strut
   length (L), strut thickness (t) and re-entrant angle (theta) on the
   mechanical response was examined through a design of experiment approach
   with ANOVA statistical analysis methods applied. The elastic modulus in
   directions normal to (E-x) and parallel to (E-y) the vertical strut was
   found to be primarily dependent upon t and L, respectively, whereas
   yield strength in both test directions (sigma(x) and sigma(y)) was
   strongly dependent on t and L. A large variation in modulus was found
   between the two test directions (E-x / E-y - 1.02 +/- 0.07 GPa/ 4.4 +/-
   0.1 GPa), whereas, yield strength showed little anisotropy (sigma(x) /
   sigma(y)-45 +/- 6 MPa/ 45 +/- 9 MPa). Poisson's ratio parallel to the
   vertical strut varied considerably with geometry but not in a direction
   normal to the vertical strut. Deformation mechanisms were found to be
   different of compression in the x and y directions, being a combination
   of stretching of the vertical strut; compression, bending and hinging of
   the re-entrant strut (x); and vertical strut compression and re-entrant
   strut stretching and bending (y).}},

Abstract = {{Background: The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has become a major
   threat to human life around the world. This study aims to assess the
   knowledge, attitude, and practices regarding COVID-19 among people with
   chronic diseases at the outpatient departments in Ho Chi Minh City.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out between February and
   March 2020 using a convenience sampling strategy in three hospitals in
   Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) via the use of a structured self-administered
   questionnaire. Factors relating to practices, prevalence ratio (PR), and
   95\% confidence interval were estimated by using the Poisson regression
   with robust options. P-value <0.05 was considered as statistically
   different.
   Results: A total of 522 participants had a mean age of 51.5 +/- 10.6
   years. Most of them reported seeing information regarding the COVID-19
   pandemic (93.7\%) via television and social media (72.8\% and 62.1\%,
   respectively). Just over two-thirds of the participants (68.4\%)
   answered with sufficient knowledge of COVID-19. Most respondents had a
   positive attitude toward COVID-19 (90.8\%), although some misconceptions
   existed. Almost over three-fourths of them (77.2\%) maintained good
   practices for prevention. The rate of good practices in those who had
   sufficient knowledge was 1.24 times greater than that among those who
   had insufficient knowledge (PR 1.24, 95\% CI: 1.10-1.41, P<0.05). Also,
   the rate of good practices in males was lower than that of females (PR:
   0.91, 95\% CI: 0.83-0.99, P<0.05).
   Conclusion: There still exists an amount of insufficient knowledge and
   negative attitude regarding COVID-19, which may be barriers to good
   prevention practices among chronic illness patients. Education programs
   need to continue via television and social media and emphasize that
   people with chronic diseases are more likely to experience severe
   symptoms, including death from COVID-19. Additionally, management
   authorities should prolong specific policies to protect the more
   vulnerable in our community.}},

   with varying angles of the conic parts and expansion properties, a
   series of deformation controlled pull-out tests were carried out by
   using bolt samples grouted in rock blocks. In addition to the
   experimental studies, numerical modelling analyses were performed to
   better understand the support properties of newly designed rock bolts.
   Because of a negative Poisson's ratio effect supplied by the head part
   expansion with the tension of the shank, new bolt heads are suggested to
   be defined as auxetic. According to the results of this study, the new

Title = {{Isogeometric Analysis and Shape Optimization of Holed Structures via the
   Patch Removing Technique}},
Journal = {{CMES-COMPUTER MODELING IN ENGINEERING \& SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{124}},

Pages = {{787-806}},
Abstract = {{In this study, a patch removing based Isogeometric analysis (PR-IGA)
   method is proposed to conduct the holed structural analysis with only
   one parametric domain, in which there are also no trimmed elements. The
   theoretical foundation of this novel patch removing approach is that any
   holed structure can be obtained by removing sub-patches (i.e., the
   holes) from an intact base patch. Since the parametric domains of these
   patches are all meshed by rectangular grids, the elements in the
   resulted holed structural parametric domain could all be untrimmed
   rectangles under certain mapping conditions. To achieve the special
   condition, a systematic technique consisting of T-spline local
   refinement and control points substitution/adjustment is provided. Due
   to the intactness of parametric elements, the analysis procedure of
   holed structures based on the proposed PRIGA is quite simplified and
   efficient compared to traditional multi-patch and trimming schemes.
   Moreover, after the deduction of analytical sensitivities related to
   structural mass and mechanical responses, the PR-IGA is directly
   employed in the holed structural shape optimization to successfully
   eliminate the need for model transformation during modeling, analysis
   and optimization processes. Numerical examples involving analysis and
   shape optimization of complex holed structures are presented to
   demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.}},

   coefficient; heat conduction coefficient, yield strength) vary according
   to the power law. Poisson's ratio remains constant. The temperature
   distribution applied to the beam varies with the thickness of the beam
   and as a function of the radial coordinate. The beam is assumed to be in
   the plane stress state. To determine the elastic behavior, von Mises
   yield criterion was used. Positive, negative and homogeneous
   temperatures were applied to the beam and the yielding was observed on
   the inner surface, the outer surface and at the same time on both

Title = {{A review of underwater acoustic metamaterials}},
Journal = {{CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN-CHINESE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{65}},
Number = {{15}},
Pages = {{1396-1410}},
Abstract = {{Underwater acoustic materials are the key to the noise and vibration
   reduction, stealth, reception and amplification of underwater acoustic
   signal. However, conventional underwater acoustic materials usually
   suffer from the weakness of great bulk, heavy weight and poor resistance
   to hydrodynamic pressure. The advancement of the acoustic metamaterials
   (AMMs) has provided new insights into fixing these problems, and a
   variety of underwater AMMs are proposed accordingly.
   This article reviews the history and the developments of underwater AMMs
   and the difficulties that existed in the developments of underwater AMMs
   as compared with the AMMs in air. The focuses are the three types of
   AMMs which are closely associated with the underwater acoustic stealth
   and signal reception \& amplification of hull-mounted sonar, i.e., the
   AMMs for sound absorption, AMMs for decoupling and those for sound
   focusing. The classification, physical mechanisms and controlling
   effects of those three types of underwater AMMs are reviewed in details.
   The AMMs for underwater sound absorption can be divided into
   local-resonance (LR) and non-resonance types. The LR types take
   advantages of the local resonance principle with the controlling
   wavelengths orders of magnitude greater than the physical dimension of a
   unit. To overcome the intrinsic narrow-band limitations of LR and
   broaden the bandwidths, efforts have been made to utilize multilayer
   LR-AMMs or multi-size LRs, attach/embed elastic plate scatter on/into
   elastically coated plate, or introduce complex lattices with multiple
   (coupled) LRs, etc. The non-resonance types are based-on non-resonance
   mechanisms such as viscous loss, heat conduction, macromolecular
   relaxation or a combination of them. These AMMs mainly include porous
   metals and nonmetal materials, gradient AMMs and acoustic meta-surfaces,
   etc. The AMMs for underwater decoupling mainly use acoustically soft
   AMMs to decouple the vibration of the base structure from adjacent
   fluid. These AMMs contain the acoustic coating embedded with various
   cavities or local resonators, gradient coating, re-entrant honeycomb
   structure or structure with negative Poisson's ratio and chiral porous
   coating, etc. The sound-focusing AMMs are categorized into diffractive,
   refractive and reflective types. The diffractive types focus underwater
   sound through constructive interference of diffracted waves, which
   mainly include all kinds of zone plates and fractal lens. The refractive
   types are mainly based on various acoustic lens and focus sound by
   controlling the refraction index of the materials. The reflective types
   focus sound by modulating the reflective waves, including the
   recently-proposed reflective acoustic meta-surfaces and acoustic
   coatings with attached/embedded periodically distributed signal
   conditioning plates, etc.
   Finally, the conclusions and drawbacks of the above AMMs are summarized.
   It is pointed out that although the present underwater AMMs have
   achieved some encouraging results, they are still confronted with
   several key problems such as the realizations of low-frequency and
   broadband, omnidirectional, subwavelength, lightweight and hydrostatic
   pressure resistant sound manipulations, the manufacture and testing of
   large AMM samples, and the environmental adaptations requirements.
   Therefore, there is still a long way for the current underwater AMM
   toward the real application. The trend and outlook toward future
   underwater AMMs are also presented. It is hoped that this review could
   provide guidelines to the design and realization of future materials
   demanded for underwater acoustic stealth and detection.}},

Abstract = {{In last time, the series of virtual internal bond model was proposed for
   solving rock mechanics problems. In these models, the rock continuum is
   considered as a structure of discrete particles connected by normal and
   shear springs (bonds). It is well announced that the normal springs
   structure corresponds to a linear elastic solid with a fixed Poisson
   ratio, namely, 0.25 for threedimensional cases. So the shear springs
   used to represent the diversity of the Poisson ratio. However, the
   shearing force calculation is not rotationally invariant and it produce
   difficulties in application of these models for rock mechanics problems
   with sufficient displacements. In this letter, we proposed the approach
   to support the diversity of the Poisson ratio that based on usage of
   deformable Voronoi cells as set of particles. The edges of dual Delaunay
   tetrahedralization are considered as structure of normal springs
   (bonds). The movements of particle's centers lead to deformation of
   tetrahedrals and as result to deformation of Voronoi cells. For each
   bond, there are the corresponded dual face of some Voronoi cell. We can
   consider the normal bond as some beam and in this case, the appropriate
   face of Voronoi cell will be a cross section of this beam. If during
   deformation the Voronoi face was expand, then, according Poisson effect,
   the length of bond should be decrees. The above mechanism was
   numerically investigated and we shown that it is acceptable for
   simulation of elastic behavior in 0.1-0.3 interval of Poisson ratio.
   Unexpected surprise is that proposed approach give possibility to
   simulate auxetic materials with negative Poisson's ratio in interval
   from -0.5 to -0.1. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd on

Title = {{Parametric Structural Optimization of 2D Complex Shape Based on
   Isogeometric Analysis}},
Journal = {{CMES-COMPUTER MODELING IN ENGINEERING \& SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{124}},

Pages = {{203-225}},
Abstract = {{The geometric model and the analysis model can be uni fied together
   through the isogeometric analysis method, which has potential to achieve
   seam- less integration of CAD and CAE. Parametric design is a mainstream
   and success- ful method in CAD field. This method is not continued in
   simulation and optimization stage because of the model conversion in
   conventional optimization method based on the finite element analysis.
   So integration of the parametric mod- eling and the structural
   optimization by using isogeometric analysis is a natural and interesting
   issue. This paper proposed a method to realize a structural optimi-
   zation of parametric complex shapes by using isogeometric analysis. By
   the given feature curves and the constraints, a feature frame model is
   built. Based on the feature frame model, a parametric representation of
   complex shape is obtained. After adding some auxiliary curves, the
   feature frame model is divided into many box -like patches in three
   dimension or four-sided patches in two dimension. These patches are
   built into parametric patches by using volume interpolation methods such
   as Coons method. Based on the parametric patches, isogeometic analysis
   is applied. Thus, the relationships are constructed among the size para-
   meters, the control points and the physical performance parameters. Then
   the sen- sitivity matrix could be derived based on the relationships.
   The size optimization is carried out in the first stage by taking the
   size parameters as variables. Based on the result of size optimization,
   shape optimization with the constraints of stress is carried out in the
   second stage by taking the control points as variables. Serval planar
   complex shapes are taken as example to verify our method. The results
   ver- ify that the parametric modeling and structural optimization can be
   united together without model conversion. Bene fit from this, the
   optimization design can be exe- cuted as a dark box operation without
   considering the concrete modeling and ana- lysis by input of the sizes,
   constraints and loads.}},

Title = {{In Vitro Study on Smart Stent for Autonomous Post-Endovascular Aneurysm
   Repair Surveillance}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Pages = {{96340-96346}},
Abstract = {{Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is an established and reliable
   surgical treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), where a covered
   stent is implanted to prevent blood flow in the aneurysm sac. Although
   current EVAR is an effective technique, it requires long-term monitoring
   for the post-operative complications (e.g., endoleak, stent occlusion),
   which usually requires expensive radiologic imaging techniques such as
   ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging
   (MRI). In this paper, we present an accessible and continuous post-EVAR
   surveillance scheme by developing a smart stent that features ultrasonic
   powering, blood flow sensing, and integrated wireless electronics. As
   the body of the smart stent, a piezoelectric membrane with a custom pore
   architecture is utilized. The benefits of the embedded pore
   architectures include the expansion and contraction to comply with a
   minimally invasive procedure and enhanced ultrasonic powering and
   sensing capability. The smart stent is able to expand up to 112 \&
   x0025; in diameter when stretched due to the negative Poisson \& x2019;s
   ratio. The ultrasound generates 0.23 mW of electrical power, which can
   sufficiently operate a low power wireless electronics. A comprehensive
   operation of the smart stent is demonstrated <italic>in vitro</italic>.
   The integrated flow sensor can measure blood flow ranging between 30
   mL/min to 980 mL/min with an average sensitivity of 0.11 mV/mL/min. The
   wireless electronics transmit and receive such blood flow rate data by
   modulating the carrier frequency from 81 to 88 MHz from 1 m away. The
   developed smart stent prototype is the first step towards minimizing
   post-EVAR complications by providing early and frequent access to
   diagnostic information to patients and physicians.}},

   Cauchy of Grade 1) continua are not always suitable to accurately
   approximate the behavior of such composites because no size effects, nor
   lack of symmetries in strain and stress, can be taken into account. This
   study focuses on composites made of hexagonal rigid particles which
   interact among themselves through elastic interfaces, so that the
   deformation energy of the material is concentrated only at the
   interfaces. Three particle geometries are investigated such as
   orthotetragonal, auxetic, and chiral. Novel results have been achieved
   by presenting the behavior of panels with various material symmetries

Abstract = {{The main content dealt with in the paper was to present a flexible
   auxetic re-entrant honeycomb fabric, which was made of a formulated
   thermoplastic polyurethane material PolyFlex with super elastic
   properties by 3D printing technology. The auxetic fabric shows
   perpendicular expansion under tension and is flexible. So. its special
   property makes auxetic fabric have great potential in future functional
   materials. Wherein, the honeycomb cell angle is a key factor affecting
   Poisson's ratio of fabric. In this paper, flexible re-entrant honeycomb
   structures with different cell angle are manufactured using 3D printing
   technology. The shape change under tension of two directions were
   investigated. The re-entrant honeycomb structures presented negative
   Poisson's ratio immediately when stretched. The shape change consisted
   of three stages in X-1-direction, the same as that in X-2-direction. A
   noticeable discovery was that the shape change in X-1-direction posed an
   out-plane change after the first shape change stage, while the shape
   change in X-2-direction always remained in-plane in the whole tension
   process. The tensile modulus tested was consistent with the tendency of
   theoretical analysis of previous work. The bending rigidities were
   tested and similar to fabrics of poplin and denim. The results indicate
   that the auxetic fabric is suitable for special clothing.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a method for extracting auxetic patterns from meshes for

   automatically. This direct approach is novel in the sense that most of
   the fabrication-oriented surface tiling methods introduce additional
   primitives, such as curve networks in an interactive semiautomatic
   framework. Our method is based on a remeshing procedure that converts a
   given quad mesh with arbitrary topology into our desired structure that
   is ready to be fabricated. The main advantages of establishing auxetic
   patterns on meshes are the achieved flexibility using cheap inflexible
   materials as well as less material usage and fabrication time, as
   demonstrated in our results.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: mental health problems during adolescence lead to increased
   morbidity and mortality. We intend to test the hypothesis that bullying
   and addictive substance use is related to negative mood states.
   Methods: We carried out a cross-sectional study among high school
   students in Burela (Northern Spain) (n=238). ``Negative mood state{''}
   was defined as experiencing the following: feeling tired, sad, out of
   place, bored, hopeless, nervous or lacking sleep. Independent variables
   were binge drinking, having smoked tobacco or cannabis, and the
   corresponding perceived risk of using them. The variable bullying was
   also measured. Poisson regression models with robust variance were
   estimated, and Prevalence Ratios were obtained.
   Results: 10.5\% {[}CI 95\% (7.2-15.2)] of the students reported
   suffering negative mood states. Students declaring low perceived risk of
   cannabis use {[}PR = 2.6 (1.2-5.5)], having tried this addictive
   substance at some point {[}PR = 3.1 (1.1-8.9)] and having suffered
   bullying {[}PR = 4.8 (2.4-9.6)] increased the risk of experiencing
   negative mood states.
   Conclusion: It would be advisable to design and implement interventions
   aimed at improving mental health during adolescence which account for
   the use of addictive substances and being a victim of bullying.}},

Abstract = {{Nature is ripe with biological organisms that can interact with its
   surroundings to continuously morph their surface texture. Many attempts
   have been made to optimize artificial surfaces depending on operational
   needs; however, most of these architected materials only focus on
   enhancing a specific material property or functionality. This study
   introduces a new class of instability-induced morphable structures,
   herein referred to as ``Active Skins{''}, which enables on-demand,
   reversible, surface morphing through buckling-induced feature
   deployment. By taking advantage of a preconceived auxetic unit cell
   geometrical design, mechanical instabilities were introduced to
   facilitate rapid out-of-plane deformations when in-plane strains are
   applied. Here, these notches were introduced at judiciously chosen
   locations in an array of unit cells to elicit unique patterns of
   out-of-plane deformations to pave way for controlling bulk Active Skin
   behavior. These purposefully designed imperfections were employed for
   selectively actuating them for applications ranging from camouflage to
   surface morphing to soft robotic grippers.}},

Abstract = {{The elasto-plastic indentation of auxetic and metal foams is
   investigated using the finite element method. The contributions of yield
   strain, elastic, and plastic Poisson's ratio on the indentation hardness
   are identified. For a given yield strain, when the plastic Poisson's
   ratio is reduced from 0.5, the indentation hardness decreases first and
   then increases. This trend was found to be valid for a wide of yield
   strains. For yield strains less than 0.08, the hardness of auxetic
   materials is much larger when compared with materials having positive
   plastic Poisson's ratio. As the plastic Poisson's ratio approaches -1,
   the elastic deformations dominate over the plastic deformations. The
   plastic dissipation, when compared with the elastic work, is lower for
   materials with negative Poisson's ratio. There is no effect of elastic
   Poisson's ratio on the indentation hardness when the plastic Poisson's
   ratio is more than -0.8. When the plastic Poisson's ratio is less than
   -0.8, the hardness increases with a decrease of elastic Poisson's ratio.
   The plastic dissipation per unit strain energy is maximum for materials
   with vanishing plastic Poisson's ratio.}},

   metamaterials}},
Journal = {{POLYMER TESTING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{81}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic materials and structures as a class of metamaterials have been
   extensively studied and evaluated for many applications. This paper
   focuses on the vibration damping mechanisms of composite
   three-dimensional double-arrow-head (3D DAH) auxetic metamaterial. The
   composite 3D DAH auxetic structures are made from carbon fiber
   reinforced polymer (CFRP) using an assembly method. The damping
   performances of this structure is characterized by compressive
   loading-unloading tests and sine sweep frequency experiments. Damping
   parameters and energy consumptions in unit volume are analyzed
   synthetically to explore the contribution of various damping mechanisms.
   The results show that the structure consumes more energy with the strain
   level increase, but the augment is not large; structural hysteresis
   energy dissipation due to the large deformation is not related to the
   loading speed; the contribution of macroscopic frictional energy and
   elastic buckling energy consumption is much greater than that of
   intrinsic material damping energy dissipation. It is observed that the
   Poisson's ratio of such structures is approximately linear with the
   comprehensive evaluation factor and vibration transmissibility per unit
   height respectively. The comparison in the performance of conventional
   structure materials shows that the 3D DAH structure has excellent
   comprehensive characteristics of light weight, high specific strength
   and high damping performance.}},

Abstract = {{Two novel folded honeycombs with miura pattern are proposed in this
   paper. Geometry parameters for design process are given and explained.
   The in-plane compressive strength of the two proposed novel folded
   honeycombs has been studied by means of finite element simulation using
   ABAQUS. Quasi-static loading in two in-plane direction is selected to
   obtain the deformation and plateau stress. The unique collapse modes and
   plateau state are obtained and discussed. Compared with the conventional
   honeycombs, the in-plane strength of the two folded honeycombs is
   improved significantly. The negative Poissons ratio effect and
   buckling-restrained mechanism are introduced to illustrate the
   improvement. It is summarized that plateau stress under in-plane loading
   is improved with the included angle of miura pattern decrease for the
   local buckling is restrained. The folded auxetic honeycomb has the best
   in-plane strength for its presented negative Poissons ratio in two

Title = {{Retrospective cohort study of the association between maternal
   employment precarity and infant low birth weight in women in the USA}},
Journal = {{BMJ OPEN}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Objectives
   To investigate the association between maternal employment precarity and
   infant low birth weight (LBW), and to assess if this association differs
   by race/ethnicity.
   Methods
   Data were collected from 2871 women enrolled in the National
   Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 and the National Longitudinal Survey
   of Youth 1979 Children and Young Adult Cohort. Employment precarity was
   evaluated using a summary variable that combined several employment
   attributes: availability of employer-sponsored insurance, income, long
   shifts, non-daytime shifts, availability of employer sponsored training
   or educational benefits and membership in a union or collective
   bargaining unit. Employment precarity scores (a sum of the number of
   negative employment attributes) were categorised into low (0-2), medium
   (3) and high (4-6). LBW was defined as weight less than 2500 g at birth.
   Modified Poisson models were fit to calculate risk ratios and 95\% CIs
   and adjusted for maternal age, race/ethnicity, educational attainment,
   nativity, prepregnancy body mass index, alcohol consumption, smoking
   during pregnancy and infant year of birth. We assessed effect
   modification by maternal race/ethnicity using a composite exposure-race
   variable.
   Results
   Women with high employment precarity had higher risk of a LBW delivery
   compared with women with low employment precarity (RR: 1.48, 95\% CI:
   1.11 to 1.98). Compared to non-Hispanic/non-black women with low
   employment precarity, non-Hispanic black women (RR: 2.68; 95\% CI: 1.72
   to 4.15), Hispanic women (RR: 2.53; 95\% CI: 1.54 to 4.16) and
   non-Hispanic/non-black women (RR: 1.46; 95\% CI: 0.98 to 2.16) with high
   employment precarity had higher risk of LBW.
   Conclusions
   We observed higher risk of LBW in pregnancies of women with high
   employment precarity; this association was stronger among black and
   Hispanic mothers compared to non-Hispanic/non-black women. Findings of
   this study can be used to inform antenatal care and identify workplace
   policies to better support women who work during pregnancy.}},

Abstract = {{Water hammer is a transient flow in pipes that were made by quickly
   change in speed in pipes. This phenomenon can cause genuine positive and
   negative pressures in pipes and frequently with hazards in pipelines.
   Generally, water hammer makes by closing valves quickly and has one of
   the most dangerous hydrodynamic phenomena in pressurized pipelines. In
   this paper, governing equations about water hammer is numerically
   fathomed by utilizing MATLAB programing language based on the method of
   characteristic (MOC), and then the pressure variations have been studied
   by changing some effective variables such as pipes elastic modulus and
   Poisson's ratio for four pipe materials. The numerical method is based
   on the method of characteristic lines. The present results showed that
   the normalized piezometric head which is calculated in 4 statuses
   (pipe's full length, pipe's 3/4 length, pipe's 1/2 length, and pipe's
   1/4 length) is directly change with the change of elastic modulus and
   Poisson's ratio based on the pipe material,. The novelty of this study
   is to show how the materials with less elastic modulus are less likely
   to occur the water hammer than the high elastic modulus for the same
   operation condition.}},

Abstract = {{The paper presents studies on the application of the boundary integral

   cross-sections. For the solution of the non-stationary problem, the
   Fourier transform for time variable was used. In Cosserat elasticity for
   the application of the boundary integral equation method the Fourier
   transform potential representations of displacements and microrotations
   were written. The fundamental functions of displacements and
   microrotations for the two-dimensional case of Cosserat continuum were
   built. For the solving of time-domain problem the system of singular
   integral equations was written. For numerical calculations the method of
   mechanical quadrature was applied. Numerical example shows the
   comparison of dynamic stress distribution in the foam medium with
   negative and positive Poisson's ratio under the action of impulse load.}},

Abstract = {{Present biocompatible materials that are suitable for load bearing
   implants have high stiffness compared to the natural human bone. This
   mechanical mismatch causes a condition known as stress shielding. The
   current trend for overcoming this problem is to use porous scaffold
   instead of solid implants to reduce the implant stiffness. Due to the
   wide spread of metal additive manufacturing machines, porous orthopaedic
   implants can be mass produced. In this regard, a porous scaffold is
   incorporated in the design of a low stiffness hip stem. A 3D finite
   element analysis is performed to evaluate the performance of the new
   stem with the patient descending the stairs. The results of the
   numerical study show that the proposed design improves stress and strain
   distributions in the proximal region which reduce the stress shielding
   effect. Finally, a prototype of the proposed design is produced using a
   3D printer as proof of concept.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is associated with the majority
   of anal high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN) and anal cancers.
   Little is known about the risk of anal cancer following a diagnosis of
   benign anal disease and AIN.
   Methods: Using data from nationwide, population-based Danish registries,
   a cohort of 126,174 individuals with either non-neoplastic anal disease
   or AIN 1 to 3 during 1970 to 2016 was followed until first occasion of
   anal cancer. Information on HIV status was obtained from the Danish HIV
   Cohort Study. The absolute risk of anal cancer was estimated using the
   Aalen-Johansen estimator taking into account censoring at emigration and
   end of follow-up and competing risk at time of death. Standardized
   incidence ratios (SIR) for anal cancer among individuals with
   non-neoplastic anal disease, including inflammatory lesions,
   hemorrhoids, and polyps, were estimated in Poisson models. Sex-, age-,
   and calendar period-specific national population rates were estimated
   using the Danish National Pathology Registry.
   Results: Anal cancer risk increased with increasing severity of lesions,
   reaching 4\% 5 years after diagnosis of AIN3. Even among those with
   non-neoplastic anal lesions, particularly inflammatory lesions, anal
   cancer risk was significantly higher than expected from Danish national
   anal cancer rates (SIR = 2.8; 95\% confidence intervals, 2.3-3.2). The
   absolute 5-year risk of anal cancer following AIN3 was considerably
   higher among HIV-positive (14.1\%) than HIV-negative (3.2\%)
   individuals.
   Conclusions: Anal cancer risk increases with increasing severity of
   lesions and is especially high among HIV-positive individuals.
   Impact: Vaccination against HPV is important in the prevention of both
   high-grade AIN and anal cancer.}},

Abstract = {{The half-metallic, mechanical, and transport properties of the
   quaternary Hensler compound of PdZrTiAl is discussed under hydrostatic
   pressures in the range of -11.4 GPa to 18.4 GPa in the framework of the
   density functional theory (DFT) and Boltzmann quasi-classical theory
   using the generalization gradient approximation (GGA). By applying the
   stress, the band gap in the minor spin increases so that the lowest band
   is obtained 0.25 eV at the pressure of -11.4 GPa while the maximum gap
   is calculated 0.9 eV at the pressure of 18.4 GPa. In all positive and
   negative pressures, the PdZrTiAl composition exhibits a half-metallic
   behavior 100\% spin polarization at the Fermi level. It is also found
   that applying stress increases the Seebeck coefficient in both spin
   directions. In the minority spin, the n-type PdZrTiAl, the power factor
   (PF) for all the cases is greater in the equilibrium state than the
   strain and stress conditions whereas in the majority spin, the PF value
   of the stress state is greater than the other two. The non-dimensional
   figure of merit (ZT) is significant and is about one in spin down in the
   room temperature for the all pressure states that it remains on this
   value by applying pressure. The obtained elastic constants indicate that
   the PdZrTiAl crystalline structure has a mechanical stability. Based on
   the Yong (E), Bulk (B) and shear (G) modulus and Poisson (n) ratio, the
   brittle-ductile behavior of this compound has been investigated under
   pressure. The results indicate that PdZrTiAl has a ductile nature and it
   is a stiffiless compound in which elastic and mechanical instability
   increases by applying strain.}},

Abstract = {{In this Study, the improvisation on mix design and the analysis of the
   strength of rubberized concrete is carried out. The carbon fiber is cut
   in the prescribed ratio and used for the partial replacement of coarse
   aggregates. The carbon fibers were mixed with the concrete to form a
   Rubberized concrete. To obtain a rubberized concrete mixture, all mix
   design parameters were kept constant as given by the IS-456 method
   except for the coarse aggregate constituents. The coarse aggregate of
   the concrete was replaced by 5\%, 10\%, 15\%, 20\% and 25\% of its
   weight. The fine aggregate was sieved using 2.36 mm in order to pass
   through the holes of the carbon fiber to make a strong contact with the
   cement matrix.
   From some experimental results of compressive strength testing it was
   observed that both plain and rubberized concrete developing similar
   strength over the curing period as expected. For all concrete mixtures,
   the rate of compressive strength developed was high between 7 and 14
   days and slow between 14 and 28 days. Also, it was noted that
   irrespective of the curing period, there was a systematic reduction in
   compressive strength with increasing rubber content of the composite.
   Some experimental investigations observed that a high percentage of
   carbon fiber mixed cylinders took a longer time to crackdown because of
   the elastic nature of the fibers when bearing the loading. Moreover, it
   was observed that the above said rubberized concrete did not exhibit
   brittle failure under compression or split tension. (C) 2019 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Based on the bi-material triangle lattice material, a new cellular
   structure: bi-material re-entrant triangle (BRT) is devised to
   incorporate tailorable coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) and

   of a triangle with two hypotenuse members. An equation to systematically
   build the relationship among the external force, the temperature
   increment and the deformation for the planar lattice material with
   boundedjoints is derived and then embedded into a theoretical model for
   devised BRT structure. Using master stiffness equation, effective PR,
   effective Young's modulus as well as effective CTE are computed. In
   order to guide designers to construct an initial concept quickly, the
   design domain for coupling negative CTE and negative PR properties is
   proposed. Nine available paired characteristics for coupling effect are
   extracted and demonstrated with ABAQUS simulation.}},

Abstract = {{Meta-materials are a class of artificial materials with a wide range of
   bulk properties that are different from the base material they are made
   of The term meta-material in the context of this research refers to a
   continuous, heterogeneous structure with prescribed elastic properties.
   Such meta-materials are designed using Topology Optimization (TO). Tools
   like SIMP interpolation, mesh filtering and continuation methods are
   used to address the numerical issues with Topology Optimization.
   In a previous research {[}1], by offsetting meta-material layers by a
   half-width of the Unit Cell, an auxetic honeycomb-like geometry was
   obtained. This was the first time such a shape was observed as the
   result of Topology Optimization targeting the effective shear modulus
   using square Unit Cells. This was obtained while designing the shear
   beam of a non-pneumatic wheel.
   This research studies the design of meta-materials using offsets other
   than zero or half-widths. The same problem {[}1] was solved for
   different values of offset, and the obtained geometries and volume
   fractions are studied. It is concluded that it may be beneficial for
   designers to consider offsetting meta-material layers with offsets other
   than half-width, to design novel, potentially better performing
   structures.}},

Abstract = {{Anisotropic textiles are commonly used in wearable applications to
   achieve varied bi-axial stress-strain behavior around the body. Auxetic
   textiles, specifically those that exhibit a negative Poisson's ratio
   (v), likewise exhibit intriguing behavior such as volume increase in
   response to impact or variable air permeability. Active textiles are
   traditional textile structures that integrate smart materials, such as
   shape memory alloys, shape memory polymers, or carbon nanotubes, to
   enable spatial actuation behavior, such as contraction for on-body
   compression or corrugation for haptic feedback. This research is a first
   experimental investigation into active auxetic and shearing textile
   structures. These textile structures leverage the bending- and
   torsional-deformations of the fibers/filaments within traditional
   textile structures as well as the shape memory effect of shape memory
   alloys to achieve novel, spatial performance. Five textile structures
   were fabricated from shape memory alloy wire deformed into needle lace
   and weft knit textile structures. All active structures exhibited
   anisotropic behavior and four of the five structures exhibited auxetic
   behavior upon free recovery, contracting in both x- and y-axes upon
   actuation (v = -0.3 to -1.5). One structure exhibited novel shearing
   behavior, with a mean free angle recovery of 7 degrees.
   Temperature-controlled biaxial tensile testing was conducted to
   experimentally investigate actuation behavior and anisotropy of the
   designed structures. The presented design and performance of these
   active auxetic, anisotropic, and shearing textiles inspire new
   capabilities for applications, such as smart wearables, soft robotics,
   reconfigurable aerospace structures, and medical devices.}},

Abstract = {{One of the leading contributors to assembly and reliability issues in
   electronic packaging arises from warpage and interfacial stresses
   stemming from coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) mismatch of the
   interfacing components. Trends toward miniaturizing and increasing
   density of the electronic packages exacerbate the assembly problems,
   leading to issues such as die cracking and board level assembly yield
   loss. One potential solution may be found in the inclusion of auxetic
   structures, which demonstrate negative Poisson's ratio through
   re-entrant geometries, which has been investigated for use in augmented
   structural mechanics for impact energy absorption. Because of the unique
   structural design, auxetics become thicker perpendicularly under an
   applied tensile load, unlike typical material loading responses. This
   interesting behavior has opportunity for integration into electronic
   packages for stress mitigation under thermal cycling since the
   structures can disrupt the typical expansion behavior. Here, auxetic
   trace geometries and structures were evaluated in various packaging
   implementations (die and substrate level) for warpage and stress
   reduction under thermal cycling conditions. By replacing standard
   Manhattan-style layouts and power and ground plane features with
   re-entrant trace geometries, reductions in thermomechanically induced
   interfacial stresses were observed, in addition to considering heat
   spreading properties within a package. Herein, deformation of silicon
   chip with addition of raised re-entrant Evans auxetics and raised
   ellipse shape auxetic traces as well as deformation of direct bonded
   copper (DBC) substrate with and without re-entrant auxetic patterned
   pads are estimated and compared using Finite Element Analysis (FEA) in
   ANSYS software. To demonstrate the benefits of passive auxetic traces, a
   planar transformer with re-entrant Evans auxetic patterns on PCB layers
   has been examined under full-load operating condition and compared with
   a traditionally patterned transformers. A better thermal distribution
   and lower maximum temperature in the device are achieved by including
   auxetic patterned features. FEA simulation results also show stress
   reduction in windings and lower deformation in PCB layers. Inclusion of
   auxetic structures in passive metal deposition layers which are not part
   of the circuit is shown to reduce maximum stress and warp deflection, as
   well as improve thermal gradient distribution and reduce overall
   temperature for 2D planar and 3D stacked packages. Consequently, use of
   auxetic features may extend package reliability significantly.}},

Title = {{Shape memory response and hierarchical motion capabilities of 4D printed

Journal = {{MECHANICS RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{103}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{4D printing refers to a novel trend in the field of active materials,
   regarding the employment of additive manufacturing to obtain structures
   presenting inherent complex shapes and shape evolutions under the
   application of proper stimuli. Such a technique is a powerful tool to
   realize auxetic structures with customized architectures and
   programmable/controllable shape change. The present paper proposes 4D
   printed shape memory polymer-based systems with auxetic structure,
   capable of hierarchical motion. The systems were prepared starting from
   a commercial photopolymer by means of stereolithography. The mechanical
   behavior of the systems was characterized in uniaxial tensile tests,
   measuring the strains parallel/perpendicular to the load direction.
   Thanks to a broad glass transition region, the photopolymer displays the
   so-called ``Temperature-Memory Effect{''} (TME), i.e. the possibility to
   tailor the thermal trigger of the Shape-Memory Effect (SME) through the
   deformation temperature. Thermo-mechanical histories were applied to a
   single unit cell to investigate both the overall shape memory response
   and the possibility to undergo multiple combined out-of-plane and
   in-plane motions on the basis of the TME. Obtained results allow
   discussing the effect of deformation temperatures on the thermal region
   triggering the SME and show the possibility to exploit the TME to
   achieve sequential self-deployment of auxetic structures. (C) 2019

Abstract = {{Auxetics (negative Poisson's ratio) and materials with negative linear
   compressibility (NLC) exhibit the anomalous mechanical properties of
   getting wider rather than thinner when stretched and expanding in at
   least one direction under hydrostatic pressure, respectively. A novel
   mechanism-termed the `triangular elongation mechanism'-leading to such
   anomalous behavior is presented and discussed through an analytical
   model. Amongst other things, it is shown that this novel mechanism, when
   combined with the well-known `rotating squares' model, can generate
   giant negative Poisson's ratios when the system is stretched.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In this contribution, a simplified macroscopic and semi-analytical
   thermal analysis of directed energy deposition (DED) is presented to
   obtain computationally efficient simulations of the entire process.
   Solidification and solid-state phase transitions are taken into account.
   The model is derived for laser metal powder directed energy deposition,
   although it can be simply adapted for other focused thermal energy
   (e.g., electron beam, or plasma arc). The gas flow used for carrying the
   powder significantly influences cooling conditions, which is included in
   the model. The proposed simulation strategy applies to multilayer
   composites with a wide range of shapes in the horizontal plane and
   arbitrary laser scanning strategies (continuous way, back and forth,
   etc.). The proposed work provides a simple tool to study the influence
   of most process parameters, design in situ experiments and in turn
   develop optimization loops to reach material requirements and specific
   microstructures. In situ pyrometer measurements have been compared to
   the model, and good agreement has been observed with 2.6\% error in
   average. The model is used to demonstrate the effect of various process
   parameters for a simple cylindrical geometry and a more complex auxetic
   cell.}},

Abstract = {{Graphene-based materials with a negative Poisson's ratio have numerous
   potential applications in various fields. However, the modification of
   graphene is cumbersome and may worsen the mechanical properties. The
   scale limitation and structural instabilities of suspended graphene are
   also unfavorable for practical applications. In the present study, we
   design several nanolayered graphene/Cu composites and investigate their
   tensile behavior using molecular dynamics simulations. The nanolayered
   composites exhibit an apparent auxetic behavior without any modification
   of graphene, as the graphene/Cu interface can significantly enhance the
   surface effect and lead to an earlier phase transformation of the Cu
   component. A simultaneous occurrence of a positive and negative
   Poisson's ratio can be achieved in an asymmetric composite due to the
   good blocking effect of graphene on two separated Cu films. Materials
   with simultaneous negative/positive Poisson's ratio have potential
   applications in scaffold design, where it is necessary to tune the
   magnitude and polarity of the Poisson's ratio in tissue engineering.
   Furthermore, we propose a composite consisting of alternating multilayer
   graphene and thin Cu films to overcome the scale limitation, whose
   negative Poisson's ratio persists when the total thickness exceeds 100
   nm. It is found that the change in the absolute value of Poisson's ratio
   becomes smaller with an increase in total thickness. Graphene/Cu
   composites with only a slight deformation under external loading may be
   suitable for the fabrication of telecommunication cables, whose
   dimensions should remain unchanged when subjected to high hydrostatic
   pressure in the deep ocean.}},

Journal = {{FORESTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The United States national inventory program measures a subset of tree
   heights in each plot in the Pacific Northwest. Unmeasured tree heights
   are predicted by adding the difference between modeled tree heights at
   two measurements to the height observed at the first measurement. This
   study compared different approaches for directly modeling 10-year height
   increment of red alder (RA) and ponderosa pine (PP) in Washington and
   Oregon using national inventory data from 2001-2015. In addition to the
   current approach, five models were implemented: nonlinear exponential,
   log-transformed linear, gamma, quasi-Poisson, and zero-inflated Poisson
   models using both tree-level (e.g., height, diameter at breast height,
   and compacted crown ratio) and plot-level (e.g., basal area, elevation,
   and slope) measurements as predictor variables. To account for negative
   height increment observations in the modeling process, a constant was
   added to shift all response values to greater than zero (log-transformed
   linear and gamma models), the negative increment was set to zero
   (quasi-Poisson and zero-inflated Poisson models), or a nonlinear model,
   which allows negative observations, was used. Random plot effects were
   included to account for the hierarchical data structure of the inventory
   data. Predictive model performance was examined through
   cross-validation. Among the implemented models, the gamma model
   performed best for both species, showing the smallest root mean square
   error (RSME) of 2.61 and 1.33 m for RA and PP, respectively (current
   method: RA-3.33 m, PP-1.40 m). Among the models that did not add the
   constant to the response, the quasi-Poisson model exhibited the smallest
   RMSE of 2.74 and 1.38 m for RA and PP, respectively. Our study showed
   that the prediction of tree height increment in Oregon and Washington
   can be improved by accounting for the negative and zero height increment
   values that are present in inventory data, and by including random plot
   effects in the models.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To identify psychosocial characteristics associated with
   dental anxiety in children aged 7-13 years in the dental setting.
   Material and Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted with
   children aged 7-13 years attended at the Dentistry School of Pelotas,
   Brazil. Data collection was based on a questionnaire administered to
   mothers and children, and the behavior of children during dental
   treatment was evaluated using the Frankl' Scale. Data were analyzed
   using Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests in order to analyze the
   association between independent variables and dental anxiety. The effect
   of variables on the outcome was assessed by the Poisson regression model
   with robust variance (Prevalence Ratio; 95\% Confidence interval).
   Results: A total of 187 children were included. Dental anxiety
   prevalence was 40.11\%. After adjustments, younger children (p=0.046),
   only child (p=0.019), and children with negative previous dental
   experience (p=0.046) showed higher dental anxiety prevalence. Children
   with uncooperative behavior in previous (p=0.033) and current (p=0.001)
   dental appointments showed higher dental anxiety prevalence. Conclusion:
   In this sample of children treated at a dentistry school, a report of
   dental anxiety was associated with age, birth order, previous dental
   experience and behavior in dental settings.}},

Abstract = {{An experimental and numerical investigation of fatigue life and crack
   propagation in two-dimensional perforated aluminum structures is
   presented. Specifically, the performance of positive Poisson's ratio
   (PPR) geometries using circular holes is compared to that of auxetic
   stop-hole and straight-groove hole geometries. Mechanical fatigue
   testing shows that the considered auxetic structures have more than 20\%
   longer life than the porous PPR structure at the same porosity and peak
   effective maximum stress despite having holes with larger stress
   concentrations. Digital image correlation is used to detect crack
   initiation and damage propagation much earlier than can be detected by
   the unaided eye. Accompanying finite element analyses reveal that
   auxetic structures have the advantage over their PPR counterparts by
   delaying crack initiation, spreading damage over a larger area, and
   having a stress intensity factor that decreases over a significant range
   of crack lengths. In addition, numerical simulations suggest that
   auxetic structures maintain their negative Poisson's ratios in the
   presence of cracks.}},

   semester of 2017 was held at a university in Southern Brazil. The
   outcome of major depressive episode was evaluated using the Patient
   Health Questionnaire-9, considered when the individual had five or more
   depressive symptoms for at least one week. Its prevalence was estimated,
   and the associated factors were examined by the hierarchical
   multivariable analysis using the Poisson regression model.
   RESULTS: A total of 32\% (95\% confidence interval 29.9-34.2) of
   university students presented a major depressive episode, and the
   problem was more frequent among women (prevalence ratio {[}PR] = 1.59);
   people aged 21 to 23 years (PR = 1.24); those with a family history of
   depression (PR = 1.27); minorities' sexual orientation (homosexuals, PR
   = 1.64, and bisexuals, PR = 1.69); who lived with friends or colleagues
   (PR = 1.36); students in the area of applied social and human sciences
   (PR = 1.28), and linguistics, language and literature, and art (PR =
   1.25). The worst academic performance (PR = 2.61), alcohol abuse (PR =
   1.25), and illicit drug use (PR = 1.30) were also positively associated
   with major depressive episode.
   CONCLUSION: In addition to individual, family, and behavioral aspects,
   already described as risk factors for major depressive episodes in the
   general population, academic aspects also influence the occurrence of
   depression among university students. Considering the high prevalence of
   major depressive episode and its negative impact on health, public and
   institutional policies are necessary to focus on students' mental health
   promotion and care.}},

Abstract = {{Bicycle-car accidents at signalized intersections account for a
   considerable part of bicycle accidents. Factors that have effects on the
   bicycle-car crash risk at signalized intersections are not well
   understood. Especially, the safety effects of bicycle facilities are
   controversial at intersections. This paper aims to identify factors that
   have significant effects on bicycle-car crash risk at signalized
   intersections and their effect directions. The negative binomial
   regression model is used to model associations between the frequency of
   bicycle-car accidents at signalized intersections and the contributory
   factors, based on 6-year accident history at 140 signalized
   intersections in Berlin, Germany. The considered factors include the
   traffic volume, geometric data, and bicycle-specific and car-specific
   infrastructures. The factor effect coefficients are estimated by the
   maximum likelihood approach. The estimated coefficient of the negative
   binomial dispersion parameter is significant at the level of 0.001.
   Three factors are identified to have significant effects on the crash
   risk. The traffic volume of cars across intersections has negative
   effects on the cycling safety. Regarding bicycle facilities, the number
   of bicycle lanes on intersection approaches has positive safety effects,
   whereas the intersections with more bicycle paths is subject to a higher
   crash risk, though intersection modifications are applied for bicycle
   paths. The results support the choice of the negative binomial
   regression over the Poisson regression in this study. The estimated
   effects provide implications for the cycling safety improvement at
   signalized intersections.}},

Abstract = {{Meta-biomaterials are designer biomaterials with unusual and even
   unprecedented properties that primarily originate from their geometrical
   designs at different (usually smaller) length scales. This concept has
   been primarily used in the context of orthopedic biomaterials with the
   ultimate aim of improving the bone tissue regeneration performance of
   implants and decreasing the risk of implant-associated infections. In
   this paper, we review the ways though which geometrical design at the
   macro-, micro-, and nanoscales combined with advanced additive
   manufacturing techniques (3D printing) could be used to create the
   unusual properties of meta-biomaterials. Due to their intended
   applications in orthopedics, metallic and hard polymeric biomaterials
   have received the most attention in the literature. However, the
   reviewed concepts are, at least in principle, applicable to a wide range
   of biomaterials including ceramics and soft polymers. At the macroscale,
   we discuss the concepts of patient-specific implants, deployable
   meta-implants, and shape-morphing implants. At the microscale, we
   introduce the concept of multi-physics meta-biomaterials while also
   covering the applications of auxetic meta-biomaterials for improving the
   longevity of orthopedic implants. At the nanoscale, the different
   aspects of the geometrical design of surface nanopatterns that
   simultaneously stimulate the osteogenic differentiation of stem cells
   and kill bacteria are presented. The concept of origami-based
   meta-biomaterials and the applications of self-folding mechanisms in the
   fabrication of meta-biomaterials are addressed next. We conclude with a
   discussion on the available evidence regarding the superior performance
   of meta-biomaterials and suggest some possible avenues for future
   research.}},

Title = {{Individual Risk Prediction for Sight-Threatening Retinopathy of

Abstract = {{Question Can a prediction model be constructed for retinopathy of
   prematurity needing treatment by using only birth characteristics data
   and applying advanced statistical methods? Findings In this cohort study
   of 6947 infants born at gestational age 24 to 30 weeks, the prediction
   model incorporating only postnatal age, gestational age, sex, and birth
   weight provided a predictive ability for retinopathy of prematurity
   needing treatment that was comparable to current models requiring
   postnatal data (not always available). The risk for retinopathy of
   prematurity needing treatment increased up to 12 weeks' postnatal age
   irrespective of the infants' gestational age. Meaning This prediction
   model identifying infants with a high risk for developing
   sight-threatening disease at an early time may improve the conditions
   for optimal screening.
   This cohort study creates and validates an easy-to-use prediction model
   using only birth characteristics and describes a continuous hazard
   function for retinopathy of prematurity treatment.
   Importance To prevent blindness, repeated infant eye examinations are
   performed to detect severe retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), yet only a
   small fraction of those screened need treatment. Early individual risk
   stratification would improve screening timing and efficiency and
   potentially reduce the risk of blindness. Objectives To create and
   validate an easy-to-use prediction model using only birth
   characteristics and to describe a continuous hazard function for ROP
   treatment. Design, Setting, and Participants In this retrospective
   cohort study, Swedish National Patient Registry data from infants
   screened for ROP (born between January 1, 2007, and August 7, 2018) were
   analyzed with Poisson regression for time-varying data (postnatal age,
   gestational age {[}GA], sex, birth weight, and important interactions)
   to develop an individualized predictive model for ROP treatment (called
   DIGIROP-Birth {[}Digital ROP]). The model was validated internally and
   externally (in US and European cohorts) and compared with 4 published
   prediction models. Main Outcomes and Measures The study outcome was ROP
   treatment. The measures were estimated momentary and cumulative risks,
   hazard ratios with 95\% CIs, area under the receiver operating
   characteristic curve (hereinafter referred to as AUC), sensitivity,
   specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive
   value (NPV). Results Among 7609 infants (54.6\% boys; mean {[}SD] GA,
   28.1 {[}2.1] weeks; mean {[}SD] birth weight, 1119 {[}353] g), 442
   (5.8\%) were treated for ROP, including 142 (40.1\%) treated of 354 born
   at less than 24 gestational weeks. Irrespective of GA, the risk for
   receiving ROP treatment increased during postnatal weeks 8 through 12
   and decreased thereafter. Validations of DIGIROP-Birth for 24 to 30
   weeks' GA showed high predictive ability for the model overall (AUC,
   0.90 {[}95\% CI, 0.89-0.92] for internal validation, 0.94 {[}95\% CI,
   0.90-0.98] for temporal validation, 0.87 {[}95\% CI, 0.84-0.89] for US
   external validation, and 0.90 {[}95\% CI, 0.85-0.95] for European
   external validation) by calendar periods and by race/ethnicity. The
   sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were numerically at least as high
   as those obtained from CHOP-ROP (Children's Hospital of
   Philadelphia-ROP), OMA-ROP (Omaha-ROP), WINROP (weight, insulinlike
   growth factor 1, neonatal, ROP), and CO-ROP (Colorado-ROP), models
   requiring more complex postnatal data. Conclusions and Relevance This
   study validated an individualized prediction model for infants born at
   24 to 30 weeks' GA, enabling early risk prediction of ROP treatment
   based on birth characteristics data. Postnatal age rather than
   postmenstrual age was a better predictive variable for the temporal risk
   of ROP treatment. The model is an accessible online application that
   appears to be generalizable and to have at least as good test statistics
   as other models requiring longitudinal neonatal data not always readily
   available to ophthalmologists.}},

Abstract = {{Background Pregnant women in settings with high HIV prevalence are at
   increased risk of HIV acquisition and subsequent vertical transmission.
   We implemented and evaluated a novel programme to provide pre-exposure
   prophylaxis (PrEP) in maternal and child health clinics in Kenya.
   Methods In collaboration with Kisumu County Department of Health, we
   integrated PrEP delivery within 16 maternal and child health clinics in
   Kisumu County (Kenya). Women and girls older than 15 years seeking
   maternal and child health services who tested HIV negative at that visit
   or within a month and were willing to receive PrEP counselling were
   interviewed to assess for HIV behavioural risk factors and offered PrEP.
   Correlates of PrEP initiation and continuation were assessed using
   Poisson regression in univariate and multivariate analyses. Potential
   correlates included in our analyses were age, marital status, marriage
   type, whether pregnant or post partum, gestational age (if pregnant),
   and HIV risk factors in the previous 6 months. Reasons for the decision
   to discontinue after having decided to initiate PrEP were evaluated.
   Women who initiated PrEP were followed up 1 month, 3 months, and 6
   months after initiation.
   Findings Between Nov 20, 2017, and June 13, 2018, 9376 pregnant and
   post-partum women were assessed for behavioural risk factors and
   willingness to initiate PrEP. Overall, 2030 (21.7\%) initiated PrEP, and
   2027 had the status of their partner captured (153 {[}79.3\%] of 193
   women with partners living with HIV, 1178 {[}37.2\%] of 3165 women with
   partners of unknown HIV status, and 696 {[}11.6\%] of 5997 women with
   HIV-negative partners). Predictors of PrEP initiation in the
   multivariate analysis were: being younger than 24 years (adjusted
   prevalence ratio 1.14, 95\% CI 1.02-1.28); having a partner living with
   HIV (6.96, 5.46-8.89) or of unknown HIV status (3.08, 2.50-3.81);
   gestational age of less than 26 weeks (1.22, 1.02-1.47); having been
   diagnosed or treated for a sexually transmitted infection (1.57,
   1.20-2.06); having been forced to have sex (1.82, 1.38-2.42); having
   experienced intimate partner violence during the previous 6 months
   (1.65, 1.10-2.48); having shared needles while engaging in injection
   drug use (2.43, 1.69-3.50); and recurrent use of post-exposure
   prophylaxis (1.96, 1.36-2.82). Overall, 786 (38.7\%) of 2030 women who
   initiated PrEP continued use after the first month, with 104 (68.0\%) of
   153 women who had a partner living with HIV continuing use. Having a
   partner living with HIV was the only predictor of PrEP continuation at 1
   month in the multivariable model (1.98, 1.54-2.55). Frequent reasons for
   discontinuation were side effects and low HIV risk perception. No
   incident HIV infection was reported among women on PrEP.
   Interpretation Many women attending maternal and child health clinics
   had risk factors for HIV and elected to use PrEP, indicating that
   routinely accessed maternal and child health clinics can be an effective
   platform for PrEP delivery for young women. As PrEP awareness rises,
   PrEP provision in routine clinical settings such as maternal and child
   health facilities might contribute to decreased HIV incidence among
   young women. Copyright (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We study the rank-frequency distribution of syllables in texts from
   written press in Bamana and Guinean Maninka, two closely related
   languages from the Manding group of the Mande family in West Africa.
   Five issues of widely circulating newspapers are analyzed in each
   language. The Bamana texts are written in a Roman-based alphabet without
   marking of tones, while Maninka texts are published in the N'ko alphabet
   comprising a superficial notation of tones. For the sake of comparisons,
   the Maninka data are also compiled for syllables with tonal distinctions
   neglected. The obtained rank-frequency distributions of syllables are
   fitted using two discrete distributions, Jain-Poisson and positive
   negative binomial, as well as the continuous Yule distribution. In most
   cases, a satisfactory fit was achieved, with the determination
   coefficient R-2 > 0.95 and discrepancy coefficient C < 0.02. The
   relation of the Yule distribution and Zipf's law with respect to the
   number of syllable types is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Objective The aim of the study was to evaluate the validity of anal
   cytology against high-resolution anoscopy in the detection of anal
   high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs) among women in a
   clinical setting in Puerto Rico, alone and in combination with high-risk
   human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) typing. Materials and Methods A
   cross-sectional study was done among 128 eligible women who attended the
   Anal Neoplasia Clinic of the University of Puerto Rico Comprehensive
   Center between 2014 and 2019. Kappa (kappa) coefficient, sensitivity,
   specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value
   were calculated using high-resolution anoscopy with biopsy as the
   criterion standard test. Poisson regression was used to estimate the
   adjusted prevalence ratio of anal HR-HPV infection. Results Overall,
   71.1\% of women were HIV infected and 78.9\% had anal HR-HPV infection.
   Squamous intraepithelial lesions were detected with anal cytology and
   histology in 70.3\% and 81.3\% of women, respectively. The kappa
   statistic between the tests (cytology and histology) was 0.32 (p < .05).
   Measured against the results from histology, the sensitivity of anal
   cytology alone to detect HSIL was 85.4\% (95\% CI = 72.2\%-93.9\%),
   whereas specificity was 38.8\% (95\% CI = 28.1\%-50.3\%). Although the
   sensitivity of the 2 tests combined (anal cytology and HR-HPV typing) to
   detect histologically confirmed HSIL increased (100.0\%, 95\% CI =
   92.6\%-100.0\%), the specificity decreased (16.3\%, 95\% CI =
   9.0\%-26.2\%). Meanwhile, women with HSIL had a higher prevalence of
   anal HR-HPV infection than those with no SIL/LSIL (prevalence ratio =
   6.23, 95\% CI = 1.50-25.83). Conclusions Anal cytology in combination
   with HR-HPV typing for the screening of anal intraepithelial neoplasia
   improved the detection of HSIL in women.}},

Title = {{Evaluation of the dynamic response of structures using auxetic-type base
   isolation}},
Journal = {{FRATTURA ED INTEGRITA STRUTTURALE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Number = {{51}},
Pages = {{52-70}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Base isolation is a widely-used method used to minimise the harmful
   effects of earthquakes on buildings. Unlike a fixed base building, a
   building with a base isolation system essentially decouples the
   superstructure from the substructure resting on the ground. Then, during
   earthquakes, the superstructure's relative displacement is significantly
   reduced, minimising the structural damage. Auxetics, which are materials
   with a negative Poisson's ratio, are known for possessing properties
   such as high energy absorption. Based on the energy absorbing
   capabilities of auxetic materials, it is proposed that incorporating
   them into base isolation structures would positively impact on the
   performance of the system. Therefore, the article aims to investigate
   the response of structures under seismic loading incorporating
   re-entrant hexagon layers into the base isolation system. This is
   assessed by defining and numerically testing the system using finite
   element analysis. The models developed for this study represent
   multi-story structural steel frames combined with fixed base,
   conventional lead-rubber bearing and auxetic composite base isolation.
   Differences in the response obtained from the mentioned systems are
   highlighted. Results indicate that the auxetic base isolation may
   improve the dynamic response of structures, although a unique
   performance is not recorded.}},

   ratio}},
Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{171}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Artificial auxetic materials with negative Poisson's ratio enable
   distinctive elastic response in the direction orthogonal to the loaded
   direction, i.e. shrinking when compressed and expanding when stretched,
   compared to conventional materials. Such distinctive mechanical
   characteristic makes auxetic materials unique in practice. Current
   studies in this aspect focus mainly on the realization of beam-dominated
   microstructures such as reentrant and chiral lattices and of cellular
   microstructures with orthogonal elliptical hole pattern. In this study,
   a novel two-dimensional auxetic microstructure is designed by
   introducing peanut-shaped holes in solid bulk matrix. Compared to the
   microstructure with elliptical hole pattern, the present design can
   produce slightly larger negative Poisson's ratio and achieve
   significantly lower stress level. The samples consisting of a number of
   centimeter-scale unit cells with the peanut-shaped holes are fabricated
   efficiently via additive manufacturing technique. Experiment and finite
   element simulation of tensile test are carried out on the specific
   sample to demonstrate the auxetic effect of the present design and
   simultaneously verify the computational model. Finally, effects of some
   parameters on Poisson's ratio, which may control the auxetic behavior of
   the present microstructure, are discussed for better understanding
   deformation mechanism of the proposed auxetic material.}},

Abstract = {{The crystal structures and elastic properties of the anhydrous zinc and
   cadmium oxalates and lead oxalate dihydrate are determined using
   rigorous first-principles solid-state methods. The three materials are
   shown to display negative Poisson's ratios (NPR) and to exhibit the
   negative linear compressibility (NLC) phenomenon. Anhydrous zinc and
   cadmium oxalates display NLC for a very wide range of external pressures
   applied in the direction of minimum compressibility in the ranges -1.3
   to 5.5 GPa and -1.2 to 2.7 GPa, respectively. The increase of volume in
   both materials is substantial for pressures larger than 3.6 and 1.8 GPa,
   and the compressibilities become -70.1 and -67.0 TPa-1 for pressures of
   5.2 and 2.6 GPa, respectively. The increase of volume is so drastic that
   these materials become unstable for pressures larger than 5.5 and 2.7
   GPa. Lead oxalate dihydrate also displays NLC along the direction of
   minimum Poisson's ratio for negative pressures in the range -0.05 to
   -0.08 GPa and undergoes a pressure-induced phase transition for
   relatively low external pressures of the order of 0.1 GPa. The presence
   of NPR and NLC phenomena in these three materials together with the
   previous finding of these phenomena for silver oxalate strongly suggests
   that other metal oxalate materials could also exhibit an extremely
   anomalous mechanical behavior.}},

Title = {{Lasting s-ketamine block of spreading depolarizations in subarachnoid
   hemorrhage: a retrospective cohort study}},
Journal = {{CRITICAL CARE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{DEC 30}},
Abstract = {{Objective: Spreading depolarizations (SD) are characterized by breakdown
   of transmembrane ion gradients and excitotoxicity. Experimentally,
   N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonists block a majority of
   SDs. In many hospitals, the NMDAR antagonist s-ketamine and the GABAA
   agonist midazolam represent the current second-line combination
   treatment to sedate patients with devastating cerebral injuries. A
   pressing clinical question is whether this option should become
   first-line in sedation-requiring individuals in whom SDs are detected,
   yet the s-ketamine dose necessary to adequately inhibit SDs is unknown.
   Moreover, use-dependent tolerance could be a problem for SD inhibition
   in the clinic.
   Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study of 66 patients with
   aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) from a prospectively collected
   database. Thirty-three of 66 patients received s-ketamine during
   electrocorticographic neuromonitoring of SDs in neurointensive care. The
   decision to give s-ketamine was dependent on the need for stronger
   sedation, so it was expected that patients receiving s-ketamine would
   have a worse clinical outcome.
   Results: S-ketamine application started 4.2 +/- 3.5 days after aSAH. The
   mean dose was 2.8 +/- 1.4 mg/kg body weight (BW)/h and thus higher than
   the dose recommended for sedation. First, patients were divided
   according to whether they received s-ketamine at any time or not. No
   significant difference in SD counts was found between groups (negative
   binomial model using the SD count per patient as outcome variable, p =
   0.288). This most likely resulted from the fact that 368 SDs had already
   occurred in the s-ketamine group before s-ketamine was given. However,
   in patients receiving s-ketamine, we found a significant decrease in SD
   incidence when s-ketamine was started (Poisson model with a random
   intercept for patient, coefficient - 1.83 (95\% confidence intervals -
   2.17; -1.50), p < 0.001; logistic regression model, odds ratio (OR) 0.13
   (0.08; 0.19), p < 0.001). Thereafter, data was further divided into
   low-dose (0.1-2.0 mg/kg BW/h) and high-dose (2.1-7.0 mg/kg/h) segments.
   High-dose s-ketamine resulted in further significant decrease in SD
   incidence (Poisson model, - 1.10 (- 1.71; - 0.49), p < 0.001; logistic
   regression model, OR 0.33 (0.17; 0.63), p < 0.001). There was little
   evidence of SD tolerance to long-term s-ketamine sedation through 5

Title = {{The association between dengue incidences and provincial-level weather
   variables in Thailand from 2001 to 2014}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{14}},

Abstract = {{Dengue and dengue hemorrhagic pose significant burdens in many tropical
   countries. Dengue incidences have perpetually increased, leading to an
   annual (uncertain) peak. Dengue cases cause an enormous public health
   problem in Thailand because there is no anti-viral drug against the
   dengue virus. Searching for means to reduce the dengue incidences is a
   challenging and appropriate strategy for primary prevention in a dengue
   outbreak. This study constructs the best predictive model from past
   statistical dengue incidences at the provincial level and studies the
   relationships among dengue incidences and weather variables. We
   conducted experiments for 65 provinces (out of 77 provinces) in Thailand
   since there is no dengue information for the remaining provinces.
   Predictive models were constructed using weekly data during 2001-2014.
   The training set are data during 2001-2013, and the test set is the data
   from 2014. Collected data were separated into two parts: current dengue
   cases as the dependent variable, and weather variables and previous
   dengue cases as the independent variables. Eight weather variables are
   used in our models: average pressure, maximum temperature, minimum
   temperature, average humidity, precipitation, vaporization, wind
   direction, wind power. Each weather variable includes the current week
   and one to three weeks of lag time. A total of 32 independent weather
   variables are used for each province. The previous one to three weeks of
   dengue cases are also used as independent variables. There is a total of
   35 independent variables. Predictive models were constructed using five
   methods: Poisson regression, negative binomial regression, quasi
   likelihood regression, ARIMA(3,1,4) and SARIMA(2,0,1)(0,2,0). The best
   model is determined by combinations of 1-12 variables, which are
   232,989,800 models for each province. We construct a total of
   15,144,337,000 models. The best model is selected by the average from
   high to low of the coefficient of determination (R2) and the lowest root
   mean square error (RMSE). From our results, the one-week lag previous
   case variable is the most frequent in 55 provinces out of a total of 65
   provinces (coefficient of determinations with a minimum of 0.257 and a
   maximum of 0.954, average of 0.6383, 95\% CI: 0.57313 to 0.70355). The
   most influential weather variable is precipitation, which is used in
   most of the provinces, followed by wind direction, wind power, and
   barometric pressure. The results confirm the common knowledge that
   dengue incidences occur most often during the rainy season. It also
   shows that wind direction, wind power, and barometric pressure also have
   influences on the number of dengue cases. These three weather variables
   may help adult mosquitos to survive longer and spread dengue. In
   conclusion, The most influential factor for further cases is the number
   of dengue cases. However, weather variables are also needed to obtain
   better results. Predictions of the number of dengue cases should be done
   locally, not at the national level. The best models of different
   provinces use different sets of weather variables. Our model has an
   accuracy that is sufficient for the real prediction of future dengue
   incidences, to prepare for and protect against severe dengue outbreaks.}},

Abstract = {{A challenge in nano- and micro-mechanics is the realization of
   innovative materials exploiting auxetic behaviour to tailor thermal
   expansion properties. For this purpose, a new class of micro-structured
   media possessing an extremely wide range of tunable (positive, negative

   experimentally assessed. For this class of isotropic Mechanical-Auxetic
   Thermal-Shrinking media, the effective coefficient of thermal expansion
   is explicitly linked to two microstructural variables via a simple
   relation, allowing the design with desired values. The theoretical
   predictions for the negative thermal properties are fully validated by
   the experimental and numerical outcomes. The simplicity of the proposed
   structure makes the design useful for the production of a new generation
   of advanced media, with applications ranging from micromechanical
   devices to large civil and space structures.}},

   exhibits a better energy absorbing potential than other re-entrant

Abstract = {{Most materials exhibit positive Poisson's ratio (PR) values, but special
   structures can also present negative and, even rarer, zero (or close to
   zero) PR. Null PR structures have received much attention due to their
   unusual properties and potential applications in different fields, such
   as aeronautics and bioengineering. Herein, a new and simple near-zero PR
   2D topological model is presented based on a structural block composed
   of two smooth and rigid bars connected by a soft membrane or spring. It
   is not based on reentrant or honeycomb-like configurations, which have
   been the basis of many null or quasinull PR models. The topological
   model is 3D printed, and the experimentally obtained PR is -0.003 +/-
   0.001 which is one of the closest to zero values ever reported. The
   possibility to extend this model to 3D systems with compression in any
   direction is discussed. The advantages and disadvantages of these models
   are also addressed.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOLIDS AND STRUCTURES}},

Volume = {{180}},
Pages = {{13-29}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic materials or structures, especially 3D cellular lattice
   architectures with negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) have attracted great
   attention due to their unprecedented mechanical behaviors and promising
   applications in recent years. Many 3D auxetic architected cellular
   materials have been manufactured and characterized with polymers and
   metals using additive manufacturing technology as well as some fibre
   reinforced polymers (FRP) composites via assembly method, however metal
   3D printed auxetic structures with high-quality are rarely reported and
   FRP composites using assembly method contain a variety of defects which
   result in a knock-down effect on mechanical properties. Auxetic
   structures made from polymers are normally of low stiffness and strength
   and FRP composites are of low toughness and impact resistance, which
   causes limitations on their structural and functional applications. If
   rationally designed structures can be made from high-performance metal
   materials the specific stiffness and strength of which are much higher
   than polymers, their specific stiffness and strength can be
   significantly increased which will make them more suitable for various
   potential applications. This paper presents novel 3D double-U
   hierarchical structures (DUHs) based on double-V hierarchical structures
   (DVHs) with tunable Poisson's ratio and Young's modulus by tailoring the
   geometry parameters. Experimental, numerical and theoretical results
   show that DUHs have smooth geometry that can reduce manufacturing damage
   and stress concentration under elastic loading. Another advantage of
   DUHs is that the curved configurations have enhanced auxetic behavior
   and higher static collapse stress than DVHs under crushing. The advanced
   3D printing technology and those excellent mechanical properties of 3D
   DUHs meet the requirements of structural and functional applications.

Abstract = {{Because of the particular characteristics of layered materials,
   searching for new two-dimensional (2D) structures has become the
   foundation of future device manufacture. Using first-principles
   calculations and theoretical analysis, we identified a new monolayer B2O
   and systematically investigated its fundamental mechanical and
   electronic properties, especially under strain. Due to the complicated
   puckered hinge structure of monolayer B2O, it possesses an intrinsic
   negative Poisson's ratio of -0.021. Moreover, we found that the
   superconducting state of monolayer B2O can be improved, where strain
   plays an effective role in regulating the properties of the 2D material.
   The current results elucidate the structure and corresponding properties
   of monolayer B2O, which may stimulate related fundamental research and

Abstract = {{Auxetic fabrics made of nonauxetic yarns have gained increasing interest
   of textile scientists. Most recently, single-layered bistretch auxetic
   woven fabrics made of nonauxetic yarns based on parallel in-phase zigzag
   foldable geometry have been reported to have auxetic behavior when
   stretched along both principal directions. It is also reported that this
   geometry can possibly be realized into double-layered woven fabrics. In
   addition, it is suggested that the phenomenon of differential shrinkage
   can be exploited to realize another variation of foldable geometry such
   as out-of-phase zigzag foldable structures into woven fabrics.
   Therefore, herein, two possibilities aimed to be explored are
   double-layered auxetic woven fabric based on parallel in-phase zigzag
   foldable geometry and single-layered fabrics based on out-of-phase
   zigzag foldable geometry that are developed using the phenomenon of
   differential shrinkage to realize these geometries into the woven fabric
   structures. Five different auxetic woven fabric samples are fabricated
   using elastic and nonelastic yarns on a conventional weaving machine and
   tested along two principal directions. The testing results show that all
   the developed fabrics have auxetic behavior in both principal
   directions, and the placement of weaves and weft yarn arrangements has
   an obvious effect.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrogen storage is one of the attractive research interests in recent
   years due to the advantages of hydrogen to be used as energy source. The
   studies on hydrogen storage applications focus mainly on investigation
   of hydrogen storage capabilities of newly introduced compounds. The
   present paper aims at characterization of CaXH3 (X: Mn, Fe, or Co)
   perovskite-type hydrides for the first time to understand their
   potential contribution to the hydrogen storage applications. CaXH3
   compounds have been investigated by density functional theory studies to
   reveal their various characteristics and hydrogen storage properties.
   CaXH3 compounds have been optimized in cubic crystal structure and the
   lattice constants of studied compounds have been obtained as 3.60, 3.50,
   and 3.48 angstrom for X: Mn, Fe, and Co compounds, respectively. The
   optimized structures have negative formation enthalpies pointing out
   that studied compounds are thermodynamically stable and could be
   synthesized experimentally. The gravimetric hydrogen storage densities
   of X: Mn, Fe, and Co compounds were found in as 3.09, 3.06, and 2.97
   wt\%, respectively. The revealed values for hydrogen storage densities
   indicate that CaXH3 compounds may be potential candidates for hydrogen
   storage applications. Moreover, various mechanical parameters of
   interest compounds like elastic constants, bulk modulus, and Poisson's
   ratio have been reported throughout the study. These compounds were
   found mechanically stable with satisfying Born stability criteria.
   Further analyses based on Cauchy pressure and Pugh criterion, showed
   that they have brittleness nature and relatively hard materials. In
   addition, the electronic characteristics, band structures, and
   associated partial density of states of CaXH3 hydrides have been
   revealed. The dynamic stability behavior of them was verified based on
   the phonon dispersion curves.}},

Title = {{Experimental and numerical analysis of wooden sandwich panels with an
   auxetic core and oval cells}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{183}},
Month = {{DEC 5}},
Abstract = {{Wood consumption is constantly being rationalized by the production of
   modern wood-based materials, especially honeycomb plates. Due to the
   beneficial properties of the auxetics, wooden honeycomb panels with
   auxetic cores can be used as structural elements. In particularly as
   walls and partitions in wooden houses, as well as shelves and bodies for
   cabinet furniture. Thus the aim of this study was to determine rigidity,
   strength and capacity to absorb energy in novel sandwich honeycomb
   boards manufactured from beech wood with oval cells of the auxetic core.
   Samples with honeycomb boards were subjected to uniaxial compression and
   three-point bending. Based on testing results it was shown that cores of
   oval cells exhibited auxetic properties and a strong orthotropy. Density
   of honeycomb panels is below 400 kg/m3, thus they may be classified as
   lightweight boards. Thanks to a high value of the modulus of linear
   elasticity and bending strength the designed board is a good substitute
   for traditional wood-based panels. During bending honeycomb panels with
   auxetic cores more effectively absorb energy compared to the same panels
   subjected to axial compression. These investigations provide the
   foundation for further studies on optimization of the board structure
   and its applicability in industrial practice. (C) 2019 The Author.

Abstract = {{Frequencies and energies of vibrations for a honeycomb sandwich plate
   with negative Possion's ratio are investigated. Based on Reddy's
   third-order shear deformation plate theory, von Karman type nonlinear
   theory and Hamilton theory, the equations of motion for the plate are
   obtained, free vibrations and vibrations with the damping and in-plane
   force of the plate are considered, respectively. The changes of real
   parts of the eigenvalues with the damping and in-plane forces of the
   plate are obtained. In order to obtain the analytic solutions of the
   frequencies and energies of the plate, lateral free vibrations are
   considered by using the Hamilton energy method, and we compare the
   results with that of the previous free vibrations. The potential
   energies and the total energies variation with parameters of the plate
   are given. The research results from the two methods show that the
   change trends of the frequencies and energy of the plate are exactly
   consistent, but the values of natural frequencies and potential energies
   are lager in lateral vibrations.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives The aim of this analysis is to: (i) assess the prevalence of
   clinically significant depressive symptoms at baseline and follow-up for
   participants in the PROUD trial of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP),
   examining changes in prevalence over time and (ii) investigate the
   association of socioeconomic and psychosocial factors with depression.
   Methods PROUD was an open label randomised trial evaluating the benefit
   of PrEP for 544 HIV-negative gay, bisexual and other men who have sex
   with men (GBMSM) in England. Enrolment was between 2012 and 2014, with
   at least 2 years follow-up. Prevalence of depression (score >= 10 on
   Patient Health Questionnaire-9) was assessed and compared across
   time-points (using McNemar's chi(2) tests) and between trial arms (using
   chi(2) tests). Cross-sectional associations with socioeconomic and
   psychosocial factors were examined using baseline data in modified
   Poisson regression models and combined 12 and 24 month follow-up data in
   generalised estimating equations (GEEs). Prevalence ratios (PRs) were
   presented as unadjusted PR and adjusted PR (aPR) for age, UK birth,
   sexual identity, university education, London study clinic site and
   calendar time (and follow-up time-point in GEEs).
   Results Depression increased significantly from baseline (9.1\%; 49/540)
   to the 12 month (14.4\%; 59/410) and 24 month (14.4\%; 48/333)
   follow-ups, possibly explained by underreporting at baseline. The
   prevalence of depression did not differ by study trial arm, at any
   time-point. In the baseline analysis, younger age, unemployment and
   crystal methamphetamine use, was associated with depression. In combined
   analysis of 12 and 24 month data, measures of intimate partner violence
   (IPV) (lifetime IPV victimisation aPR 2.57 (95\% CI: 1.71 to 3.86)),
   internalised homophobia (aPR 1.91 (95\% CI: 1.29 to 2.83)) and
   concealment of sexual identity (aPR 1.75 (95\% CI: 1.16 to 2.65)), were
   strongly associated with depression.
   Conclusions There is a high concomitant burden of psychosocial factors
   with depression among GBMSM.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The extent to which rural-to-urban migration affects risk
   for cardiometabolic diseases (CMD) in Africa is not well understood. We
   investigated prevalence and risk for obesity, diabetes, hypertension and
   precursor conditions by migration status.
   Methods: In a cross-sectional survey in Malawi (February 2013-March
   2017), 13 903 rural, 9929 rural-to-urban migrant and 6741 urban
   residents (>= 18 years old) participated. We interviewed participants,
   measured blood pressure and collected anthropometric data and fasting
   blood samples to estimate population prevalences and odds ratios, using
   negative binomial regression, for CMD, by migration status. In a
   sub-cohort of 131 rural-urban siblings-sets, migration-associated CMD
   risk was explored using conditional Poisson regression.
   Results: In rural, rural-to-urban migrant and urban residents,
   prevalence estimates were; 8.9, 20.9 and 15.2\% in men and 25.4, 43.9
   and 39.3\% in women for overweight/obesity; 1.4, 2.9 and 1.9\% in men
   and 1.5, 2.8 and 1.7\% in women for diabetes; and 13.4, 18.8 and 12.2\%
   in men and 13.7, 15.8 and 10.2\% in women for hypertension.
   Rural-to-urban migrants had the greatest risk for hypertension (adjusted
   relative risk for men 1.18; 95\% confidence interval 1.04-1.34 and women
   1.17: 95\% confidence interval 1.05-1.29) and were the most screened,
   diagnosed and treated for CMD, compared with urban residents. Within
   sibling sets, rural-to-urban migrant siblings had a higher risk for
   overweight and pre-hypertension, with no evidence for differences by
   duration of stay.
   Conclusions: Rural-to-urban migration is associated with increased CMD
   risk in Malawi. In a poor country experiencing rapid urbanization,
   interventions for the prevention and management of CMD, which reach
   migrant populations, are needed.}},

Abstract = {{A band gap region, or simply a band gap, is a range of frequencies where
   vibrations of certain frequency ranges are isolated. In the present
   paper, such ranges are sought through the study of different cases for
   the shape of the unit cells of a lattice, i.e., of an assembly of
   classical structural elements, such as beams and plates. A lattice with
   a specific, special designed microstructure is considered in the present
   investigation. Each particular cell of the examined lattice is studied
   as a classical composite material consisting of a matrix and the
   reinforcing core (e.g., matrix-fiber composite), and it is discretized
   by using two-dimensional plane stress finite elements. The form of the
   core of the unit cells can be of several shapes, e.g., quadratic,
   circular, and star. Some of these shapes provide the whole lattice with
   auxetic behavior, with negative Poisson's ratio at the homogenized
   properties. The shape and the microstructure of the lattice is optimized
   in order to achieve isolation of the desired frequencies. A first
   attempt on the optimization of star-shaped microstructures is also
   presented. The optimization is carried out using powerful global
   optimization methods, such as the genetic algorithms. Results indicate
   that band gaps may appear in both conventional and auxetic
   microstructures. Moreover, the appearance and the size of the band gaps
   depend on the selected microstructure.}},

Abstract = {{This article considers testing for independence in a time series of
   small counts within an Integer Autoregressive (INAR) model, taking a
   semiparametric approach that avoids any distributional assumption on the
   arrivals process of the model. The nature of the testing problem is
   shown to differ depending on whether or not the support of the arrivals
   distribution is the full set of natural numbers (as would be the case
   for Poisson or Negative Binomial distributions for example) or some
   strict subset of the natural numbers (such as for a Binomial or Uniform
   distribution). The theory for these two cases is studied separately.
   For the case where the arrivals have support on the natural numbers, a
   new asymptotically efficient semiparametric test, the effective score
   (Neyman-Rao) test, is derived. The semiparametric Likelihood-Ratio, Wald
   and score tests are shown to be asymptotically equivalent to the
   effective score test, and hence also asymptotically efficient.
   Asymptotic relative efficiency calculations demonstrate that the
   semiparametric effective score test can provide substantial power
   advantages over the first order autocorrelation coefficient, which is
   most commonly applied in practice.
   For the case where the arrivals have support that is a strict subset of
   the natural numbers, the theory is considerably altered because the
   support of the observations becomes different under the null and
   alternative hypotheses. The semiparametric Likelihood-Ratio, Wald and
   score tests become asymptotically degenerate in this case, while the
   effective score test remains valid. Remarkably, in this case the
   effective score test is also found to have power against local
   alternatives that shrink to the null at the rate T-1. In rare cases
   where the arrival support is partly or totally known, additional tests
   exploiting this information are considered.
   Finite sample properties of the tests in these various cases demonstrate
   the semiparametric effective score test can provide substantial power
   advantages over the first order autocorrelation test implied by a
   parametric Poisson specification. The simulations also reveal situations
   in which the first order autocorrelation is preferable in finite
   samples, so a hybrid of the effective score and autocorrelation tests is
   proposed to capture most of the benefits of each test.}},

Abstract = {{Based on the bi-material triangle lattice cell, a new cellular
   structure, bi-material re-entrant triangle (BRT) cellular structure, is
   devised to incorporate tailorable coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE)
   and tunable Poisson's ratio (PR) properties by replacing the straight
   base of a triangle with two hypotenuse members. A general
   thermoelasticity equation to systematically build the relationship among
   the external force, the temperature load, and the deformation for planar
   lattice structures with bounded joints is derived and then embedded into
   a theoretical model for the devised BRT structure. Using assembled
   thermoelasticity equation, effective PR, Young's modulus, as well as CTE
   are computed. In order to guide designers to construct initial concepts,
   the design domain for coupling negative CTE and negative PR properties
   is plotted. The material-property-combination region that can be
   achieved by this cellular structure is determined within an Ashby
   material selection chart of CTE versus PR. Nine available combinations
   of CTE and PR properties are extracted and demonstrated with ABAQUS

Abstract = {{A novel electro-active bushing (EAB) design is proposed based on the
   unique physical properties of dielectric elastomers. A dielectric
   elastomer is applied as the tendon layer to a circular two-dimensional
   double-V auxetic structure. When load and voltage excitation vary,
   mechanical performance and dimensions of dielectric elastomers change,
   which empowers EAB to realize an electrostrictive phenomenon and
   real-time variable stiffness under different voltages. An EAB structure
   can endure mechanical loads along all directions in a cross-sectional
   plane, which is more practical than our previous design which can only
   bear loads along one direction. A theoretical electromechanical model of
   an EAB unit cell was proposed based on the physics theory of dielectric
   elastomers. The influences of unit cell parameters on electromechanical
   responses were researched. Moreover, an EAB prototype was fabricated via
   the 3D printing method. The experiments using EAB prototype applied 3M
   VHB 4910 and 3M VHB 9473 acrylic membranes prestretched by 200\% and
   300\%, respectively, were conducted. The results indicated that the
   electrostrictive displacement increases as the load increases, and the
   stiffness decreases with the rise in voltage. Greater stiffness is
   obtained by higher original thickness and prestretch rates, but the
   electrostrictive displacement and stiffness variation under high
   excitation was dramatically affected.}},

Abstract = {{Mechanical properties of two-dimensional (2D) transition-metal
   dichalcogenides (TMDCs) are of vital importance in any practical
   applications to flexible devices and nano-electromechanical systems.
   Thus, the mechanical properties of monolayer TMDCs, a stoichiometric
   formula MX2 in which M = Mo, W and X = S, Se, Te, are investigated by
   using density functional theory. More importantly, based on the
   different atomic arrangement, all three chemical isomers, such as 1T, 1T
   `, and 1H phases, are compared in detail. We found that their 2D Young's
   moduli and Poisson's ratios display a strong dependence not only on the
   atomic species but also on the atomic arrangements. For the same
   structural phase, monolayer TMDCs with the W (S) atom are found to be
   much stiffer in each chalcogenide (metal) group. Due to the threefold
   rotation symmetry of the hexagonal lattice, 1T- and 1H-TMDC monolayers
   belong to the isotropic structures, while the strong anisotropic Young's
   moduli and Poisson's ratios are observed in the 1T ` phase, i.e., 2D
   Young's moduli along the armchair direction are nearly 50\% larger than
   those along the zigzag direction for tellurides. Interestingly, 1T-TMDC
   monolayers show negative Poisson's ratios. Furthermore, their in-plane
   1H/1T ` heterostructures could be constructed, and the corresponding
   mechanical properties are explored. We found that the influence of the
   1H/1T ` interface on the mechanical behavior is detrimental, which
   reduces the in-plane stiffness normal to the 1H/1T ` interface as
   compared with 1H and 1T ` structures. However, in comparison with the 1T
   ` phase, a remarkable strength of these novel heterostructures is along
   the 1H/1T ` interface direction. In brief, the present first-principles
   results constitute a useful picture for the mechanical properties of 2D
   TMDCs and their in-plane heterostructures.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents a novel armchair graphene nanoribbon (AGNR)
   field-effect transistor with engineered nanopores for resonant
   tunneling. Two rectangular nanopores are punched to create two potential
   barriers and one quantum well. Channel and source and drain contacts are
   AGNR, indicating structure homogeneity. Nonequilibrium Green's function
   and Poisson's equations are used for structural analysis. The input
   variables are well width (WW), drain voltage (VD), and barrier width
   (BW). The effects of repositioning nanopores and AGNR type (i.e.,
   semiconductor and semimetal) are also studied. The impact of the
   parameters on the density of states, transmission probabilities, peak
   current (IP) and its voltage (VP), valley current (IV) and its voltage
   (VV), and peak-tovalley ratio (PVR) are investigated. Simulation results
   show that in both AGNR types, a decrease in WW brings about higher IP,
   VP, and VV. Moreover, in the semimetal AGNR, the narrowest WW leads to
   the highest PVR value. Another key observation is that with a decrease
   in VD, the PVR increases, and negative gate transconductance (NGT)
   characteristics show better performance. In addition, in the semimetal
   AGNR, the highest PVR value and the best NGT characteristics occur at
   the highest BW. Furthermore, repositioning nanopores across the device
   width does not affect the energy of the first resonance level. Finally,
   the structure with the largest unobstructed width (i.e., the one with
   the least backscattering) has the highest PVR.}},

Title = {{Mechanical property of anti-trichiral honeycombs under large deformation
   along the x-direction}},
Journal = {{THIN-WALLED STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{145}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The mechanical property of anti-trichiral honeycombs under large
   deformation along the x-direction are studied by both experiments and
   theoretical analysis. It's shown that the elastic-plasticity bending
   occurs in the ligaments besides the plastic hinges, which is very
   different from the deformation mode under the y-directional compression
   reported previously. Based on the cells' deformation mechanism observed
   in experiments, an analytical model is established to derive the
   Poisson's ratio and the crushing stress of the anti-trichiral honeycomb.
   The theoretical predictions are verified by the experimental results. It
   is shown that the crushing stress increases with the wall thickness t,
   but decreases with the ligament's length L. As for the Poisson's ratio,
   it increases with L, but decreases with the honeycomb's deformation,
   while the ligament's wall thickness t makes no difference to it.
   Moreover, it is revealed that the negative Poisson's ratio effect of the
   anti-trichiral honeycomb under the x-directional compression is stronger
   than that under the y-directional compression, while the superiority of
   the crushing stress along these two directions depends on the cell's
   geometry parameters.}},

   square tubes under axial loading}},
Journal = {{THIN-WALLED STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{145}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper treats energy absorption and crushing characteristics of
   auxetic foam-filled square-section tubes under axial loading condition.
   The influence of auxeticity effect on the structural collapse was
   experimentally investigated to quantify the interaction effect between
   Poisson's ratios of foam (ranging from - 0.31- 0.03) and square tube
   walls under quasi-static and dynamic loadings. The validated computer
   simulation technique was employed to conduct a series of parametric
   study in order to evaluate the influence of tube parameters on the
   energy absorption responses. It is evident that negative Poisson ratio
   effectively influences the crushing response and energy absorption
   capability of auxetic foam-filled square tubes. Moreover, it was found
   that increasing the auxeticity level of foam filler enhances
   crashworthiness performance of foam-filled structures under both
   quasistatic and dynamic loading conditions. The primary outcome of this
   study is a design guideline for the use of auxetic foam in different
   ranges of Poisson's ratio as a core for an energy absorber device where
   impact loading is expected.}},

Title = {{Interlamellar-induced time-dependent response of intervertebral disc
   annulus: A microstructure-based chemo-viscoelastic model}},
Journal = {{ACTA BIOMATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{100}},
Pages = {{75-91}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The annulus fibrosus of the intervertebral disc exhibits an unusual
   transversal behavior for which a constitutive representation that
   considers as well regional effect, chemical sensitivity and
   time-dependency has not yet been developed, and it is hence the aim of
   the present contribution. A physically-based model is proposed by
   introducing a free energy function that takes into account the actual
   disc annulus structure in relation with the surrounding biochemical
   environment. The response is assumed to be dominated by the viscoelastic
   contribution of the extracellular matrix, the elastic contribution of
   the oriented collagen fibers and the osmo-induced volumetric
   contribution of the internal fluid content variation. The regional
   dependence of the disc annulus response due to variation in fibers
   content/orientation allows a micromechanical treatment of the soft
   tissue. A finite element model of the annulus specimen is designed while
   taking into consideration the `interlamellar' ground substance zone
   between lamellae of the layered soft tissue. The kinetics is designed
   using full-field strain measurements performed on specimens extracted
   from two disc annulus regions and tested under different osmotic
   conditions. The time-dependency of the tissue response is reported on
   stress-free volumetric changes, on hysteretic stress and transversal
   strains during quasi-static stretching at different strain-rates and on
   their temporal changes during an interrupted stretching. Considering the
   effective contributions of the internal fluid transfer and the
   extracellular matrix viscosity, the microstructure-based
   chemo-mechanical model is found able to successfully reproduce the
   significant features of the macro-response and the unusual transversal
   behavior including the strong regional dependency from inner to outer
   parts of the disc: Poisson's ratio lesser than 0 (auxetic) in lamellae
   plane, higher than 0.5 in fibers plane, and their temporal changes
   towards usual values (between 0 and 0.5) at chemo-mechanical
   equilibrium. The underlying time-dependent mechanisms occurring in the
   tissue are analyzed via the local numerical fields and important
   insights about the effective role of the interlamellar zone are revealed
   for the different disc localizations.
   Statement of significance
   The structural complexity of the annulus fibrosus has only been
   appreciated through recent experimental contributions and a constitutive
   representation that considers as well regional effect, chemical
   sensitivity and time-dependency of the unusual transversal behavior has
   not yet been developed. Here, a microstructure-based chemo-viscoelastic
   model is developed to highlight the interlamellar-induced time-dependent
   response by means of a two-scale strategy. The model provides important
   insights about the origin of the time-dependent phenomena in disc
   annulus along with regional dependency, essential for understanding disc
   functionality. (C) 2019 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

   306 randomly selected preschool and day care children in the city of
   Diamantina, Brazil. Parents/caregivers answered a questionnaire on
   socio-demographic information, the Brazilian version of the Early
   Childhood Oral Health Impact Scale, their child's general/oral health
   and the Brazilian version of the Dental Discomfort Questionnaire. The
   children underwent an oral examination. Descriptive statistics,
   Spearman's correlations, the Kruskal-Wallis test, Mann-Whitney test and
   Poisson regression were used to determine associations between the
   variables (prevalence ratio {[}PR], alpha = 5\%). Results The prevalence
   of dental caries and dental pain was 43.1\% and 40.2\%, respectively.
   Dental pain (PR: 1.96, 95\% CI 1.52-2.54; p < 0.001), monthly household

Abstract = {{Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar observations often provide maps
   of vertical displacement that can be integrated to estimate an uplift
   volume. Relating this measure to source processes requires a model of
   the deformation. Bignami et al. (2019) argue that the negative uplift
   volume associated with the 2016 Amatrice-Norcia, central Italy,
   earthquake sequence requires a coseismic volume collapse of the hanging
   wall. Using results for dip-slip dislocations in an elastic half-space
   we show that V-uplift = (P/4) (1 - 2 nu) sin(2 delta), in which P is the
   seismic potency, nu is the Poisson's ratio, and delta is the fault dip,
   consistent with an earlier result of Ward (1986). For reasonable
   estimates of net potency for the 2016 Amatrice-Norcia sequence, this
   simple formula yields uplift volume estimates close to that observed. We
   conclude that the data are completely consistent with elastic
   dislocation theory and do not require a volume collapse at depth.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{535}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{In-depth understanding of flow and pumping characteristics of the
   nanofluids in a narrow fluidic channel is required for accurate control
   of micropumps. The present paper studies the nanofluids flow driven by
   the combined effects of peristaltic pumping and external electric field
   through microchannel. Double diffusive convection in nanofluids is
   examined. Buoyancy effects due to change in temperature, solute
   concentration and nanoparticle volume fraction are also taken into
   account. Poisson-Boltzmann, momentum, energy, solute concentration, and
   nanoparticle volume fraction equations are considered to govern the
   nanofluids flow. Governing equations are simplified under the
   lubrication theory and Debye-Huckel linearization. Influences of Joule
   heating, electric double layer thickness, electroosmostic velocity,
   Grashof numbers, thermophoresis and Brownian motion on flow
   characteristics, pumping characteristics, and skin friction coefficient
   are computed using Mathematica software. Trapping phenomenon is also
   examined under the effects of pertinent parameters. Present analysis
   reveals that flow characteristics and pumping characteristics improve
   with negative Joule heating effects. The findings of present analysis
   can be utilized in clinical implications like drug delivery systems,
   cell therapeutics, and particles filtrations etc. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {{Topology optimization of 2-D mechanical metamaterials using a parametric
   level set method combined with a meshfree algorithm}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{229}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Two-dimensional (2-D) micro-architectured mechanical metamaterials are
   designed using a topology optimization approach that integrates a
   parametric level set method (PLSM) with a meshfree method based on
   compactly supported radial basis functions (CS-RBF). The PLSM is
   employed as the optimization algorithm to achieve desired
   microstructures with targeted material properties. The effective elastic
   properties, including the bulk modulus, shear modulus and Poisson's
   ratio, are predicted using a strain energy-based homogenization method
   and the CS-RBF meshfree algorithm. Two sets of optimizations are
   implemented: one is for the case of a single solid material, and the
   other is for the case of two solid materials, each involving an
   additional void phase. Three numerical examples are provided for each
   case with the same optimization objectives: maximizing the effective
   bulk modulus, maximizing the effective shear modulus, and minimizing the
   effective Poisson's ratio under given volume fraction constraints. The
   numerical results reveal that the newly proposed approach can generate
   smooth topological boundaries and optimal microstructures. In
   particular, the current method can topologically optimize auxetic
   metamaterials with a negative Poisson's ratio. It can also be extended
   to design other periodic metamaterials, including those with a negative
   coefficient of thermal expansion or frequency bandgaps.}},

Title = {{In-plane crashworthiness of re-entrant hierarchical honeycombs with
   negative Poisson's ratio}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{229}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Both auxetic structures and hierarchical honeycombs are marked with
   lightweight and excellent mechanical properties. Here, we combine the
   characteristics of auxetic structures and hierarchical honeycombs, and
   propose two re-entrant hierarchical honeycombs constructed by replacing
   the cell walls of re-entrant honeycombs with regular hexagon
   substructure (RHH) and equilateral triangle substructure (RHT). The
   honeycombs are subjected to in-plane impact in order to investigate the
   crashworthiness by using the commercial software LS-DYNA. The plateau
   stress of RHH and RHT in x and y directions are derived by a two-scale
   method. The results from numerical simulation indicate that the specific
   energy absorption of RHT and RHH is improved by up to 292\% and 105\%.
   RHT and RHH improve the mean crushing force value by 298\%, 108\%
   respectively compared with the classic re-entrant honeycomb (RH) under
   quasi-static loading at stress plateau region. The RHT and RHH still
   have the characteristic of negative Poisson's ratio. Additionally, the
   parametric studies are further carried out to investigate the effects of
   impact velocities and relative densities on crashworthiness. All the
   findings of this study indicate that the proposed two hierarchical
   honeycombs exhibit an improved crushing performance, and RHT provides
   the highest energy absorption capacity among all specimens.}},

Title = {{Relation between tobacco control policies and population at high risk of

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{179}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Introduction Lung cancer accounts for nearly 2 million deaths per year
   worldwide, the majority of cases due to smoking as the main risk factor
   associated. The aim of this study was to assess the relation between the
   level of implementation of tobacco control policies and the population
   at high risk of lung cancer in the European Union (EU).
   Methods: The Special Eurobarometer 458 ``Attitudes of Europeans towards
   tobacco and electronic cigarettes{''}, conducted in 2017, and the
   Tobacco Control Scale (TCS) 2010, 2013, and 2016 were the sources of our
   data. High risk of lung cancer was defined by the inclusion criteria in
   the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) and the Dutch-Belgian Lung
   Cancer Screening Trial (NELSON), the largest lung cancer screening
   trials carried out in the US and the EU. We calculated Spearman's rank
   correlation coefficients (r(sp)) and fitted multilevel generalized
   linear mixed models using the quasi-Poisson family to assess the
   correlation at the national level and analyze the association at the
   individual level, respectively, between the scores in the TCS (higher
   scores means better implementation of tobacco control policies) and the
   proportion of individuals at high risk of lung cancer in member states
   of the EU.
   Results: The scores in the TCS 2010 were statistically negatively
   correlated with the current proportion of ever and former smokers at
   high risk according to NELSON criteria ( - 0.41; 95\%CI -0.68, -0.04 and
   - 0.49; 95\%CI -0.73, -0.13, respectively). We observed statistically
   significant inverse associations between the scores in the TCS 2010 for
   the highest quartiles and the proportion of individuals at high risk of
   lung cancer according to both criteria. Non-statistically significant
   negative correlations and inverse associations were observed with other
   TCS.
   Conclusion: There is a lag between the implementation of tobacco control
   policies and the reduction of the rates of high risk of lung cancer.
   Member states should reinforce comprehensive tobacco control policies to
   reduce the population at high risk of lung cancer in the EU.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the nonlinear transient responses of an auxetic
   (negative Poisson's ratio) honeycomb sandwich plate under impact dynamic
   loads. The partial differential equations of the honeycomb sandwich
   plate based on Reddy's higher shear deformation theory and Hamilton's
   principle are obtained. The nonlinear ordinary differential equations
   are then derived by Galerkin truncation method. The dynamic responses of
   the honeycomb sandwich plate subjected to different loads, such as step
   loading, air-blast loading, sinusoidal loading, triangular loading and
   incremental loading, respectively, have been investigated. The
   contributions of total thickness, core thickness ratio, Poisson's ratio,
   cell inclination angle and blast types to transient responses of the
   plate are discussed in detail by numerical simulations. The effect of
   geometrical parameters on the dynamics of the plate and the effect of
   different blast loads on the plate are obtained. It is found that the
   honeycomb sandwich plate with negative Poisson's ratio would be a better
   choice compared with the positive one for some structures under dynamic

Abstract = {{This study presents the finite element-based micromechanical modeling
   approach to obtain the electromechanical properties of the piezoelectric
   metamaterial based on honeycomb (HC) cellular networks. The symmetry of
   the periodic structure was employed to derive mixed boundary conditions
   (MBCs) analogous to periodic boundary conditions (PBCs). Three classes
   of hexagonal HC cellular networks, namely, a conventional HC (CHC), a
   re-entrant HC (RE), and a semi-re-entrant HC (SRE) were considered. The
   representative volume elements (RVEs) of these three classes of cellular
   materials were created, and finite element analyses were carried out to
   analyze the effect of orientation of the ligament on their effective
   electromechanical properties and their suitability in specific
   engineering applications. The longitudinally poled piezoelectric HC
   cellular networks showed an enhanced behavior as compared to the
   monolithic piezoelectric materials. Moreover, longitudinally poled HC
   cellular networks demonstrated that, as compared to the bulk
   constituent, their hydrostatic figure of merit increased and their
   acoustic impedance decreased by one order of magnitude, respectively,
   indicating their applicability for the design on hydrophones. Moreover,
   results showed that cellular metamaterial with tunable electromechanical
   characteristics and a variety of auxetic behaviors such as negative,
   positive, or zero Poisson's ratios could be developed. Such novel HC
   network-based functional cellular materials are likely to facilitate the
   design of light-weight devices for various next-generation sensors and
   actuators. (C) 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Title = {{Negative impact of spinal epidural lipomatosis on the surgical outcome

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Spinal epidural lipomatosis (SEL) results from
   excess lumbar epidural fat (EF) accumulation that compresses the cauda
   equina or nerve roots. Guidelines for the therapeutic management of SEL
   are not currently available.
   PURPOSE: To elucidate the efficacy of lumbar decompression surgery in
   SEL.
   STUDY DESIGN: Multicenter retrospective study.
   PATIENT SAMPLE: A total of 288 consecutive patients who underwent
   posterior lumbar spinous-splitting decompression surgery for lumbar
   spinal canal stenosis and followed up greater than 2 years at
   participating institutions were retrospectively reviewed.
   OUTCOME MEASURES: Japanese Orthopedic Association Back Pain Evaluation
   Questionnaire (JOABPEQ) and Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire
   (RDQ).
   METHODS: Participants were divided into two groups according to the
   ratio of EF to anteroposterior diameter of the spinal canal (EF/SC-L) at
   the spinal level with maximum dural tube compression. Patients with
   EF/SC-L of >= 0.6 and <0.6 were defined as those with SEL and non-SEL,
   respectively. We assessed whether surgical treatment was ``effective{''}
   or ``not effective{''} using the JOABPEQ based on the following: an
   increase of >= 20 points in the postoperative score compared with the
   preoperative score, or a preoperative score <90 with a postoperative
   score >= 90 points. We constructed a multiple Poisson regression model
   by adjusting for confounding factors, and determined estimated relative
   risk (RR) for ``not effective{''} with surgical treatment using the
   JOABPEQ. Additionally, we selected age-, sex-, BMI-, and decompression
   levels-matched patients with non-SEL and compared the frequency of ``not
   effective{''} between SEL patients (n=60) and non-SEL patients (n=60).
   RESULTS: Analysis using the RDQ and JOABPEQ showed that the 1- and
   2-year postoperative scores were significantly better than the
   preoperative scores in the both groups. Multivariable Poisson regression
   analysis demonstrated that SEL was significantly associated with ``not
   effective{''} for decompression surgery in the 1-year postoperative
   outcomes of walking ability ({[}RR] 1.5, 95\% confidence interval {[}CI]
   1.0-2.2) and social life (RR 1.3, 95\% CI 1.0-1.8) and the 2-year
   postoperative outcomes of walking ability (RR 1.6, 95\% CI 1.2-2.3).
   Matching analysis showed that SEL was significantly associated with
   ``not effective{''} with lumbar decompression surgery in the 2-year
   postoperative outcomes of walking ability (p=.02).
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients with SEL exhibited significant improvements in
   surgical outcomes at 1 and 2 years postoperatively. However, compared
   with the non-SEL group, the efficacy of posterior lumbar
   spinous-splitting decompression surgery was worse in the SEL group,
   especially for walking ability. These results indicate that EF
   accumulation should be considered when planning treatment for patients
   with lumbar spinal canal stenosis and estimating the efficacy of lumbar
   decompression surgery. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In chiral metamaterials, the twist per axial strain (TPAS) is an
   important index to evaluate the tension-torsion coupling effect. Most
   chiral structures reported in current literatures have the appearance of
   lattice architectures, which possess limited TPAS. Inspired by DNA and
   origami structures, the proposed DNA-like chiral structure can generate
   a twist with the folding behavior of each unit. Theoretically, the value
   of TPAS of the proposed structure can achieve +co, which provides a good
   basis to design metamaterials for target tensiontorsion coupling
   properties. Also, we can design lattice structures based on the proposed
   DNA-origami concept. With the advanced additive manufacturing
   techniques, the proposed DNA-like structures can be used to fabricate
   shape memory morphing structures, smart propellers, artificial muscles,

Title = {{Wave propagation in microtubule-based bio-nano-architected networks: A
   lesson from nature}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{164}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Microtubules, bio-polymeric hollow tubes forming entangled radial
   networks from the nucleus to the cell membrane, are considered the main
   part of the cytoskeleton providing mechanical stiffness, organization
   and shape for the cytoplasm of the eukaryotic cells and playing
   substantial roles in some cellular processes such as
   mechanotransduction, cell division, intercellular transports, internal
   organization of the cell components, etc. In all of the mentioned
   functions, the network structure of the microtubules has the main
   responsibility proving the importance of more in-depth studies of their
   mechanical properties. This paper addresses the elastic wave propagation
   in various two-dimensional microtubule-based bio-nano-architected
   periodic networks to analyze their dynamic characteristics for possible
   further utilizations. The study starts with selecting a proper beam
   model for a single microtubule, as proved by previous experiments, and
   continues with creating ten widely used periodic structures, namely
   square, triangle, triangle-square, triangle-diamond, negative Poisson's
   ratio, semi-honeycomb, star-honeycomb, zig-zag, hexagram, and Sierpinski
   triangle, thereof. To obtain the dispersion curves, finite element
   models are developed for both individual and networked microtubules, and
   the phononic band structures are calculated based on Bloch's theorem.
   The results reveal the possibility of designing bandgaps in specific
   ranges for the low- and high-frequency bio-filter applications depending
   on the topologies of the selected unit cells as well as the considered
   periodicities. This application helps researchers control the ways to
   absorb some unwanted or hazardous vibrations using architected periodic
   structures and, thanks to the higher biocompatibility resulted from
   their biomaterial origin, the networks can be applied in next-generation
   nano-biomechanical instruments such as implantable biosensors.}},

Abstract = {{Standard Poisson and negative binomial truncated regression models for
   count data include the regressors in the mean of the non-truncated
   distribution. In this paper, a new approach is proposed so that the
   explanatory variables determine directly the truncated mean. The main
   advantage is that the regression coefficients in the new models have a
   straightforward interpretation as the effect of a change in a covariate
   on the mean of the response variable. A simulation study has been
   carried out in order to analyze the performance of the proposed
   truncated regression models versus the standard ones showing that
   coefficient estimates are now more accurate in the sense that the
   standard errors are always lower. Also, the simulation study indicates
   that the estimates obtained with the standard models are biased. An
   application to real data illustrates the utility of the introduced
   truncated models in a hurdle model. Although in the example there are
   slight differences in the results between the two approaches, the
   proposed one provides a clear interpretation of the coefficient
   estimates.}},

Abstract = {{The peridynamic theory has been used to model and simulate numerically
   various kinds of mechanical behavior of solids. This work is devoted to
   analytical solutions of the elastodynamic behavior of linearized
   isotropic state-based peridynamic materials. First, we present the
   solutions of the dispersion relations, group velocities, and phase
   velocities of longitudinal and transverse waves, and examine in detail
   the effects of the Poisson's ratio on these properties. It is shown that
   the elastodynamic behavior of the state-based peridynamic material with
   a negative Poisson's ratio is remarkably different from that of the
   material with a positive Poisson's ratio. We then derive the general
   solutions of initial-value problems, and obtain the Green's function in
   a closed form. Finally, we study the evolution of a displacement
   discontinuity in the state-based peridynamic medium, and find that each
   component of the discontinuity in the three-dimensional theory varies
   independently according to the same vibrational mode. The results may
   have implications in investigations of wave propagations, including
   discontinuities such as phase transitions and kink propagations.}},

Abstract = {{The annulus fibrosus exhibits complex osmotic and inelastic effects
   responsible for unusual transversal behavior with a Poisson's ratio
   higher than 0.5 in fibers plane and negative (i.e., auxetic) in lamellae
   plane. In this paper, we present a new chemo-mechanical approach for the
   intrinsic osmo-inelastic response of the annulus fibrosus in relation to
   the microstructure of the layered reinforced soft tissue, the
   biochemical environment and the mechanical loading conditions. The
   constitutive model introduces the coupling between the
   deformation-induced inelastic stress in the tangled extracellular matrix
   and the stress-free swelling due to internal fluid content variation by
   osmosis. The proposed formulation is implemented into a finite element
   code, and numerical simulations on annulus specimens, including
   explicitly lamellae and interlamellar zones, are presented. To
   illustrate the capability of the approach to capture experimental
   observations quantitatively, the simulated results are compared to
   experimental results obtained by monitoring the full-field strain in
   annulus specimens using digital image correlation method. Some material
   constants are found by matching the free swelling in a water bath with
   different salt concentrations, and others are found by matching tensile
   results in terms of loading-unloading stress-stretch curve and
   transversal behavior. The constitutive model is found to successfully
   capture the variations in osmolarity and strain-rate conditions (both
   statistically significant, p < 0.05) on the intrinsic response and the
   auxeticity. The stress/strain patterns in the model simulation provide
   valuable insights into the role of the interlamellar zone in the
   osmo-inelastic mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials are characterized with counter intuitive mechanical
   behavior, that is, a negative Poisson's ratio, in which the material
   expands in the direction perpendicular to the elongation direction. This
   intriguing property can be used to engineer structures with various
   porosity for `smart filters' where the permeability changes in response
   to exterior force. In this research, the mechanical behavior of braided
   tubular structures that comprise helical auxetic yarns (HAYs) has been
   investigated. The permeability of the structure can be altered with the
   application of different levels of tensile force. Both HAYs and biaxial
   structures are fabricated on a Maypole braiding machine. The novelty of
   this braided tubular structure is that its open area decreases when
   stretched due to the local auxetic effect. A multi-scale finite element
   model is established to analyze the auxetic effect and the relationship
   between tensile force and the open area. The open area of the biaxial
   structure is measured by a camera system that is installed next to an
   Instron machine while the sample is subjected to tension. The
   experimental results show that the open area in the biaxial structure is
   reduced due to the auxetic effect of each HAY. The model gives a
   reasonable prediction compared to the experimental data, even though
   deviation exists, which is probably due to the nonlinear behavior from
   contact and large deformation.}},

Abstract = {{We present a new type of a truly three-dimensional cubic negative
   stiffness lattice structure that can achieve energy absorption and
   recover its original configuration under cyclic loading in excess of a
   strain of approximately 20\%. This structure was composed of multiple
   unit cells exploiting negative stiffness from controlled elastic
   buckling. Structural properties were designed to be tuned by adjusting
   geometry. The effective Poisson's ratio was equal to zero regardless of
   the constituent material. Geometric parameters that can lead to the
   desired energy absorption without yielding the structure were determined
   by finite element analysis. We then fabricated samples representing the
   lattice structure with different sizes through additive manufacturing
   and performed cyclic loading experiments to capture stress-strain
   hysteresis loops. Results clearly showed that the designed structure was
   capable of absorbing mechanical energy effectively with a full recovery
   of geometry in three principal directions and that the amount of energy
   absorbed during cyclic loading increases with its size. (C) 2019

Abstract = {{Background/Aim Enamel fractures are the most common type of traumatic
   dental injury (TDI) in children and adolescents. Recognizing the impact
   of these fractures on oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) could
   contribute to the establishment of treatment protocols. The aim of this
   study was to assess and quantify the impact of enamel fractures on
   overall OHRQoL and domain scores in adolescents. Materials and Methods A
   cross-sectional study was conducted with 775 adolescents aged 11 to 14
   years in the city of Santo angelo in southern Brazil. Sociodemographic
   variables were collected from parents/caregivers using a structured
   questionnaire. The adolescents answered the Child Perceptions
   Questionnaire (CPQ(11-14)). Physical examinations were performed by an
   examiner who had undergone training and calibration exercises for the
   investigation of TDI (Andreasen criteria), dental caries (WHO criteria),
   and malocclusion (Dental Aesthetic Index). Data analysis involved
   Poisson regression with robust variance. Results The prevalence of TDI
   was 11.9\% and enamel fractures accounted for 79.3\% of all injuries. In
   the multivariate analysis, adolescents with enamel fractures had 29\%
   higher CPQ(11-14) scores (worse OHRQoL) than those without TDI, even
   after adjustment for sociodemographic and clinical variables (mean ratio
   = 1.29; 95\% CI: 1.09-1.53; P = .003). Enamel fractures exerted a
   negative impact on the functional limitation, emotional well-being, and
   social well-being domains. Conclusions Enamel fractures exert a negative
   impact on the OHRQoL of adolescents, suggesting that subjective measures
   should be incorporated in the evaluation of patients with this traumatic
   injury.}},

Abstract = {{The crystal structure, elastic properties and the Raman spectrum of the
   layered calcium uranyl silicate pentahydrate mineral uranophane-beta,
   Ca(UO2)(2)Si2O6(OH)(2)center dot 5H(2)O, are studied by means of
   first-principles solid-state methods and compared with the corresponding
   information for the alpha polymorph. The availability of the energy
   optimized full crystal structure of uranophane-beta, including the
   positions of the hydrogen atoms, made possible the computation of its
   elastic properties and the Raman spectrum by using the theoretical
   methodology. An extended set of relevant mechanical data is reported.
   Uranophane-beta is shown to be a weak and ductile mineral and,
   consequenty, is mechanically very different from the alpha polymorph
   which is a hard and brittle material. Uranophane-beta exhibits the
   important negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) and negative linear
   compressibility (NLC) phenomena. The experimental Raman spectrum of
   uranophane-beta obtained from a natural mineral sample from pegmatite
   Perus, Sao Paulo, Brazil, is compared with the spectrum determined
   theoretically. Since both spectra are in very good agreement, the
   theoretical methods are employed to assign the Raman spectrum. Three
   weak bands of the experimental spectrum of this mineral, located at the
   wavenumbers 2302, 2128 and 2042 cm(-1), are identified as combination
   bands. The Raman spectrum of uranophane-beta is also compared with that
   of the alpha polymorph. While they are rather similar, a detailed
   analysis reveals a significant number of differences. Finally, the
   relative thermodynamic stability of the alpha and beta polymorphs is
   evaluated. The alpha polymorph is more stable than the beta polymorph at
   zero pressure and temperature by -12.0 kJ mol(-1).}},

Abstract = {{Structures with negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) have been widely used in
   engineering application due to its unusual properties. In this paper,
   crashworthiness of a novel cylindrical auxetic structure under axial
   impact loading is investigated by the numerical methods. The software
   LS-DYNA is adopted to analyze the effects of the geometry parameters on
   the force, energy absorption (EA) and specific energy absorption (SEA).
   It is found that an overlarge number of layers and cells will make NPR
   structure extend outward from the mid; NPR structures with small number
   of layers and cells will make some layers of structures rotate in final
   crushing state. If the thickness of the long-inclined bean (L-beam) is
   larger than that of short-inclined beam (S-beam), there will be a
   smoother transition from the lower to a higher value in crushing force.
   Conversely, the force will maintain a relatively steady value, which
   determined by the sum of the thickness of L- and S-beams. In addition,
   there is also a critical inner circle radius which distinguishes
   different deformation modes. Once the critical inner circle radius is
   smaller than the critical value, NPR structures tend to deform
   unsteadily.}},

Title = {{Sensitivity Improvement of Highly Stretchable Capacitive Strain Sensors
   by Hierarchical Auxetic Structures}},

Abstract = {{Highly stretchable sensors that can detect large strains are useful in
   deformable systems, such as soft robots and wearable devices. For
   stretchable strain sensors, two types of sensing methods exist, namely,
   resistive and capacitive. Capacitive sensing has several advantages over
   the resistive type, such as high linearity, repeatability, and low
   hysteresis. However, the sensitivity (gauge factor) of capacitive strain
   sensors is theoretically limited to 1, which is much lower than that of
   the resistive-type sensors. The objective of this study is to improve
   the sensitivity of highly stretchable capacitive strain sensors by
   integrating hierarchical auxetic structures into them. Auxetic
   structures have a negative Poisson's ratio that causes increase in
   change in capacitance with applied strains, and thereby improving
   sensitivity. In order to prove this concept, we fabricate and
   characterize two sensor samples with planar dimensions 60 mm x 16 mm.
   The samples have an acrylic elastomer (3M, VHB 4905) as the dielectric
   layer and a liquid metal (eutectic gallium-indium) for electrodes. On
   both sides of the sensor samples, hierarchical auxetic structures made
   of a silicone elastomer (Dow Corning, Sylgard 184) are attached. The
   samples are tested under strains up to 50\% and the experimental results
   show that the sensitivity of the sensor with the auxetic structure
   exceeds the theoretical limit. In addition, it is observed that the
   sensitivity of this sensor is roughly two times higher than that of a
   sensor without the auxetic structure, while maintaining high linearity
   (R-2 = 0.995), repeatability (>= 10(4) cycles), and low hysteresis.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we perform first-principle studies on the mechanical,

   chalcogenides MX2 and M2X3 where M = Ni or Pd and X = S, Se or Te. For
   MX2, besides the common hexagonal forms, it presents a stable
   orthorhombic structure with highly in-plane anisotropic properties and
   giant negative Poisson's ratios. For M2X3, on the other hand, it
   presents no hexagonal but another orthorhombic structure with highly
   anisotropic mechanical and electronic features. These orthorhombic MX2
   and M2X3 are semiconducting with band gaps ranging from 1.05 to 2.40 eV,
   and they are hyperbolic materials operating in a broad range of the
   electromagnetic spectrum from infrared to ultraviolet. Moreover, by
   joint analysis of band gaps, band edges and optical absorption, Ni2Se3,
   Pd2S3 and orthorhombic MX2 are found to be highly efficient for

Abstract = {{Flexible ultrasensitive strain sensors are highly desirable in view of
   their widespread applications in wearable electronics, health monitoring
   systems, and smart robots, where subtle strain detection is required.
   However, traditional fabrication of such sensors was done to prepare
   sensitive layers on bare or single-sided structural substrates, leading
   to limited sensitivity. Herein, a stretchable resistive-type strain
   sensor was demonstrated by self-assembling conductive networks onto a
   monolithic polydimethylsiloxane substrate with a two-sided topological
   design, for example, a sinusoid/auxetic binary architecture. The
   sensitivity of the obtained sensor was greatly improved by 22-fold as
   compared to the traditional counterpart with a bare substrate. The
   remarkably good agreement between the experimental results and finite
   element analysis predictions confirmed that the superior sensitivity is
   a synergistic effect of local strain enhancement derived from the
   topological structure on the foreside and an additional strain
   concentration and a reduced Poisson's ratio from the auxetic arrays on
   the backside. Furthermore, this sensor can withstand an extreme
   mechanical force (>750 N) because of the shear stiffening characteristic
   of the auxetic structure. Benefiting from the characteristics of
   ultrahigh sensitivity (gauge factor similar to 1744 at 5\%), low
   detection limit (<0.05\%), and long-term durability (>500 loading
   cycles), this as-prepared sensor shows promise in practical applications
   of high-performance wearable electronics.}},

Abstract = {{Background-Dosing of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors
   (RAASi) may be modified to manage associated hyperkalemia risk; however,
   this approach could adversely affect cardiorenal outcomes. This study
   investigated real-world associations of RAASi dose, hyperkalemia, and
   adverse clinical outcomes in a large cohort of UK cardiorenal patients.
   Methods and Results-This observational study included RAASi-prescribed
   patients with new-onset chronic kidney disease (n=100 572) or heart
   failure (n=13 113) first recorded between January 2006 and December 2015
   in Clinical Practice Research Datalink and linked Hospital Episode
   Statistics databases. Odds ratios associating hyperkalemia and RAASi
   dose modification were estimated using logistic generalized estimating
   equations with normal (<5.0 mmol/L) serum potassium level as the
   reference category. Patients with serum potassium >= 5.0 mmol/L had
   higher risk of RAASi down-titration (adjusted odds ratios, chronic
   kidney disease: 1.79 {[}95\% CI, 1.64-1.96]; heart failure: 1.33 {[}95\%
   CI, 1.08-1.62]). Poisson models were used to estimate adjusted incident
   rate ratios of adverse outcomes based on total RAASi exposure (<50\% and
   >= 50\% of the guideline-recommended RAASi dose). Incidence of major
   adverse cardiac events and mortality was consistently higher in the
   lower dose group (adjusted incident rate ratios: chronic kidney disease:
   5.60 {[}95\% CI, 5.29-5.93] for mortality and 1.60 {[}95\% CI,
   1.55-1.66] for nonfatal major adverse cardiac events; heart failure:
   7.34 {[}95\% CI, 6.35-8.48] for mortality and 1.85 {[}95\% CI,
   1.71-1.99] for major adverse cardiac events).
   Conclusions-The results of this real-world analysis highlight the
   potential negative impact of suboptimal RAASi dosing and the need for
   strategies that allow patients to be maintained on appropriate therapy,
   avoiding RAASi dose modification or discontinuation.}},

Abstract = {{The cellular structure can exhibit many special mechanical behaviors due
   to its variable cell shape. A three-dimensional compression-twist cell
   structure based on the rotation mechanism of two-dimensional chiral cell
   structure is developed, which has twist deformation under axial
   compression. The shape of three-dimensional compression-twist cell
   structure is determined through cell angle, cell length, and thickness
   ratio. Analytical expressions of effective Young's modulus, Poisson's
   ratio, and twist angle are derived by using beam theory, which have a
   good agreement with the finite element calculations and the deformation
   process of the cell is discussed. To work on the effect of geometric
   parameters of cell on the mechanical properties, a finite element
   analysis model of compression-twist cell structure is carried out, which
   shows the process of elastic and plastic deformation under compression.
   Effects of cell angle, cell length, and thickness ratio are fully
   discussed, which indicate that cell angle has obvious nonlinear effect
   on relative twist angle and could stiffen it. Finally, a
   compression-twist cell structure sample is made through
   three-dimensional printing, and an in-plane compressive experiment is
   carried out to prove analytical and finite element analysis results.}},

Abstract = {{In the present study, NaXH3 (X = Mn, Fe, Co) perovskite type hydrides
   have been investigated by performing first-principles calculation. The
   results of the structural optimizations show that all these compounds
   have negative formation energy implying the thermodynamic stability and
   synthesisability. The mechanical stability of these compounds has been
   studied with the elastic constants. Moreover, the polycrystalline
   properties like bulk modulus, Poisson's ratio, etc. have been obtained
   using calculated elastic constants of interest compounds. The electronic
   properties have been studied and band structures have been drawn with
   the corresponding partial density of states. These plots indicated that
   NaXH3 hydrides show metallic characteristics. The charge transfer
   characteristics in these compounds have been studied with the Bader
   partial charge analysis. The phonon dispersion curves and corresponding
   density of states indicated that NaXH3 compounds are dynamically stable
   compounds. The investigation on hydrogen storage characteristics of
   NaXH3 compounds resulted in hydrogen storage capacities of 3.74, 3.70
   and 3.57 wt\% for X = Mn, Fe and Co, respectively. The present study is
   the first investigation of NaXH3 perovskite type hydrides as known up to

Title = {{Experimental and numerical studies on the compressive mechanical
   properties of the metallic auxetic reentrant honeycomb}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{182}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, not only the effect of cell-wall thickness on the
   deformation mode of metallic auxetic reentrant honeycomb was firstly
   studied, but also the negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) effect on the
   crushing stress was also clarified by the quasi-static compressive
   experiments. Firstly, two types of typical reentrant hexagonal
   honeycombs with thin-walled and thick-walled cells were manufactured and
   compressive tests were carried out to characterize the deformation
   modes, negative Poisson's ratio distribution and crushing stress.
   Experiment results showed that the deformation mode of thin-walled
   honeycomb was quite different from that of thick-walled honeycomb, which
   has not been found in the existing reported papers. Secondly, a finite
   element (FE) model of the reentrant honeycomb was established and the FE
   results were systematically compared with the experimental results. The
   effects of honeycomb cell's number on the compressive deformation and
   the crushing stress of the honeycomb were studied. The results showed
   that once the honeycomb contained more than four cells in both
   transverse and horizontal directions, both the compressive deformation
   and the crushing stress were close to the experimental results. Finally,
   the energy absorption characteristics of reentrant honeycomb during
   compression were discussed. (C) 2019 The Author(s). Published by

Journal = {{PHYSICA STATUS SOLIDI B-BASIC SOLID STATE PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{257}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The folded geometry has successfully been transformed into auxetic woven
   fabric in the literature. However, the influences of the microgeometric
   parameters on the macroscopic behavior have not been addressed yet.
   Herein, several key microgeometric parameters for the folded geometry
   are identified and the mechanical behaviors of the folded structure are
   preliminarily studied using the finite element method. The results show
   that the folded structure can be unfolded in both longitudinal and
   transverse directions when stretched and thus achieve a negative
   Poisson's ratio. More interestingly, another fantastic property of
   tension-bending coupling effect is found in the folded structure and a
   competition exists between the auxeticity and the tension-bending
   coupling effect. This is the first time to report a structure that can
   stimulatingly have the auxeticity and the tension-bending coupling
   effect. Due to the unique properties, the folded geometry is very
   promising in some important fields; for example, the textiles, civil
   engineering, and auto industry. The present work may provide a good
   guide for the design and application of the folded structure.}},

Abstract = {{An experimental investigation on the flexural response of polymer cement
   mortar matrix overlayed or inserted with carbon fibre or auxetic fabric
   layers subject to four levels of rates of loading (1-150 mm/min) is
   reported. Seventy-two specimens made from plain polymer cement mortar,
   composites with auxetic and carbon fibre fabric layers overlayed at the
   bottom and inserted at the mid-depth of the specimens were prepared and
   tested under four point bending. The failure mode including debonding,
   peak load, load-deflection behaviour, longitudinal strain at peak load,
   ultimate stage and energy dissipation are reported. All composite
   specimens exhibited higher peak load, longitudinal strain and energy
   dissipation in comparison to the plain polymer mortar specimens. Auxetic
   fabric composites exhibited increased energy dissipation and
   longitudinal strain at peak load without any sign of debonding. Carbon
   fibre composites, on the other hand, failed due to debonding at a lower
   longitudinal strain. A finite element model is presented to demonstrate
   the debonding tendencies observed in the experiments. Increase in rate
   of loading improved the performance of the auxetic fabric composites but
   reduced the energy dissipation of carbon fibre composites. (C) 2019

Abstract = {{Mass-spring networks (MSNs) have long been used as approximate
   descriptions of biological and engineered systems, from actomyosin
   networks to mechanical trusses. In the last decade, MSNs have
   re-attracted theoretical interest as models for phononic metamaterials
   with exotic properties such as negative Poisson's ratio, negative
   effective mass, or gapped vibrational spectra. A numerical advantage of
   MSNs is their tuneability, which allows the inverse design of materials
   with pre-specified bandgaps. Building on this fact, we demonstrate here
   that designed MSNs, when subjected to Coriolis forces, can host
   topologically protected chiral edge modes at predetermined frequencies,
   thus enabling robust unidirectional transmission of mechanical waves.
   Similar to other recently discovered topological materials, the
   topological phases of MSNs can be classified by a Chern invariant
   related to time-reversal symmetry breaking.}},

Abstract = {{Background: High-sensitivity troponin assays promise earlier
   discrimination of myocardial infarction. Yet, the benefits and harms of
   this improved discriminatory performance when incorporated within rapid
   testing protocols, with respect to subsequent testing and clinical
   events, has not been evaluated in an in-practice patient-level
   randomized study. This multicenter study evaluated the noninferiority of
   a 0/1-hour high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) protocol in
   comparison with a 0/3-hour masked hs-cTnT protocol in patients with
   suspected acute coronary syndrome presenting to the emergency department
   (ED). Methods: Patients were randomly assigned to either a 0/1-hour
   hs-cTnT protocol (reported to the limit of detection {[}<5 ng/L]) or
   masked hs-cTnT reported to <= 29 ng/L evaluated at 0/3-hours (standard
   arm). The 30-day primary end point was all-cause death and myocardial
   infarction. Noninferiority was defined as an absolute margin of 0.5\%
   determined by Poisson regression. Results: In total, 3378 participants
   with an emergency presentation were randomly assigned between August
   2015 and April 2019. Ninety participants were deemed ineligible or
   withdrew consent. The remaining participants received care guided either
   by the 0/1-hour hs-cTnT protocol (n=1646) or the 0/3-hour standard
   masked hs-cTnT protocol (n=1642) and were followed for 30 days. Median
   age was 59 (49-70) years, and 47\% were female. Participants in the
   0/1-hour arm were more likely to be discharged from the ED (0/1-hour
   arm: 45.1\% versus standard arm: 32.3\%, P<0.001) and median ED length
   of stay was shorter (0/1-hour arm: 4.6 {[}interquartile range, 3.4-6.4]
   hours versus standard arm: 5.6 (interquartile range, 4.0-7.1) hours,
   P<0.001). Those randomly assigned to the 0/1-hour protocol were less
   likely to undergo functional cardiac testing (0/1-hour arm: 7.5\% versus
   standard arm: 11.0\%, P<0.001). The 0/1-hour hs-cTnT protocol was not
   inferior to standard care (0/1-hour arm: 17/1646 {[}1.0\%] versus
   16/1642 {[}1.0\%]; incidence rate ratio, 1.06 {[} 0.53-2.11],
   noninferiority P value=0.006, superiority P value=0.867), although an
   increase in myocardial injury was observed. Among patients discharged
   from ED, the 0/1-hour protocol had a negative predictive value of 99.6\%
   (95\% CI, 99.0-99.9\%) for 30-day death or myocardial infarction.
   Conclusions: This in-practice evaluation of a 0/1-hour hs-cTnT protocol
   embedded in ED care enabled more rapid discharge of patients with
   suspected acute coronary syndrome. Improving short-term outcomes among
   patients with newly recognized troponin T elevation will require an
   evolution in management strategies for these patients.}},

   birthweight for gestational age z-scores. Modified Poisson regression
   and linear models were used to evaluate associations of prenatal NLE
   scores with birth outcomes. Sex differences were assessed by inclusion
   of an interaction term for sex by NLE score and in sex-stratified
   analyses. In analyses adjusted for maternal age, education,
   race/ethnicity, and pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), increasing
   prenatal stress was associated with shortened gestational age (days)
   (??=??0.63, {[}95\% CI ?1.20, ?0.06]). This effect was sex specific,
   with increasing prenatal stress associated with shortened gestational
   age, as well as increased risk of PTB, in male infants (??=??1.35
   {[}95\% CI ?2.17, ?0.54] and RR?=?1.18 {[}95\% CI 0.99, 1.42],
   respectively) but not female infants (??=?0.15 {[}95\%CI ?0.63, 0.94]
   and RR?=?0.85, {[}95\%CI 0.65, 1.11], respectively). Prenatal stress was
   not associated with birthweight z-scores. Our results support the
   importance of psychosocial stress as a programming factor that may have
   sex-specific effects for adverse fetal outcomes. Understanding
   sex-specific effects of prenatal stress on birth outcomes may inform
   prevention strategies. LAY SUMMARY Higher stress experienced by mothers
   in pregnancy was associated with shorter length of pregnancy and the
   effect was stronger in male infants when compared to female infants.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUIDS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{91}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{We report results from an experimental investigation of the
   three-dimensional separation produced by a high-lift aerofoil at
   moderate incidence, with constant section, where the separation is
   controlled by the implementation of an adaptive surface. Mean and
   time-resolved measurements are made using a NASA GA(W)-1 aerofoil with
   AR = 6 at Re-c = 3.5 x 10(5). Surface oil visualisation and stereo
   Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) are used to explore the flow field. The
   mean topology of the flow identifies characteristic spanwise periodic
   behaviour, ``stall cells{''}, along the surface of the model. Analysis
   of the time-dependent surface pressure shows two distinct frequencies
   within the flow field. The higher frequency appears at a Strouhal
   number, St approximate to 0.2, representative of vortex shedding, and
   the typical von Karman vortex street. The lower frequency appears at St
   approximate to 0.02, observed as a global fluctuation in stall-cell
   extent. This lower frequency is apparent in many separated flows, but in
   the present context, appears to have received only little attention. It
   correlates with widely observed low-frequency unsteadiness in the wing
   loading around stall. While this mode is analogous to that observed in
   other types of separation, here the streamwise extent of the separation
   varies because the flow is separating from a curved surface rather than
   from a sharp edge; the width of the separated region also varies. We
   show that fully-reversible point actuations of an actuated surface with
   auxetic structure, introduced immediately upstream of the saddle point
   at the leading edge of the stall cell, reduce the extent of the
   separated region. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Negative Poisson's ratio materials, or auxetics, have drawn attention
   for the past 30 years. The auxetic effect could lead to improved
   mechanical properties such as acoustic damping, indentation resistance,
   or crashworthiness. In this work, two 3D auxetic lattices are
   introduced. Auxeticity is achieved by design through pre-buckling of the
   lattice struts. The influence of geometrical parameters on the effective
   elastic properties is investigated using computational homogenization
   method with periodic boundary conditions. Effective Young's modulus is
   3D mapped to reveal anisotropy and identify spatial orientations of
   interest. The effective Poisson ratio is computed for various geometric
   configurations to characterize auxeticity. Finally, the influence of
   effective elastic properties on energy dissipation under compression is
   explored for elastoplastic lattices with different loading directions,
   using finite element simulations. Results suggest that loading 3D
   auxetic lattices along their stiffest direction maximizes their

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED MECHANICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{86}},
Number = {{11, SI}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Two-dimensional hexachiral lattices belong to the family of
   honeycomb-like mechanical metamaterials such as triangular, hexagonal,
   and kagome lattices. The common feature of this family of beam-based
   metamaterials is their six-fold rotational symmetry which guarantees
   their (transversely-) isotropic elastic response. In the case of
   hexachiral lattices, a single geometric parameter may be introduced to
   control the degree of chirality such that the elastic Poisson's ratio
   can be adjusted between 0.33 and -0.8. Detailed finite element
   simulations are performed to establish the structure-property
   relationships for hexachiral lattices for relative densities ranging
   from 1\% to 45\%. It is shown that both the Young's and shear moduli are
   always lower for hexachiral structures than for optimal lattices
   (triangular and kagome). This result is in line with the general
   understanding that stretching-dominated architectures outperform
   bending-dominated architectures. The same conclusions may be drawn from
   the comparison of the tensile yield strength. However, hexachiral
   structures provide a lower degree of plastic anisotropy than
   stretching-dominated lattices. Furthermore, special hexachiral
   configurations have been identified that exhibit a slightly higher shear
   yield strength than triangular and kagome lattices, thereby presenting
   an example of bending-dominated architectures outperforming
   stretching-dominated architectures of equal mass. Tensile specimens have
   been additively manufactured from a tough PLA polymer and tested to
   partially validate the simulation results.}},

Journal = {{EXTREME MECHANICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{33}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Thin elastic sheets and membranes are known to wrinkle when they are
   stretched - the associated physics is highly non-linear. The unusual
   behavior exhibited by thin films upon stretching when they possess
   auxetic structure, i.e. when their apparent Poisson's ratio is negative,
   is reported here. Wrinkling is now suppressed within the bulk of auxetic
   films when tensioned, whereas localized creases confined to the clamps,
   which decay away exponentially, appear. These edge wrinkles are
   characterized for their amplitude and wavelength experimentally,
   theoretically, and computationally, which show excellent agreement with
   expected trends. The scaling for amplitude, wavelength and decay rate
   upon film properties and tension is obtained using simple analyses based
   on kinematic mismatch resulting from lateral Poisson's expansion. (C)

Journal = {{EXTREME MECHANICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{33}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Attaining architected structures with unprecedented properties not found
   in natural materials is a long-sought goal for both materials science
   and additive manufacturing. Improving the mechanical behavior of
   engineered materials such as auxetics for bioengineering applications or
   bistable structures for mechanical actuation depends on the buckling
   mechanisms governing their response. Despite the fact that the design
   principles for two-dimensional buckling have been elucidated in previous
   studies, comprehending three dimensional buckling mechanisms is still
   tenuous. In this study, we aim to illuminate the buckling mechanisms
   governing the response of three-dimensional structures at the
   microscale, providing the critical guidelines for the design of novel
   metamaterials. In addition, finite element analysis and in-situ SEM -
   microindentation experiments are performed to investigate how scale
   effects affect the design principles to architect a controlled 3D
   buckling mechanism and reflect the mechanical response to the
   deformation of the structure in-situ. Our findings elicit the design
   process of tailored three dimensional buckling structures based on the
   geometric architecture instead of the behavior of the bulk material,
   while setting a broader framework to fabricate and characterize these
   structures at the microscale. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Background and Objectives: Psychological outcomes following termination
   of wanted pregnancies have not previously been studied. Does excluding
   such abortions affect estimates of psychological distress following
   abortion? To address this question this study examines long-term
   psychological outcomes by pregnancy intention (wanted or unwanted)
   following induced abortion relative to childbirth in the United States.
   Materials and Methods: Panel data on a nationally-representative cohort
   of 3935 ever-pregnant women assessed at mean age of 15, 22, and 28 years
   were examined from the National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent to
   Adult Health (Add Health). Relative risk (RR) and incident rate ratios
   (IRR) for time-dynamic mental health outcomes, conditioned by pregnancy
   intention and abortion exposure, were estimated from population-averaged
   longitudinal logistic and Poisson regression models, with extensive
   adjustment for sociodemographic differences, pregnancy and mental health
   history, and other confounding factors. Outcomes were assessed using the
   Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Version 4, American Psychiatric
   Association (DSM-IV) diagnostic criteria or another validated index for
   suicidal ideation, depression, and anxiety (affective problems); drug
   abuse, opioid abuse, alcohol abuse, and cannabis abuse (substance abuse
   problems); and summary total disorders. Results: Women who terminated
   one or more wanted pregnancies experienced a 43\% higher risk of
   affective problems (RR 1.69, 95\% CI 1.3-2.2) relative to childbirth,
   compared to women terminating only unwanted pregnancies (RR 1.18, 95\%
   CI 1.0-1.4). Risks of depression (RR 2.22, 95\% CI 1.3-3.8) and
   suicidality (RR 3.44 95\% CI 1.5-7.7) were especially elevated with
   wanted pregnancy abortion. Relative risk of substance abuse disorders
   with any abortion was high, at about 2.0, but unaffected by pregnancy
   intention. Excluding wanted pregnancies artifactually reduced estimates
   of affective disorders by 72\% from unity, substance abuse disorders by
   11\% from unity, and total disorders by 21\% from unity. Conclusions:
   Excluding wanted pregnancies moderately understates overall risk and
   strongly understates affective risk of mental health difficulties for
   women following abortion. Compared to corresponding births, abortions of
   wanted pregnancies are associated with a greater risk of negative
   psychological affect, particularly depression and suicide ideation, but
   not greater risk of substance abuse, than are abortions of unwanted
   pregnancies. Clinical, research, and policy implications are discussed
   briefly.}},

Abstract = {{Determining the criterion for critical limits is always one of the
   essential challenges for traffic safety authorities. The purpose of
   identifying accident hotspots is to achieve high-priority locations in
   order to effectively allocate the safety budgets as well as to promote
   more efficient and faster safety at the road network level. In recent
   years, human, vehicle, road and environment have been recognized as the
   three main effective elements of the road transportation in the
   occurrence of accidents. In the present study, with combining the
   parameters related to accidents, geometric parameters of the accident
   location and traffic parameters, hotspots were identified. At the
   present research, were used the superior methods of Poisson regression
   and negative binomial distribution and based on the combined criteria of
   frequency and severity of accidents and equivalent injury factors by a
   floating segmentation of road. Then using Time Series Models in ANN,
   result were compared and validated. The results of ANN models
   demonstrate that the frequency method of accidents tends toward places
   with high traffic volume. MATLAB and STATA software were used.
   Non-native plumbing, curvature, slope, section length and residential
   area had more significance, and their coefficients indicated the
   significant effect of these parameters on the occurrence of the
   frequency and severity of accidents in hotspot locations.}},

Abstract = {{In the present study, a comparative compression investigation of
   anti-tetrachiral and modified re-entrant lattices was conducted in-plane
   direction using experimental and numerical analyses. Lattice structures
   were manufactured using fused deposition modelling 3D printing
   technology and crushed at quasi-static condition. Nonlinear finite
   element (FE) models of both structures were established, and the FE
   results were systematically compared with the experimental results. The
   onset of densification phases of both structures was determined
   numerically. Results indicate that deformation modes strongly affect the
   force-deflection response of both designs. In this manner, failure
   locations and buckling deformation in the tests were identified to find
   a relation with theory and to modify geometries. The anti-tetrachiral
   design exhibits higher specific energy absorption than modified
   re-entrant hexagonal lattices. Beyond the auxetic characteristics,
   deformation mechanism of the anti-tetrachiral lattices provides an
   opportunity to construct excellent crush absorption in-plane direction
   thanks to its high shear strength stem from its unique deformation
   mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{Sandwich panels most commonly used in the furniture industry are layered
   structures composed of a hexagonal cell paper core. The use of
   wood-based composites in modelling truss and pyramidal cores of layered
   furniture panels is rather scarce. The effect of geometry in the auxetic
   truss core on the mechanical properties of manufactured wood-based
   materials was primarily explored in this study. Moreover, the need to
   conduct further studies was also stressed to determine the elastic
   properties of cells and cores manufactured from wood filaments using 3D
   printing. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of the type
   of filament used in 3D printing and the geometry of pyramidal core cells
   on elastic constants in cores with identical relative density. This
   paper presented analytical models of manufactured cells, results of
   numerical calculations performed using the finite element method, as
   well as experimental tests determining elastic constants of the cores.
   Digital image analysis was used and showed that cell geometry had a
   considerable effect on elastic properties of the core while maintaining
   identical relative density of these structures. The angle of cell arms
   had a particularly marked effect on these properties.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to determine associations between
   socio-demographic and health characteristics with paid work among
   elderly Brazilians. The analysis included 11,177 subjects aged 60 years
   and over from the National Health Survey conducted in 2013. The
   multivariate analysis was based on prevalence ratios and their
   respective 95\% confidence intervals estimated by Poisson regression.
   The participation of men in paid work was significantly higher (32.9\%)
   than women (14.4\%). For men and women, this participation decreased
   with increasing age and was higher among those with better schooling and
   good self-rated health. Among men, good self-rated health was associated
   with paid work (PR = 1.63, 95\% CI, 1.23-2.15) only for those with less
   schooling (< 9 years). Among women, good self-rated health revealed a
   positive association with paid work (PR = 1.94, 95\% CI 1.32-2.84) for
   those with less schooling, and a negative association for those with
   better schooling (RP = 0.54, 95\% CI 0.38-0.77). The results suggest
   that investments in schooling and improvements in health conditions can
   contribute to an increase in the longevity of the elderly in the labor
   market.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, although advances were made on modeling multivariate count
   data, existing models really has several limitations: (i) The
   multivariate Poisson log-normal model (Aitchison and Ho, 1989) cannot be
   used to fit multivariate count data with excess zero-vectors; (ii) The
   multivariate zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) distribution (Li et al., 1999)
   cannot be used to model zero-truncated/deflated count data and it is
   difficult to apply to high-dimensional cases; (iii) The Type I
   multivariate zero-adjusted Poisson (ZAP) distribution (Tian et al.,
   2017) could only model multivariate count data with a special
   correlation structure for random components that are all positive or
   negative. In this paper, we first introduce a new multivariate ZAP
   distribution, based on a multivariate Poisson distribution, which allows
   the correlations between components with a more flexible dependency
   structure, that is some of the correlation coefficients could be
   positive while others could be negative. We then develop its important
   distributional properties, and provide efficient statistical inference
   methods for multivariate ZAP model with or without covariates. Two real
   data examples in biomedicine are used to illustrate the proposed
   methods.}},

Abstract = {{Expanded Polystyrene Styrofoam (EPS) geofoam is widely used in various
   civil engineering applications. To predict the responses of structures
   to external loading, when in the presence of geofoam, understanding
   physical and mechanical behavior of geofoam, both short and long term,
   is very essential. A series of laboratory experiments was conducted on
   EPS15, EPS20, and EPS25 geofoam specimens under different loading
   conditions. To understand the short-term behavior, static uniaxial
   compression and cyclic uniaxial compression (CUC) tests were performed;
   however, for long-term behavior, accelerated creep and pseudo long-term
   tests were conducted on geofoam samples. CUC tests were performed at
   different static and cyclic stress amplitudes and loading frequencies
   for 5,000 load cycles, and the results reveal that, irrespective of
   geofoam density, secant modulus (E-dyn) decreases and the damping ratio
   of geofoam increases with the increase in cyclic axial strain. Also, it
   was observed that an increase in cyclic axial strain and the number of
   loading cycles reduced the Poisson's ratio of geofoam from positive to
   negative values. From the time-temperature-stress superposition
   accelerated creep testing method, creep strains developed in EPS15,
   EPS20, and EPS25 geofoam samples at the end of 100 years were 2.12, 2.4,
   and 2.11 \%, respectively. From pseudo long-term tests, the estimated
   Young's modulus (E) of geofoam decreases with the increase in
   compressive creep strain for all three densities of geofoam.}},

Abstract = {{Consider an exponential family F on the set of non-negative integers
   indexed by the parameter a. The cumulative distribution function of an
   element of F estimated on k is both a function of a and k. Assume that
   the derivative of this function with respect to a is the product of
   three things: a function of k, a function of a and the function a to the
   power k. We show that this assumption implies that the exponential
   family is either a binomial, or the Poisson, or a negative binomial
   family. Next, we study an analogous property for continuous
   distributions and we find that it is satisfied if and only the families
   are either Gaussian or Gamma. Ultimately, the proofs rely on the fact
   that only Mobius functions preserve the cross ratio.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports a study on the geometrical analysis of bi-stretch
   auxetic woven fabric based on a re-entrant hexagonal geometry. The
   fabric was first designed and fabricated. Then, the fabric was subjected
   to tensile tests, and changes in the geometry of the fabric structural
   unit cell at different tensile strains were observed when stretched
   either in the warp or weft direction. Based on the observations, a
   geometrical model was proposed for each stretch direction and used to
   establish the relationship between Poisson's ratio and tensile strain.
   The semi-empirical equations for both stretch directions were finally
   obtained by fitting geometrical parameters with experimental results. It
   is expected that the semi-empirical equations obtained in this study
   could be used in the design and prediction of the auxetic behavior of
   bi-stretch auxetic woven fabrics made with the same type of materials
   and geometry, but with different values of geometrical parameters.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials with negative Poisson's ratio have potential
   applications across a broad range of engineering fields. Several FE
   based design techniques have been developed to achieve auxetic materials
   with targeted effective properties, mostly in linear deformation regime.
   In this paper, an isogeometric shape optimization framework for
   designing 2D auxetic materials with prescribed deformation over large
   strain intervals is presented Taking into account practical
   manufacturing considerations, a minimum thickness for each member is
   imposed via a spline-based geometric constraint. The capability of the
   framework is demonstrated through two examples. First, the paper
   considers shape optimization of smoothed hexa-petals in plane strain
   condition to achieve constant Poisson's ratios ranging from a null value
   to -0.5 to an effective tensile strain of 50\%. The second example
   showcases the shape optimization of smoothed tri- and hexa-petals in
   plane stress condition for targeted nonlinear deformation behaviour of
   cat's skin up to 90\% tensile strain. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A novel computational framework for designing metamaterials with
   negative Poisson's ratio over a large strain range is presented in this
   work by combining the density-based topology optimization together with
   a mixed stress/deformation driven nonlinear homogenization method. A
   measure of Poisson's ratio based on the macro deformations is proposed,
   which is further validated through direct numerical simulations. With
   the consistent optimization formulations based on nonlinear
   homogenization, auxetic metamaterial designs with respect to different
   loading orientations and with different unit cell domains are
   systematically explored. In addition, the extension to multimaterial
   auxetic metamaterial designs is also considered, and stable optimization
   formulations are presented to obtain discrete metamaterial topologies
   under finite strains. Various new auxetic designs are obtained based on
   the proposed framework. To validate the performance of optimized
   designs, a multiscale stability analysis is carried out using the Bloch
   analysis and rank-one convexity check. As demonstrated, short and/or
   long wavelength instabilities can occur during the loading process,
   leading to a change of periodicity of the microstructure, which can
   affect the performance of an optimized design. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials are under great attention of researchers due to their
   excellent mechanical response under certain conditions. Previous works
   have been carried out in knitted or uni-stretch woven fabrics. In the
   present study, three-dimensional (3D) woven structures were produced and
   the effect of float length of ground weave and binding yarn on
   auxeticity of the fabric was investigated. Eight different 3D orthogonal
   woven structures/reinforcements were produced on rapier dobby loom by
   changing the float length in ground weave and binding yarns. Hand layup
   technique was used for composite fabrication, while green epoxy resin
   was used as a matrix. For investigating the auxeticity, 3D reinforcement
   samples were subjected to tensile loading and change in their thickness
   was measured. The results showed that 3D woven reinforcements with equal
   and maximum float length of ground weave and binding yarn showed greater
   auxetic behavior, because both weaves support each other and room for
   opening of structure increases. As the difference between the float
   length of ground weave and binding yarns increases, the auxeticity of
   reinforcement decreases because the ground weave and binding yarn cancel
   out the effect of each other. Moreover, the impact energy absorption of
   the developed composites was found to increase with the increase in
   float length, justifying that the structures are auxetic in nature.}},

   Numerical simulation shows that the amplitudes of the acceleration

Title = {{Predictive model of BEC dark matter halos with a solitonic core and an

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW D}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{100}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{OCT 31}},
Abstract = {{We develop a model of Bose-Einstein condensate dark matter halos with a
   solitonic core and an isothermal atmosphere based on a generalized
   Gross-Pitaevskii equation {[}P. H. Chavanis, Eur. Phys. J. Plus 132, 248
   (2017)]. This equation provides a heuristic coarse-grained
   parametrization of the ordinary GrossPitaevskii equation accounting for
   violent relaxation and gravitational cooling. It involves a cubic
   nonlinearity taking into account the self-interaction of the bosons, a
   logarithmic nonlinearity associated with an effective temperature, and a
   source of dissipation. It leads to superfluid dark matter halos with a
   core-halo structure. The quantum potential or the self-interaction of
   the bosons generates a solitonic core that solves the cusp problem of
   the cold dark matter model. The logarithmic nonlinearity generates an
   isothermal atmosphere accounting for the flat rotation curves of the
   galaxies. The dissipation ensures that the system relaxes towards an
   equilibrium configuration. In the Thomas-Fermi approximation, a dark
   matter halo is equivalent to a barotropic gas with an equation of state
   P = 2 pi a(s)h(2)/rho(2)m(3)+ pk(B)T/m, where a(s) is the scattering
   length of the bosons and m is their individual mass. We numerically
   solve the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium and determine the density
   profiles and rotation curves of dark matter halos. We impose that the
   surface density of the halos has the universal value Sigma(0)
   =rho(0)r(h) = 141 M-circle dot/pc(2) obtained from the observations. For
   a boson with ratio a(s)/m(3) = 3.28 x 10(3) fm/(eV/c(2))(3), we find a
   minimum halo mass (M-h)(min) = 1.86 x 10(8) M-circle dot and a minimum
   halo radius (r(h))(min) = 788 pc. This ultracompact halo corresponds to
   a pure soliton which is the ground state of the Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson
   equation. For (M-h)(min) h, < (M-h), = 3.30 x 10(9) M circle dot the
   soliton is surrounded by a tenuous isothermal atmosphere. For M-h >
   (M-h)(c) we find two branches of solutions corresponding to (i) purely
   isothermal halos without soliton and (ii) isothermal halos harboring a
   central soliton. The purely isothermal halos (gaseous phase) are stable.
   For M-h> (M-h)(c) = 6.86 x 10(10) M-circle dot they arc
   indistinguishable from the observational Burkert profile. For (M-h) {*}
   < M-h < (M-h)(c), the deviation from the isothermal law (most probable
   state) may be explained by incomplete violent relaxation, tidal effects,
   or stochastic forcing. The isothermal halos harboring a central soliton
   (core-halo phase) are canonically unstable (having a negative specific
   heat) but they are microcanonically stable so they are long-lived. By
   extremizing the free energy with respect to the core mass, we find that
   the core mass scales as M-c/(M-h)(min) = 0.626(M-h/(M-h)(min))(1/2)
   In(M-h/(M-h)(min)). For a halo of mass M-h= 10(12) M-circle dot, similar
   to the mass of the dark matter halo that surrounds our Galaxy, the
   solitonic core has a mass M-c= 6.39 x 10(10) M-circle dot and a radius
   R-c = 1 kpc.
   The solitonic core cannot mimic by itself a supermassive black hole at
   the center of the Galaxy but it may represent a large bulge which is
   either present now or may have, in the past, triggered the collapse of
   the surrounding gas, leading to a supermassive black hole and a quasiu.
   On the other hand, we argue that large halos with a mass M-h > 10(12)
   M-circle dot may undergo a gravothermal catastrophe leading ultimately
   to the formation of a supermassive black hole (for smaller halos, the
   gravothermal catastrophe is inhibited by quantum effects). We relate the
   bifurcation point and the point above which supermassive black holes may
   form to the canonical and microcanonical critical points (M-h)(CCP) =
   3.27 x 10(9) M-circle dot and (M-h)(MCP) similar to 2 x 10(12) M-circle
   dot of the ``thermal{''} self-gravitating bosonic gas. Our model has no
   free parameter so it is completely predictive. Extension of this model
   to noninteracting bosons and fermions will be presented in forthcoming
   papers.}},

Title = {{Chromatin Compaction, Auxeticity, and the Epigenetic Landscape of Stem
   Cells}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW X}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{9}},

Month = {{OCT 28}},
Abstract = {{When embryonic stem cells differentiate, the mechanical properties of
   their nuclei evolve en route to their terminal state. Measurements of
   the deformability of cell nuclei in the transitional state that
   intervenes between the embryonic stem-cell state and the differentiation
   primed state of mouse stem cells indicate that such nuclei are auxetic;
   i.e., they have a negative Poisson's ratio. We show, using a theoretical
   model, how this remarkable mechanical behavior results from the coupling
   between chromatin compaction states and nuclear shape. Our biophysical
   approach, which treats chromatin as an active polymer system whose
   mechanics is modulated by nucleosome binding and unbinding, reproduces
   experimental results. It provides testable predictions for changes in
   chromatin compaction as a function of applied force, for the
   correlations of chromatin compaction and nuclear shape, and for the
   in-phase and out-of-phase response of these quantities to an applied
   uniaxial oscillatory force. Our model yields a biophysical
   interpretation of the epigenetic landscape of stem cells, also
   suggesting how this landscape might be probed experimentally.}},

Pages = {{8084-8091}},
Month = {{OCT 28}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic materials are characterized by a negative Poisson's ratio, nu.
   As the Poisson's ratio approaches the lower isotropic mechanical limit
   of nu = -1, materials show enhanced resistance to impact and shear,
   making them suitable for applications ranging from robotics to impact
   mitigation. Past experimental efforts aimed at reaching the nu = -1
   limit have resulted in highly anisotropic materials, which show a
   negative Poisson's ratio only when subjected to deformations along
   specific directions. Isotropic designs have only attained moderately
   auxetic behavior or have led to solutions that cannot be manufactured in
   3D. Here, we present a design strategy to create isotropic structures
   from disordered networks, which result in Poisson's ratios as low as nu
   = -0.98. The materials conceived through this approach are successfully
   fabricated in the laboratory and behave as predicted. nu depends on
   network structure and bond strengths; this sheds light on the motifs
   which lead to auxetic behavior. The ideas introduced here can be
   generalized to 3D, a wide range of materials, and a spectrum of length
   scales, thereby providing a general platform that could impact
   technology.}},

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 25}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic materials have gained increasing interest in the last decades,
   fostered by auspicious applications in various fields. While the design
   of new auxetics has largely focused on metamaterials with deterministic,
   periodically arranged structures, we show here by theoretical and
   numerical analysis that pronounced auxetic behaviour with negative
   Poisson's ratios of very large magnitude can occur in random fibre
   networks with slender, reasonably straight fibre segments that buckle
   and deflect. We further demonstrate in experiments that such auxetic
   fibre networks, which increase their thickness by an order of magnitude
   and more than quintuple their volume when moderately extended, can be
   produced by electrospinning. Our results thus augment the class of
   auxetics by a large group of straightforwardly fabricable meta-materials
   with stochastic microstructure.}},

Abstract = {{This article is devoted to the study of auxetic properties of Cosserat
   hexagonal lattices composed of finite-sized particles with complex
   connections. The description of complex connections is given; their
   mathematical model is elaborated and the properties are studied. The
   introduction of complex connections enables one varying their structure
   and component parameters. Due to that there arise possibilities for both
   simulation of nonchiral lattices with symmetrical bonds and with a
   chiral microstructure and construction of lattices with desired
   properties. The discrete and micropolar equations of the lattice are
   obtained. As a result, the macroparameters are expressed in terms of the
   lattice microparameters. The dependence of the Poisson's ratio on the
   lattice microparameters is obtained. It allows finding and analyzing
   parameters, for which the lattice possesses auxetic properties. The
   importance of rotational degrees of freedom of particles and chirality
   for the appearance of auxetic properties is shown. For verification, the
   results of the calculation of the Poisson's ratio obtained on the basis
   of theoretically obtained relations are compared with the results of
   numerical simulation of the stretching of the lattice.}},

Abstract = {{Statistical inference based on correlated count measurements are
   frequently performed in biomedical studies. Most of existing sample size
   calculation methods for count outcomes are developed under the Poisson
   model. Deviation from the Poisson assumption (equality of mean and
   variance) has been widely documented in practice, which indicates urgent
   needs of sample size methods with more realistic assumptions to ensure
   valid experimental design. In this study, we investigate sample size
   calculation for clinical trials with correlated count measurements based
   on the negative binomial distribution. This approach is flexible to
   accommodate overdispersion and unequal measurement intervals, as well as
   arbitrary randomization ratios, missing data patterns, and correlation
   structures. Importantly, the derived sample size formulas have closed
   forms both for the comparison of slopes and for the comparison of
   time-averaged responses, which greatly reduces the burden of
   implementation in practice. We conducted extensive simulation to
   demonstrate that the proposed method maintains the nominal levels of
   power and type I error over a wide range of design configurations. We
   illustrate the application of this approach using a real epileptic
   trial.}},

Abstract = {{To maximize the public health benefits of voluntary medical male
   circumcision (VMMC) in real-world settings, sexual abstinence is
   recommended for six weeks following VMMC to ensure complete wound
   healing. We determined the frequency and predictors of early resumption
   of sex among a cohort of HIV-negative, sexually active men 18-49 years
   who underwent VMMC within a public-sector clinic in Botswana.
   Multivariate robust Poisson regression methods were used to identify
   predictors of having any sexual intercourse in the last six weeks since
   undergoing VMMC. In total, 433/519 (83\%) men had data available on
   sexual activity at six weeks post-VMMC. Median age was 27 years, 57\%
   had a higher than secondary education, 72\% were employed, and 9\% were
   married. Overall, 122/433 (28\%) men had sexual intercourse within the
   six weeks since VMMC, of whom 36\% reported inconsistent condom use.
   Compared to men >= 34 years, men aged <30 years (adjusted risk ratio
   {[}aRR] = 1.71, 95\% CI 0.95-3.08) and men 30-34 years had a two-fold
   higher likelihood of resuming sexual activity early in multivariate
   analyses (aRR = 2.31, 95\% CI 1.26-4.25, Wald p = 0.018). Employed men
   were more likely to resume sexual activity early than unemployed men
   (aRR = 1.58, 95\% CI 1.02-2.44, p = 0.039). Additional interventions are
   needed to encourage abstinence until complete wound healing.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic textiles have been the focus of much attention due to their
   great promise for advanced protective clothing, flexible energy harvest
   devices, and functional textiles. Herein, plain fabric, basket fabric,
   and a derivative weave with the warp and weft yarns arrangement in a
   series of zigzags were prepared by incorporating different initial wrap
   density helical auxetic yarns in the weft direction using a commercial
   semi-automatic loom. The derivative weave using HAYs with a 150 m(-1)
   initial wrap density as the weft yarn not only possesses superior
   auxetic behavior but also has good performance in strength and
   elasticity-essential properties useful for textile daily application.
   This fabric exhibits a high auxetic effect (nu = -0.585), low elastic
   deformation (total deformation of 8.4\% at 20\% strain), excellent
   flexibility, and high break load. Moreover, by taking account of the key
   geometric parameters, a systematic discussion of the fabrics has been
   completed to evaluate the effect on the auxetic behavior; this clarified
   that changing the fabric structure and initial wrap density of a HAY is
   an effective strategy to tailor auxetic behavior without compromising
   the intrinsic properties of components. On the basis of our research,
   auxetic textiles can be considered a promising candidate for
   next-generation smart textiles and advanced functional textiles.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the wealth of studies reporting mechanical properties of liquid
   crystal elastomers (LCEs), no theory can currently describe their
   complete mechanical anisotropy and nonlinearity. Here, we present the
   first comprehensive study of mechanical anisotropy in an all-acrylate
   LCE via tensile tests that simultaneously track liquid crystal (LC)
   director rotation. We then use an empirical approach to gain a deeper
   insight into the LCE's mechanical responses at values of strain, up to
   1.5, for initial director orientations between 0 degrees and 90 degrees.
   Using a method analogous to time-temperature superposition, we create
   master curves for the LCE's mechanical response and use these to deduce
   a model that accurately predicts the load curve of the LCE for stresses
   applied at angles between 15 degrees and 70 degrees relative to the
   initial LC director. This LCE has been shown to exhibit auxetic behavior
   for deformations perpendicular to the director. Interestingly, our
   empirical model predicts that the LCE will further demonstrate auxetic
   behavior when stressed at angles between 54 degrees and 90 degrees to
   the director. Our approach could be extended to any LCE; so it
   represents a significant step forward toward models that would aid the
   further development of LCE theory and the design and modeling of
   LCE-based technologies. (c) 2019 The Authors. Journal of Polymer Science

   cellular solids: Dependence between static and dynamic mechanical
   properties}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{226}},

Abstract = {{Cellular solids are attractive materials due to their high specific
   static and dynamic mechanical properties. Even though these mechanical
   domains are interdependent, they are generally studied separately. This
   study uses a combination of additive manufacturing and vacuum assisted
   investment casting to manufacture low specific density (0.042-0.098)
   non-stochastic metallic cellular solids. An in-situ unitary cell
   geometric control is used to produce samples with positive, zero and
   negative Poisson's ratios. The different values of this elastic constant
   allow the analysis of the distinct deformation in auxetic and
   non-auxetic behaviors. Deformation models are used to describe the
   static and dynamic behavior of the referred samples. It is shown that
   auxetic samples display higher values of apparent modulus and plastic
   collapse stress due to their densification effect. In terms of dynamic
   properties, samples with slightly negative and zero rib angles show
   higher values of damping. This is attributed to the more favorable
   flexure component of deformation and variations in material volume that
   influence the hysteretic damping. Overall, it is suggested that the most
   beneficial combination of specific density, static and dynamic
   mechanical properties is observed in samples with a rib angle of -10
   degrees and a Poisson's ratio of - 0.34.}},

Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{226}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{This paper introduces a class of honeycomb composite metamaterials
   whereby the increase and decrease in temperature give rise to opposing
   microstructural geometries in situ, thereby leading to Poisson's ratio
   of opposing signs. The metamaterial consists of rigid crossbeams from
   which alternating bimaterials are joined onto. Four types of this class
   of metamaterial, depending on the relative location of the bimaterial
   phase with higher coefficient of thermal expansion within each unit
   cell, have been identified. The O-Type and X-Type metamaterials, in
   which each unit cell has 2 axes of symmetry, exhibit sign-reversal of
   Poisson's ratio upon temperature change sign reversal. The CC-Type has
   one axis of symmetry in each unit cell while the SS-Type possesses a
   180-degree rotational symmetry; these metamaterial types display zero
   Poisson's ratio and zero thermal expansion in a specific direction. This
   class of metamaterial avails to the practising engineer the possibility
   of designing materials and structures with in situ sign-switchable
   Poisson's ratio by means of thermal-toggling, as well as those that
   require good dimensional stability.}},

Title = {{A novel three-dimensional mechanical metamaterial with
   compression-torsion properties}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{226}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{A new design of a 3D compression-torsion mechanical metamaterial is
   proposed based on the chiral mechanism of inclined rods converting axial
   compression (or tension) into torsion. Experiments and numerical
   simulations are employed to investigate the compression-torsion
   properties of the new proposed metamaterial under uniaxial compression.
   Results show that it possesses excellent compression-torsion properties
   compared to previously reported 3D compression-torsion metamaterials.
   Moreover, the torsion angle of the proposed metamaterial under
   compression can maintain a large value even when the transverse cell
   number N = 9. By contrast, the torsion angle of structures reported in
   references declined rapidly with the cell number, and the
   compression-torsion properties nearly vanished when N = 5. These
   outstanding properties of the proposed metamaterial are due to the
   better compression-torsion properties of the unit cell and weaker
   transverse constraint among cells. The latter reason also contributes to
   an interesting phenomenon wherein the torsion angle first increases and
   then declines with the transverse cell number N, which is much different
   from the monotonically decreasing trend of other 3D compression-torsion
   metamaterials. The main factors affecting the compression-torsion
   properties of 3D metamaterials are revealed and discussed in detail,
   shedding light on the design of 3D metamaterial with outstanding
   compression-torsion properties.}},

   constants for 22 either rigid or flexible MOFs assembled from rod
   secondary building units (rod MOFs) and related to 7 topological types
   of underlying nets: 4/5/t1, bik, crb, dia, gis, cda, and mog. The
   calculated values of the Young's and shear moduli, linear
   compressibility, and Poisson's ratio have found a good agreement with
   experimental observations. We have shown that the
   geometrical-topological features of the coordination framework
   predetermine the general form of the elastic tensor, while variations in
   the MOF composition tune the mechanical properties in specific
   directions. We report for the first time a negative linear
   compressibility for the CAU-10-OCH3, NOTT-401, MIL-60, MIL-116, and
   MIL-118 frameworks. We have also revealed that the breathing behavior of
   six rod MOFs of the MIL-53, MIL-118, and CAU-10 families is caused by
   compliant geometrical-topological patterns and ligand-ligand
   interactions. The proposed classification of the geometrical-topological
   patterns into compliant and noncompliant can be used to search for and
   to design breathing MOFs.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials are promising structural and functional candidates due
   to their unique lateral expansion when stretched, however, bulk metallic
   glasses (MGs) could not show any auxeticity because of their intrinsic
   isotropic nature. Here we construct chiral Cu50Zr50 metallic glass
   nanolattices with cavities, and investigate their auxeticity and
   underlying mechanism with molecular dynamics simulations. It is found
   that, compared to monolithic MGs, all the chiral metallic glass
   nanolattices (CMGNs) exhibit improved auxeticity and lower density. For
   CMGNs with cavities, the negative Poisson's ratio and ultimate tensile
   strength (UTS) increase first and then decrease with increasing cavity
   radius, with the cavity radius of 2.5 nm being the most favorable for
   auxeticity and enhanced UTS. The auxetic mechanism is attributed to the
   competition between rotation behavior and non-affine deformation under
   tension. Our study not only reveals the mechanism of auxeticity in CMGNs
   having cavities but also provides a feasible method to optimize their
   auxetic performance and density by structure designing of MGs.}},

Title = {{A novel layered topology of auxetic materials based on the tetrachiral
   honeycomb microstructure}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{179}},
Month = {{OCT 5}},
Abstract = {{Microstructured honeycomb materials may exhibit exotic, extreme and
   tailorable mechanical properties, suited for innovative technological
   applications in a variety of modern engineering fields. The paper is
   focused on analysing the directional auxeticity of tetrachiral
   materials, through analytical, numerical and experimental methods.
   Theoretical predictions about the global elastic properties have been
   successfully validated by performing tensile laboratory tests on
   tetrachiral samples, realized with high precision 3D printing
   technologies. Inspired by the kinematic behaviour of the tetrachiral
   material, a newly-design bi-layered topology, referred to as
   bi-tetrachiral material, has been theoretically conceived and
   mechanically modelled. The novel topology virtuously exploits the mutual
   collaboration between two tetrachiral layers with opposite chiralities.
   The bi-tetrachiral material has been verified to outperform the
   tetrachiral material in terms of global Young modulus and, as major
   achievement, to exhibit a remarkable auxetic behaviour. Specifically,
   experimental results, confirmed by parametric analytical and
   computational analyses, have highlighted the effective possibility to
   attain strongly negative Poisson ratios, identified as a peculiar global
   elastic property of the novel bi-layered topology.(c) 2019 The Authors.

Abstract = {{The Poisson's ratio (PR) of asphalt mixtures is an important input
   parameter in the constitutive models for pavement design and performance
   analysis. The design and performance analysis of asphalt pavements
   depend upon measuring proper material properties such as complex modulus
   and PR. The PR is often assumed to be time independent or it is
   calculated as the negative ratio of transverse to axial strains in the
   time domain under uniaxial loading when the time dependency is
   considered. This study used accurate methods to calculate the
   viscoelastic Poisson's Ratio (VPR) under various loading conditions and
   demonstrated the error associated with using inaccurate methods for
   calculating the PR. The results demonstrated that the VPR increased with
   time in uniaxial unconfined tension and compression tests where shear
   relaxation was generally faster than dilatational relaxation. While the
   VPR slightly decreased with time in uniaxial confined compression tests
   where the dilatational relaxation was faster than the shear relaxation.
   In addition, the results demonstrated that asphalt mixtures with coarse
   aggregate gradations had lower VPR compared to asphalt mixtures with
   finer aggregate gradations. Also, the VPR was found to be sensitive to
   the ageing and moisture conditions. The VPR decreased with ageing and
   increased with the level and time of moisture conditioning of the
   asphalt mixtures. Finally, the error introduced by incorrectly
   calculating the PR as the negative ratio of transverse to axial strains
   in the time domain was found to be significant in some cases, while it
   was insignificant in others.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic chiral structures with negative Poisson ratio (NPR) can contract
   its width along the directions perpendicular to compression loading
   direction, thus generate enhanced indentation resistance and enhanced
   impact energy absorption abilities. To enhance the dynamic mechanical
   performances of periodic anti-chiral structures and hybrid-chiral
   structures, geometrically graded ligaments are proposed, and the
   in-plane dynamic deformation mechanism and energy absorption capacity of
   the functionally graded anti-chiral and hybrid-chiral cellular
   structures are studied through finite element analysis (FEA). Numerical
   results in our work show that the crushing energy absorption
   performances of periodic chiral structures can be improved by
   introducing structural graded design, where the plateau stress and
   energy absorption efficiency can be optimized by means of adjusting the
   unit cell geometrical parameters. Our study can enrich insightful
   understanding of the dynamic behavior of chiral cellular materials, and
   can be employed for optimizing the design of automobile crash energy
   absorption and impact protection structures. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This paper details a new 2D auxetic honeycomb that was structured by
   mirroring the horizontal series-connected parallelograms along the
   vertical direction. A combination of analytical, numerical, and
   experimental methods was used to gain a deep understanding of the
   elastic behavior of the new honeycomb and examined its dependence on the
   geometric parameters. The results showed that the new honeycomb can
   achieve a negative Poisson's ratio via a novel mechanism. Furthermore,
   the newly developed 2D honeycomb was extended to three dimensions, and
   three kinds of 3D structures were conceived via different splicing
   methods. A preliminary numerical study was conducted to explore the
   mechanical properties of the 3D structures. An auxetic effect was found
   in two principal orthogonal coordinate directions of those 3D structures
   when they were compressed along the other principal axis. This work may
   provide a new insight into the design of both the 2D and 3D auxetics.}},

Title = {{Novel mechanical behaviors of DNA-inspired helical structures with
   chirality}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{161}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Artificially designed structures with chirality are able to possess
   novel mechanical properties, for example, chiral honeycombs with
   negative Poisson's ratio and chiral acoustic metamaterials. Inspired by
   the chiral nature of double-helical structure of DNA molecule, in this
   paper, we present a design of helical structure with chirality and study
   its mechanical behaviors through experimental characterization,
   theoretical analysis and numerical simulation. A compression-twisting
   coupling deformation mode is observed for different types of
   DNA-inspired helical structures due to the competition among
   compression, bending and twisting energy of the helical structures and
   tension energy of the interlinks. We find that interlinks between two
   intertwined helices are decisive to the compression-twisting coupling
   deformation mode and both chiral and non-chiral behaviors of the
   structures can be quantitively captured by our established theoretical
   and numerical models. The influences of various geometric parameters on
   the stiffness and deformation mode are discussed. Finally, we present
   two types of superposed structures that behave differently, showing a
   high designability of the DNA-inspired structures. This study exploits
   the chirality of bio-inspired structures and uses it in structural
   design with novel mechanical properties, which may shed light on the
   development of bio-inspired mechanical metamaterials, impact energy
   absorbers, multi-functional composite materials and among others.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the fabrication of polymeric auxetic foam using a
   quasi tri-axial compression method. In this method, the conversion
   process is executed by applying a quasi tri-axial compression on
   conventional closed-cell polyurethane foams. In order to achieve optimum
   auxetic characteristics, the densification points in various directions
   are evaluated. In addition, the heating time of the compressed foam is
   also determined and applied to minimize the residual stress due to the
   volumetric compression. It leads to the fabrication of auxetic foams
   with achievable maximum re-entrancy and minimum collapsed cells without
   surface creasing. The results also show that the optimized auxetic foam
   exhibits isotropic behavior compared to its pre-cursor foam as verified
   by the morphological analysis. The produced foam has all the desired
   properties of auxetic foams. The auxetic foam with a negative Poisson's
   ratio may be have great potential as the supplementary materials in
   energy absorption and structural applications.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetics with negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) can expand dimensions along
   the direction perpendicular to the tensile direction, such as rigid
   rotation, reentrant and chiral structures, etc. The mechanical
   performances of chiral metastructures are closely related to internal
   defects and interactions between defects. In this paper, two types of
   irregular chiral structures with Gaussian dispersion of circular node
   positions and missing ligaments are designed, namely: anti-tetrachiral
   metastructure and tetrachiral hybrid metastructure. These two types of
   chiral metastructures are characterized by node radius, ligament
   thickness, ligament length, the circular node center dispersion range,
   and missing ligament percentages. Effects of random node distribution
   range and cell wall missing percentage on the elastic modulus and
   Poisson's ratio of chiral metastructures are investigated through
   experimental tests and finite element (FE) simulation systematically.
   Through dimensionless analysis, it is found that ligament thickness has
   remarkable influence on the negative Poisson's ratio. Effect of missing
   ligament on the mechanical properties of the structure is greater than
   effect of random node center dispersion. With the increase of ligament
   missing percentage, the resultant modulus of chiral metastructures
   decreases, and the corresponding NPR increases.}},

Abstract = {{Growing biological media develop residual stresses to make compatible
   elastic and inelastic growth-induced deformations, which in turn remodel
   the tissue properties modifying the actual elastic moduli and
   transforming an initially isotropic and homogeneous material into a
   spatially inhomogeneous and anisotropic one. This process is crucial in
   solid tumor growth mechanobiology, the residual stresses directly
   influencing tumor aggressiveness, nutrients walkway, necrosis and
   angiogenesis. With this in mind, we here analyze the problem of a
   hyperelastic sphere undergoing finite heterogeneous growth, in cases of
   different boundary conditions and spherical symmetry. By following an
   analytical approach, we obtain the explicit expression of the tangent
   elasticity tensor at any point of the material body as a function of the
   prescribed growth, by involving a small-on-large procedure and
   exploiting exact solutions for layered media. The results allowed to
   gain several new insights into how growth-guided mechanical stresses and
   remodeling processes can influence the solid tumor development. In
   particular, we highlight that-under hypotheses consistent with
   mechanical and physiological conditions-auxetic (negative Poisson ratio)
   transformations of the elastic response of selected growing mass
   districts could occur and contribute to explain some not yet completely
   understood phenomena associated to solid tumors. The general approach
   proposed in the present work could be also helpfully employed to
   conceive composite materials where ad hoc pre-stress distributions can
   be designed to obtain auxetic or other selected mechanical properties.}},

Abstract = {{A systematic investigation is presented that explores band gap
   properties of periodic micro-structures architected for maximum
   auxeticity. The design of two-dimensional auxetic cells is addressed
   using inverse homogenization. A non-convex optimization problem is
   formulated that is solved through mathematical programming. Different
   starting guesses are used to explore local minima when distributing
   material and void or two materials and void. The same numerical tool
   succeeds in capturing re-entrant, chiral and anti-chiral layouts with
   negative Poisson's ratio, retrieving solutions originally found through
   other approaches as well as generating variations. A Floquet-Bloch
   approach is then applied to the achieved periodic cells to investigate
   possible band gaps characterizing the in-plane wave propagation.
   Directional and full band-pass filters are found in the case of
   micro-structures whose auxetic behavior comes from the arising of a
   rotational deformation of the periodic cell. Such kind of topologies
   could be exploited to design tunable wave guides and tunable phononic
   crystals, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) have detrimental impact on
   health-related quality of life. This study has 2 aims: first to identify
   the optimum model for LUTS study and then to explore the potential
   associated factors of LUTS and bother LUTS with the optimum model among
   adult women in China.
   The survey was conducted in 6 regions of China between February and July
   2006. A modified Chinese Bristol Female LUTS questionnaire was
   administered. The number of LUTS was the main outcome measure. The
   fitting goodness was compared to identify the optimum model with
   likelihood ratio test statistics. Zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB)
   model was used to explore the potential associated factors of LUTS and
   bother LUTS.
   Of all 18,992 respondents, 55.5\% of respondents reported one (any LUTS)
   or more LUTS (mixed LUTS) and 36.5\% of respondents reported one or more
   bother LUTS. With the largest log likelihood and smallest AIC and BIC,
   ZINB model showed the best goodness of fit. In the ZINB model, we
   identified multiple associated factors for any LUTS and mixed LUTS;
   older age (beta=0.2), overweight {[}beta=0.059, 95\%CI (0.016 similar to
   0.102)], obese {[}beta=0.143, 95\%CI (0.087 similar to 0.198)],
   postmenopausal status {[}beta=0.099, 95\%CI (0.023 similar to 0.175)],
   prolonged labor {[}beta=0.188, 95\%CI (0.104 similar to 0.272)],
   constipation {[}beta=0.309, 95\%CI (0.262 similar to 0.357)], coexisting
   pelvic organ prolapse (POP) {[}beta=0.348, 95\%CI (0.224 similar to
   0.473)], diabetes (beta=0.178, 95\%CI (0.100 similar to 0.257),
   hypertension {[}beta=0.092, 95\%CI (0.041 similar to 0.143)], smoking
   (beta=0.192, 95\%CI (0.127 similar to 0.258) and alcohol consumption
   {[}beta=0.063, 95\%CI (0.001 similar to 0.126)] increased the odds of
   mixed LUTS. We identified multiple associated factors for bother LUTS
   and mixed LUTS; older age (beta=0.1), prolonged labor {[}beta 0.153,
   95\%CI (0.031 similar to 0.275)], constipation {[}beta=0.359, 95\%CI
   (0.292 similar to 0.426)] coexisting POP (beta=0.212, {[}95\% CI (0.031
   similar to 0.393)], diabetes {[}beta=.154, 95\%CI (0.030 similar to
   0.278)], and smoking {[}beta=0.169, 95\%CI (0.076 similar to 0.262)]
   increased the odds of bother mixed LUTS.
   ZINB model was the optimum model to explore the potential associated
   factors of LUTS. Older age, coexisting POP and constipation were both
   closely related to any and bother LUTS, also the severity of LUTS.
   Compared to nulliparity, single or multiple deliveries and women who had
   perineal laceration had nothing to do with the severity of LUTS.}},

Abstract = {{A chiral 3D lattice is designed, made by 3D printing, and studied
   experimentally. The lattice exhibits squeeze-twist coupling and a
   Poisson's ratio near zero. Squeeze-twist coupling does not occur in
   classical elasticity which makes no provision for chirality. By
   contrast, chiral effects are allowed in Cosserat elasticity. An
   experimental squeeze-twist coupling strain ratio on the order of unity

   finite element analysis of a lattice with similar structure, for which

   HIV-Related Sexual Risk Behavior Among Young Trans Women in San

Abstract = {{Purpose: Young trans women (YTW) carry a disproportionate burden of HIV.
   The developmental context of HIV risk for YTW is underexamined. The aim
   of this analysis was to examine whether parent/caregiver responses to
   gender identity were associated with engagement in HIV-related sexual
   risk behavior for YTW and whether these associations varied by
   racial/ethnic identity or age.
   Methods: Baseline data from the SHINE study (n = 300) at San Francisco
   Department of Public Health (2012-2014) were analyzed. Multivariable
   Poisson binomial regression models characterized relationships between
   parent/caregiver responses to gender identity and HIV-related sexual
   risk behaviors, adjusting for select participant demographics.
   Statistically significant interactions (by race/ethnicity or age) were
   plotted using marginal predicted probabilities of sexual risk behaviors.
   Results: Thirty-seven percent of YTW engaged in any condomless anal
   intercourse; 12\% reported income from sex work in the last month. Ever
   moving away from family and friends because of gender identity was
   associated with condomless anal intercourse (adjusted prevalence ratio
   {[}PR] = 1.44, 95\% confidence interval {[}CI] =1.08-1.92, p =.01) and
   sex work (PR =2.07, 95\% CI = 1.14-3.75, p =.02). Ever receiving poor
   treatment from parents/caregivers because of gender identity was
   associated with sex work (PR = 3.47, 95\% CI = 1.52-7.95, p < .01).
   Greater parent/caregiver acceptance of gender identity was associated
   with lower adjusted prevalence of condomless anal intercourse for
   Hispanic/Latinx YTW.
   Conclusions: Negative parent/caregiver exposures related to YTW's gender
   identities were associated with increased HIV-related sexual risk
   behaviors, whereas parent/caregiver acceptance of gender identity was
   protective against condomless anal intercourse for Hispanic/Latinx YTW.
   There is a need for additional studies that inform interventions for YTW
   focusing on parent/caregiver relationships to prevent HIV-related risk
   behavior. Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of Society for Adolescent

Abstract = {{This paper presents a dual metal trapezoidal recessed channel metal
   oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET) embedded with
   asymmetric stack gate with linearly graded metal work-function technique
   to improve the carrier transport efficiency and device switching
   performance. The analytical model for the proposed asymmetric-linearly
   graded trapezoidal gate (ASY-LGTG) silicon on insulator (SOI) MOSFET has
   been developed considering parabolic approximation of 2-D Poisson's
   equation. The threshold voltage of the device is extracted using minimum
   surface potential. The simulation work has been carried out using a
   Silvaco TCAD tool to validate the results of the analytical model. This
   grooved structure exhibits the corner effect, which plays a dynamic role
   in the improvement of the device performance. However, the impact of the
   corner effect can be controlled by the groove corner angle and doping
   concentration. We have also investigated the impact of different
   structural parameters such as negative junction depth (NJD), corner
   angle, substrate doping and stack gate features (upper oxide
   permittivity and oxide thickness ratio) on the performance of minimum
   surface potential, sub-threshold slope (SS), drain induced barrier
   lowering (DIBL), threshold voltage and device switching characteristics.}},

Journal = {{ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{131}},
Pages = {{112-121}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Poisson and negative binomial regression models are fundamental
   statistical analysis tools for traffic safety evaluation. The regression
   parameter estimation could suffer from the finite sample bias when event
   frequency is low, which is commonly observed in safety research as
   crashes are rare events. In this study, we apply a bias-correction
   procedure to the parameter estimation of Poisson and NB regression
   models. We provide a general bias-correction formulation and illustrate
   the finite sample bias through a special scenario with a single binary
   explanatory variable. Several factors affecting the magnitude of bias
   are identified, including the number of crashes and the balance of the
   crash counts within strata of a categorical explanatory variable.
   Simulations are conducted to examine the properties of the
   bias-corrected coefficient estimators. The results show that the
   bias-corrected estimators generally provide less bias and smaller
   variance. The effect is especially pronounced when the crash count in
   one stratum is between 5 and 50. We apply the proposed method to a case
   study of infrastructure safety evaluation. Three scenarios were
   evaluated, all crashes collected in three years, and two hypothetical
   situations, where crash information was collected for ``half-year{''}
   and ``quarter-year{''} periods. The case-study results confirm that the
   magnitude of bias correction is larger for smaller crash counts. This
   paper demonstrates the finite sample bias associated with the small
   number of crashes and suggests bias adjustment can provide more accurate
   estimation when evaluating the impacts of crash risk factors.}},

Abstract = {{The current work suggests a mathematical model for the dynamic response
   of sandwich plates subjected to a blast load using a numerical method.
   The sandwich structure is made from an auxetic honeycomb core layer
   integrated by multiphase nanocomposite facesheets. The facesheets are
   composed of polymer-carbon nanotube (CNT)-fiber where the equivalent
   material properties of the multiphase nanocomposite layers are obtained
   using fiber micromechanics and Halpin-Tsai equations in hierarchy. The
   top and bottom layers are subjected to magnetic field and the material
   properties of them are assumed temperature and moisture dependent. The
   Kelvin-Voigt model is employed to consider the viscoelastic properties
   of the structure. The sandwich structure is rested on a viscoelastic
   foundation which is modeled by orthotropic visco-Pasternak medium. Based
   on refined zigzag theory (RZT), energy method and Hamilton's principle,
   the motion equations are derived. A new numerical method, namely
   differential cubature method (DCM) in conjunction with Newmark method is
   utilized for obtaining the dynamic deflection of the structure for
   different boundary conditions. The effects of various parameters such as
   blast load, viscoelastic foundation, structural damping, magnetic field,
   volume fraction of CNTs, temperature and moisture changes, geometrical
   parameters of honeycomb layer and sandwich plate are considered on the
   dynamic deflection of the structure. The results show that the magnetic
   field to the facesheets can be considered as effective parameters to
   control the dynamic deflection. In addition, hygrothermal condition
   leads to increase of 24\% in the dynamic displacement of system.}},

Abstract = {{Crumpled thin foils as exemplified by crumpled paper balls are complex
   fractal structures that belong to the class of auxetic materials, i.e.
   materials with negative Poisson coefficient. Here we report evidence
   that the unpacking of a crumpled surface is controlled asymptotically by
   a strain-strain relation similar in form to the Richardson scaling which
   describes the diffusion of particles in a turbulent fluid. This
   relationship was found using several photographs that recorded the
   expansion of the transverse deformation of the crumpled paper balls.
   Through an image analysis program we show that the average transversal
   expansion Delta(sigma) over bar - (or the maximum transverse distance
   Delta sigma') exhibits an asymptotic power law scaling with the pull
   strain Delta x. The analysis of the photographs of transverse dilatation
   also showed some aspects similar to those found in Levy's walking
   statistics.}},

Abstract = {{Using density functional theory (DFT), a designed isoelectronic
   counterpart of phosphorene, black-phosphorusanalogous monolayer CSe
   (alpha-CSe) was confirmed to be stable. alpha-CSe displays apparently
   anisotropic behaviors of in-plane mechanics through calculating ideal
   tensile strength and critical strain, which thus causes anisotropic
   response to in-plane strains in its electronic and transport properties.
   It was found that the monolayer alpha-CSe can endure an ultimate stress
   of 4.008 N/m along armchair direction at epsilon(x) = 0.28, and 10.96
   N/m along zigzag direction at epsilon(y) = 0.22. Intriguingly, the
   strain praxis of alpha-CSe under zigzag deformation highlights a
   negative out-of-plane Poisson's ratio of - 0.76 rooted in its puckered
   structure. Direct-to-indirect bandgap transitions and reverse
   transitions occurred alternatively under uniaxial and biaxial strains,
   which in essence issued in drastic variation of effective mass in
   k-place. Thus, the prior transport direction of carriers can be feasibly
   tuned by imposing biaxial strain. However, the preferred armchair
   transport direction is irrespective of strain size and present good
   mechanical stability, under the uniaxial strain. The anisotropic
   Dirac-like dispersions in alpha-CSe were identified at appropriate
   strain value, which unveiled the ballistic conduction along Gamma-Y. Our
   numerical results offered meritorious information of puckered sheets by
   insight into alpha-CSe, and revealed the prospects of alpha-CSe in
   nano-devices applications.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED MATHEMATICAL MODELLING}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{74}},
Pages = {{320-336}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{In this study, the responsive-behavior of auxetic and non-auxetic
   polymer gels to mechanical loads is modeled. The elastic deformation
   patterns of gels with different structural and mechanical properties are
   depicted. The first strain gradient theory is employed to model the
   random structure of crosslinked polymer gels. The applicability of the
   first strain gradient theory to model the mechanics of polymer gels is
   demonstrated. The equations governing the elastostatic equilibrium of
   polymer gels under finite strain gradient and infinitesimal strain
   gradient regimes are derived depending on the strain and its first-order
   gradient. An analytical solution for the plane strain deformation is
   derived. This solution is harnessed to investigate effects of Poisson's
   ratio and the strain gradient on the plane strain deformation of auxetic
   and non-auxetic polymer gels. The results revealed that Poisson's ratio
   and the micro-strain field significantly influence the elastic
   extensibility and elastic compressibility of polymer gels. Depending on
   its Poisson's ratio and the nature of its microstructure, a polymer gel
   may exhibit homogeneous/inhomogeneous deformation, and its rigidity may
   be enhanced/degraded. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Hardness and fracture toughness are some of the most important

   the elastic properties to calculate the hardness and fracture toughness.
   Its accuracy is checked by comparison with other available models and

   metallic glasses. We found the model to perform well on all datasets for
   both hardness and fracture toughness, while for auxetic materials (i.e.,

Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a pseudo-rigid body model is proposed for the analysis of
   a spatial mechanical metamaterial and its application is demonstrated.
   Using this model, the post-buckling behavior of the mechanical
   metamaterial can be determined without the need to consider the whole
   elastic structure, e.g., using finite-element procedures. This is done
   by analyzing a porous cylindrical mechanical metamaterial using a rigid
   body mechanism, consisting of rigid squares that are connected at their
   corners. Stiffness in this model comes from torsion springs placed at
   the connections between rigid parts. The theory of the model is
   presented and the results of two versions of this model are compared
   through experiments. One version describes the metamaterial in the free
   state, while the other, more extended, version includes clamped
   boundaries, matching the conditions of the experimental set-up. It is
   shown that the mechanical behavior of the spatial metamaterial is
   captured by the models and that the shape of the metamaterial in the
   deformed state can be obtained from the more extended model.}},

Volume = {{90}},

Abstract = {{Negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) material with unique geometry is rare in
   nature and has an auxetic response under strain in a specific direction.
   With this unique property, this type of material is significantly
   promising in many specific application fields. The curling structure
   commonly exists in knitted products due to the unbalanced force inside a
   knit loop. Thus, knitted fabric is an ideal candidate to mimic natural
   NPR materials, since it possesses such an inherent curly configuration
   and the flexibility to design and process. In this work, a weft-knitted
   Miura-ori fold (WMF) fabric was produced that creates a self-folding
   three-dimensional structure with NPR performance. Also, a finite element
   analysis model was developed to simulate the structural auxetic response
   to understand the deformation mechanism of hierarchical thread-based
   auxetic fabrics. The simulated strain-force curves of four WMF fabrics
   quantitatively agree with our experimental results. The auxetic
   morphologies, Poisson's ratio and damping capacity were discussed,
   revealing the deformation mechanism of the WMF fabrics. This study thus
   provides a fundamental framework for mechanical-stimulating textiles.
   The developed NPR knitted fabrics have a high potential to be employed
   in areas of tissue engineering, such as artificial blood vessels and
   artificial folding mucosa.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{14}},

Month = {{SEP 20}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Little is known about outpatient health services use following critical
   illness and intensive care. We examined the association of intensive
   care with outpatient consultations and quality of life in a
   population-based sample.
   Methods
   Cross-sectional analysis of data from 6,686 participants of the Study of
   Health in Pomerania (SHIP), which consists of two independent
   population-based cohorts. Statistical modeling was done using Poisson
   regression, negative binomial and generalized linear models for
   consultations, and a fractional response model for quality of life
   (EQ-5D-3L index value), with results expressed as prevalence ratios (PR)
   or percent change (PC). Entropy balancing was used to adjust for
   observed confounding.
   Results
   ICU treatment in the previous year was reported by 139 of 6,686 (2,1\%)
   participants, and was associated with a higher probability (PR 1.05
   {[}CI:1.03;1.07]), number (PC +58.0\% {[}CI:22.8;103.2]) and costs (PC
   +64.1\% {[}CI:32.0;103.9]) of annual outpatient consultations, as well
   as with a higher number of medications (PC +37.8\% {[}CI:17.7;61.5]).
   Participants with ICU treatment were more likely to visit a specialist
   (PR 1.13 {[}CI:1.09; 1.16]), specifically internal medicine (PR 1.67
   {[}CI:1.45;1.92]), surgery (PR 2.42 {[}CI:1.92;3.05]), psychiatry (PR
   2.25 {[}CI:1.30;3.90]), and orthopedics (PR 1.54 {[}CI:1.11;2.14]).
   There was no significant effect regarding general practitioner
   consultations. ICU treatment was also associated with lower
   health-related quality of life (EQ-5D index value: PC -13.7\%
   {[}CI:-27.0;-0.3]). Furthermore, quality of life was inversely
   associated with outpatient consultations in the previous month, more so
   for participants with ICU treatment.
   Conclusions
   Our findings suggest that ICU treatment is associated with an increased
   utilization of outpatient specialist services, higher medication intake,
   and impaired quality of life.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates analytical solutions stresses and displacements
   of the functionally graded cylindrically curved beam subjected to the
   thermal load in the radial direction. The ends of this curved FGM beam
   is supposed to be guided in such a way that a displacement in
   circumferential direction may occur and that the radius of the middle
   surface remains unchanged. Then, couples act on those ends, giving rise
   to pure bending condition. It is assumed that the temperature
   distribution varies as a function of the radial coordinate and is in
   steady state. The modulus of elasticity varies with the power law
   through of the thickness of the curved FGM beam. Accordingly, by
   applying the general mixture law, the thermal expansion, the heat
   transfer coefficient and the volume fraction varies depending on the
   power law (except Poisson ratio). The curved FGM beam is assumed to be
   in plane stress state. Using the von Mises yield criterion, the effects
   of the values of power law index on the displacement and stresses of the
   curved beam is discussed. The inner surface of the curved FGM beam is
   steel and its outer surface is aluminum. At positive and negative
   temperatures, the effects of the yielding on the curved beam are
   investigated. It is observed that the starting of the plastic yielding
   is on the outer surface, inner surface and at the simultaneously on both
   surfaces. Communicated by Eleonora Tubaldi.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},

Abstract = {{Often wetting is considered from the perspective of a single surface of
   a rigid substrate and its topographical properties such as roughness or
   texture. However, many substrates, such as membranes and meshes, have
   two useful surfaces. Such flexible substrates also offer the potential
   to be formed into structures with either a double-sided surface (e.g. by
   joining the ends of a mesh as a tape) or a single-sided surface (e.g. by
   ends with a half-twist). When a substrate possesses holes, it is also
   possible to consider how the spaces in the substrate may be connected or
   disconnected. This combination of flexibility, holes and connectedness
   can therefore be used to introduce topological concepts, which are
   distinct from simple topography. Here, we present a method to create a
   Slippery Liquid-Infused Porous Surface (SLIPS) coating on flexible
   conformable doubled-sided meshes and for coating complex geometries. By
   considering the flexibility and connectedness of a mesh with the surface
   properties of SLIPS, we show it is possible to create double-sided SLIPS
   materials with high droplet mobility and droplet control on both faces.
   We also exemplify the importance of flexibility using a mesh-based SLIPS
   pipe capable of withstanding laminar and turbulent flows for 180 and 90
   minutes, respectively. Finally, we discuss how ideas of topology
   introduced by the SLIPS mesh might be extended to create completely new
   types of SLIPS systems, such as Mobius strips and auxetic metamaterials.}},

Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{177}},

Abstract = {{Thin-walled metamaterials based on triply periodic surfaces are
   relatively simple, light-weight structures that, as shown in the
   following, possess extraordinary material properties. As opposed to
   their filled counterparts, these structures can be tuned to be
   elastically isotropic and isotropically auxetic- the latter is the
   material property of extending in all directions under tensile loading
   in one direction. Considering level surfaces topologically equivalent to
   the triply periodic minimal surfaces of types Primitive, Diamond, Gyroid
   and I-WP, we focus on stiffness, symmetry, auxeticity, Cauchy pressure
   and proximity to Born mechanical instability. Our findings show that
   core-shell structures respond drastically differently not only in their
   stiffness but also for each of these observed properties compared to
   their counterparts with complete filling. Only core-shell topology makes
   elastic isotropy possible. Diamond core-shell structures are the only
   ones which show negative Cauchy pressure p(c) < 0. Most notably, for the
   Diamond core-shell structures we observe an auxetic behavior spanning
   over the whole range from non-auxetic to isotropically auxetic. For the
   structures possessing auxeticity, negativity in the Poisson's ratio is
   retained for a wide deformation range spanning from small-strain tension
   to large-strain compression. (C) 2019 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by

Title = {{Shape optimization of bowtie-shaped auxetic structures using beam theory}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{224}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic structures with a negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) are known for
   their novel mechanical properties. Recent studies have shown that these
   properties can be tailored using numerical simulations based on the
   finite element method where plane or solid elements are applied,
   combined with optimization techniques. However, an optimization
   procedure based on beam theory, which is expected to be more
   computationally efficient than the prevalent plane or solid element
   formulations, has not been developed thus far. In this paper, we propose
   a nonlinear beam theory-based model discretized by the Ritz method for
   the optimum design of bowtie-shaped auxetic structures. For a systematic
   design process, effective stiffness, NPR, maximum stress, and volume are
   defined as the main performance indices. Two design parameters, namely,
   the initial shape of the centerline and the thickness profile
   represented by B-spline curves, are used to maximize the performance of
   the system. Our study confirmed that auxetic structures can be tailored
   to yield a minimum value of the NPR, stress, and volume without the loss
   of effective stiffness. 3D-printed prototypes were tested to verify the
   accuracy of the proposed model and the optimality of the design.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. Frequent or severe headaches are associated with school
   absenteeism and functional limitation in children, but trends in
   headache prevalence are uncertain. We used nationally representative
   data to describe trends in pediatric headache prevalence in the United
   States, and to evaluate whether headache has remained consistently
   associated with functional limitations among school-age children.
   Methods. We analyzed data on children age 5 to 17 years in the 2007 to
   2015 National Health Interview Surveys. Caregivers reported whether each
   child experienced frequent or severe headache in the past 12 months.
   Weighted proportions and multivariable regression were used to estimate
   headache prevalence over the study period and associations between
   headache and measures of functional limitation. Results. The analysis
   included 57 272 children (mean age = 11 years; 52\% female). Frequent or
   severe headache was reported for 6\% of children, with no discernable
   trend over the study period. On multivariable Poisson regression,
   headache became more strongly associated with school absenteeism over
   time. In 2007, frequent or severe headache was associated with a 70\%
   increase in the number of missed school days (incidence risk ratio
   {[}IRR] = 1.70; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI] = 1.50-1.91; P < .001),
   whereas by 2015, headache was associated with a 139\% increase in the
   number of missed school days (IRR = 2.39; 95\% CI = 2.02-2.83; P <
   .001). Conclusion. Though the prevalence of frequent or severe headache
   in school-age children did not change in 2007 to 2015, headache became
   more strongly associated with school absenteeism, highlighting the need
   for improved management of patients with headaches to prevent negative
   impact on school performance and functional status.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials, known with negative Poisson's ratio, are highly
   desirable for many advanced applications, but the candidates are rather
   scarce, especially at low dimension. Motivated by the re-entrant

   two-dimensional (2D) planar B4N monolayer as a promising auxetic
   material with unusual in-plane negative Poisson's ratio within the
   framework of density functional theory calculations. B4N monolayer also
   exhibits a highly emerged mechanical anisotropy, characterized by
   Young's modulus and Poissons ratio. In addition, this monolayer shows
   superior mechanical flexibility in ideal tensile strength and critical
   strain values. The phonon dispersion calculations and ab initio
   molecular dynamics simulations further demonstrate that this monolayer
   also owns excellent dynamical and thermal stabilities. The fantastic
   mechanical properties coupled with robust structural stability render
   the auxetic B4N monolayer promising for future nanomechanical devices.}},

   structure forms. The auxeticity of highly porous volcanic rocks such as
   pumice and reticulite will be suppressed by infiltration of water into
   the rocks. Hence, volcanic rocks cannot be auxetic in nature if their
   vesicles are filled with water. Under the laboratory conditions,
   however, a transition from conventional to auxetic behaviors in pumice
   and reticulite is expected to occur by changing the degree of water
   saturation. These results provide a set of basic parameters for the
   modeling of ground deformation and temporal and spatial variations in
   V-p, V-s, V-p/V-s ratio as precursors of volcanic eruption or volcanic
   edifice collapse.}},

Abstract = {{Exploring novel two-dimensional multifunctional materials with
   distinguished properties lies at the core of materials innovation. Here,
   we identify a hitherto-neglected single-layer PtI2, which can readily be
   exfoliated from its bulk experimentally, with appealing multifunctional
   properties through first-principles calculations. Single-layer PtI2 is
   an indirect-gap semiconductor with a band gap of 2.56 eV, and its band
   gap is extremely robust against external strain. We find that it is a
   promising two-dimensional photocatalyst, exhibiting outstanding
   catalytic performances toward oxygen evolution reactions, with the water
   oxidation reaction occurring spontaneously under light irradiation.
   Moreover, we unveil that single-layer PtI2 is a long-sought auxetic
   material with a negative Poisson's ratio of -0.54, arising from its
   particular puckered hinge crystal. Our findings highlight single-layer
   PtI2 as a promising multifunctional material for nanoscale mechanical
   and photocatalytic applications.}},

Abstract = {{This article concludes some of the important observation regarding
   quasi-static and dynamic crushing response of honeycomb structure
   carried out by authors and addressed in the literature. The behaviour of
   honeycomb structure has been reported through experimentation,
   mathematical and numerical models. The influence of cell wall thickness,
   node length, cell size and loading has been studied in detail leading to
   some important findings which have not been addressed earlier. The
   crushing responses of honeycomb structure have been studied in both
   out-of-plane and in-plane loading condition. Moreover, its bending
   behaviour has also been reported in few studies. Geometrical core
   configuration and geometric property like cell size, cell wall thickness
   and node length etc. play a defining role in administrating potential of
   honeycomb. Relative density was a vital property of honeycomb dependent
   on cell configuration and geometric properties. Facesheet material and
   thickness majorly effects the energy absorption capability of the core
   during dynamic projectile and impulsive impacts.}},

   three different weft knitted fabrics have auxetic effect. The Poisson's
   ratio values of the three fabrics are inversely proportional to knit
   loop lengths. However, differences exist between the curves of Poisson's
   ratio relative to strain. With regards to the rotational and
   double-headed arrow topological structures, the curves tend to be
   monotonic, whilst that of the foldable structure takes the form of a
   parabola. This research thus confirms the possibility of producing

Abstract = {{In the past decades, various novel functions (i.e., negative Poisson's
   ratio, zero thermal expansion) have been obtained by tailoring the
   microstructures of the cellular structures. Among all the
   microstructures, the horseshoe topology shows a J-shaped stress-strain
   curve, which is quite different from the conventional materials. It can
   be inferred that the 2D lattice structure with horseshoe microstructure
   will also exhibit excellent out-of-plane impact resistance since the
   spider silk also exhibits the J-shaped stress-strain curve. In this
   paper, the out-of-plane sphere impact of 2D truss lattice structure is
   conducted using finite element method (FEM) simulation. The point has
   been made that, by replacing the direct-line beam to horseshoe curved
   beam, the out-of-plane impact resistance has been greatly improved. The
   most curved beam structure is found to have the best out-of-plane
   performs with the maximum energy absorption and the minimum passing
   through velocity.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To examine the impact of caesarean section on breastfeeding
   indicators-early initiation of breastfeeding, exclusive breastfeeding
   under 6 months and children ever breastfed (at least once)-in
   sub-Saharan Africa.
   Design Secondary analysis of Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS).
   Setting Thirty-three low-income and middle-income countries with a
   survey conducted between 2010 and 2017/2018.
   Participants Women aged 15-49 years with a singleton live last birth
   during the 2 years preceding the survey.
   Main outcome measures We analysed the DHS data to examine the impact of
   caesarean section on breastfeeding indicators using the modified Poisson
   regression models for each country adjusted for potential confounders.
   For each breastfeeding indicator, the within-country adjusted prevalence
   ratios (aPR) were pooled in random-effects meta-analysis.
   Results The within-country analyses showed, compared with vaginal birth,
   caesarean section was associated with aPR for early initiation of
   breastfeeding that ranged from 0.24 (95\% CI 0.17 to 0.33) in Tanzania
   to 0.89 (95\% CI 0.78 to 1.00) in South Africa. The aPR for exclusive
   breastfeeding under 6 months ranged from 0.58 (95\% CI 0.34 to 0.98) in
   Angola to 1.93 (95\% CI 0.46 to 8.10) in Cote d'Ivoire, while the aPR
   for children ever breastfed ranged from 0.91 (95\% CI 0.82 to 1.02) in
   Gabon to 1.02 (95\% CI 0.99 to 1.04) in Gambia. The meta-analysis showed
   caesarean section was associated with a 46\% lower prevalence of early
   initiation of breastfeeding (pooled aPR, 0.54 (95\% CI 0.48 to 0.60)).
   However, meta-analysis indicated little association with exclusive
   breastfeeding under 6 months (pooled aPR, 0.94 (95\% CI 0.88 to 1.01))
   and children ever breastfed (pooled aPR, 0.98 (95\% CI 0.98 to 0.99))
   among caesarean versus vaginally born children.
   Conclusions Caesarean section had a negative influence on early
   initiation of breastfeeding but showed little difference in exclusive
   breastfeeding under 6 months and children ever breastfed in sub-Saharan
   Africa.}},

Abstract = {{Objective There is an urgent need to understand high HIV-infection rates
   among young women in sub-Saharan Africa. While age-disparate
   partnerships have been characterised with high-risk sexual behaviours,
   the mechanisms through which these partnerships may increase HIV-risk
   are not fully understood. This study assessed the association between
   age-disparate partnerships and herpes simplex virus type-2 (HSV-2)
   infection, a factor known to increase HIV-infection risk.
   Methods Cross-sectional face-to-face questionnaire data, and laboratory
   HSV-2 and HIV antibody data were collected among a representative sample
   in the 2014/2015 household survey of the HIV Incidence Provincial
   Surveillance System in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Among 15-24-year-old
   women who reported having ever had sex (n=1550), the association between
   age-disparate partnerships (ie, male partner >= 5 years older) and HSV-2
   antibody status was assessed using multivariable Poisson regression
   models with robust variance. Analyses were repeated among HIV-negative
   women.
   Results HSV-2 prevalence was 55\% among 15-24-year-old women. Women who
   reported an age-disparate partnership with their most recent partner
   were more likely to test HSV-2 positive compared with women with
   age-similar partners (64\% vs 51\%; adjusted prevalence ratio (aPR):1.19
   (95\% CI 1.07 to 1.32, p<0.01)). HSV-2 prevalence was also significantly
   higher among HIV-negative women who reported age-disparate partnerships
   (51\% vs 40 \%; aPR:1.25 (95\% CI 1.05 to 1.50, p=0.014)).
   Conclusions Results indicate that age-disparate partnerships are
   associated with a greater risk of HSV-2 among young women. These
   findings point towards an additional mechanism through which
   age-disparate partnerships could increase HIV-infection risk.
   Importantly, by increasing the HSV-2 risk, age-disparate partnerships
   have the potential to increase the HIV-infection risk within subsequent
   partnerships, regardless of the partner age-difference in those
   relationships.}},

Abstract = {{Negative Poisson's ratio or auxetic foams were fabricated and studied
   for use in prosthetic applications. A thermomechanical process was used
   to convert conventional polyurethane (PU) foam into auxetic PU foam. Two
   types of auxetic PU foams were made using two different volumetric
   compression ratios, 3.02 and 3.86. Chemical composition analysis showed
   that chemical structure of the converted auxetic foam remained the same
   as the conventional PU foam after the thermomechanical process.
   Compression tests showed that the auxetic foams had higher stiffness
   than conventional foams, implying that the auxetic foams could be
   potentially used in seat cushions, shoe soles, and as liners in
   prosthetic applications. Compression fatigue tests showed that
   percentage loss in thickness in auxetic foam fabricated using lower
   compression ratio had loss in thickness that is comparable to
   conventional foam, whereas auxetic foam fabricated using higher
   compression ratio had greater loss in thickness. Our study indicates
   that the auxetic foams made using lower compression ratio need to be
   further explored for suitability in various rehabilitation applications.}},

Title = {{Integrating preexposure prophylaxis delivery in routine family planning
   clinics: A feasibility programmatic evaluation in Kenya}},
Journal = {{PLOS MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{16}},

Abstract = {{Author summaryWhy was this study done? Adolescent girls and young women
   (AGYW) in Africa are disproportionately affected by HIV infections
   because of cultural, structural, biological, and behavior factors.
   Preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP), as a highly potent and recommended
   discreet user-controlled HIV prevention strategy, has the potential to
   substantially reduce new HIV infections in African women if delivered
   with high coverage and if used with sufficient adherence. However, data
   are limited on ``real-world{''} implementation approaches to efficiently
   reach at-risk women who may benefit from PrEP. Family planning (FP)
   clinics provide care to young women at risk for acquiring HIV and have
   in-built staffing, supply chain, and HIV testing access, which could
   contribute to more efficient PrEP implementation with less cost, but no
   study has evaluated this model in ``real-world{''} settings. What did
   the researchers do and find? We conducted a pilot open-label,
   ``real-world{''} implementation program to evaluate the feasibility of
   integrating PrEP delivery into routine FP clinics to reach HIV at-risk
   young women. General-population women accessing FP services were
   universally screened for HIV behavior risk factors and were counseled
   for PrEP by program-dedicated nurses embedded in 8 public health FP
   clinics in a high-HIV-prevalence region in Kenya. We found that FP
   clinics can be an effective platform to efficiently reach HIV at-risk
   women who may benefit from PrEP. PrEP screening was feasible, and 22\%
   of the general population of women took PrEP home. There was a high
   drop-off in early PrEP continuation (41\% PrEP continuation at 1 month)
   particularly among AGYW <24 years old, but a subset of women persisted
   on PrEP (25\% at month 3 and 15\% at month 6), with higher continuation
   among women with HIV-positive partners, possibly indicating further
   reflection or decision-making on PrEP use. Women's perceived risk for
   HIV, including having an HIV-positive partner, was an important driver
   of initiation and continuation on PrEP. What do these findings mean? To
   our knowledge, this project provides the first demonstration of
   ``real-world{''} delivery of PrEP for at-risk AGYW integrated into FP
   clinics in Africa, a priority population for HIV prevention. These
   findings demonstrate that it may be feasible to integrate PrEP delivery
   in public health FP clinics, making this a platform potential
   ``one-stop{''} location for FP and PrEP. With expanding PrEP awareness,
   uptake and continuation are likely to increase among women at risk.
   Evidence from this work will inform next steps for wider delivery of
   PrEP and next-generation PrEP formulations (e.g., multipurpose HIV
   prevention and contraception technologies) in FP clinics, not only in
   Kenya but in other resource-limited settings globally.
   Background Young women account for a disproportionate fraction of new
   HIV infections in Africa and are a priority population for HIV
   prevention, including implementation of preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP).
   The overarching goal of this project was to demonstrate the feasibility
   of integrating PrEP delivery within routine family planning (FP) clinics
   to serve as a platform to efficiently reach at-risk adolescent girls and
   young women (AGYW) for PrEP in HIV high-burden settings. Methods and
   findings The PrEP Implementation in Young Women and Adolescents (PrIYA)
   program is a real-world implementation program to demonstrate
   integration of PrEP delivery for at-risk AGYW in FP clinics in Kisumu,
   Kenya. Between November 2017 and June 2018, women aged 15 to 45 from the
   general population seeking FP services at 8 public health clinics were
   universally screened for HIV behavioral risk factors and offered PrEP
   following national PrEP guidelines. We evaluated PrEP uptake and
   continuation, and robust Poisson regression methods were used to
   identify correlates of uptake and early continuation of PrEP, with age
   included as a one-knot linear spline. Overall, 1,271 HIV-uninfected
   women accessing routine FP clinics were screened for PrEP; the median
   age was 25 years (interquartile range {[}IQR]: 22-29), 627 (49\%) were
   <24 years old, 1,026 (82\%) were married, more than one-third (34\%) had
   partners of unknown HIV status, and the vast majority (n = 1,200
   {[}94\%]) reported recent condom-less sex. Of 1,271 women screened, 278
   (22\%) initiated PrEP, and 114 (41\%) returned for at least one refill
   visit after initiation. PrEP uptake was independently associated with
   reported male-partner HIV status (HIV-positive 94\%, unknown 35\%,
   HIV-negative 8\%; p < 0.001) and marital status (28\% unmarried versus
   married 21\%; p = 0.04), and a higher proportion of women >= 24 years
   (26\%; 191/740) initiated PrEP compared to 16\% (87/531) of young women
   <24 years (p < 0.001). There was a moderate and statistically
   non-significant unadjusted increase in PrEP uptake among women using
   oral contraception pills (OCPs) compared to women using injectable or
   long-acting reversible contraception methods (OCP 28\% versus
   injectable/implants/intrauterine devices {[}IUDs] 18\%; p = 0.06). Among
   women with at least one post-PrEP initiation follow-up visit (n = 278),
   no HIV infection was documented during the project period. Overall,
   continuation of PrEP use at 1, 3, and 6 months post initiation was 41\%,
   24\%, and 15\%, respectively. The likelihood for early continuation of
   PrEP use (i.e., return for at least one PrEP refill within 45 days post
   initiation) was strongly associated with reported male-partner HIV
   status (HIV-positive 67\%, -negative 39\%, unknown 31\%; overall effect
   p = 0.001), and a higher proportion of women >= 24 years old continued
   PrEP at 1 month compared with young women <24 years old (47\% versus
   29\%; p = 0.002). For women >= 24 years old, the likelihood to continue
   PrEP use at 1 month post initiation increased by 3\% for each additional
   year of a woman's age (adjusted prevalence ratio {[}PR]: 1.03; 95\%
   confidence interval {[}CI]: 1.01-1.05; p = 0.01). In contrast, for women
   <24 years old, the likelihood of continuing PrEP for each additional
   year of a woman's age was high in magnitude (approximately 6\%) but
   statistically non-significant (adjusted PR: 1.06; 95\% CI: 0.97-1.16; p
   = 0.18). Frequently reported reasons for discontinuing PrEP were low
   perceived risk of HIV (25\%), knowledge that partner was HIV negative
   (24\%), experiencing side effects (20\%), and pill burden (17\%).
   Study limitations include lack of qualitative work to provide insights
   into women's decision-making on PrEP uptake and continuation, the small
   number of measured covariates imposed by the program data, and a
   nonrandomized design limiting definitive ascertainment of the robustness
   of a PrEP-dedicated nurse-led implementation strategy. Conclusions In
   this real-world PrEP implementation program in Kenya, integration of
   universal screening and counseling for PrEP in FP clinics was feasible,
   making this platform a potential ``one-stop{''} location for FP and
   PrEP. There was a high drop-off in PrEP continuation, but a subset of
   women continued PrEP use at least through 1 month, possibly indicating
   further reflection or decision-making on PrEP use. Greater efforts to
   support PrEP normalization and persistence for African women are needed
   to help women navigate their decisions about HIV prevention preferences
   as their reproductive goals and HIV vulnerability evolve.}},

Abstract = {{The paper investigates the in-plane elastic wave propagation in
   hierarchical lattices. The hierarchical organization is obtained by
   removing a certain amount of cells successively from a general hexagonal
   lattice that involves the re-entrant configuration with negative
   Poisson's ratio. The symmetry reduction caused by the alteration of the
   internal angle and the formed vertexes with stacking hexagons gives rise
   to a significant effect on the dispersion properties of the structure
   materials. Results show that the lattices with different hierarchy
   levels possess a stable behavior of the band gap in the position near
   the resonant frequency of the cell walls, and the gap width has an
   evident increase in the re-entrant hierarchical structures. In addition,
   band structure in the low frequency range has an unchanged performance
   for the varying parameters of cell walls, and the reason is owing to the
   steady of the structure vibration pattern for the Bloch modes. The
   authors' findings of the dispersion behaviors in the hierarchical
   lattices provide a broad design space for the lightweight materials in
   the wave manipulation and vibration control.}},

Abstract = {{How can we modulate the inherent Poisson's ratio value of soft

   ratio of isotropic materials can be defined from -1 to 0.5 but
   elastomers generally take the Poisson's ratio of 0.5. Herein, we
   introduce and establish the concept of a mechanical meta elastomer
   called ``auxetic elastomer{''}. This is a continuum-solid elastomer
   having unique programmable elastic properties of Poisson's ratio that
   are beyond their conventional ranges, and include in-plane negative and
   out-of-plane high positive Poisson's ratios. Leveraging these unique
   deformation characteristics, we applied auxetic elastomers as a soft
   dielectric material for a highly stretchable capacitive-type strain
   sensor that overcomes the inherent performance limitations in terms of

Volume = {{59}},

Abstract = {{Polymeric foams are used for impact protection due to their ability to
   absorb large amounts of strain energy. In this work, the compressive
   response of an open cell polyurethane foam currently used as liner in
   the advanced combat helmet is examined across strain rates. A
   traditional load frame is used to investigate the quasi-static behavior,
   and two different modifications of a conventional Kolsky
   (split-Hopkinson) bar configuration are used to probe the dynamic
   response. A unique, independent method not relying on strain gage
   signals is presented that leverages high-speed full-field imaging to
   track the velocity on each side of the sample-bar interface and used to
   extract the dynamic stress-strain response; the results are compared
   against traditional strain gage measurements. X-ray tomography is used
   to examine the global morphological characteristics of the foam. The
   foam is found to be strongly rate dependent, where the characteristic
   properties vary logarithmically with strain rate. An analytical
   expression is presented to describe the rate dependency that collapses
   all stress-strain curves on a master curve. Full-field kinematic data
   from digital image correlation taken during loading is used to extract a
   nonlinear Poisson's ratio as a function of strain, which is found to be
   strain rate insensitive. A tangent Poisson function is used to explore
   the foam's auxetic behavior. These findings provide insight on
   physically-based constitutive modeling of foams, crucial to predictive
   brain injury simulations, as well as motivate the need to probe local
   heterogenous behavior across strain rates moving forward.}},

Title = {{Mechanical modeling of an auxetic tubular braided structure:
   Experimental and numerical analyses}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES}},

Abstract = {{An auxetic braided structure was developed in our previous work for
   overcoming the slippage problem encountered in the double-helix yarn.
   However, the influences of the micro-geometric parameters on the
   macroscopic behavior, which are significant for the structure's design
   and application, have not been addressed yet. By using a standard
   tubular braiding technology, several samples of the auxetic braided
   structure were fabricated in this work and the design concept and
   manufacture process were described in detail. Then, systematic
   parameters studies were completed through experimentally validated
   finite element models. The study showed that the braided structure could
   achieve a robust auxetic behavior and its Poisson's ratio and stiffness
   were strongly dependent on their initial micro-geometric parameters,
   especially initial braiding angle and diameter of component yarns. A
   maximum negative Poisson's ratio of -9.49 could be achieved by lowering
   the angle value to 15 degrees. Higher negative Poisson's ratio effect
   could be obtained with grosser stiff yarn and finer elastic yarns.
   However, the existence of the elastic wraps would diminish the
   auxeticity of the braided structure, which should be taken into
   consideration in design and application.}},

Abstract = {{In the process of coalbed methane (CBM) mining, with the decreasing of
   reservoir pressure, stress sensitivity and matrix desorption shrinkage,
   which could be called self-regulating effect comprehensively, possess
   great effect on the gas adsorption due to the changing of pore volume.
   Therefore, it is necessary to modify the simplified local density (SLD)
   model to investigate the gas adsorption under reservoir conditions for
   an accurate prediction of CBM production. For the utilization of SLD
   adsorption model, assume the pores as slit pore. When pressure is lower
   than critical desorption pressure and keeps falling, the deformations of
   specific surface area (SSA) and pore width could be studied by the
   chosen Shi and Durucan (S\&D) model. Furthermore, based on the variation
   relationship and the modification of SLD model, a new adsorption
   predicting model could be derived with the consideration of stress
   sensitivity, and matrix desorption shrinkage. In the absence of stress
   sensitivity and matrix desorption shrinkage, the calculated consequence
   is relatively smaller than the actual field adsorption data. What's
   more, the sensitivity analyses of Poisson's ratio, pore volume
   compressibility and critical desorption pressure are conducted with the
   application of this new model. At the same reservoir pressure, Poisson's
   ratio possesses negative relationship with modified adsorption, while
   pore volume compressibility and critical desorption pressure both
   possess positive influence on modified adsorption. The main reason is
   that Poisson's ratio affects matrix desorption shrinkage negatively,
   while pore volume compressibility and critical desorption pressure
   affect matrix desorption shrinkage positively. In spite of the opposite
   effect of stress sensitivity and matrix desorption shrinkage on pore
   deformation, matrix desorption shrinkage exhibits a dominant role in
   self-regulating.}},

Title = {{A time-trend ecological study for identifying flood-sensitive infectious
   diseases in Guangxi, China from 2005 to 2012}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{176}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Background: Flood-related damage can be very severe and include health
   effects. Among those health impacts, infectious diseases still represent
   a significant public health problem in China. However, there have been
   few studies on the identification of the spectrum of infectious diseases
   associated with floods in one area. This study aimed to quantitatively
   identify sensitive infectious diseases associated with floods in
   Guangxi, China.
   Methods: A time-trend ecological design was conducted. A descriptive
   analysis was first performed to exclude infectious diseases with low
   incidence from 2005 to 2012 in ten study sites of Guangxi. The Wilcoxon
   rank-sum test was applied to examine the difference in the ten-day
   attack rate of infectious diseases between the exposure and control
   periods with different lagged effects. Negative binomial, zero-inflated
   Poisson and zero-inflated negative binomial models were used to examine
   the relationship and odd ratios (ORs) of the risk of floods on
   infectious diseases of preliminary screening.
   Results: A total of 417,271 infectious diseases were notified. There
   were 11 infectious diseases associated with floods in the preliminary
   screening process for flood-sensitive infectious diseases. The strongest
   effect was shown with a 0-9 ten-day lag in different infectious
   diseases. Multivariate analysis showed that floods were significantly
   associated with an increased the risk of bacillary dysentery (odds ratio
   (OR) = 1.268, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.072-1.500), acute
   haemorrhagic conjunctivitis (AHC, OR = 3.230, 95\% CI: 1.976-5.280),
   influenza A (H1N1) (OR = 1.808, 95\% CI: 1.721-1.901), tuberculosis (OR
   = 1.200, 95\% CI: 1.036-1.391), influenza (OR = 2.614, 95\% CI:
   1.476-4.629), Japanese encephalitis (OR = 2.334, 95\% CI: 1.119-4.865),
   and leptospirosis (OR = 1.138, 95\% CI: 1.075-1.205), respectively.
   Conclusion. The spectrum of infectious diseases which are associated
   with floods are bacillary dysentery, AHC, influenza A (H1N1),
   tuberculosis, influenza, Japanese encephalitis and leptospirosis in
   Guangxi. Floods can result in differently increased risk of these
   diseases, and public health action should be taken to control a
   potential risk of these diseases after floods.}},

Title = {{Associations between ambient air pollution and mortality from all
   causes, pneumonia, and congenital heart diseases among children aged
   under 5 years in Beijing, China: A population-based time series study}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{176}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Background: Previous studies have mainly focused on the associations
   between particulate matters and infant mortality. However, evidence
   regarding the associations between gaseous pollutants and mortality
   among children aged < 5 years remains sparse.
   Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate the associations
   between ambient air pollution and death among children aged < 5 years in
   Beijing, China, and explore the impact of age, gender and specific
   causes of death on these associations.
   Methods: Concentrations of ambient air pollution and the number of
   deaths among children aged < 5 years in Beijing from January 2014 to
   September 2016 were extracted from authoritative electronic databases.
   The associations were estimated for a single-month lag from the current
   month up to the previous 5 months (lag0-lag5) and moving averages of the
   current and previous months (lag01-lag05) using generalized additive
   Poisson regression (adjusted for time trends, season, meteorological
   variables and holidays). Subgroup analyses related to age, gender and
   specific diseases were performed. Two-pollutant models were used to
   evaluate the possible role of single pollutants.
   Results: Sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and carbon
   monoxide (CO) demonstrated the strongest associations with death among
   children aged < 5 years at lag0 and the estimates decreased or even
   turned negative with the increasing lag periods. For an interquartile
   range increase in SO2, NO2 and CO at lag0, the odds ratios (OR) were
   1.332 (95\% CI 1.152-1.539), 1.383 (95\% CI 1.113-1.718) and 1.273 (95\%
   CI 1.028-1.575). However, CO lost significance after adjusting for SO2
   and NO2, and PM2.5 gained significance (OR 1.548, 95\% CI 1.061-2.258)
   after adjusting for PM10. The ORs for SO2 and NO2 remained the most
   stable across all two-pollutant models. The associations for children
   aged 1-5 years were stronger than those reported for infants at lag but
   lower at the other lag months. The pollutant associations were stronger
   for congenital heart disease-related death than overall and
   pneumonia-related death. We did not find significant differences in
   terms of gender.
   Conclusion: Exposure to air pollution may increase the incidence of
   death among children aged < 5 years. SO2 and NO2 may be the most stable
   pollutants reflecting associations between air pollution and death,
   deserving further attention. Children with congenital heart diseases are
   more susceptible to air pollution. Therefore, it is urgent to implement
   the clean air targets established by WHO and reduce the exposure of
   children to air pollution.}},

Abstract = {{We present a thin tube formulation for coupled
   extension-torsion-inflation deformation in helically reinforced
   pressurized circular tubes. Both compressible and incompressible tubes
   are considered. On applying the thin tube limit, the nonlinear ordinary
   differential equation to obtain the in-plane radial displacement is
   converted into a set of two simple algebraic equations for the
   compressible case and one equation for the incompressible case. This
   allows us to obtain analytical expressions, in terms of the tube's
   intrinsic twist, material constants, and the applied pressure, which can
   predict whether such tubes would overwind/unwind on being
   infinitesimally stretched or exhibit positive/negative Poisson's effect.
   We further show numerically that such tubes can be tuned to generate
   initial overwinding followed by rapid unwinding as observed during
   finite stretching of a torsionally relaxed DNA. Finally, we demonstrate
   that such tubes can also exhibit usual deflation initially followed by
   unusual inflation as the tube is finitely stretched.}},

Abstract = {{We experimentally and numerically investigate instability-induced
   pattern transformations and switchable auxetic behavior in multiphase
   composites consisted of circular voids and stiff inclusions periodically
   distributed in a soft elastomer. We specifically focus on the role of
   inclusion distribution on the behavior of the soft transformative
   composites. The inclusions are distributed in either square or
   triangular periodic configurations, while the voids are distributed in
   the triangular periodic array - the configurations enabling cooperative
   buckling induced transformations of the unit cells. Through the survey
   of microstructure parameter, we show that tailored positioning of the
   stiff inclusions can be exploited to expand the set of admissible
   switchable patterns in multiphase composites. Thus, extreme values of
   negative Poisson's ratio can be attained through applied strains;
   moreover, the onset of instabilities, and the corresponding switches to
   extremely soft behavior are shown to be controlled by the inclusion
   arrangements and volume fractions. Furthermore, the dependence of the
   microstructure buckling and post-buckling behavior on loading direction
   is investigated, and the composite anisotropic properties depending on
   the microstructure parameters are discussed.}},

Title = {{Joint effects of heatwaves and air quality on ambulance services for

Abstract = {{As the frequency, intensity, and duration of heatwaves increases,
   emergency health serviceutilization, including ambulance service, has
   correspondingly increased across the world. The negative effects of air
   pollution on health complicate these adverse health effects. This
   research work is the first known study to analyze the joint effects of
   heatwaves and air quality on the ambulance service in Western Australia
   (WA). The main objective is to investigate the potential joint effects
   of heatwaves and air quality on the ambulance service for vulnerable
   populations in the Perth metropolitan area. A time series design was
   used. Daily data on ambulance callouts, temperature and air pollutants
   (CO, SO2, NO2, O-3, PM10 and PM2.5) were collected for the Perth
   metropolitan area, WA from 2006 to 2015. Poisson regression modeling was
   used to assess the association between heatwaves, air quality, and
   ambulance callouts. Risk assessments on age, gender, socio-economic
   status (SES), and joint effects between heatwaves and air quality on
   ambulance callouts were conducted. The ambulance callout rate was higher
   during heatwave days (14.20/100,000/day) compared to non-heatwave days
   (13.95/100,000/day) with a rate ratio of 1.017 (95\% confidence interval
   1.012, 1.023). The ambulance callout rate was higher in males, people
   over 60 years old, people with low SES, and those living in coastal
   areas during period of heatwaves. Exposure to CO, SO2, O-3 and P-2.5
   increased risk on ambulance callouts and exposure to NO2 showed joint
   effect with heatwave and increased risk of ambulance callouts by 3\%
   after adjustment of all other risk factors. Ambulance callouts are an
   important indicator for evaluating heatwave-related emergency morbidity
   in WA. As the median concentrations of air pollutants in WA were lower
   than the Australian National Standards, the interactive effects of
   heatwaves and air quality on ambulance service need to be further
   examined, especially when air pollutants exceed the standards. (C) 2019

Journal = {{NATURE MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{999+}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Kirigami tessellations, regular planar patterns formed by partially
   cutting flat, thin sheets, allow compact shapes to morph into open
   structures with rich geometries and unusual material properties.
   However, geometric and topological constraints make the design of such
   structures challenging. Here we pose and solve the inverse problem of
   determining the number, size and orientation of cuts that enables the
   deployment of a closed, compact regular kirigami tessellation to conform
   approximately to any prescribed target shape in two or three dimensions.
   We first identify the constraints on the lengths and angles of
   generalized kirigami tessellations that guarantee that their
   reconfigured face geometries can be contracted from a non-trivial
   deployed shape to a compact, non-overlapping planar cut pattern. We then
   encode these conditions into a flexible constrained optimization
   framework to obtain generalized kirigami patterns derived from various
   periodic tesselations of the plane that can be deployed into a wide
   variety of prescribed shapes. A simple mechanical analysis of the
   resulting structure allows us to determine and control the stability of
   the deployed state and control the deployment path. Finally, we
   fabricate physical models that deploy in two and three dimensions to
   validate this inverse design approach. Altogether, our approach,
   combining geometry, topology and optimization, highlights the potential
   for generalized kirigami tessellations as building blocks for
   shape-morphing mechanical metamaterials.}},

Abstract = {{Cellular core structures with a negative Poisson's ratio, also known as
   auxetic core structures, are gaining attention due to their unique
   performance in sandwich panel systems for protecting critical
   infrastructures and military vehicles that are at high risk of blast and
   impact loads due to accidental and deliberate events. To help develop a
   high-performance protective system, this article outlines the
   performance evaluation of five different auxetic cell configurations
   based on a quantitative/qualitative review of an experimental
   load-deformation relationship of three-dimensional-printed auxetic
   panels from nylon plastics and the overall performance evaluation of
   metallic re-entrant honeycomb core sandwich panels as one type of
   lightweight protective system under static and dynamic loads via
   experimental testing and numerical simulations. The re-entrant honeycomb
   design displayed the most consistent auxetic behaviour. Quasi-static
   compression and drop hammer impact tests were performed using the
   proposed full-scale sandwich panel design with two different
   configurations as a protective system for concrete wall structures in
   combination with plastic face plates. The effect of the internal angle
   of the re-entrant honeycomb design and the effect of the core material
   under static and dynamic loads were evaluated using full-scale sandwich
   panels. Furthermore, two separate materials - acrylonitrile butadiene
   styrene and low-density polyethylene - were used as face plates, and the
   low-density polyethylene was effective for lightweight and smooth load
   transferring and distribution into the auxetic core. Auxetic panel
   deformation under static and dynamic load was examined using a normal
   speed camera and high-speed video recording data and all auxetic panels
   indicated excellent systematic crushing behaviour with drawing materials
   into the load path to effectively resist the impact load. Numerical
   simulations were performed using LS-DYNA and indicated good agreement
   with the experimental results. Finally, protective systems utilising
   sandwich panels with a re-entrant honeycomb core indicated strong
   potential for the development of high-performance lightweight
   impact-resistant protective systems.}},

Abstract = {{Metamaterials are featured by artificial composite structures with
   exotic properties, which process promising application potentials in
   various areas. However, the manufacturing of metamaterials faces great
   challenges due to the structural complexity, accuracy requirement, and
   small scale. Additive manufacturing (AM), as a layer-by-layer technique,
   shows intrinsic advantages in the fabrication of metamaterials. This
   paper extensively reviews the current state on how and to what extent AM
   techniques are adopted for metamaterials fabrication, in which the
   metamaterials are mainly classified into mechanical, acoustic and
   electromagnetic types. More importantly, the challenges and research
   opportunities are discussed for AM fabrication of metamaterials, with
   focus on high precision, multi-structural and multi-material, topology
   optimization, support structure, anisotropy and heterogeneity, residual
   stresses and application realization. It is expected that with further
   innovative solutions being developed to bridge the research gaps, the
   industries will become more confident to adopt metamaterials in devices
   and systems for critical applications.}},

Abstract = {{Lattice structures have been widely studied due to their advantage of
   low stiffness-to-weight ratio or sometimes auxetic properties. This
   paper presents a topology optimization method for structures with
   functionally-graded infill lattices with buckling constraints, which
   minimizes compliance while ensuring a prescribed level of structural
   stability against buckling failures. To realize topologically-optimized
   structures filled with functionally-graded lattices, Helmholtz
   PDE-filter with a variable radius is applied on the density field in
   Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization (SIMP) method. Buckling load
   factors based on the linear buckling analysis is employed as buckling
   constraints. Numerical examples show that proposed method can generate
   stiff structures comparable to the ones by the SIMP, with
   functionally-graded infill lattices that improve the structural
   stability by avoiding long, slender features under compression. (C) 2019

Abstract = {{In aerospace applications, variations of temperature caused by changing
   environmental conditions or generation of heat is a common problem. The
   resulting thermal strains cause separation and alignment errors in
   optical systems, and stresses due to mismatches of thermal expansion at
   material interfaces cause failure of components and structures. Because
   minimizing weight, cost, and lead time are also critical requirements,
   lightweight, easily machined metals are attractive for aerospace
   applications, but these materials all have substantial coefficients of
   thermal expansion. Previous work has shown that the superposition of two
   metals with dissimilar coefficients of thermal expansion in periodic
   cellular configurations can result in a composite material with zero
   effective thermal expansion. However, fabrication of these material
   architectures typically is either impossible or requires manual
   assembly. Here, we propose methods to design and fabricate cellular
   metal composites with tunable thermal expansion and optimized specific
   stiffness that can be manufactured at useful scales entirely with
   automated methods. Samples were manufactured with ultrasonic additive
   manufacturing and computer-controlled machining, and thermal expansion
   was measured optically. The results demonstrate the practical
   fabrication of cellular metal composites with zero or negative thermal
   expansion in one direction, tunable thermal expansion in a second
   direction, and structural performance indices competitive with the
   indices of conventional aerospace alloys.}},

Abstract = {{The investigation of the fatigue behaviour of an auxetic cellular
   structure made of Al-alloy 7075-T651 is presented in this study. The
   complete fatigue process of the analysed cellular structure is divided
   into the crack initiation (N-i) and crack propagation (N-p) period,
   where the total fatigue life (N-t) is defined as the sum of N-i and N-p.
   The crack initiation period, N-i, is determined using the strain life
   approach in the framework of the Fe-Safe computational code, where
   elastic-plastic numerical analysis is performed to obtain the total
   strain amplitude in the critical cross-section of the analysed cellular
   structure. The number of stress cycles, N-p, required for the fatigue
   crack propagation from the initial to the critical crack length is also
   determined numerically using a finite element model in the framework of
   the Abaqus computation FEM code. The Maximum Tensile Stress (MTS)
   criterion is considered when analysing the crack path inside the
   cellular structure. Finally, experimental fatigue testing has also been
   performed to validate the computational results.}},

Title = {{Special characteristics of tetrachiral honeycombs under large
   deformation}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOLIDS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{169}},
Pages = {{166-176}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The nonlinear mechanical responses of tetrachiral honeycombs under large
   deformation are theoretically analyzed by employing elliptic integrals,
   and the results are verified by numerical simulations. The nonlinear
   relationships between normal stress, shear stress, Poisson's ratio and
   the strain are derived for the tetrachiral honeycombs. It is found that
   the Poison's ratio of the tetrachiral honeycombs under large deformation
   is totally different from that under small deformation. The Poisson's
   ratio can achieve to a large magnitude of 0.8 in the former case, while
   remains 0 in the latter case. Moreover, the tetrachiral honeycombs
   exhibit positive Poison's ratio under large tensile-deformation, whilst
   showing negative Poisson's ratio under large compression-deformation.
   The magnitude of Poisson's ratio depends on both the honeycomb's
   deformation and the ligament relative length, while it is insensitive to
   the ligament thickness. Besides, the coupling effect between tensile (or
   compression) and shear is observed for the tetrachiral honeycombs. In
   other words, shear deformation appears within the honeycomb under
   uniaxial loading. The coupling effect depends on both the honeycomb's
   deformation and the geometric parameters of the cell structure. And the
   quantitative relationships among them are derived. This special coupling
   effect of tetrachiral honeycombs provides a new idea for designing more
   metamaterials. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Title = {{3D auxetic lattice materials for anomalous elastic wave polarization}},
Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{115}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{AUG 26}},
Abstract = {{Elastic bulk materials support longitudinal and transverse waves such
   that the former travels faster in most cases. Anomalous polarization is
   the case when a transverse wave travels faster, allowing us to engineer
   the wave propagation via wave steering, scattering control, and mode
   conversion, which has critical applications in vibration mitigation and
   ultrasonic imaging. However, realizable materials that exhibit anomalous
   polarization are rarely found in nature, and architected materials that
   exhibit this property have only been demonstrated in 2D. In this
   article, we present 3D auxetic periodic lattice materials that support
   anomalous wave polarization. Through finite element analysis, we show
   that these lattices can switch between normal and anomalous behavior via
   simple geometry changes. We confirm the elasticity condition and
   qualitatively discuss the guidelines to design lattice materials that
   support anomalous polarization along a specific wave propagation
   direction. We show the ability to control the anomalous wave propagation
   direction by modifying the lattice geometry. Further, we numerically
   demonstrate mode conservation, deceleration, and acceleration of an
   incident wave using a material that exhibits anomalous wave
   polarization. These demonstrations show the potential application of
   such materials in nondestructive evaluation and medical imaging.

Title = {{Bit error rate of pulse position modulation wireless optical
   communication in gamma-gamma oceanic anisotropic turbulence}},
Journal = {{ACTA PHYSICA SINICA}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{68}},
Number = {{16}},
Month = {{AUG 20}},
Abstract = {{Pulse position modulation (PPM) technology combined with the system of
   wireless optical communication received by the photon detector has the
   advantages of high energy efficiency and strong anti-interference
   capability. This technology has received extensive attention in the
   field of underwater wireless optical communication (UWOC) system.
   Affected by ocean turbulence, the UWOC system will produce the intensity
   fluctuations, leading the system performance to degrade. The Gamma-gamma
   intensity fluctuation probability model, which is a two-parameter model,
   possesses a wide range of applications. It can describe weak, medium and
   strong fluctuation in light intensity statistics. In this paper,
   firstly, based on the relationship between the weak atmospheric
   turbulent spherical wave scintillation index and the weak ocean
   anisotropic turbulent spherical wave scintillation index, the equivalent
   structural parameter expressed by both ocean turbulence parameters and
   anisotropy factor is derived. Then, using the structural parameter
   combined with the gamma-gamma turbulence channel and the asymptotic
   Rytov theory, the bit error rate (BER) under anisotropic ocean
   turbulence is calculated based on the BER formula of the PPM
   communication system. Finally, numerical simulations are carried out to
   analyze the ocean turbulence parameters, the average avalanche
   photodiode (APD) gain, the PPM modulation order, the data bit rate, and
   the influences of transmission distance on the BER under different
   anisotropic ocean turbulences. The results indicate that the negative
   effect of turbulence becomes stronger with increasing the ratio between
   the contributions of temperature and salinity to the refractive index
   spectrum, the dissipation rate of mean-squared temperature, data bit
   rate, and propagation distance. As the viscosity coefficient increases,
   the BER decreases. When the isotropic ocean turbulence and the
   anisotropy factors are very small, the increase of the rate of
   dissipation of kinetic energy per unit mass of fluid will result in a
   decrease in BER. When the turbulent environment anisotropy is further
   strengthened, the BER first increases and then decreases as the rate of
   dissipation of kinetic energy per unit mass of fluid increases. As the
   average APD gain increases, the BER first decreases and then increases.
   This trend is especially noticeable as the anisotropy factor increases.
   The choice of the average APD gain is important for finding the minimum
   value of the BER. In general, the system is more affected by salinity
   fluctuation than by temperature fluctuation. As the rate of dissipation
   of mean-squared temperature increases and the viscosity coefficient
   decreases, the negative effects of turbulence becomes more and more
   serious. When the system propagates longer distances or works at a
   higher data bit rate, the system is severely affected by turbulence,
   which limits the system operating distance and data transmission rate.
   However, using a smaller modulation order and choosing the right APD can
   conduce to improving the system performance. In addition, the PPM UWOC
   system can perform better when the system operates within acceptable bit
   error rate as the ocean turbulence environment becomes more anisotropic.
   This study will provide reference for the construction and performance
   estimation of UWOC system platform.}},

Abstract = {{We report a three-dimensional instability-triggered mechanical
   metamaterial that simultaneously possesses negative stiffness, negative
   bulk modulus, and negative Poisson's ratio. This metamaterial is a
   periodic arrangement of binder-shell elements. Combining numerical
   simulation and micromechanics analysis, we show that the thin spherical
   shells dent inward under compression, which contributes to a negative
   Poisson's ratio. Snap-through instability is predicted by the Riks
   method-based simulation, revealing that the metamaterial exhibits
   negative incremental stiffness. Negative bulk modulus is an outcome of
   negative stiffness and negative Poisson's ratio. Interestingly, both
   incremental stiffness and incremental Poisson's ratio approach negative
   infinity under displacement-controlled loading when snap back takes
   place. We further show that a triply negative metamaterial can satisfy
   the strong ellipticity condition, providing a mechanism to prevent the
   formation of localized deformation bands even when material softening
   takes place. The proposed triply negative metamaterial can also serve as
   structural elements for applications such as extreme damping composites,
   extreme stiff composites, and mechanical actuators.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presented a detailed study of the negative Poisson's ratio
   (NPR) effect on shrinkage deformation and crushing stress of metallic
   auxetic reentrant honeycomb under low, medium and high-velocity
   compressions. Instead of the traditional calculating method for the
   crushing stress of auxetic honeycomb, the new theoretical formula
   considering the NPR effect was proposed. The theoretical and finite
   element (FE) results showed that the crushing stress of reentrant
   honeycomb had been underestimated according to the traditional nominal
   stress strain curve. Not only had that, but also the theoretical results
   showed that the NPR effect could enhance the inertial effect during
   dynamic compression. Subsequently, under the medium and high-velocity
   compressions, the dynamic deformations of reentrant honeycomb were
   obviously different from that under low-velocity compression and those
   of metallic cellular materials with positive Poisson's ratio (such as Al
   foam and traditional hexagonal honeycomb) under medium or high-velocity
   compressions. In view of these differences, a new shrinkage deformation
   mechanism of reentrant honeycomb was proposed and a characterization
   parameter in contrast to the Poisson's ratio was presented to describe
   its dynamic shrinkage deformation capacity.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic lattice structures are prospective candidates in many
   engineering applications because of their unique negative Poisson's
   ratio effect as well as excellent mechanical properties. An aluminum
   based auxetic lattice structure reinforced by polymer fillers was
   fabricated through pressure infiltration technology, and the compressive
   mechanical properties of the resultant auxetic composites were then
   investigated through experimental tests combined with finite element
   analyses in the present study. The results show that the composites
   exhibit higher elastic modulus, compressive strength and energy
   absorption capacity compared with original aluminum based auxetic
   lattice structures. This enhancement is ascribed to intensified
   interaction between the struts and the polymer filler resulted from the
   special deformation mode of auxetic lattice structures. Furthermore, the
   deformation mechanism mode of the auxetic structures and corresponding
   auxetic composites were also discussed. It is therefore suggested that
   there will be pronounced enhancement in auxetic lattice structures if
   the negative Poisson's ratio effect is restrained.}},

Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{176}},
Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{In recent years, auxetic cellular materials such as auxetic reentrant
   honeycombs were widely studied due to its attractively negative
   Poisson's ratio. In this manuscript, the structure response of
   end-clamped sandwich beam with auxetic reentrant hexagonal aluminum
   honeycomb core locally subjected to foam projectile with high-velocity
   impact was experimentally and numerically studied. The reentrant
   honeycomb cores with different cell-wall thicknesses were fabricated by
   selective laser melting (SLM). According to experiment results, the
   failure modes of the sandwich beam were investigated. It was found that
   sandwich beam with different honeycomb cell's thicknesses could fail in
   different modes. Meanwhile, the local negative Poisson's ratio
   deformation was observed in the thin honeycomb core. Based on this, a
   finite element (FE) model was constructed to analysis the dynamic
   deformation evolution of two face sheets and auxetic reentrant honeycomb
   core. The local auxetic and expand deformations of honeycomb core were
   both found. Finally, the residual deflections of sandwich beam under
   impulsive loadings were discussed. (c) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Silica aerogels are attractive for thermal insulation due to their low
   thermal conductivity and good heat resistance performance. However, the
   fabrication of silica aerogels with temperature-invariant
   superelasticity and ultralow thermal conductivity has remained extremely
   challenging. Herein, we designed and synthesized a hierarchical cellular
   structured silica nanofibrous aerogel by using electrospun SiO2
   nanofibers (SNFs) and SiO2 nanoparticle aerogels (SNAs) as the matrix
   and SiO2 sol as the high-temperature nanoglue. This pathway leads to the
   intrinsically random deposited SNFs assembling into a fibrous cellular
   structure, and the SNAs are evenly distributed on the fibrous cell wall.
   The unique hierarchical cellular structure of the ceramic nanofibrous
   aerogels endows it with integrated performances of the ultralow density
   of similar to 0.2 mg cm(-3), negative Poisson's ratio, ultralow thermal
   conductivity (23.27 mW m(-1) K-1), temperature-invariant superelasticity
   from -196 to 1100 degrees C, and editable shapes on a large scale. These
   favorable multifeatures present the aerogels ideal for thermal
   insulation in industrial, aerospace, and even extreme environmental
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic woven fabrics made of non-auxetic yarns have gained the interest
   of textile scientists in recent times. Such fabrics have already been
   produced and investigated for their negative Poisson's ratio (NPR)
   effect in two principle directions. However, the NPR effect of these
   fabrics in different biased tensile directions has not been studied. In
   particular, the influence of repeated tensile loading on the NPR effect
   retention ability of fabric has not been explored yet. Therefore, this
   paper aims to report the NPR effect of auxetic woven fabric in different
   tensile directions and the influence of repeating tensile cycle tests on
   its NPR effect retention ability. The auxetic woven fabric is firstly
   fabricated based on a re-entrant hexagonal geometrical structure by
   using elastic and non-elastic yarns, and then subjected to single and
   repeating tensile tests in five different tensile directions, which
   include two principle directions and three biased directions. It is
   found that the NPR effect is largely dependent upon the tensile
   direction and the number of repeating tensile cycles.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To compare the efficacy of emicizumab prophylaxis with that
   of factor VIII (FVIII) prophylaxis in patients with hemophilia A without
   inhibitors using two approaches: network meta-analyses (NMA) and
   additional sub-group analyses from the HAVEN 3 trial. Methods: The NMA
   used data from trials identified using a systematic literature review
   and compared bleed rates in patients receiving emicizumab prophylaxis
   and patients receiving FVIII prophylaxis using a Bayesian, random
   effects generalized linear model with log link Poisson likelihood.
   Additional sub-groups of the HAVEN 3 trial included here were defined as
   patients whose dose-taking behavior met either European label or World
   Federation of Hemophilia guidelines. A negative binomial regression
   model was used to conduct an intra-patient comparison of bleed rates
   within the sub-groups, during treatment with FVIII prophylaxis before
   entering HAVEN 3 and treatment with emicizumab prophylaxis during HAVEN
   3. Results: Four studies were included in the base-case NMA. Evidence
   showed that the total treated bleed rate was lower with emicizumab
   prophylaxis compared with FVIII prophylaxis (rate ratio {[}RR] = 0.36
   {[}95\% credible interval (CrI) = 0.13-0.95]). Similar associations were
   observed in sensitivity analyses. The additional HAVEN 3 analyses also
   showed lower rates of treated bleeds with emicizumab prophylaxis than
   with FVIII prophylaxis (RRs {[}95\% confidence interval (CI)] = 0.380
   {[}0.186-0.790] and 0.472 {[}0.258-0.866] in two sub-groups). These
   results confirm the original HAVEN 3 intra-patient comparison findings.
   Conclusions: Combined findings from NMA and additional sub-group
   analyses of HAVEN 3 support the superiority of emicizumab prophylaxis
   over FVIII prophylaxis in patients with hemophilia A without inhibitors.}},

Title = {{An analytical solution for settlement of jacked piles considering pile
   installation effects}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND CIVIL ENGINEERING}},
Abstract = {{This paper develops an analytical solution for the settlement of jacked
   piles induced by reconsolidation of the surrounding soil. The Terzaghi's
   radial consolidation theory is utilised to model the dissipation of the
   installation-induced excess pore water pressure. A two-layer subgrade
   model, more general than single-layer ones and capable of being easily
   extended to multilayer soil systems, is adopted to analyse the
   settlement of the soil surrounding jacked piles so as to predict the
   additional settlement of the piles. The pile-soil interaction is
   properly considered in deriving the differential equations to formulate
   the problem considered. Example analysis is performed to illustrate the
   application of the proposed solution. Results indicate that the
   additional settlement of jacked piles, induced by reconsolidation of the
   surrounding soil, should be considered in calculation of the settlement
   of the pile after installation. Parametric studies are conducted to
   investigate the impact of the Poisson's ratio, overconsolidation ratio,
   shear modulus and initial void ratio on the settlement of the pile due
   to consolidation of the surrounding soil. The results show that the
   Poisson's ratio and the overconsolidation ratio of the upper stratum
   have pronounced effects on the settlement of the pile top.}},

Title = {{Examining the association of changes in minimum wage with health across
   race/ethnicity and gender in the United States}},
Journal = {{BMC PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{AUG 8}},
Abstract = {{Background: The minimum wage creates both winners (through wage
   increases) and-potentially-losers (through job losses). Research on the
   health effects of minimum wage policies has been sparse, particularly
   across gender and among racial/ethnic minorities. We test the impact of
   minimum wage increases on health outcomes, health behaviors and access
   to healthcare across gender and race/ethnicity.
   Methods: Using 1993-2014 data from the Behavioral Risk Factor
   Surveillance System, variables for access to healthcare (insurance
   coverage, missed care due to cost), health behavior (exercise, fruit,
   vegetable and alcohol consumption) and health outcomes (self-reported
   fair/poor health, hypertension, poor physical health days, poor mental
   health days, unhealthy days) were regressed on the product of the ratio
   of the 1-year lagged minimum wage to the state median wage and the
   national median wage, using Linear Probability Models and Poisson
   Regression Models for dichotomous and count outcomes, respectively.
   Regressions (total population, gender-stratified, race/ethnicity
   stratified (white, black, Latino), gender/race/ethnicity stratified and
   total population with interaction terms for race/ethnicity/gender)
   controlled for state-level ecologic variables, individual-level
   demographics and fixed-effects (state and year).
   Results were adjusted for complex survey design and Bonferroni
   corrections were applied to p-values such that the level of statistical
   significance for a given outcome category was 0.05 divided by the number
   of outcomes in that category. Results: Minimum wage increases were
   positively associated with access to care among white men, black women
   and Latino women but negatively associated with access to care among
   white women and black men. With respect to dietary quality, minimum wage
   increases were associated with improvements, mixed results and negative
   impacts among white, Latino and black men, respectively. With respect to
   health outcomes, minimum wage increases were associated with positive,
   negative and mixed impacts among white women, white men and Latino men,
   respectively.
   Conclusions: While there is enthusiasm for minimum wage increases in the
   public health community, such increases may have to be paired with
   deliberate strategies to protect workers that might be vulnerable to
   economic dislocation. Such strategies may include more robust
   unemployment insurance or increased access to job training for displaced
   workers.}},

Abstract = {{Ionogels are an emerging class of soft materials that exhibit ionic
   conductivity and thermal stability without the need to replenish ions or
   the addition of conductive particle fillers. An ionogel ink is reported
   for direct-write 3D printing to fabricate conductive structures that can
   vary in the printed object geometries. This approach relies on a
   shear-thinning ionogel ink that can be extruded to afford
   self-supporting constructs. After a brief UV cure, the printed construct
   is transformed into a mechanically tough, transparent structure that is
   ionically conductive. Upon application of stretching and twisting loads,
   the 3D-printed objects exhibit detectable changes in conductivity. To
   demonstrate the versatility of rapid prototyping with the ionogel inks,
   an auxetic structure is 3D printed and tested as a strain sensor. The
   printed auxetic structure exhibits an electrical response to strain, but
   also demonstrates increased extensibility and operational range in
   comparison to a casted bulk film with the same outer dimensions.}},

Abstract = {{The resilience of materials from the notch effect together with
   subsequent operating life and safety are important factors for the
   choice of material in industrial manufacture as well as for crash
   scenarios. The aim of this investigation is to study stress caused by
   the notch effect for HCT780XD and X5CrNi18-10 at different tensile test
   strain rates as well as due to various stress concentration factors
   during a high-speed tensile test. The notch geometries chosen are round,
   trapezoid, sharp and bore. They are compared to a test specimen without
   notch. The stress distribution analysis of notches was performed by the
   finite-element-method (FEM) in order to determine stress concentration
   factors. The high-speed tensile test was recorded with a high-speed
   camera. For this purpose, the test specimens were marked with a
   speckle-pattern, essential for the identification of strain rate via
   Dantec Dynamics Istra 4D. The influence of the stress concentration rate
   on parameters like energy, strength and the elongation of break was
   established and will be reported in the following. The level of the
   concentration factor leads to negative effects while the strain rate
   level delivers positive results. On other hand, the stress concentration
   factor is more important on the parameter than the strain rate. By
   contrast, Poisson's ratio does not affect the parameters observed.}},

Abstract = {{Mechanical metamaterial composed of chiral honeycomb structure is high
   performance engineering materials developed in recent years. They have
   the advantages of light weight, high specific stiffness, negative
   Poisson' s ratio, adjustable structural parameters and stable mechanical
   properties. It not only can realize the dual mechanical functions of
   in-plane deformation and out-of-plane load-bearing, but also has
   excellent engineering application performance such as vibration
   isolation and sound absorption and noise reduction and control of
   elastic wave propagation. It has great potential in the fields of
   intelligent structure, vehicle, ship, aerospace and so on. Two
   mechanical aspects of its elastic properties and impact resistance were
   reviewed. First, the progress of theoretical analysis and research on
   the elastic properties such as the surface poplar modulus, negative
   Poisson's ratio, and elastic properties of external shear modulus of
   mechanical metamaterials were reviewed and commented. Further, in the
   aspect of impact resistance, the overall deformation and impact
   resistance of the existing chiral honeycomb mechanical metamaterials
   under impact load were reviewed based on perspectives of model
   establishment and finite element analysis. Finally, it was pointed out
   that in the further research of elasticity and impact properties, the
   mechanical model of internal ligament deformation and force transmission
   can be further established and the energy absorption mechanism of the
   impact process to be further explored so as to provide the reference for
   the optimization design of the internal structure of ligaments and node
   rings in this type of metamaterial.}},

Abstract = {{Eight diamond-like structures (tubulanes) of different morphology based
   on carbon nanotubes are studied by the combination of molecular dynamics
   simulation and analytical calculations. Molecular dynamics is used for
   the structure relaxation, stability analysis, and calculation of the
   stiffness and compliance coefficients of stable tubulanes. Six stable
   tubulanes which can be elastically deformed are distinguished among the
   considered structures. Engineering elastic constants such as Young's
   modulus, Poisson's ratio, shear modulus, and bulk modulus are found by
   analytical methods. Two of the studied structures, TA6 and TB, are found
   to be partial auxetics having negative Poisson's ratio with the minimum
   values of -0.01 and - 0.8, respectively. The maximum Young's modulus for
   tubulanes TA6, TA8, and TB is found to be > 1 TPa. In combination with
   hardness close to that of diamond, considered phases with their
   outstanding mechanical properties can be potentially used as protective
   coatings.}},

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional (2D) materials with negative Poisson's ratio (NPR)
   attract considerable attention because of their exotic mechanical
   properties. We propose a new 2D material, monolayer GaPS4, which shows
   NPR for both in-plane (-0.033) and out-of-plane (-0.62) directions. Such
   coexistence of NPR in two distinct directions could be explained by its
   corner- and edge-shared tetrahedra pucker structure. GaPS4 has an
   ultralow cleavage energy of 0.23 J m(-2) according to our calculation,
   such that exfoliation of the bulk material is feasible for the
   preparation of mono- and few-layer GaPS4. Direct wide band gap of 3.55
   eV and moderate electron mobility have been revealed in monolayer GaPS4,
   while the direct gap feature is robust within a strain range of -6\% to
   6\%. These findings render 2D GaPS4 a promising candidate for
   applications in nanoelectronics and low-dimensional electromechanical
   devices.}},

   ratio and multiaxial yield surface. The effects of the elongation ratio
   and gas pressure on the elasto-plastic properties for a relative density
   of 0.5 were investigated. It was found that an increase in the
   elongation ratio caused increases in both the elastic modulus and yield
   stress for uniaxial loading along the cell elongation direction, and led
   to a tilted multiaxial yield surface in the mean stress and Mises
   equivalent stress plane. Compared to isotropic spheroidal-cell foams,
   the size of the yield surface of the ellipsoidal-cell foam is smaller
   for high-stress triaxiality, but larger for low-stress triaxiality, and
   the yield surface rotates counter-clockwise with the Lode angle
   increasing. The gas pressure caused asymmetry of the uniaxial
   stress-strain curve (e.g., reduced tensile yield stress), and it
   increased the nominal plastic Poisson's ratio for compression, but had
   the opposite effect for tension. Furthermore, the gas pressure shifted
   the yield surface towards the negative mean stress axis with a distance
   equal to the gas pressure. The combined effects of the elongation ratio
   and gas pressure are complicated, particularly for the elasto-plastic
   properties in the plane in which the cells are equiaxed.}},

Abstract = {{Research on metamaterials has attracted more and more attention, along
   with the design of various new 3D metamaterials, in which orthogonal
   assembling is a typical way of constructing such structures. For this
   kind of 3D orthogonal assembling structure, determining the equivalent
   elastic parameters of these 3D materials is important for mechanical
   analysis. However, because of the complexity, researchers tend to use
   finite element simulations or experimental methods, with little use of
   theoretical derivation solutions. In the present paper, we establish a
   mechanical model for determining the equivalent elastic parameters of a
   3D orthogonal assembling model. The equivalent formula of the 3D
   structure's elastic parameter can be obtained by using the known elastic
   parameters of the corresponding 2D structure. The applicability of the
   formula is verified through comparison with the results in the
   literature. Compared with existing methods for directly analyzing a
   specific 3D structure, this method is simpler and has great generality,
   which can provide assistance in the design and performance prediction of
   such structures.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic warp-knitted spacer fabrics have gained increasing interest due
   to their excellent properties, such as shear resistance, indentation
   resistance, synclastic curvature and so on. Soft composites made from
   auxetic warp-knitted spacer fabrics and A/B two-component silicone
   rubbers were studied in this paper. The stabbing resistance of
   composites made by different auxetic fabrics (Fabrics 1-4\#) and at
   different filling rates (0\%, 20\%, 40\%, 70\%, 100\%), respectively,
   were tested using a universal Material Testing System. The results show
   that the peak load, energy absorption and deformation displacement of
   the composites increase with an increase of auxetic performance and
   filling rate. In addition, a better auxetic effect and larger filling
   rate can result in less damage. The composites with a higher filling
   rate are more like an elastomer. The auxetic effect also has an
   important role in stabbing resistance, which is due to fabrics with a
   larger negative Poisson's ratio value having a denser face layer
   structure and more deformable units, which can lead to better stabbing
   resistance for the composites.}},

Abstract = {{Microbial colony counts of concern of food products are one of the most
   important items in microbiological examinations. The distributions of
   colony counts per agar plate of food samples are considered to be
   reflected with microbial cell distributions in food homogenates.
   However, (i) the probabilistic distributions of the colony counts per
   agar plate at the dilution of counting and (ii) the relationship between
   the colony counts per plate and the number of agar plates for food
   samples have not been intensively studied so far. In this study,
   therefore, these two points were studied with raw food samples of raw
   minced beef and chicken and raw milk and microbial culture samples of
   Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
   Among four major probabilistic distributions, it was found that aerobic
   plate counts per plate of the foods were well described with negative
   binomial, Poisson, and normal distributions and that the colony counts
   per plate of microbial cultures were described well with binomial,
   Poisson, and normal distributions. The effect of the number of agar
   plates on the estimation of the mean of colony counts per plate of a
   sample was then studied with the data randomly resampled from the
   experimental data. The resampled data showed that with more number of
   plates the mean of counts fluctuated less and the coefficients of
   variation of colony counts per plate decreased further, which were
   coincident to the estimated by the central limit theory. Our study would
   provide useful information on the characteristics of colony counts per
   plate of food samples which are routinely examined.}},

Title = {{The Development of a New Shock Absorbing Uniaxial Graded Auxetic Damper
   (UGAD)}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{16}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic structures are efficient cellular materials that can absorb
   blast/impact energy through plastic deformation, thus protecting the
   structure. They are developing sacrificial solutions with light weight,
   high specific strength, high specific toughness and excellent energy
   dissipating properties, due to its negative Poison's ratio nature. The
   use of auxetic and non-auxetic panels in blast resistant structures had
   been relatively perceived by researchers. Nonetheless, implementation of
   those energy dissipaters, explicitly as a uni-axial passive damper is
   restrained to limited studies, which highlight the potential need for
   further explorations. The aim of this paper is the design of a new
   uniaxial graded auxetic damper (UGAD) that can be used as a
   blast/impact/shock absorber in different scales for different structural
   applications. First, the geometry, material, numerical model and loading
   are introduced. Then, a detailed parametric study is conducted to
   achieve the most efficient graded auxetic system. Moreover, the designed
   auxetic damper is numerically tested and its static and dynamic
   constitutive relations are derived and validated analytically. The
   selection of optimum parameters was based on the ratio of the reaction
   force to the applied load (RFd/P) and plastic dissipation energy (PDE).
   The final designed UGAD contains three auxetic cores that have the same
   geometry, material grade (6063-T4), size and number of layers equal to
   eight. The cell-wall thickness t of the three auxetic cores is 1.4 mm,
   1.8 mm and 2.2 mm, respectively; composing a graded auxetic system. The
   performance of the three auxetic cores together have led to a wide
   plateau region (80\% of total crushing strain) and variant strength
   range (1-10 MPa), which in return, can justify the superior performance
   of the UGAD under different blast levels. Finally, the 3D printed
   prototype of the UGAD is presented and the possible applications are
   covered.}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with experimental investigation into a strain-rate
   dependent function of Poisson's ratio of three auxetic structures
   subjected to compressive loading. The missing rib, the 2D re-entrant
   honeycomb, and the 3D re-entrant honeycomb lattices printed using
   selective laser sintering from powdered SS316L austenitic steel are
   investigated. The samples are subjected to uni-axial compression under
   quasi-static conditions and dynamic conditions using the Split Hopkinson
   Pressure Bar (SHPB). The deforming specimens are optically observed in
   order to apply a digital image correlation for evaluation of the
   in-plane displacement and strain fields. From the calculated strain
   fields, the function of Poisson's ratio is calculated for each
   experiment using different methods taking specific regions of interest
   of the specimen microstructures into account. The obtained functions of
   Poisson's ratio are plotted for each microstructure and strain-rate. The
   analysis of the results shows that the strain-rate has a significant
   influence on the deformation characteristics of all the investigated
   microstructures yielding differences in the magnitude of the minima of
   Poisson's ratio and the differences in the maximum overall compressive
   strain, where the lattices are still auxetic.}},

Abstract = {{Cellular materials such as foams, honeycombs, or auxetic structures are
   an interesting type of structural materials for lightweight
   constructions or dynamic energy absorbers. These microheterogeneous
   materials consist of a hierarchical structure. Foams can be separated
   into a macro scale, meso scale, and micro scale dealing with the entire
   specimen or component, individual pores, and individual struts,
   respectively. As a result, the macroscopic foam properties are strongly
   related to the mesoscopic and microscopic properties as a superposition
   of geometrical structural response and material properties. Whereas the
   geometry can be easily determined, e.g., by computer tomography
   measurements, the evaluation of real micro material properties of
   individual struts or cell walls is still a very challenging task. The
   material properties of these constituents of open-cell or closed-cell
   foams significantly differ from bulk material properties due to changes
   in boundary condition during production and different scaling effects,
   such as different surface-to-volume ratios of oxide layers or different
   cooling conditions due to less material in struts than in the bulk.
   However, the need for reliable micro material properties for the
   realistic forecast of macroscopic properties of components made of foam
   by numerical simulations makes the micromechanical characterization and
   testing of metal foams to an emerging field of research. The present
   contribution deals with the most relevant achievements in the field from
   the beginnings to the present day.}},

Abstract = {{Aluminium honeycomb is a lightweight load carrying structure widely used
   in aerospace and automotive industries. In this study, In-plane
   compression analysis of AA 8011 reinforced honeycomb was performed
   numerically and experimentally. Geometrical parameters like cell size,
   cell wall thickness and node length were varied for attaining different
   models. Cell size was varied as 7 mm and 10 mm while node length as 25
   mm, 30 mm and 35 mm respectively. Cell wall thickness of reinforced
   honeycomb was kept as 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 mm respectively. Finite element
   simulations were performed on various combination of reinforced
   honeycomb configuration using IS DYNA. Numerical model was validated
   with experimental results performed on reinforced core. Cell-wall
   thickness has major influence on energy absorption and peak crushing
   force of honeycomb. Enhancement in cell wall thickness increased
   crushing strength and energy absorption capacity of the structure
   whereas reverse effect was observed with increase in cell size. Node
   length has less impact on performance characteristics of honeycomb core.}},

Title = {{Revisiting the Dependence of Poisson's Ratio on Liquid Fragility and
   Atomic Packing Density in Oxide Glasses}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{15}},
Month = {{AUG 1}},
Abstract = {{Poisson's ratio (nu) defines a material's propensity to laterally expand
   upon compression, or laterally shrink upon tension for non-auxetic
   materials. This fundamental metric has traditionally, in some fields,
   been assumed to be a material-independent constant, but it is clear that
   it varies with composition across glasses, ceramics, metals, and
   polymers. The intrinsically elastic metric has also been suggested to
   control a range of properties, even beyond the linear-elastic regime.
   Notably, metallic glasses show a striking brittle-to-ductile (BTD)
   transition for nu-values above 0.32. The BTD transition has also been
   suggested to be valid for oxide glasses, but, unfortunately, direct
   prediction of Poisson's ratio from chemical composition remains
   challenging. With the long-term goal to discover such high-nu oxide
   glasses, we here revisit whether previously proposed relationships
   between Poisson's ratio and liquid fragility (m) and atomic packing
   density (C-g) hold for oxide glasses, since this would enable m and C-g
   to be used as surrogates for nu. To do so, we have performed an
   extensive literature review and synthesized new oxide glasses within the
   zinc borate and aluminoborate families that are found to exhibit high
   Poisson's ratio values up to 0.34. We are not able to unequivocally
   confirm the universality of the Novikov-Sokolov correlation between nu
   and m and that between nu and C-g for oxide glass-formers, nor for the
   organic, ionic, chalcogenide, halogenide, or metallic glasses. Despite
   significant scatter, we do, however, observe an overall increase in nu
   with increasing m and C-g, but it is clear that additional structural
   details besides m or C-g are needed to predict and understand the
   composition dependence of Poisson's ratio. Finally, we also infer from
   literature data that, in addition to high nu, high Young's modulus is
   also needed to obtain glasses with high fracture toughness.}},

Abstract = {{An auxetic design is proposed by soft-hard material integration and
   demonstrate negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) can be achieved by leveraging
   unique rotation features of non-connected hard particles in a soft
   matrix. A theoretical mechanics framework that describes rotation of
   hard particles in a soft matrix under a mechanical loading is
   incorporated with overall Poisson's ratio of the soft-hard integrated
   metamaterials. The theoretical analysis shows that the auxetic behaviour
   of the soft-hard integrated structures not only relies critically on
   geometry of particles, but also depends on their periodic arrangements
   in the soft matrix. Extensive finite-element analyses (FEA) are
   performed and validate the theoretical predictions of hard-particle
   rotation and overall Poisson's ratio of soft-hard integrated structures.
   Furthermore, uniaxial tensile tests are carried out on three-dimensional
   printed soft-hard integrated structures and confirm auxetic behaviour of
   soft-hard integrated structures enabled by the rotation of hard
   particles. Besides, Poisson's ratio varies nonlinearly with the
   thickness of specimens and reaches a maximum NPR far out of the bounds
   of plane stress and plane strain situations, which agrees well with FEA.
   This work provides a theoretical foundation for the design of mechanical
   metamaterials enabled by soft-hard material integration with auxetic
   deformation behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{Pedestrian behaviour is one of the major contributors to road
   fatalities. The negative binomial regression model was found to better
   agree with road fatality data, and this study used this model to assess
   the influence of pedestrian behaviour factors on road fatalities in
   Malawi. The data used in this analysis were crash reports of pedestrian
   behaviour factors and observed fatalities for the period 2000-2015
   obtained from the national database, except for the 2013 data, which
   were disregarded because they appeared to be incomplete. Whereas
   pedestrian behaviour factors of walking on roads, crossing outside
   pedestrian crossings, and other negligent and careless behaviours were
   found to be positively correlated with road deaths, indicating that
   road-related fatalities increased with increasing input data, factors of
   being under the influence of alcohol and crossing at pedestrian
   crossings demonstrated negligible influence. The study also found that
   there was a 1\% increase in the number of crash deaths for every
   additional fatal crash involving pedestrians walking on roads. Moreover,
   an additional 0.5\% increase in the number of fatalities was recorded
   for every fatal crash involving a pedestrian behaviour factor of
   crossing outside the pedestrian crossing or other negligent behaviour.
   An increase of 0.3\% in the number of the fatalities was seen for every
   extra fatal crash caused by crossing carelessly or factors other than
   pedestrian behaviour. Despite coefficient values being small in all
   variables, which is a major limitation of this study, enforcement can
   prioritise those variables that increase road-related fatalities or even
   couple them with other risk factors such as speed.}},

Abstract = {{Metamaterials, rationally designed multiscale composite systems, have
   attracted extensive interest because of their potential for a broad
   range of applications due to their unique properties such as negative
   Poisson's ratio, exceptional mechanical performance, tunable photonic
   and phononic properties, structural reconfiguration, etc. Though they
   are dominated by an auxetic structure, the constituents of metamaterials
   also play an indispensable role in determining their unprecedented
   properties. In this vein, 2D materials such as graphene, silicene, and
   phosphorene with superior structural tunability are ideal candidates for
   constituents of metamaterials. However, the nanostructure-property
   relationship and composition-property relationship of these 2D
   material-based metamaterials remain largely unexplored. Mechanical
   anisotropy inherited from the 2D material constituents, for example, may
   substantially impact the physical stability and robustness of the
   corresponding metamaterial systems. Herein, classical molecular dynamics
   simulations are performed using a generic coarse-grained model to
   explore the deformation mechanism of these 2D material-based
   metamaterials with sinusoidally curved ligaments and the effect of
   mechanical anisotropy on mechanical properties, especially the negative
   Poisson's ratio. The results indicate that deformation under axial
   tensile load can be divided into two stages: bending-dominated and
   stretching-dominated, in which the rotation of junctions in the former
   stage results in auxetic behavior of the proposed metamaterials. In
   addition, the auxetic behavior depends heavily on both the
   amplitude/wavelength ratio of the sinusoidal ligament and the stiffness
   ratio between axial and transverse directions. The magnitude of negative
   Poisson's ratio increases from 0 to 0.625, with an associated increase
   of the amplitude/wavelength ratio from 0 to 0.225, and fluctuates at
   around 0.625, in good agreement with the literature, with
   amplitude/wavelength ratios greater than 0.225. More interestingly, the
   magnitude of negative Poisson's ratio increases from 0.47 to 0.87 with
   the increase of the stiffness ratio from 0.125 to 8, in good agreement
   with additional all-atom molecular dynamics simulations for phosphorene
   and molybdenum disulfide. Overall, these research findings shed light on
   the deformation mechanism of auxetic metamaterials, providing useful
   guidelines for designing auxetic 2D lattice structures made of 2D
   materials that can display a tunable negative Poisson's ratio.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports a novel method to fabricate auxetic warp knitted
   fabrics on a tricot warp knitting machine based on a special structure
   design and knitting process. Three auxetic warp knitted structures were
   successfully developed and all of them were designed to form a reentrant
   hexagonal geometry to acquire an auxetic effect. To provide the fabrics
   with reentrant frames, elastomeric yarns and stiff yarns were used to
   form the elastic underlaps and stiff underlaps, respectively. While the
   elastic underlaps can keep the reentrant structures stable, the stiff
   underlaps can support the reentrant structures to keep their reentrant
   frames. To alleviate the transfer of yarns in the loops under tension,
   an additional front yarn guide bar was used to feed binding yarns to
   basic reentrant structures. After knitting, all the fabrics were
   subjected to a heat setting process to keep their shape and a tensile
   test to assess their auxetic behavior. The experimental results showed
   that all the fabrics exhibited an obvious auxetic behavior within a wide
   range of strain. In particular, the fabrics retained auxetic behavior
   until breaking when stretched in the wale direction, and the Poisson's
   ratio of the fabrics could be as low as -0.5. On the other hand, the
   fabrics exhibited a large tensile elongation when stretched in the
   course direction and their Poisson's ratios changed from negative to
   positive after the tensile strain exceeded a certain value.}},

Abstract = {{Re-entrant anti-trichiral honeycomb is a typical auxetic material. The
   collapse process can be divided into three stages while its negative
   Poisson's ratio (NPR) effect under large deformation is still unclear.
   In the present paper, the NPR effects of re-entrant anti-trichiral
   honeycombs under large deformation are studied by numerical and
   theoretical method. Numerical results are verified by the experiments
   with respect to their deformation mechanism and stress-strain behavior.
   Theoretical formulas are derived to predict the NPR effect of the
   honeycomb under large deformation. The analytical predictions are in
   good agreement with the FEM results. It is revealed that the NPR effect
   of the honeycomb is magnified with the global strain in the second stage
   while is weaken in the third stage of the deformation process. The
   decrease of the ligament-ratio and the mean radius will result in more
   obvious NPR effect. Variation of cell-wall thickness doesn't have much
   impact on the Poisson's ratio in the second stage, while smaller
   cell-wall thickness will induce larger NPR in the third stage. The
   present work is supposed to shed light on the design and fabrication of
   re-entrant anti-trichiral honeycombs with desired Poisson's ratio.}},

Abstract = {{The architected mechanical metamaterials have garnered significant
   research attention for a variety of engineering application due to their
   remarkable mechanical properties and unique deformation behavior.
   Herein, the in-plane uniaxial compressive response and energy absorption
   capacity of a novel hybrid configuration, AuxHex structure, which
   consists of auxetic and hexagonal honeycomb cells, are systematically
   investigated through theoretical, finite element simulation and
   experimental methods. A series of AuxHex sandwich core panels have been
   fabricated with nylon material by using additive manufacturing route.
   The relationships for Young's modulus and plastic collapse stress along
   different loading directions are derived and validated through the
   comparative analysis. In addition, the deformation mechanism and failure
   modes of the AuxHex structure have also been discussed in detail. The
   AuxHex structures have exhibited superior Young's modulus, collapse
   strength and energy absorption than traditional honeycomb structures. In
   the x-direction, the energy absorption capacity was improved by 38\%,
   which can be attributed to the uniform and stable deformation mode of
   the unit cell. The theoretical prediction results of Young's modulus and
   plastic collapse stress are consistent with finite element simulation
   and experimental results. The AuxHex structures demonstrate a novel
   design strategy for the architected metamaterials through the
   combination of various cellular cells. The hybrid structures will play
   an important role in both the load-bearing and energy-absorbing
   applications, and it demonstrates a novel design strategy for the
   architected metamaterials through the combination of various cellular
   cells.}},

Title = {{Gas transport study in the confined microfractures of coal reservoirs}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NATURAL GAS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{68}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Microfractures are commonly observed in coal reservoirs. During the
   coalbed gas production process, stress sensitivity and coalbed gas
   viscosity changes are significant factors that affect gas transport. By
   using research methods based on desorption theory and elastic-plastic
   mechanics, a coal confined microfracture gas transport model that
   considers dynamic microfracture width variations and gas effective
   viscosity is established in this paper. This model comprehensively fuses
   the Knudsen diffusion model, the slip flow model, the surface diffusion
   model, and the cubic grid model. The reliability of this model is
   verified via molecular simulations, and the influence factors of gas
   transport capacity in confined microfractures of coal reservoirs are
   then discussed in detail. The results demonstrate the following
   findings. (1) The analyzed flows are well simulated in coal confined
   microfractures by the model established in this paper, which considers
   stress sensitivity and coalbed methane viscosity change. (2) Under low
   formation pressure (less than 5 MPa), the effective gas viscosity
   rapidly decreases with the decrease in formation pressure, and the
   negative contribution of gas viscosity change to the microfracture
   permeability of coal is large. The smaller the initial fracture width of
   coal, the more obvious this negative effect. (3) When the initial
   fracture width is fairly small (near 1 nm), Knudsen flow and surface
   diffusion greatly contribute to the microfracture permeability of coal.
   However, the larger the initial microfracture width, the smaller the
   contribution of the two flow regimes to the microfracture permeability,
   and the permeability is mainly provided by slip flow. (4) Under given
   conditions, the microfracture permeability of coal is positively related
   to rock mechanical parameters (Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio) and
   negatively related to fracture compressibility. Under low formation
   pressures (less than 15 MPa), the microfracture permeability of coal is
   positively related to gas desorption. When the formation pressure
   exceeds 15 MPa, the influence of gas desorption performance on
   permeability is nearly constant.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, structural stability, elastic properties, electronic
   structure and thermodynamic properties of Al-Fe-Si compounds are
   systematically investigated by first-principles calculations. The
   negative formation enthalpy indicates that all Al-Fe-Si compounds are
   thermodynamically stable, and the Al-Fe-Si compounds are determined to
   be mechanically stable by the stability criteria. The bulk, shear and
   Young's moduli as well as Poisson's ratio of Al-Fe-Si compounds are also
   calculated. The results show that Al2Fe3Si3 has the highest shear
   modulus and Young's modulus, which leads to stronger shear deformation
   resistance and stiffness. The elastic anisotropy and shear anisotropic
   factors of Al-Fe-Si compounds are analyzed in this study, and the
   anisotropy of Al3Fe2Si3 is the greatest among them. Al3Fe2Si3 and
   Al2Fe3Si4 show metallic character and Al2Fe3Si3 is classified as direct
   band gap semiconductors. The DOS of Al-Fe-Si compounds are found mainly
   from Al 3p, Si 3p and Fe 4d states and the Fe-Al/Si bonding is much
   stronger than that of Al-Si. According to the results, Al2Fe3Si3 has the
   highest Debye temperature, indicating strong chemical bonding and higher
   thermal conductivity, which are consistent with the results of Young's
   modulus and minimum thermal conductivity.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a self-developed MATLAB program for achieving

   the laminated woven fabric composite under different loading/unloading
   stages, cycles, stress levels and ratios, which is a further development
   of our prior work. Results show that elastic parameters and orthotropic
   characteristics of the material vary noticeably with the
   loading/unloading stages, cycles, stress levels, and ratios. As higher
   values are required to model the remarkable warp-weft interaction and
   large negative strains, Poisson's ratios in boundary regions with a
   maximum of 1.0 (loading) or 1.5 (unloading) are outside the bounds
   normally expected for these parameters. In addition, the proposed method
   is feasible to evaluate elastic parameters for any stress state, and
   thereby provides new insights into underlying deformation mechanisms of

Abstract = {{A novel 3D re-entrant chiral auxetic (RCA) structure has been proposed
   for the first time in this study. The unit cell has been developed with
   solid cubes and struts based on the topological features of both
   re-entrant honeycomb and chiral honeycomb. A recently developed powerful
   3D printing process, Multi Jet Fusion (MJF), has been employed to print
   six samples from polyamide 12 (PA 12). Uniaxial quasi-static compressive
   tests have been performed in the X, Y and Z directions to investigate
   the deformation, Poisson's ratio and energy absorption of the proposed
   structure. Finite element (FE) models have been developed using
   ANSYS/LS-DYNA and verified by the respective experimental data. The
   experimental microscopic measurements reveal high accuracy of MJF
   process to produce robust parts with smooth internal morphology. The
   designed cubes are found to demonstrate a similar rotation function to
   that of cylinders of the corresponding 2D RCA structure. The plastic
   bending and buckling are found to be the dominated deformation
   mechanisms for the samples compressed in the Y direction, while plastic
   bending is the dominated deformation mechanism for the samples
   compressed in the X and Z directions. The proposed structure displays
   auxetic feature under uniaxial compression in all three directions,
   which facilitates a more severe compaction of the structure and results
   in an improved load carrying capacity. It is also found that the
   compressed RCA structure when loaded in the X direction outperforms in
   terms of auxeticity and energy absorption compared with the other (Y and
   Z) directions. The proposed 3D RCA structure has anisotropic properties.}},

Journal = {{NANO ENERGY}},

Abstract = {{Driving status monitoring is highly desirable to ensure safety and
   prevent traffic accidents. Unsafe and inappropriate driving behaviors
   can be identified through the monitoring of the driver's body motion. A
   self-powered smart safety belt composed of two types of triboelectric
   nanogenerators (TENGs) is developed to monitor the forward position and
   turning actions of the driver. An auxetic Polyurethane (APU)-TENG
   integrated in the horizontal strip of the safety belt achieves high
   sensitivity (0.89V/cm(2)) for strain measurements in the large strain
   domain (40\%-100\%), enabling the long range monitoring of the forward
   position of the driver, which correlates to abrupt and aggressive
   deceleration. Two sensor arrays of arch-shaped TENGs (AS-TENGs) attached
   to shoulder and waist location of the diagonal strip in the safety belt
   can measure the turning directions and angles of the driver,
   respectively. The AS-TENGs are designed through the integration of two
   TENGs in the top and bottom arch, respectively, to ensure stable and
   gradually increased contact between the triboelectric layers in both
   arches, which leads to a high displacement measurement sensitivity of
   47.2 V/cm(3) with high linearity. This work demonstrates an effctive
   approach to integrate self-powered TENGs sensors seamlessly into
   existing driving environment for driving status monitoring, expanding
   the applictions of TENGs in wearable electronics.}},

Abstract = {{Wearable electronic devices have become familiar to people and have been
   expanded to various functions via development in the field of the
   flexible and stretchable electronic devices. These wearable devices,
   such as displays, motion sensors, electromyography sensors, and
   electrocardiogram sensors, require input and power systems to command
   information and supply energy, respectively. The triboelectric
   nanogenerator (TENG) has attracted attention as an eco-friendly device
   that provides sustainable power without an external power supply. Here,
   we report a self-powered stretchable TENG (S-TENG) touch sensor suitable
   for a wearable device that adapts to the skin's motion because of its
   stretchability. The S-TENG with a single-electrode structure was
   fabricated using atomically thin graphene (< 1 nm), polyethylene
   terephthalate (similar to 5 mu m), and polydimethylsiloxane (similar to
   5 mu m) as the electrode, substrate, and electrification layer,
   respectively. The stretchability was realized through an auxetic mesh
   design, which helps to obtain stable mechanical and electrical
   properties while stretching. The S-TENG touch sensor not only senses the
   touch point but can also perform improved extended functions such as
   detection of touch sliding velocity and information input through the
   trajectory mode. The developed S-TENG touch sensor showed good potential
   for future wearable input applications and is capable of long-term
   performance without an energy supply.}},

Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{123}},
Pages = {{114-122}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Filling a non-conducting soft matrix with a hard conducting phase leads
   to two critical transitions: a percolation threshold with a drastic
   increase in conductivity and a rigidity threshold marking a substantial
   increase in the elastic modulus. A metal-particulate polymer composite
   has interpenetrating phases with substantial rigidity beyond the
   rigidity threshold. Experimental results show that the Young's modulus
   of the composite is enhanced significantly when an entrapped
   incompressible polymer phase exerts high hydrostatic stresses in
   uniaxial compression at the rigidity threshold. Additional experiments
   beyond the glass transition temperature of the polymer reveal a
   substantial reduction in the modulus of the composite at the rigidity
   threshold, as the polymer compressibility is increased significantly,
   confirming the role of the soft phase in rigidity enhancements. The
   present investigation provides a potential new designing criterion for
   enhancing the Young's modulus of an interpenetrating composite
   structure, by utilizing an incompressible second phase and negative
   volumetric strain.}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Solids exhibit transverse shrinkage when they are stretched, except
   auxetics that abnormally demonstrate lateral expansion instead. Graphene
   possesses the unique normal-auxeticity (NA) transition when it is
   stretched along the armchair direction but not along the zigzag
   direction. Here we report on the anisotropic temperature-dependent NA
   transitions in strained graphene using molecular dynamics simulations.
   The critical strain where the NA transition occurs increases with
   respect to an increase in the tilt angle deviating from armchair
   direction upon uniaxial loading. The magic angle for the NA transition
   is 10.9 degrees, beyond which the critical strain is close to fracture
   strain. In addition, the critical strain decreases with an increasing
   temperature when the tilt angle is smaller than the NA magic angle. Our
   results shed lights on the unprecedented nonlinear dimensional response
   of graphene to the large mechanical loading at various temperatures. (C)

Abstract = {{In this paper, an effective and efficient topology optimization method,
   termed as Isogeometric Topology Optimization (ITO), is proposed for
   systematic design of both 2D and 3D auxetic metamaterials based on
   isogeometric analysis (IGA). Firstly, a density distribution function
   (DDF) with the desired smoothness and continuity, to represent the
   topological changes of structures, is constructed using the Shepard
   function and non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS) basis functions.
   Secondly, an energy-based homogenization method (EBHM) to evaluate
   material effective properties is numerically implemented by IGA, with
   the imposing of the periodic boundary formulation on material
   microstructure. Thirdly, a topology optimization formulation for 2D and
   3D auxetic metamaterials is developed based on the DDF, where the
   objective function is defined as a combination of the homogenized
   elastic tensor and the IGA is applied to solve the structural responses.
   A relaxed optimality criteria (OC) method is used to update the design
   variables, due to the non-monotonic property of the problem. Finally,
   several numerical examples are used to demonstrate the effectiveness and
   efficiency of the proposed method. A series of auxetic microstructures
   with different deformation mechanisms (e.g. the re-entrant and chiral)
   can be obtained. The auxetic behavior of material microstructures are
   numerically validated using ANSYS, and the optimized designs are
   prototyped using the Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) technique. (C) 2019

Title = {{In-plane crushing response of tetra-chiral honeycombs}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMPACT ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2019}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Tetra-chiral (TC) honeycombs are a type of auxetic materials showing
   negative Poisson's ratio (NPR), which are promising for impact energy
   absorption. This study aims to analyze the in-plane crushing response of
   the TC honeycombs under both quasi-static and dynamic loading conditions
   through numerical simulations and theoretical analyses. The numerical
   modeling techniques in LS-DYNA were validated using the quasi-static
   crush test data of TC honeycomb specimens obtained with a 3D-printer.
   Numerical simulations revealed the ``Z{''} mode deformation and the
   ``bulge effect{''} under quasi-static crushing, and the row-by-row
   ``I{''} mode deformation under dynamic crushing of the TC honeycombs. By
   referring to the simulation results, theoretical models were derived
   based on the representative unit for predicting the TC honeycomb's
   crushing strength, i.e. plateau stress, under both quasi-static and
   dynamic loads. Good agreement was found between the theoretical and the
   numerical predictions with a maximum relative error of 7\%. Parametric
   analyses showed that the unit cell configuration has a great effect on
   the crushing strength of TC honeycomb under in-plane crushing. The
   dynamic sensitivity index was defined to quantitatively evaluate the
   sensitivity of the TC honeycomb's crushing strength to the loading
   speed, and was found to depend on the unit cell geometry. The TC
   honeycomb was found to present a varied effective Poisson's ratio (EPR)
   with strain under both quasi-static and dynamic in-plane crushing;
   smaller radius ratio and lower crushing speed were found to yield more
   obvious NPR effect. Moreover, relative dimension of the TC honeycomb
   represented by the orthogonal array ratio do not affect its plateau
   stress under either quasi-static or dynamic crushing, while large
   orthogonal array ratio results in more obvious ``bulge{''} and NPR
   effects under quasi-static crushing.}},

Abstract = {{The crystal structure, stability, and electronic and mechanical
   properties of D0(22) Al3Ti-Al3Nb pseudobinary solid solution were
   systematically investigated by a first-principles method and experiment.
   The calculated formation energies demonstrated that all the
   Al-3(Ti1-xNbx) (0 <= x <= 1) solid solutions considered are
   thermodynamically stable and that the stability decreases monotonously
   with increasing Nb concentration. Lattice parameter a of Al-3(Ti1-xNbx)
   exhibits strong negative deviation from a linear composition dependence,
   while the trend is reversed for lattice parameter c. Study of the
   mechanical properties (including the bulk modulus, shear modulus,
   Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, and Debye temperature) reveals that Nb
   atom substitution in Al3Ti enhances the mechanical stability and
   strength. The analysis of calculated electronic structures reveals that
   the metallic behavior of Al-3(Ti1-xNbx) depends on the Nb concentration.
   Experimentally, Al-3(Ti1-xNbx) was synthesized and was characterized by
   means of X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. Rietveld
   refinement results confirmed that the lattice parameters are in the
   range of our previous calculated values. The differences between the

Journal = {{MATERIALS RESEARCH EXPRESS}},

Volume = {{6}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The auxetic materials and structures exhibiting negative Poisson's ratio
   are essentially used in filtration, medical devices, energy absorbing
   applications, etc. The auxetic materials excel at traditional materials
   due to better mechanical performance. This paper presents the auxetic
   fabrics produced using Helical Auxetic Yarn (HAY). The HAY was developed
   by wrapping a stiffer yarn (multifilament Kevlar) on core yarn
   (multifilament Polypropylene), by varying wrap to core angle from 8
   degrees to 20 degrees. The recent research works report the auxeticity
   of HAY woven fabric, but the scope is limited to a particular weave
   pattern with a certain warp to core angle. In this study, the developed
   HAYs were used to weave fabrics in four different weaving patterns. The
   woven fabrics were produced using HAY as warp and Kevlar as weft.
   Furthermore, auxetic effect exhibited by HAY and subsequent woven
   fabrics was studied. It was found that the lower wrap to core angle in
   HAY yielded higher auxetic effect. Moreover, the matt woven fabric
   developed using 8 degrees HAY exhibited maximum auxetic effect. The
   developed structure can be effectively used for filtration or energy
   absorbing applications.}},

Journal = {{MATERIALS RESEARCH EXPRESS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{To improve the auxeticity and isotropy behavior of standard hexachiral
   structures at large elasto-plastic deformation, the authors have earlier
   proposed a modified hexachiral structure with wavy ligaments (Zhu et al
   2018 Smart Material Structures 27 055001). While a significant
   improvement was achieved with the proposed modified chiral structure, it
   was reported therewith that its auxeticity and isotropy degrade rapidly
   at large tensile deformation, in contrast to the excellent performance
   in compression. The present work builds upon the basic structure
   proposed in (Zhu et al 2018 Smart Material Structures 27 055001), to
   further improve the mechanical behavior in tension, without compromising
   the already excellent performance achieved at large compressive
   deformation. To reduce the distortion of the central ring in a
   hexachiral structure-the deformation mechanism that degrades its
   mechanical performance in tension-a hierarchical hexachiral structure is
   proposed, where a standard hexachiral structure reinforces the central
   ring of the basic hexachiral structure in (Zhu et al 2018 Smart Material
   Structures 27 055001). A significant improvement in mechanical behavior
   over the basic structure is demonstrated, with potential applications in
   a protective system.}},

Abstract = {{Muzhailing Highway Extra-long Tunnel in Lanzhou, Gansu Province, China,
   belongs to the soft rock tunnel in the extremely high geostress area.
   During the construction process, large deformation of the soft rock
   occurred frequently. Taking the no. 2 inclined shaft of Muzhailing
   tunnel as the research object, an NPR (negative Poisson's ratio)
   constant resistance and large deformation anchor cable support system
   based on high prestress force, constant resistance, and releasing
   surrounding rock pressure was proposed. The characteristics of the
   surrounding rock under the steel arch support and NPR anchor cable
   support were compared and analyzed by using 3DEC software. A series of
   field tests were conducted in the no. 2 inclined shaft, and the rock
   strength, displacement of the surrounding rock, deep displacement of the
   surrounding rock, internal force of steel arch, and axial force of
   anchor cable were measured to study the application effect of the NPR
   anchor cable support system in tunnel engineering. Moreover, the 3DEC
   numerical simulation results were compared with the field test results.
   The research results show that the application of NPR constant
   resistance and large deformation anchor cable support system in tunnel
   engineering has achieved good results, and it plays a significant role
   in controlling the large deformation of the tunnel surrounding rock.}},

   epsilon <=-1\% but becomes negative under epsilon > 0. The deformation
   mechanism for BPO under strain depends on the mutual competition between
   the P-P attraction and P-O repulsion effect, and these two factors
   induce two different deformation pathways (one with positive PR, and the
   other with NPR). Moreover, with increasing of strain, both the decreased
   strength of P-P attraction and the increased strength of P-O repulsion
   effect modulates the PR of BPO from positive to negative.}},

Abstract = {{Metamaterials that exhibit negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) are known as
   auxetics. They laterally expand or contract when they are axially
   tensioned or compressed. A re-entrant chiral auxetic structure (RCA) is
   a recently developed structure, which combines the topological features
   of re- entrant and chiral honeycombs. Comparative study between the RCA
   structure and popular benchmarks subjected to uniaxial compression has
   been conducted experimentally and numerically. Specimens have been
   fabricated from polyamide12 (PA12) using Multi Jet Fusion (MJF).
   Numerical models have been developed using ABAQUS/Explicit and verified
   by the experiments. The experimental measurements manifest the high
   accuracy of the MJF process to produce robust components with precise
   details. It has been found that the RCA structure outperforms the other
   types of honeycombs in terms of strength and specific energy absorption
   when loaded in the Y direction, while only the tetrachiral honeycomb
   surpasses the RCA structure in terms of specific energy absorption when

Abstract = {{Helical auxetic yarns (HAYs) spun by ring spinning have a large residual
   torque, which restricts their application. To address this problem, the
   hollow-spindle covering system was adopted to prepare structurally
   stable HAYs consisting of the core yarn and the wrap yarn. Four types of
   HAYs were manufactured, and a self-designed automatic stretching device
   was prepared for recording the alteration of yarn diameter. These
   as-fabricated yarns were measured and characterized in terms of their
   deformation behavior and auxetic performance. The strain-stress curves
   of these HAYs have two peaks corresponding to their respective two
   component yarns during stretch until completely failure, and also it was
   found that the wrap component is always broken before the core yarn. By
   comparison, the maximum negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) of -2.55 was
   achieved with as-prepared HAYs composed of spandex and stainless steel
   monofilaments. Meanwhile, the structural stability of these yarns was
   discussed with respect to the residual torque, and the experimental
   results indicate that the residual torque of these HAYs is obviously
   smaller than that of conventional ring-spun yarns. These confirm the
   superiority of our proposed hollow-spindle method. Furthermore, the
   effects of the diameter of the core yarn and tensile modulus of the wrap
   yarn on the auxetic behavior were systematically investigated. It is
   found that a larger NPR can be obtained with a thicker diameter of core
   yarn and a higher tensile modulus of wrap yarn. It is also demonstrated
   that an appropriate combination of the component modulus and geometric
   parameters is essential to fabricate HAY with an obvious auxetic
   behavior.}},

Volume = {{391}},

Month = {{JUL 15}},
Abstract = {{Hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites (HOIPs) have attracted significant
   attention in recent years attributed to their outstanding physical
   properties and striking application potentials in the fields of
   photovoltaic and optoelectronic devices. For the commercialization of
   devices employing hybrid perovskite materials, their mechanical
   properties critically influence the manufacturing, processing as well as
   the device durability, and hence need to be well understood. In this
   review, we summarize recent mechanical studies of the known HOIPs.
   Firstly, we present a comprehensive account of the relationship between
   crystal structures and properties, where the influence of different
   chemical and bonding factors on the load response of HOIPs are
   extensively discussed. The functional abnormalities of HOIP materials
   under the stress stimuli are also reviewed, addressing the effects of
   negative linear compressibility, negative Poisson's ratio and
   barocaloric effect. Finally, we briefly summarize the significant effect
   of strain and stress in thin-film halide perovskite materials, which
   have been widely employed in solar cells and Light-emitting diodes. This
   review aims to raise more awareness about the fundamental understanding
   of the mechanical properties of hybrid perovskite materials, and attract
   more research attention to this interdisciplinary field. (C) 2019

   result of tensile and compressive loads respectively. By incorporating
   an additional set of rods, the modified microstructure behaves as a
   positive hygrothermal expansion material due to decrease in temperature
   and/or moisture concentration, but exhibits negative hygrothermal
   expansivity upon the increase of temperature and/or moisture
   concentration. The possibility of producing materials with behavioral
   multiplicity offers opportunities for development of materials and

   sign as well as a switch in the sign for change(s) to the environmental

Title = {{A method of failure modeling for 3D printed cellular structures}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{174}},
Month = {{JUL 15}},
Abstract = {{The paper presents a new approach for failure modeling of a cellular
   structure manufactured with a 3D printing technology. For this purpose,
   the honeycomb topology was designed and fabricated using fused
   deposition modeling of ABSplus material. The proposed method was based
   on the tiebreak contact for connecting plastic joints with cell walls.
   Additionally, two methods based on constitutive models were also
   analyzed. In the first case, an elasto-plastic material model was
   adopted, whereas in the second case an elasto-visco-plastic material
   model with damage was included. Firstly, the mechanical properties of
   ABSplus material were determined and numerically correlated with
   experimental outcomes. Subsequently, a contact parametric study was
   performed, and the optimal contact parameters were evaluated. The
   quasi-static experimental compression tests were simulated using LS-Dyna
   software. The results of actual tests and numerical analyses with three
   different methods for honeycomb structure modeling were compared in
   terms of deformation, force history, failure behavior and energy
   absorption capabilities. It was shown that the contact-based method
   resulted an in an increase of the results quality with better
   reproduction of force characteristic and progressive failure behavior
   during the deformation process, compared to other two methods. (C) 2019

Title = {{Building egg-tray-shaped graphenes that have superior mechanical
   strength and band gap}},
Journal = {{NPJ COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{JUL 11}},
Abstract = {{The major hindrances of implementing graphene in two-dimensional (2D)
   electronics are both mechanical (the tendency to crumble and form
   ripples) and electrical (the lack of a band gap). Moreover, the
   inevitable structural defects in graphene have a profound influence on
   its physical and chemical properties. Here, we propose a family of 2D
   egg-tray graphenes constructed by arranging pentagon and heptagon
   defects in the graphene lattice based on a careful analysis of the
   topological distribution of minima, maxima, and saddle points.
   First-principles calculations show that the egg-tray graphenes are
   dynamically stable, and their energies, which depend on the
   concentration of pentagons and heptagons, are the lowest among carbon
   allotropes. These 2D carbon allotropes exhibit a large variation in
   their electronic properties, ranging from semi metallic to
   semiconducting, including some allotropes that have Dirac cones in their
   band structures. Furthermore, some egg-tray graphenes are predicted to
   have negative Poisson's ratios. The adsorption of Li atoms on the
   egg-tray graphenes is considerably stronger than the adsorption on
   perfect graphene, therefore they may absorb Li more effectively than
   graphene, which is important for improving the performance of
   rechargeable Li batteries.}},

Year = {{2019}},

Abstract = {{The emergence of advanced 3D printing techniques and the recent interest
   in architected materials have sparked a surge of interest in mechanical
   metamaterials whose unusual properties are defined by their highly
   ordered microarchitectures. Mechanical metamaterials with disordered
   microarchitectures have, however, not received as much attention despite
   their inherent advantages, such as robustness against the precise
   arrangement and design parameters of individual unit cells. Here, we
   computationally studied the elastic properties of two general types of
   disordered networks, namely, lattice-restricted and unrestricted
   networks that were made of beamlike elements and possessed mean
   connectivity values, Z, ranging between 2.5 and 7. We also additively
   manufactured a number of representative networks using selective laser
   sintering and showed that their deformations are consistent with our
   computational predictions. Unrestricted networks exhibited several
   advantages over the lattice-restricted ones including a broader range of
   achievable elastic modulus-Poisson's ratio duos as well as a higher
   probability of exhibiting auxetic and double-auxetic (i.e., auxetic
   behavior in both orthogonal directions) behaviors. Most interestingly,
   we could find unrestricted auxetic networks for high connectivity levels
   of up to 4.5, while no lattice-restricted auxetic networks were found
   for any connectivity level beyond 3.5. Given the fact that, according to
   Maxwell's criterion, 3.5 is the highest Z for which both of our
   lattice-restricted and unrestricted networks are bending-dominated, we
   concluded that unrestricted networks exhibit auxetic behavior well into
   their stretch-dominated domain. This is a promising observation that
   underlines the potential of unrestricted networks for the challenging
   task of designing stiff auxetic metamaterials in the stretch-dominated
   domain (i.e., Z = 4-4.5). Published under license by AIP Publishing.}},

Title = {{A new auxetic structure with significantly reduced stress concentration

Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{173}},
Month = {{JUL 5}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic structures exhibit certain abnormal mechanical responses such as
   negative Poisson's ratios, mainly through the intertwined deformation
   attributes of inter-connected members of macro structural forms.
   Considering the relative ease of achieving complex forms with the advent
   of the additive manufacturing technologies, there is a renewed interest
   in auxetic structures, as the already established as well as new
   structural shapes are physically produced and tested to ascertain the
   theoretical predictions. While the focus was mostly around the auxetic
   responses, the stress distribution patterns and in particular the stress
   concentration effects were mostly neglected. This paper fills this gap,
   evaluating the stress concentration aspects of a standard re-entrant
   auxetic structure. A new structure is designed and proven to be less
   stressed in comparison with the re-entrant form commonly reported in the
   literature by means of analytical, experimental, and numerical results.
   The new structure proposed has proved to be more auxetic up to 15\% of
   the external strain and with Poisson's ratios up to -2.5. (C) 2019 The

Title = {{The prevalence and severity of root surface caries across Australian
   generations}},
Journal = {{COMMUNITY DENTISTRY AND ORAL EPIDEMIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{47}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Background The ``failure of success{''} theory predicts that as
   subsequent generations of older adults retain more teeth, those
   additional teeth will experience more oral disease like root surface
   caries. The theory in relation to root surface caries has never been
   tested in a cross-generational study. This study aims to compare root
   surface caries across generations of South Australian older adults to
   test the theory and explore risk indicators for root surface caries.
   Methods Data were from the baseline of two South Australian studies
   separated by 22 years. In both studies, stratified random samples of
   people aged 60+ years from Adelaide and Mount Gambier were recruited.
   Dental examinations were performed by trained and calibrated dentists.
   One of the dental examiners from the earlier study was the gold standard
   examiner in the second study. Risk indicators included behavioural
   factors, clinical oral conditions, sociodemographic and socioeconomic
   status. Root surface caries was assessed as untreated root surface
   caries (root decayed surfaces {[}RDS]), treated root surface caries
   (root filled surfaces {[}RFS]) and treated or untreated root surface
   caries (root decayed and filled surfaces {[}RDFS]) and was presented as
   the prevalence and summed count. Multivariable models for Poisson and
   negative binomial distributions were used to estimate prevalence ratios
   (PR) and mean ratios (MR), respectively, and their 95\% confidence
   intervals (95\% CI). Results The current generation of South Australian
   older adults has significantly lower RDS (PR {[}95\% CI] = 0.65
   {[}0.47-0.89]; MR {[}95\% CI] = 0.51 {[}0.35-0.73]) and RDFS (PR {[}95\%
   CI] = 0.84 {[}0.71-0.99]; MR {[}95\% CI] = 0.76 {[}0.65-0.90]) than the
   previous generation. The RFS in the previous and current generation was
   similar. Gingival recession, irregular brushing, dental visiting for a
   problem and smoking were the indicators for RDS, while age, gingival
   recession, tooth brushing frequency, time since last dental visit and
   reason of visiting were the indicators for RFS or RDFS. Conclusions
   These results do not support the ``failure of success{''} theory in
   relation to root surface caries among South Australian older adults.
   Despite the higher number of teeth retained, the current generation of
   older adults has less root surface caries than the previous generation.
   Behavioural factors remain the indicators of root surface caries across
   the generations.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To test the association between maternal perception about
   child's oral health and child dental caries experience and maternal
   self-perception about oral health. Materials and methods: A
   cross-sectional study was performed with mothers and their children aged
   six to 13 years. A questionnaire was applied to mothers. Children were
   dentally examined using the DMF-T/dmf-t Index. For analysis, Poisson
   regression models with robust variance were employed for each variable
   of interest (child dental caries experience and maternal self-report
   about oral health). Magnitudes of associations were estimated through
   Prevalence Ratio (PR) as effect measure with 95\% confidence intervals
   (CI). A significant level of p <= .05 was adopted. Results: Overall, 131
   mothers-children dyads were included. Most of children were girls
   (52.7\%) and aged between 10 to 13 years (60.3\%). Negative maternal
   perception about child's oral health was associated to maternal negative
   self-perception about oral health (PR 2.54; 95\%CI 1.54-4.30) and to
   higher child dental caries experience (PR 2.21; 95\%CI 1.41-3.47).
   Conclusion: Maternal perception about child oral health was associated
   to child dental caries and to maternal self-report about oral health.}},

Abstract = {{Negative health outcome and its relationship with length and severity of
   Childhood Sexual Abuse is well established in the literature.Until
   recently, this literature consisted disproportionately of studies of

   relevant. We aim to characterize factors related to long-term and severe
   sexual abuse among children in SAo Paulo, Brazil.We conducted a
   cross-sectional study of children up to the age of ten, referred to a
   specialty program on sexual abuse between 2004 and 2013. Length and
   severity of the abuse were tested for associations with variables
   related to the abuse using a Chi-square test, followed by the Poisson
   regression with robust variance for prevalence ratio. Most children
   experienced abuse were reliant on relatives or friends for housing
   (45\%). The time between abuse and reporting was longer when the
   perpetrator lived in the same household as the child and when abuse was
   reported by a relative or friend. Abuse was more frequent among female
   children, but longer and more severe in males. A lack of independent
   housing, parents' education and social stigma facilitated childhood
   sexual abuse by delaying reporting among our sample.}},

   initio methods, after the optimization process to get optimal structural
   parameters in most suitable magnetic phase, the electronic band
   structures with the total density of electronic states and second order
   elastic constants to predict some thermal and elastic features have been

   electronic band structures, E-g = 2.62 eV for Zn3VS4 and E-g = 1.75 eV
   for Zn3VTe4, show that our crystal systems have half-metallic character.
   Also, the calculated elastic constants prove that our compounds are
   mechanically stable due to satisfy the Born-Huang criteria. Moreover,
   the anisotropic elastic properties have been visualized in
   two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) surfaces for Young's

Abstract = {{The mechanical properties of the stent are of key importance to the
   mechanical integrity and performance reliability of stent-plaque-artery

   fabricated with SLS additive manufacturing technique. Firstly, through
   combining micro-CT tomography and image-based finite element analysis,
   the mechanical properties of as fabricated SLS stent are explored;
   Secondly, two series of stent samples are fabricated with SLS additive
   manufacturing techniques, and in-situ compression experiments are
   performed for studying the deformation mechanisms and auxetic mechanical
   behaviors of stents. Finally, effects of geometrical parameters on the
   tensile mechanical performance of these stents are studied with finite
   element analysis. The proposed chiral stent exhibits auxetic behaviors,
   and can be tailored through adjusting the unit cell design parameters,
   such as: struct numbers along circumferential directions, ligament
   lengths, and node radius.}},

Abstract = {{The paper provides a theoretical analysis of axially stretched

   crystallographic orientations parallel to the plate edges, and in the

   The analysis shows that more than fifty cubic crystals with positive
   anisotropy can form two-layered plates whose effective Young's modulus
   is greater than the moduli of both layers, which violates the well-known
   Voigt's rule of mixtures. The anomalous behavior of effective Young's
   modulus and Poisson's ratios in the plates depends on the properties of
   their constituent crystals: the sign and value of anisotropy
   coefficients and Poisson's ratio, ratio of Young's moduli, relative
   orientation angle, and layer thickness ratio.}},

Abstract = {{A novel hierarchical metamaterial with tunable negative Poisson's ratio
   is designed by a re-entrant representative unit cell (RUC), which
   consists of star-shaped subordinate cells. The in-plane mechanical
   behaviors of star-re-entrant hierarchical metamaterial are studied
   thoroughly by finite element method, non-dimensional effective moduli
   and effective Poisson's ratios (PR) are obtained, then parameters of
   cell length, inclined angle, thickness for star subordinate cell as well
   as the amount of subordinate cell along x, y directions for re-entrant
   RUC are applied as adjustable design variables to explore
   structure-property relations. Finally, the effects of the design
   parameters on mechanical behavior and relative density are
   systematically investigated, which indicate that high specific stiffness
   and large auxetic deformation can be remarkably enhanced and manipulated
   through combining parameters of both subordinate cell and parent RUC. It
   is believed that the new hierarchical metamaterial reported here will
   provide more opportunities to design multifunctional lightweight
   materials that are promising for various engineering applications.}},

Abstract = {{A rugged lithium-ion battery (LIB) can be realized without any new
   material development through selective material matching based on
   localized deformation of a substrate induced by its well-designed
   pattern. In particular, an auxetic cut flexible substrate accommodates
   various complex deformations and adaptive conformations through the
   hinge joints because the external force is highly localized in the
   hinges while the segmented motifs remain almost undeformed. The embedded
   LIB cells in undeformed regions of the auxetic cut silicon rubber sheet
   do not undergo large deformation, maintaining their battery performance
   regardless of loading conditions via the pattern-associated deformation
   mechanism. The hierarchy and number of segmentations are the key
   parameters of the deformation mechanism for auxetic cut
   shape-reconfigurable battery systems. The numerically and experimentally
   proven strategy that utilizes strain gradients induced by a patterned
   substrate as a design guideline for material matching can lead to
   various wearable and conformable designs without sacrificing the
   functionality and durability of electronic devices.}},

Abstract = {{Mechanical metamaterials have attracted great interest due their ability
   to attain material properties outside the bounds of those found in
   natural materials. Many promising mechanical metamaterials have been
   designed, fabricated, and tested, however, these metamaterials have not
   been subjected to the rigorous requirements needed to certify their use
   in demanding industrial applications that require multifunctional
   behavior. This paper details an auxetic multifunctional metamaterial
   that has been optimized to outperform conventional designs for cooling
   systems commonly used in the space, the transportation, the energy and
   the nuclear industry. Experimental tests performed to certify this
   material for use in gas turbines have shown that in comparison to
   conventional designs, the metamaterial increases structural life by
   orders of magnitude while also providing more efficient cooling and
   maintaining similar acoustic damping characteristics. This metamaterial
   offers an agile and economical solution for the realization of next
   generation components.}},

Title = {{Novel 2D metamaterials with negative Poisson's ratio and negative
   thermal expansion}},
Journal = {{EXTREME MECHANICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{30}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{It is known that metamaterials with negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) can
   be designed to possess negative thermal expansion (NTE) property.
   However, it is uncommon to use NTE structures to obtain NPR behavior. In
   this paper, based on a typical NTE unit structure, two novel
   meta-structures with auxetic behavior are proposed, which are
   demonstrated by the micro-scale mechanical experiments and numerical
   simulations. By changing the angle of the structure, the Poisson's ratio
   of the structures could be positive, zero and negative. The extreme
   negative Poisson's ratio of the structures is about -0.94. Moreover, the
   thermal expansion of the novel 2D structures can also be designed and
   modulated to be positive, zero and negative. This concept of building 2D
   metamaterials with NPR in this study would open up new avenues to
   understand and design metamaterials with NPR and NTE for potential
   engineering applications, such as smart sensors and electronic
   components. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Lithium-ion pouch battery (LIPB) is widely applied in different
   engineering fields, such as electric vehicles, aeronautics,
   astronautics, and among others. However, few complete mechanical models
   with deformation field are presented to predict internal short circuit
   (ISC) and resistance exterior force property of LIPB under exterior
   loading. In the present research, the indentation theoretical models
   with sinusoidal shape function are established to investigate resistance
   exterior force property of batteries with different positive materials
   under different punch shapes loading. The effects of indentation
   displacement and deformation region on indentation force are carried
   out. By the comparison of indentation force, present theoretical and
   numerical results are consistent with previous experimental results. The
   indentation force increases with the punch radius increase, but
   decreases with the indentation displacement increase. On the basis of
   energy conservation law, it is concluded that LIPB is more likely to
   produce mechanical failure and ISC when normalized deformation region is
   greater than or equal to 0.4 and plastic strain energy ratio is greater
   than or equal to 1.5. In addition, from resistance exterior force
   property point of view, LIPB has a better property to resist external
   force when LiMnNiCoO2, rather than LiCoO2 and Nanophosphate, is used as
   positive material. The research provides a reference for assessing the
   safety of LIPB and selecting suitable positive material, which possesses
   high energy capacity and resistance exterior force property.}},

Abstract = {{3D random Vonoroi structures with negative Poisson's ratio have been
   proposed and created numerically via finite element method using Voronoi
   tessellation technique. Negative Poisson's ratio is achieved via
   triaxial compression treatment on the Voronoi models generated using
   Matlab. The Poisson's ratio and energy absorption capacity of the
   triaxially compressed structures have been studied as a function of the
   geometrical irregularity beta and the triaxial compression ratio eta in
   a uniaxial compression setup. Results show that the Poisson's ratio of
   the structures rapidly decreases from positive to negative and achieved
   a minimum with an increasing triaxial compression ratio eta. The
   Poisson's ratio exhibited slight increase and quickly saturated with
   further increase of the triaxial compression ratio eta. A minimum nu(yz)
   of -0.366 is achieved when beta = 0.3 and eta = 20\%; whereas, a minimum
   nu(xz) of -0.347 is achieved when beta = 0.1 and eta = 10\%. The energy
   absorption capacity of the structure with a specific initial
   irregularity factor beta decreases with an increasing eta. For a
   specific eta, structures with the maximum initial irregularity factor
   beta exhibited the highest energy absorption capacity. A maximum energy
   absorption capacity is achieved in the model with an initial
   irregularity factor beta of 0.7 and a triaxial compression ratio eta of

Title = {{Subfertility among HIV-affected couples in a safer conception cohort in
   South Africa}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Subfertility among couples affected by HIV has an impact on
   the well-being of couples who desire to have children and may prolong
   HIV exposure. Subfertility in the antiretroviral therapy era and its
   determinants have not yet been well characterized.
   OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to investigate the burden and
   determinants of subfertility among HIV-affected couples seeking safer
   conception services in South Africa.
   STUDY DESIGN: Nonpregnant women and male partners in HIV seroconcordant
   or HIV discordant relationships desiring a child were enrolled in the
   Sakh'umndeni safer conception cohort at Witkoppen Clinic in Johannesburg
   between July 2013 and April 2017. Clients were followed up prospectively
   through pregnancy (if they conceived) or until 6 months of attempted
   conception, after which they were referred for infertility services.
   Subfertility was defined as not having conceived within 6 months of
   attempted conception. Robust Poisson regression was used to assess the
   association between baseline characteristics and subfertility outcomes;
   inverse probability weighting was used to account for missing data from
   women lost to safer conception care before 6 months of attempted
   conception.
   RESULTS: Among 334 couples enrolled, 65\% experienced subfertility
   (inverse probability weighting weighted, 95\% confidence interval,
   0.59-0.73), of which 33\% were primary subfertility and 67\% secondary
   subfertility. Compared with HIV-negative women, HIV-positive women not
   on antiretroviral therapy had a 2-fold increased risk of subfertility
   (weighted and adjusted risk ratio, 2.00; 95\% confidence interval,
   1.19-3.34). Infertility risk was attenuated in women on antiretroviral
   therapy but remained elevated, even after >= 2 years on antiretroviral
   therapy (weighted and adjusted risk ratio, 1.63; 95\% confidence
   interval, 0.98-2.69). Other factors associated with subfertility were
   female age (weighted and adjusted risk ratio, 1.03, 95\% confidence
   interval, 1.01-1.05 per year), male HIV-positive status (weighted and
   adjusted risk ratio, 1.31; 95\% confidence interval, 1.02-1.68), male
   smoking (weighted and adjusted risk ratio, 1.29; 95\% confidence
   interval, 1.05-1.60), and trying to conceive for >= 1 year (weighted and
   adjusted risk ratio, 1.38; 95\% confidence interval, 1.13-1.68).
   CONCLUSION: Two in 3 HIV-affected couples experienced subfertility.
   HIV-positive women were at increased risk of subfertility, even when on
   antiretroviral therapy. Both male and female HIV status were associated
   with subfertility. Subfertility is an underrecognized reproductive
   health problem in resource-limited settings and may contribute to
   prolonged HIV exposure and transmission within couples. Low-cost
   approaches for screening and treating subfertility in this population
   are needed.}},

Abstract = {{Micro-dilatation theory of elasticity is the simplest special case of
   the micromorphic theory, assuming that the micro-deformation tensor has
   the spherical form. Recently, it was shown that the micro-dilatation
   theory can be efficiently used as the continuum model of cellular
   auxetic metamaterials with re-entrant type lattice structure. Here, we
   provide a further development of this subject and present the results of
   numerical three-dimensional modeling of composite cellular metamaterials
   using the conventional lattice model and the corresponding continuum
   micro-dilatation model. We consider the two-phase metastructures which
   behave like a heterogeneous auxetic material under tension/compression
   and, at the same time, like a homogeneous material under shear. These
   results are achieved due to the absence of coupling between the
   microstructural micro-dilatation effects and the macroscopic shear
   properties of the metamaterial. The positive size effect for the
   apparent Young's modulus of the considered composite structures is
   shown. Additionally, the simple way for the finite-element
   implementation of the micro-dilatation theory in the Comsol system is
   described.}},

Abstract = {{Knowing the structures of the crust and upper mantle is fundamental for
   understanding of the geodynamics of the orogenic belt. To provide
   observational seismic evidences on deep structures of crust and mantle
   beneath the intersection zone of Nanling and Wuyi, we conduct the
   crustal imaging obtained from P-wave receiver functions. In this study,
   P-wave receiver functions are calculated using teleseismic waveforms
   recorded by 66 portable broadband stations and 24 permanent stations. We
   also obtain the crustal thickness, Poisson's ratio and image of the Moho
   interface by using the H-kappa stacking method and Common Conversion
   Point (CCP) stacking method, which indicate the variationsin crustal
   thickness and Poisson's ratio between the Yangtze block and the
   Cathaysia block.
   The results show that : (1) The average thickness of the crust is 31. 2
   km with the average Poisson's ratio of 0. 23. The study area (Both the
   Yangtze block and the Cathaysia block are) is characterized by thin
   crust and low Poisson' s ratio. Further, the thickness of crust
   gradually decreases from northwest to southeast, which is consistent
   with the regional extension of the crust. (2) Along the
   Shaoguan-Ganzhou-Jian-Nanchang profile, a strip of thin (about 28 km)
   crustal thickness is observed, indicating a southwest-northeast
   spreading, with a slight increase of the Poisson's ratio. The results
   suggest that the upwelling of mantle heat flow from the South China Sea
   leads to the formation of a weak zone in the crust and plays an
   important role in regulating the crustal stress field in the South
   China. (3) The Poisson's ratio in the Jiangnan orogenic belt is
   relatively low, with average value of two areas less than 0. 21. There
   is a weak negative correlation between the crustal thickness and the
   Poisson's ratio in the Cathaysia block, indicating a decrease of the
   proportion of the ferromagnesian lower-crust thickness in the entire
   crust with the increase of crustal thickness. The Poisson's ratio of the
   Cathaysia block is smaller than that of the Yangtze block, which may be
   related to the late formation of the crust and the multiple tectonic
   activities that have occurred since the Phanerozoic.}},

Title = {{Reduced Lower Extremity Functioning Is Associated With an Increased Rate
   of Being a Nondriver: The National Health and Aging Trends Study}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL THERAPY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{99}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Background Driving a motor vehicle is an important aspect of mobility
   for older adults. Limited lower extremity functioning performance, as
   measured by the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), has been
   associated with various negative health outcomes, but little is known
   about the association of SPPB scores with driving status.
   Objective The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether lower
   (poorer) SPPB scores are associated with an increased rate for being a
   current nondriver among a nationally representative sample of
   community-dwelling older adults.
   Design The National Health and Aging Trends Study is a longitudinal
   cohort study.
   Methods A population of 5935 participants, surveyed annually from 2011
   to 2014 for the National Health and Aging Trends Study, was used to
   examine the relationship between SPPB and driving status. Using weighted
   data, multivariable Poisson regression with generalized estimating
   equations was used to calculate the rate ratios, adjusting for
   covariates and clustering due to the complex survey design.
   Results Participants with a low (poor) SPPB score (0-5) had a rate for
   being a current nondriver 2.01 times the rate (or 101\% increase) of
   those with a high (good) SPPB score (10-12) (adjusted 95\% confidence
   interval = 1.78-2.26).
   Limitations Current nondrivers were not asked whether they planned to
   resume driving if they had not driven in the previous year.
   Conclusions Unlike other factors, such as cognitive decline, lower SPPB
   scores (poorer lower extremity functioning) are significantly associated
   with an increased rate of being a current nondriver and are a modifiable
   risk factor. Further research is needed to examine whether optimum
   exercises and other physical therapist interventions focused on
   improving lower extremity strength and balance ultimately improve
   driving outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, metal additive manufacturing (AM) are widely employed
   for industrial applications, such as: biomedical, aerospace, automotive,
   marine and offshore sections. AM demonstrated superior manufacturing
   efficiencies and economic advantages for advanced lightweight industrial
   components with unlimited arbitrary topological layouts and complex
   internal microstructures, and are also employed for fabrication of
   auxetic materials and structures. In this paper, damage
   characterizations and mechanical behaviors of selective laser melting
   (SLM) fabricated 3D re-entrant lattices are investigated based on
   in-situ interrupted micro-CT test, and simulation based on geometric
   reconstructed models are performed for exploring the underlying failure
   mechanisms. Firstly, theoretical models for predicting the mechanical
   properties of 3D re-entrant lattice are developed, such as stiffness,
   Poisson's ratio and strength, etc. Secondly, the geometrical errors and
   fabrication defects of 3D reentrant lattices are analyzed based on 3D
   micro-CT scanning, in-situ micro-CT interrupted compression tests are
   performed for studying the deformation process and failure mechanisms.
   Finally, image finite element models with the detailed information of
   the shape, position and distribution of defects of the 3D reentrant
   lattices are constructed from 3D tomographic images, and numerical
   simulations are performed for studying the effects of the defects on the
   mechanical performances of the SLM additive manufactured 3D re-entrant
   lattice structures. It is shown that the failure behavior of the
   reentrant lattice is governed not only by its topology, but also by the
   geometric defects and surface defects. Moreover, the proposed
   interrupted in-situ micro-CT mechanical loading experiments and image
   finite element approaches can also shed lights on the relations between
   fracture failure around the edge and the powder adhesion. The damage
   evolution process is compared with the numerical simulation results to
   verify the materials failure modes.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this research was to study the spatial distribution of
   Rhinostomus barbirostris (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) (Fabricius, 1775)
   in coconut (Cocos nucifera L.). They were made ten samples every two
   weeks, of males, females and the total (Male + female), R. barbirostris
   in marked traps with a nylon screen surrounded with palm trees
   characteristic symptom of the attack of this pest, totaling 24 traps. To
   study the spatial distribution of R. barbirostris, dispersion indexes
   were calculated: variance / mean ratio, Morisita index (I-delta), Green
   coefficient (C-x), k exponent of negative binomial distribution, index
   of de Cluster Size (ICS), index of de Cluster Frequency (ICF) e index of
   de Patchiness (IP) for each sample. It tested the data fitting the
   Poisson distribution and binomial negative. The results calculated in
   aggregation indexes indicate that Most samplings presented aggregated
   distribution of R. barbirostris for all the variables studied. The
   negative binomial distribution was the best model to represent the
   frequency distribution of the coconut borer, since the variance was
   higher than the average for the majority of the samples.}},

Volume = {{15}},

Pages = {{714+}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Understanding conformational change is crucial for programming and
   controlling the function of many mechanobiological and mechanical
   systems such as robots, enzymes and tunable metamaterials. These systems
   are often modelled as constituent nodes (for example, joints or amino
   acids) whose motion is restricted by edges (for example, limbs or bonds)
   to yield functionally useful coordinated motions (for example, walking
   or allosteric regulation). However, the design of desired functions is
   made difficult by the complex dependence of these coordinated motions on
   the connectivity of edges. Here, we develop simple mathematical
   principles to design mechanical systems that achieve any desired
   infinitesimal or finite coordinated motion. We specifically study
   mechanical networks of two- and three-dimensional frames composed of
   nodes connected by freely rotating rods and springs. We first develop
   simple principles that govern all networks with an arbitrarily specified
   motion as the sole zero-energy mode. We then extend these principles to
   characterize networks that yield multiple specified zero modes, generate
   pre-stress stability and display branched motions. By coupling
   individual modules, we design networks with negative Poisson's ratio and
   allosteric response. Finally, we extend our framework to networks with
   arbitrarily specifiable initial and final positions to design energy
   minima at desired geometric configurations, and create networks
   demonstrating tristability and cooperativity.}},

Abstract = {{Usual lightweight soft robotic bodies built with elastomer materials
   show lack of structural stiffness that limits their use in many
   practical applications. Herein, an architectured robotic body design
   with deformable cellular structures, which is easy to fabricate,
   lightweight, mechanically durable, and compliant while maintaining its
   resilience, is proposed. The cellular body design overcomes not only the
   stiffness limitation but also other drawbacks of most common soft bodies
   that may damage from high pressure or impact. An artificial cellular
   finger is printed together with embedded pressure sensors on the
   fingertip to form a functional system in a single-building process with
   the advantage of multi-material 3D printing. The integrated
   architectured grippers, composed of cellular fingers with a repeatable,
   reliable bending profile, demonstrate maximum gripping force as 16N on
   actuation, with gripping capability of various objects. 3D cellular
   designs open up new possibilities for architectured robotic bodies that
   can immensely widen their space of applications.}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic chiral structures consisting of circular ring nodes and
   tangentially connected ligaments are engineered systems that exhibit
   excellent flexibility, vibration attenuation, impact resistance
   performances. In this paper, the out-of-plane dynamic crash behaviors of
   anti-tetrachiral, hexachiral and hierarchical chiral structures are
   studied. The energy absorption efficiency, plateau stress, peak stress
   of chiral structures with different ligament length, node radius,
   ligament thickness and level of structural hierarchy under different
   external crashing conditions are compared, and identical mass per area
   of different unit cell configurations are assumed. It is found that
   anti-tetrachiral structure is able to generate higher plateau stress and
   better energy absorption efficiency than hexachiral structures. Making
   use of the mechanical benefits of structural hierarchy, novel
   hierarchical chiral structures are proposed for improving the crash
   energy absorption abilities of chiral structures, and relations between
   crash energy absorption performances and unit cell geometries are
   explored, such as: energy absorption efficiency, plateau stress of
   chiral structures. Based on systematical analysis, optimized chiral and
   hierarchical chiral cellular structure can be designed for impact energy
   absorption in protective sandwich structures.}},

Abstract = {{The fabrication of auxetic fabrics by using conventional yarns and
   machinery has gained extraordinary interest from researchers in recent
   years. However, to date this approach has only been adopted to fabricate
   auxetic knitted fabrics and uni-stretch auxetic woven fabrics. This
   paper reports a study that aimed to develop a new class of bi-stretch
   woven fabrics with auxetic behavior using conventional elastic and
   non-elastic yarns, and available weaving machinery. Bi-stretch auxetic
   woven fabrics were firstly designed based on a foldable geometry
   possessing negative Poisson's ratio by consideration of different design
   parameters, including the yarn float length, the placement of tight and
   loose weaves, and the arrangement of elastic and non-elastic yarns in
   the weft direction, and then fabricated on a dobby weaving machine
   equipped with multiple weft supplies and a separately controlled second
   beam assembly attachment. The fabricated fabrics were finally tested on
   a tensile machine to assess their auxetic behavior in both the warp and
   weft directions. The results showed that the bi-stretch woven fabrics
   developed exhibit negative Poisson's ratio up to -0.36 and -0.27 when
   stretched along the warp and weft directions, respectively, and could be
   applied for clothing applications that require enhanced shape fit and
   comfort.}},

Abstract = {{In many countries, specialist cancer services are centralised to improve
   outcomes. We explored how centralisation affects the radical treatment
   of high-risk and locally advanced prostate cancer in the English NHS.
   79,085 patients diagnosed with high-risk and locally advanced prostate
   cancer in England (April 2014 to March 2016) were identified in the
   National Prostate Cancer Audit database. Poisson models were used to
   estimate risk ratios (RR) for undergoing radical treatment by whether
   men were diagnosed at a regional co-ordinating centre ('hub'), for
   having surgery by the presence of surgical services on-site, and for
   receiving high dose-rate brachytherapy (HDR-BT) in addition to external
   beam radiotherapy by its regional availability. Men were equally likely
   to receive radical treatment, irrespective of whether they were
   diagnosed in a hub (RR 0.99, 95\% CI 0.91-1.08). Men were more likely to
   have surgery if they were diagnosed at a hospital with surgical services
   on site (RR 1.24, 1.10-1.40), and more likely to receive additional
   HDR-BT if they were diagnosed at a hospital with direct regional access
   to this service (RR 6.16, 2.94-12.92). Centralisation of specialist
   cancer services does not affect whether men receive radical treatment,
   but it does affect treatment modality. Centralisation may have a
   negative impact on access to specific treatment modalities.}},

Abstract = {{We experimentally determined the uniaxial compressive stress-strain
   responses of an auxetic polyurethane (PU) foam at quasi-static (0.01/s),
   intermediate (1/s, 10/s and 745/s) and high (1430/s, 1870/s and 2290/s)
   strain rates. A hydraulically driven materials testing system (MTS) was
   used to perform the experiments at the strain rate of 0.1/s, 1/s and
   10/s, while higher intermediate (745/s) and high strain-rate compressive
   loadings were introduced using long and regular Kolsky bars,
   respectively. The Poisson effect of the auxetic PU foam was also
   investigated during the experiments using a precision LED optical
   micrometer system (OMS) (0.01/s-10/s) or an ultra-high speed camera
   (745/s-2290/s). Our results show that the compressive stress-strain
   curves of the auxetic PU foam are non-linear and strain-rate sensitive.
   In all the experiments, the Poisson's ratio, with an initial negative
   value at small strains, progressively increased toward 0 as the specimen
   was further compressed. The strain-rate effect on the material's
   Poisson's ratio is also evident in our study, as the specimens subjected
   to high strain-rate loadings exhibited smaller negative Poisson's ratios
   (NPR) in absolute sense at small strains in comparing with those at
   quasi-static and intermediate strain rates.}},

Abstract = {{Materials with a negative Poisson's ratio, termed auxetic materials,
   will expand (contract) in the transverse direction when they are
   stretched (compressed) longitudinally. They provide exciting prospects
   for enhancing mechanical properties and a wide range of promising
   applications. Driven by the current demand for nano-devices with
   specific functionalities, research studies on two-dimensional auxetic
   materials with an intrinsic negative Poisson's ratio are intensively
   simulated. Herein, we summarize the recent efforts and progress in
   material discovery and property characterization on two-dimensional
   auxetic materials. We categorize the rich variety of the proposed
   two-dimensional auxetic materials based on their structures and whether
   they have been synthesized experimentally. The underlying mechanisms for
   forming a negative Poisson's ratio as well as the modulation of negative
   Poisson's ratio are discussed. Finally, we close by assessing the
   challenges and perspectives faced by future research and development of
   this compelling class of materials.}},

Abstract = {{Development and use of metamaterials have been gaining prominence in
   large part due to the possibility of creating platforms with
   ``disruptive{''} and unique optical properties. However, to date, the
   majority of such systems produced using micro or nanotechnology are
   static and can only perform certain target functions. Next-generation
   multifunctional smart optical metamaterials are expected to have tunable
   elements with the possibility of controlling the optical properties in
   real time via variation in parameters such as pressure, mechanical
   stress, and voltage or through nonlinear optical effects. Here, we
   address this challenge by developing a thermally controlled optical
   switch, based on the self-assembly of
   poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)-functionalized gold nanoparticles on a
   planar macroscale gold substrate. We show that such meta-surfaces can be
   tuned to exhibit substantial changes in the optical properties in terms
   of both wavelength and intensity, through the temperature-controlled
   variation of the interparticle distance within the nanoparticle
   monolayer as well as its separation from the substrate. This change is
   based on temperature-induced auxetic expansion and contraction of the
   functional ligands. Such a system has potential for numerous
   applications, ranging from thermal sensors to regulated light
   harnessing.}},

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional lattice structures with specific geometric features have
   been reported to have a negative Poisson's ratio, termed as auxetic
   metamaterials, that is, stretching-induced expansion in the transversal
   direction. In this paper, we designed a novel auxetic metamaterial; by
   utilizing the shape memory effect of the constituent materials, the
   in-plane moduli and Poisson's ratios can be continuously tailored.
   During deformation, the curved meshes ensure the rotation of the mesh
   joints to achieve auxetics. The rotations of these mesh joints are
   governed by the mesh curvature, which continuously changes during
   deformation. Because of the shape memory effect, the mesh curvature
   after printing can be programmed, which can be used to tune the rotation
   of the mesh joints and the mechanical properties of auxetic metamaterial
   structures, including Poisson's ratios, moduli, and fracture strains.
   Using the finite element method, the deformation of these auxetic meshes
   was analyzed. Finally, we designed and fabricated gradient/digital
   patterns and cylindrical shells and used the auxetics and shape memory
   effects to reshape the printed structures.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials possess special applications due to their unique
   negative Poisson's ratios (NPRs). As a classic 2D carbon material, the
   NPR of graphene is still deliberated. Introducing the NPR in graphene
   would increase its extraordinary properties, and the NPR together with
   other properties would bring more significant applications for graphene.
   In this Letter, on the basis of first-principles calculations, we
   reconfigure the structure of graphene, and, as an example, we propose a
   new 2D planar carbon allotrope, xgraphene, which is constructed by 5-6-7
   carbon rings. Our theoretical calculations indicate that xgraphene has
   an NPR and constitutes a broad spectrum of metal ion battery anodes with
   high performance. Its maximum storage capacities are 930/1302/744/1488
   mAh/g for Li/Na/K/Ca-ion batteries. It has low metal-ion diffusion
   energy barriers (<= 0.49 eV) and low average open-circuit voltages (<=
   0.53 V). Our density functional theory results also showed that it is
   intrinsically metallic and possesses dynamic, thermal, and mechanical
   stabilities. Its intrinsic NPR, which stems from the weakness of
   coupling of carbon-carbon bonds, is found upon loading the uniaxial
   strain along the armchair direction. This work not only opens up a new
   direction for the design of the next-generation broad-spectrum
   energy-storage materials with low cost and high performance but also
   offers a class application for auxetic materials.}},

Abstract = {{Due to their excellent physical properties and compatibility with
   micro-fabrication processes, vertically aligned carbon nanotubes
   (VA-CNTs) have been successfully integrated in various
   nano/micro-electromechanical system (NEMS/MEMS) devices, composites, and
   electronic circuits. Here, we investigate the behavior of VA-CNTs under
   electrostatic tension. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that
   electrostatic tension reorganizes the individual CNTs and increases
   their alignment, thereby increasing their stiffness, and resulting in a
   negative Poisson's ratio (NPR). High NPR values were obtained in the top
   portion of the VA-CNTs (the location of the greatest morphological
   change), while the other portions (a less significant morphological
   change) demonstrated smaller NPR values. Therefore, the electrostatic
   pressure induces an irreversible morphological change in the VA-CNTs,
   which, in turn, modifies their properties. This behavior makes VA-CNTs
   an attractive material for a wide range of micro- and nano-scale
   devices, wherein tunable mechanical properties and a versatile motion
   transformation are required. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Emergent crystals are the periodic alignment of ``emergent
   particles,{''} i.e., localized collective behavior of atoms or their
   charges, spins, or orbits. The elasticity of these novel states of
   matter suffering mechanical loads can be strikingly softer than that of
   the underlying material, showing great strain-mediated tunability.
   However, the deformation and possible failure of emergent crystals under
   strong strain, vital for realizing related applications, are hitherto
   unclear. Here we theoretically study the nonlinear elasticity and
   structural transitions of a Skyrmion crystal (SkX) suffering uniaxial
   distortion. Under moderate tension, a SkX behaves like a ductile
   material, with an exotic negative crossover elastic stiffness and a
   negative emergent Poisson's ratio at appropriate conditions of magnetic
   field. Under strong strain, we observe at most six phase transitions,
   generating four novel emergent crystals that are thermodynamically
   metastable. We argue that this nondestructive polymorphism is a general
   feature for any emergent crystals exposed to mechanical loads.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the quasi-static compression behavior of graded metallic
   auxetic reentrant honeycomb was firstly studied. Using the selective
   laser melting method, the unidirectionally-graded auxetic honeycomb
   (UGAH) and bidirectionally-graded auxetic honeycomb (BGAH) with the
   equal mass were fabricated to conduct the compression tests. The
   deformation mode, crushing stress and Poisson's ratio distribution of
   graded auxetic honeycombs were presented. Experiment results showed that
   the compression behavior of graded auxetic honeycomb was different from
   that of graded honeycomb with positive Poisson's ratio owing to the
   horizontal shrinkage deformation and the gradient distribution had
   effects on the crushing stress and Poisson's ratio. Then, a finite
   element (FE) model of the graded auxetic honeycomb was established and
   the calculation results were systematically compared with the
   experimental results. The effects of gradient distribution on the energy
   dissipation characteristics of the graded auxetic honeycomb were
   studied, The results showed that the energy dissipation of the UGAH was
   lower than that of the BGAH before the graded layer with the maximum
   cell-wall thickness was densified.}},

Abstract = {{Graphene-derived macroscopic assemblies feature hierarchical nano-and
   microstructures that provide numerous routes for surface and interfacial
   functionalization achieving unconventional material properties. We
   report that the microstructural hierarchy of pristine chemically
   modified graphene films, featuring wrinkles, delamination of
   close-packed laminates, their ordered and disordered stacks, renders
   remarkable negative Poisson's ratios ranging from -0.25 to -0.55. The
   mechanism proposed is validated by the experimental characterization and
   theoretical analysis. Based on the understanding of microstructural
   origins, pre-strech is applied to endow chemically modified graphene
   films with controlled negative Poisson's ratios. Modulating the wavy
   textures of the inter-connected network of close-packed laminates in the
   chemically modified graphene films also yields finely-tuned negative
   Poisson's ratios. These findings offer the key insights into rational
   design of films constructed from two-dimensional materials with negative
   Poisson's ratios and mechanomutable performance.}},

Abstract = {{This paper attempts to disclose the mechanical behavior and deformation
   performance of the resin anchor of the roadway in high temperature, deep

   strength, elastic modulus, Poisson's ratio and rheological performance
   of the anchoring resin under thermomechanical coupling, and compares the
   pull-out and rheological performances of the resin anchored layer under
   different temperatures and stresses. The results show that: With the
   increase in test temperature, the anchoring resin witnessed a gradual
   decline in its compressive strength and yield stress, a continuous
   decrease of its elastic modulus, a gradual growth in the Poisson's
   ratio, and a reduction in the yield point; The rheological deformation
   of the anchoring resin is affected by test temperature and stress; There
   is a negative correlation between the ambient temperature and the
   pull-out force needed to displace the anchoring resin by a certain
   distance, under the high temperature environment; In high-temperature,
   deep mines, anchoring resin is significantly affected by the ambient

Abstract = {{Magnesium diboride gained significant interest in the materials science
   community after the discovery of its superconductivity, with an
   unusually high critical temperature of 39 K. Many aspects of the
   electronic properties and superconductivity of bulk MgB2 and thin sheets
   of MgB2 have been determined; however, a single layer of MgB2 has not
   yet been fully theoretically investigated. Here, we present a detailed
   study of the structural, electronic, vibrational, and elastic properties
   of monolayer MgB2, based on ab initio methods. First-principles
   calculations reveal the importance of reduction of dimensionality on the
   properties of MgB2 and thoroughly describe the properties of this novel
   2D material. The presence of a negative Poisson ratio, higher density of
   states at the Fermi level, and a good dynamic stability under strain
   make the MgB2 monolayer a prominent material, both for fundamental
   research and application studies.}},

Abstract = {{Guidelines for trip and parking generation in the United States come
   mainly from the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE). However,
   their trip and parking manuals focus on suburban locations with limited
   transit and pedestrian access. This study aims to determine how many
   fewer vehicle trips are generated and how much less parking demand is
   generated, by different housing types (single-family attached,
   single-family detached, and apartment and condo) and in different
   settings (from low density suburban environments to compact, mixed-use
   urban environments). Using household travel survey data from 30 diverse
   regions of the United States, we estimate a multilevel negative binomial
   model of vehicle trip generation and a multilevel Poisson model of
   vehicle ownership, vehicle trip generation and vehicle ownership being
   logically modelled as count variables. The models have the expected
   signs on their coefficients and have respectable explanatory power.
   Vehicle trip generation and vehicle ownership (and hence parking demand)
   decrease with the compactness of neighbourhood development, measured
   with a principal component that depends on activity density, land use
   diversity, percentage of four-way intersections, transit stop density
   and employment accessibility (after controlling for sociodemographic
   variables). The models capture the phenomena of trip degeneration' and
   car shedding' as development patterns become more compact. Reducing the
   number of required parking spaces, and vehicle trips for which
   mitigation is required, creates the potential for significant savings
   when developing urban projects. Guidelines are provided for using study
   results in transportation planning.}},

Journal = {{POLYMERS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{This paper reports the auxetic behavior of modified conventional
   non-woven fabric. The auxetic behavior of fabric was achieved by forming
   rotating square unit geometry with a highly ordered pattern of slits by
   laser cutting. Two commercial needle-punched non-woven fabric used as
   lining and the reinforcement fabric for the footwear industry were
   investigated. The influence of two rotating square unit sizes was
   analyzed for each fabric. The original and modified fabric samples were
   subjected to quasi-static tensile load by using the Tinius Olsen testing
   machine to observe the in-plane mechanical properties and deformation
   behavior of tested samples. The tests were recorded with a full
   high-definition (HD) digital camera and the video recognition technique
   was applied to determine the Poisson's ratio evolution during testing.
   The results show that the modified samples exhibit a much lower breaking
   force due to induced slits, which in turn limits the application of such
   modified fabric to low tensile loads. The samples with smaller rotating
   cell sizes exhibit the highest negative Poisson's ratio during tensile
   loading through the entire longitudinal strain range until rupture.
   Non-woven fabric with equal distribution and orientation of fibers in
   both directions offer better auxetic response with a smaller
   out-of-plane rotation of rotating unit cells. The out-of-plane rotation
   of unit cells in non-homogenous samples is higher in machine direction.}},

Abstract = {{The limited range of mechanical responses achievable by materials
   compatible with additive manufacturing hinders the 3D printing of
   continuum soft robots with programmed motion. This paper describes the
   rapid design and fabrication of low-density, 3D-architected soft
   machines (ASMs) by combining Voronoi tessellation and additive
   manufacturing. On tendon-based actuation, ASMs deform according to the
   topologically encoded buckling of their structure to produce a wide
   range of motions (contraction, twisting, bending, and cyclic motion).
   ASMs exhibiting densities as low as 0.094 g cm(-3) (approximate to 8\%
   of bulk polymer) can be rapidly built by the stereolithographic 3D
   printing of flexible photopolymers or the injection molding of
   elastomers. The buckling of ASMs can be programmed by inducing gradients
   in the thickness of their flexible beams or by the localized enlargement
   of the Voronoi cells to generate complex motions such as multi-finger
   gripping or quadrupedal locomotion. The topological architecture of
   these low-density soft robots confers them with the stiffness necessary
   to recover their original shape even after ultrahigh compression (400\%)
   and extension (500\%). ASMs expand the range of mechanical properties
   currently achievable by 3D printed or molded materials to enable the
   fabrication of soft machines with auxetic mechanical metamaterial
   properties.}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{We introduce a new type of auxetic material with ultrahigh strength and
   ductility that mimics the crystal structures of two natural solids:
   a-cristobalite and LaNiO3/SrTiO3 superlattice (or ABO(3) perovskite).
   The fabrication method is based on wire-woven metals. Namely, this new
   auxetic material is fabricated by forming helical wires, assembling them
   into a wire-woven structure, and then filling the tetrahedron or
   octahedron cells with another solid. The structure is then transformed
   similar to the crystal structure of one of the two natural auxetic
   solids, mentioned above. We evaluate the mechanical and auxetic
   properties of the material through compression tests on the specimens
   made of aluminum, followed by numerical analyses. Unlike previous
   auxetic materials, this material can be mass produced and can absorb
   ultrahigh energy, needed for heavy duty applications such as a sandwich
   core of military amour, because the raw material is metallic wire and
   the fabrication process is uncomplicated, merely comprising conventional
   metal forming and heat treatment.}},

Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{2}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The crystal structure and mechanical properties of silver oxalate,
   AgC2O4, are determined using first-principles solid-state methods. The
   set of calculated mechanical properties include the bulk modulus and its
   pressure derivatives, the Young and shear moduli, the Poisson's Ratio
   and the ductility, hardness, and anisotropy indices. Silver oxalate is a
   highly anisotropic brittle material possessing a small bulk modulus of
   approximate to 9.6 GPa. It displays the negative Poisson's ratio (NPR)
   phenomenon, the value of the lowest NPR having a very large magnitude,
   -1.27. Besides, it exhibits the most extreme form of the negative linear
   compressibility (NLC) phenomenon found to date. Silver oxalate displays
   anisotropic NLC for external pressures in the range -0.1 to -2.4 GPa
   directed along the {[}010] crystallographic direction and isotropic NLC
   for isotropic pressures in the range -0.51 to 13.4 GPa. The lowest value
   of the negative compressibility, -831.9 +/- 10 TPa-1, is found for an
   isotropic pressure of -0.16 GPa. The absolute value of the computed
   lowest NLC is extremely large, about three times larger than the
   absolute value ofthe lowest NLC found so far. The NLC pressure range is
   also very wide, its width being more than two times the largest range
   found to date.}},

Abstract = {{Rationale: National guidelines have laid out a process to conflict
   resolution in cases of potentially inappropriate medical interventions.
   Objectives: To determine the association between information about a
   process-based approach and lay public perceptions of the appropriateness
   of withholding medically inappropriate interventions.
   Methods: Respondents from a nationwide sample completed a survey with
   two adult intensive care unit-based vignettes: one about advanced cancer
   where doctors told the family that additional chemotherapy would not be
   offered, and a second case of multiorgan failure after brain hemorrhage
   where dialysis would not be offered. Participants were randomly assigned
   to see or not see information about a detailed process for the
   determination to withhold (second opinion, ethics consultation,
   exploring transfer to another institution). The primary outcome was the
   perceived appropriateness of not providing the treatment (four-point
   scale, dichotomized for analysis, modified Poisson regression), and the
   secondary outcome was the negative emotional reaction to the case
   positive and negative affect schedule, range 1-5, higher is greater
   negative emotional response, linear regression).
   Results: A total of 1,191 respondents were included. Providing detailed
   process information increased the perceived appropriateness of
   withholding treatment by approximately 10 percentage points in each
   vignette: (chemotherapy, 75.7-85.4\%; dialysis, 68.0-79.3\%). Process
   information remained associated with perceived appropriateness of
   withholding treatment after adjustment for order effects and
   prespecified respondent characteristics (chemotherapy: prevalence ratio,
   1.13; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI], 1.07-1.19) (dialysis: prevalence
   ratio, 1.17; 95\% CI, 1.10-1.25). Process information was not associated
   with emotional response to the cases (chemotherapy: beta = -0.04; 95\%
   CI, -0.16 to 0.09) (dialysis: beta = -0.02; 95\% CI, -0.14 to 0.10; both
   adjusted for order effects).
   Conclusions: Providing process-based conflict resolution information
   increased public acceptance of determinations of medical futility,
   supporting the practice outlined in national consensus statements.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{PET images often suffer poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Our objective
   is to improve the SNR of PET images using a deep neural network (DNN)
   model and MRI images without requiring any higher SNR PET images in
   training. Our proposed DNN model consists of three modified U-Nets
   (3U-net). The PET training input data and targets were reconstructed
   using filtered-backprojection (FBP) and maximum likelihood expectation
   maximization (MLEM), respectively. FBP reconstruction was used because
   of its computational efficiency so that the trained network not only
   removes noise, but also accelerates image reconstruction. Digital brain
   phantoms downloaded from BrainWeb were used to evaluate the proposed
   method. Poisson noise was added into sinogram data to simulate a 6 min
   brain PET scan. Attenuation effect was included and corrected before the
   image reconstruction. Extra Poisson noise was introduced to the training
   inputs to improve the network denoising capability. Three independent
   experiments were conducted to examine the reproducibility. A lesion was
   inserted into testing data to evaluate the impact of mismatched MRI
   information using the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR). The negative impact
   on noise reduction was also studied when miscoregistration between PET
   and MRI images occurs. Compared with 1U-net trained with only PET
   images, training with PET/MRI decreased the mean squared error (MSE) by
   31.3\% and 34.0\% for 1U-net and 3U-net, respectively. The MSE reduction
   is equivalent to an increase in the count level by 2.5 folds and 2.9
   folds for 1U-net and 3U-net, respectively. Compared with the MLEM
   images, the lesion CNR was improved 2.7 folds and 1.4 folds for 1U-net
   and 3U-net, respectively. The results show that the proposed method
   could improve the PET SNR without having higher SNR PET images.}},

Journal = {{DRUG SAFETY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{42}},

Abstract = {{Introduction It is important to monitor the safety profile of drugs, and
   mining for strong associations between drugs and adverse events is an
   effective and inexpensive method of post-marketing safety surveillance.
   Objective The objective of our work was to compare the accuracy of both
   common and innovative methods of data mining for pharmacovigilance
   purposes.
   Methods We used the reference standard provided by the Observational
   Medical Outcomes Partnership, which contains 398 drug-adverse event
   pairs (165 positive controls, 233 negative controls). Ten methods and
   algorithms were applied to the US FDA Adverse Event Reporting System
   data to investigate the 398 pairs. The ten methods include popular
   methods in the pharmacovigilance literature, newly developed
   pharmacovigilance methods as at 2018, and popular methods in the
   genome-wide association study literature. We compared their performance
   using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plot, area under the
   curve (AUC), and Youden's index.
   Results The Bayesian confidence propagation neural network had the
   highest AUC overall. Monte Carlo expectation maximization, a method
   developed in 2018, had the second highest AUC and the highest Youden's
   index, and performed very well in terms of high specificity. The
   regression-adjusted gamma Poisson shrinkage model performed best under
   high-sensitivity requirements.
   Conclusion Our results will be useful to help choose a method for a
   given desired level of specificity. Methods popular in the genome-wide
   association study literature did not perform well because of the
   sparsity of data and will need modification before their properties can
   be used in the drug-adverse event association problem.}},

Title = {{Size-dependence of Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio: Effects of
   material dispersion}},

Volume = {{133}},
Pages = {{111-119}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Here, we demonstrate that the Young's modulus (E) and Poisson's ratio
   (nu) are not only material-dependent but also size-dependent. The
   interplay between the size dependence of E and nu and the dispersion
   characteristics of the material is revealed. An experimental approach is
   developed to capture the size-dependence of E and nu based on material's
   dispersion characteristics. This experimental approach is supported by a
   theoretical approach, which implements a nonlocal model with two
   independent nonlocal fields. A unique material dispersion parameter (R)
   that measures the contrast between the material dispersions in
   longitudinal and transverse directions is developed. This parameter is
   used to scale the size-dependence of E and nu of various monocrystals
   and define the conditions of the material stability. It is revealed that
   the material is stable with positive stiffnesses when 0 < R < 0.865.
   When R > 0.865, the material possesses a negative bulk modulus, and it
   is yet stable if it is constrained. The material is unstable when R is
   imaginary. The material is auxetic (with a negative Poisson's ratio)
   only when 0.7 < R < 1. The implementations of the two approaches to Ag,
   Au, Cu, Pt, and Si monocrystals highlight that values of E and nu
   strongly depend on the material's size and the contrast between its
   longitudinal and transverse dispersions.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated whether alcohol use influences periodontal

   those participants who took part in both the Health 2000 Survey and the
   Follow-up Study on Finnish Adults' Oral Health. The participants at
   baseline were aged >= 30 yr, periodontally healthy, and did not have
   diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis. The development of periodontal pockets
   at follow-up was measured as the number of teeth with periodontal
   pockets and the presence of periodontal pockets. Alcohol use at baseline
   was measured as g/wk, frequency, and use over the risk limit. Incidence
   rate ratios with 95\% CI were estimated using negative binomial
   regression models and Poisson regression models with a robust variance
   estimator. No consistent association was found between any of the
   alcohol variables and periodontal pocket development in the total
   population or among non-smokers. Among smokers, a positive association
   was found with the frequency of alcohol use. In general, risk estimates
   were slightly higher for women than for men. In summary,
   light-to-moderate alcohol use appears not to be consistently associated
   with the development of periodontal pockets. The adverse effects on the
   periodontium seem, to some extent, to be dependent on gender and

Abstract = {{Auxetic structures exhibit negative Poisson's ratios based on the

   implementation and experimental validation were limited due to the
   difficulties in manufacturing the complex structural forms. Practical
   realization of true auxetic structural solutions attained a great
   impetus with the advent of the additive manufacturing solutions, opening
   up wider opportunities and renewed interests. The current research is an
   attempt towards enhancing the auxetic nature of a square grid structure
   by numerical and experimental methods. Finite element simulations
   allowed to identify structural changes for improved auxeticity and
   experimental validation based on selective laser melted structures
   proved the trends to be true. Experimental results based on the

Abstract = {{Bayesian optimization (BO) is a global optimization method that has the
   potential for design optimization. However, in classical BO algorithm,
   the variables are considered as continuous. In real-world engineering
   problems, both continuous and discrete variables are present. In this
   work, an efficient approach to incorporate discrete variables to BO is
   proposed. In the proposed constrained mixed-integer BO method, the
   sample set is decomposed into smaller clusters during sequential
   sampling, where each cluster corresponds to a unique ordered set of
   discrete variables, and a Gaussian process regression (GP) metamodel is
   constructed for each cluster. The model prediction is formed as the
   Gaussian mixture model, where the weights are computed based on the
   pair-wise Wasserstein distance between clusters and gradually converge
   to an independent GP as the optimization process advances. The
   definition of neighborhood can be flexibly and manually defined to
   account for independence between clusters, such as in the case of
   categorical variables. Theoretical results are provided in concert with
   two numerical and engineering examples, and two examples for
   metamaterial developments, including one fractal and one auxetic
   metamaterials, where the effective properties depend on both the
   geometry and the bulk material properties.}},

   GPa directed along the direction of minimum Poisson ratio. The main
   purpose of this communication is to show that the croconic acid also
   exhibits the NLC phenomenon when submitted to isotropic pressures. The a
   lattice parameter of croconic acid increases for applied isotropic
   pressures in the range from 0.41 GPa to 0.46 GPa. The computed

Month = {{MAY 29}},
Abstract = {{This paper deals with the effect of unit cell configuration on the
   energy absorption response of different cellular auxetic structures
   subjected to quasi-static and dynamic loadings through the experimental
   and numerical methods. Among the various structures, a re-entrant
   structure was selected due to its fundamental properties underlying the
   main characteristics of an auxetic material. Computer simulation
   techniques using ABAQUS software validated by experimental testing were
   used to conduct the evaluation of such devices. Several re-entrant
   structures with different geometrical parameters were modeled and
   compared with the conventional ones. Standard compression tests were
   carried out on the different structures produced by the 3D printing
   machine to evaluate the influence of auxeticity phenomenon in the energy
   absorption capability. It is discovered that the auxetic structures are
   superior to non-auxetic structures in terms of all studied impact
   resistance and energy absorption indicators due to their ability to
   withstand quasi-static axial impact loads. The primary outcome of this
   research is to extract design information for the use of auxetic
   materials as energy absorbers where quasi-static loading is expected.}},

Title = {{Realizing negative Poisson's ratio in spring networks with close-packed
   lattice geometries}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 24}},
Abstract = {{Previously, auxetic materials were realized by designing building blocks
   with specific geometries or tuning topology of spring networks. Here, we
   propose a new approach by properly manipulating the disorder, especially
   the bond stiffness disorder, of an unstressed spring network. When
   randomly distorting a spring network initially with a close-packed
   lattice structure, we find that the resultant unstressed network becomes
   auxetic. Resulted from the distortion, longer bonds are likely to
   contribute more to the shear modulus but less to the bulk modulus.
   Inspired by this correlation, we realize isotropic auxeticity in the
   unstressed triangular lattice, by distributing each bond a spring
   constant according to a virtual lattice distortion. In the perspective
   of previous approaches, however, it is not straightforward to figure out
   how the close-packed lattices can be turned into auxetic independent of
   directions. The key of our approach is the correlated disorder induced
   by the (virtual) lattice distortion, which leads to a sufficiently large
   nonaffine contribution responsible to the auxeticity.}},

Abstract = {{The experimentally verified negative Poisson's ratio of black phosphorus

Abstract = {{Recently, beta-Te {[}atomically two-dimensional (2D) tellurium] with
   rectangular crystal structure has been synthesized successfully on
   highly oriented pyrolytic graphite substrates by using molecular beam
   epitaxy {[}Z. Zhu et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 119, 106101 (2017); Chen et
   al., Nanoscale 9, 15945 (2017)]. It has been found to possess remarkable
   properties such as ultralow lattice thermal conductivity and high
   thermoelectric efficiency. Based on first-principles calculations, we
   study the thermal expansion and thermodynamic properties of the
   experimental phase monolayer beta-Te, using the quasiharmonic approach.
   It is found that beta-Te shows large positive thermal expansion at
   elevated temperature, while the linear thermal expansion coefficient is
   negative along the a direction at very low temperature. The linear
   thermal expansion coefficient along the b direction is 4.9 x 10(-5) K-1
   at 500 K, which is considerably large in 2D materials. beta-Te exhibits
   strong in-plane anisotropy, including thermal expansion, 2D elastic
   moduli, and Poisson's ratios. However, the elastic moduli, Poisson's
   ratios and the in-plane anisotropy are weakened with increasing
   temperature, and the variations are dominated by the generalized mode
   Gruneisen parameters.}},

   It has generally been recommended, however, that inference be carried

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on a systematic isogeometric design approach for the
   optimal petal form and size characterization of tetra-petals auxetics,
   considering both plane stress and plane strain conditions. The
   underlying deformation mechanism of a tetra-petals auxetic is analyzed
   numerically with respect to several key parameters. Design optimizations
   are performed systematically to give bounding graphs for the minimum
   Poisson's ratio achievable with different stiffness constraints. Tunable
   design studies with targeted effective Poisson's ratio, shear modulus
   and stiffness are demonstrated. Potential application for functionally
   graded lattice structures is presented. Numerical and experimental
   verifications are provided to verify the designs. The out-of-plane
   buckling phenomenon in tension for thin auxetics with re-entrant
   features is illustrated experimentally to draw caution to results
   obtained using plane stress formulations for designing such structures.

Abstract = {{The aim of the present study was to initiate an investigation based on
   the design of a thin sandwich panel with an auxetic (i.e. exhibiting
   negative Poisson's ratio) lattice core using wood composites and 3D
   print technology. The sandwich panels were fabricated by attaching the
   3D LayWooden pyramidal truss structures to HDF face sheets with the PVCa
   adhesive. The mechanical strengths and failure mechanisms under bending
   load were estimated experimentally, analytically and numerically. The
   results showed that the mechanical properties of beams increase with an
   increasing inclination angle of struts and/or relative density of the
   core. No signs of damage were observed, such as face sheet crushing (FC)

   borophene reveals an unexpected rich magnetism and polymorphism. A

   the buckling and coupling among three atomic layers are not only
   responsible for magnetism, but also result in an out-of-plane negative

   material possessing auxetic and magnetic properties simultaneously.}},

   the likelihood function. The likelihood ratio procedure is used to
   evaluate the adequacy of a postulated parametric functional form for the
   continuous covariate effect. An extensive simulation study is conducted
   to assess the finite-sample performance of the proposed test. The

   Their thermodynamic stabilities are confirmed by cohesive energy
   calculations. Their band alignments compared with the O-2/O-2(-) redox
   potential suggest an improved chemical stability toward oxidative
   degradation in ambient conditions. These new mixed-phase phosphorene
   allotropes show attractive anisotropric electronic and mechanical
   properties. In particular, gamma delta-P shows the narrowest band gap
   (0.80 eV based on HSE06 calculations) and the highest negative Poisson
   ratio among all mixed and basic phosphorenes reported to date. The gamma

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{31}},

Month = {{MAY 1}},
Abstract = {{The mechanical properties of the uranyl squarate monohydrate material,
   (UO2) (C4O4) center dot H2O, were studied using theoretical solid-state
   methods based in density functional theory employing plane waves and
   pseudopotentials. Very demanding calculation parameters were utilized in
   order to obtain a realistic description of the mechanical behavior of
   this material. Since the determination of the positions of the hydrogen
   atoms in the unit cell of uranyl squarate monohydrate was not possible
   from x-ray diffraction data by structure refinement, they were fully
   optimized theoretically. The computed lattice parameters, bond
   distances, angles, and x-ray powder diffraction patterns of this
   material were in very good agreement with the experimental data. This
   material was found to be mechanically and dynamically stable since the
   corresponding stability conditions were satisfied. The values of the
   bulk modulus and its pressure derivatives, shear and Young moduli,
   Poisson ratio, ductility, hardness, and mechanical anisotropy indices of
   this material were reported. Furthermore, this study showed that this
   material exhibits the important negative Poisson ratio (NPR) and
   negative linear compressibility (NLC) phenomena. Uranyl squarate
   monohydrate is a very anisotropic brittle material characterized by a
   bulk modulus of similar to 33 GPa, which shows a minimum value of the
   NPR of the order of -0.5. Besides, this material displays NLC values for
   a limited range of positive pressures, from 0.025 GPa to 0.094GPa,
   applied along the direction of minimum negative Poisson ratio. The
   analysis of the crystal structure as a function of pressure demonstrates
   that the mechanism of NIP. of this material is associated to the change
   in shape of the uranyl pentagonal bipyramids and unrelated to the
   wine-rack structural mechanism commonly used to rationalize this
   phenomenon.}},

Abstract = {{Crustal extension in graben takes place by normal (+strike-slip)
   faulting, yet the physical processes involved are poorly understood. A
   series of shallow large earthquakes struck the Kumamoto area of Kyushu,
   Japan, in 2016. The M(w)7.0 main shock was a slip along the southern
   boundary of the Beppu-Shimabara Graben, where NS-extensional crustal
   deformation is now taking place. We conducted a tomographic inversion
   for crustal P and S velocities and Poisson's ratio (V-p, V-s, and sigma)
   in Kyushu. The most outstanding feature in this region is a
   Beppu-Shimabara Graben-parallel belt of low V-p and V-s anomalies at
   depths of the upper crust. We find that within the belt dV(s)/V-s
   approximate to dV(p)/V-p (<0) in marked contrast to relations in other
   low-velocity regions where |dV(s)/V-s|>|dV(p)/V-p|. This observation can
   be interpreted as due to water-saturated, oblate-spheroid pores with
   either of two very different geometries: one almost round pore and the
   other very flat pore. We calculate 3-D density anomaly distributions and
   2-D gravity anomaly profiles for these two pore models. The gravity
   anomaly map calculated for spherical pores shows a significant negative
   anomaly belt that spatially agrees with observed Bouguer anomaly map.
   The spatial agreement is very poor if pores are modeled as flat. This
   and extensive seismicity within Beppu-Shimabara Graben imply
   significance of fault-associated round pore formation in the process of
   graben opening. Seismic tomography combined with gravity and
   poroeasticty analyses can constrain the crack/pore state of
   extensionally deforming crust.}},

Abstract = {{A transversely isotropic multilayered half-space is considered as a
   support of a massless circular rigid foundation undergoing forced
   vibrations. The problem formulation adopts the axes of material symmetry
   of layers with the half-space aligned depth-wise. The problem solution
   involves two coupled wave equations accompanied by mixed boundary
   conditions. Employing the influence functions, which contain the effects
   of the entire domain, i.e. reflecting and refracting phenomena as a
   consequence of the inhomogeneity of media, the governing equations
   reduce to a set of Fredholm integral equations of the second kind, which
   are then solved numerically. To illustrate the method's accuracy, a
   comparison between the result of this study and the existing solutions
   for the vibration of a foundation on a layered isotropic half-space is
   given. Also, the result of the vibration of the disc on a transversely
   isotropic half-space is determined and compared to the available
   solution in the literature To explore the effect of stratification as
   well as material anisotropy on wave motion, dispersion curves
   corresponding to surface waves are shown. These curves indicate the
   existence of limiting values for both small and large values of
   wavenumbers as compared to layers' thicknesses. Also, exploring the
   effect of various material properties (e.g., the negative Poisson ratio)
   and different layers' arrangements, it is found that the impedance
   functions of the multilayered medium are closely related to the
   frequency of excitation while showing almost no sensitivity to
   properties of the half-space and, in particular, for rocking motion. (C)

Abstract = {{An investigation of Poisson's ratios and band gap behaviors of 2D
   hierarchical re-entrant lattice structures is conducted using finite
   element method (FEM). The structure with a hierarchy order n (n >= 1) is
   constructed by replacing each outmost vertex of the re-entrant octagons
   of a hierarchical structure of hierarchy order n-1 with a smaller
   self-similar re-entrant octagon. The dispersion relation and
   transmission spectrum of the proposed hierarchical structures are
   analyzed based on the Bloch's theorem. The effects of geometrical
   parameters, order of rotational symmetry and orientation angle of some
   types of re-entrant polygon cores on the lattice Poisson's ratio and
   band gap structures are also investigated. Results show that the
   re-entrant structures with first order hierarchy exhibit a wider band
   gap and a stronger attenuation effect compared with structures without
   structural hierarchy. The first order 2D hierarchical re-entrant
   structure with a negative Poisson's ratio of -0.032 exhibits the widest
   band gap, 17.8\% wider than that of the zeroth order 2D re-entrant
   structure. The order of rotational symmetry and the orientation angle of
   the re-entrant polygon cores of the lattice have a strong impact on the
   lattice Poisson's ratio and band structures.}},

Abstract = {{The PSI-graphene, a two-dimensional structure, was a novel carbon
   allotrope. In this paper, based on molecular dynamics simulation, the
   effects of stretching direction, temperature and vacancy defects on the
   mechanical properties of PSI-graphene were studied. We found that when
   PSI-graphene was stretched along 0 degrees and 90 degrees at 300 K, the
   ultimate strength reached a maximum of about 65 GPa. And when stretched
   along 54.2 degrees and 155.2 degrees at 300 K, the Young's modulus had
   peaks, which were 1105 GPa and 2082 GPa, respectively. In addition, when
   the temperature was raised from 300 K to 900 K, the ultimate strength in
   all directions was reduced. The fracture morphology of PSI-graphene
   stretched at different angles was also shown in the text. In addition,
   the number of points removed from PSI-graphene sheet also seriously
   affected the tensile properties of the material. It was found that,
   compared with graphene, PSI-graphene didn't have the negative Poisson's
   ratio phenomenon when it was stretched along the direction of 0 degrees,
   11.2 degrees, 24.8 degrees and 34.7 degrees. Our results provided a
   reference for studying the multi-angle stretching of other carbon
   structures at various temperatures.}},

Abstract = {{The combined influence of material auxeticity, strain and lateral
   boundary condition on the longitudinal wave speed in a prismatic rod of
   circular cross-section is developed herein. The lateral surface of the
   rod is elastically restrained in the radial direction such that twisting
   and bending are prevented while the axial displacement is fully
   permitted. As such, the imposition of zero and infinite radial spring
   stiffness reduces this model into longitudinal wave motion in a
   prismatic rod with free side surface and a plane wave of dilatation,
   respectively. The wave speed was made dimensionless by two ways, i.e. by
   normalizing against the elementary wave speed in prismatic rods and
   against the speed of plane waves of dilatation. Both approaches
   demonstrate the manner by which the wave speed transits between the two
   extreme lateral boundary conditions: from being a purely rod (1D stress
   with 3D strain) to a purely bulk (3D stress with 1D strain) wave motion,
   with the strain and material properties taken into consideration.
   Results indicate that the wave speed is increased by (a) greater radial
   elastic restraint stiffness, (b) more positive longitudinal strain, and
   (c) the higher Poisson's ratio magnitude of the rod material. These
   results also suggest that the adjustment of wave speed is more easily
   controlled in the auxetic region than in the conventional region.}},

Abstract = {{Objective Faecal immunochemical tests (FITs) are replacing guaiac faecal
   occult blood tests (gFOBTs) for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening.
   Incidence of interval colorectal cancer (iCRC) following a negative
   stool test result is not yet known. We aimed to compare incidence of
   iCRC following a negative FIT or gFOBT.
   Design We searched Ovid Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, Science
   Citation Index, PubMed and Google Scholar from inception to 12 December
   2017 for citations related to CRC screening based on stool tests. We
   included studies on FIT or gFOBT iCRC in averagerisk screening
   populations. Main outcome was pooled incidence rate of iCRCs per 100 000
   person-years (p-y). Pooled incidence rates were obtained by fitting
   randomeffect Poisson regression models.
   Results We identified 7 426 records and included 29 studies.
   Meta-analyses comprised data of 6 987 825 subjects with a negative test
   result, in whom 11 932 screen-detected CRCs and 5 548 gFOBT or FIT iCRCs
   were documented. Median faecal haemoglobin (Hb) positivity cut-off used
   was 20 (range 10-200) mu g Hb/g faeces in the 17 studies that provided
   FIT results. Pooled incidence rates of iCRC following FIT and gFOBT were
   20 (95\% CI 14 to 29; I2= 99\%) and 34 (95\% CI 20 to 57; I2= 99\%) per
   100 000 p-y, respectively. Pooled incidence rate ratio of FIT versus
   gFOBT iCRC was 0.58 (95\% CI 0.32 to 1.07; I2= 99\%) and 0.36 (95\% CI
   0.17 to 0.75; I2= 10\%) in sensitivity analysis. For every FIT iCRC, 2.6
   screen-detected CRCs were found (ratio 1: 2.6); for gFOBT, the ratio
   between iCRC and screen-detected CRC was 1: 1.2. Age below 60 years and
   the third screening round were significantly associated with a lower
   iCRC rate.
   Conclusion A negative gFOBT result is associated with a higher iCRC
   incidence than a negative FIT. This supports the use of FIT over gFOBT
   as CRC screening tool.}},

Journal = {{SCIENCE ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2019}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Mechanical metamaterials exhibit unusual properties, such as negative
   Poisson's ratio, which are difficult to achieve in conventional
   materials. Rational design of mechanical metamaterials at the microscale
   is becoming popular partly because of the advance in three-dimensional
   printing technologies. However, incorporating movable building blocks
   inside solids, thereby enabling us to manipulate mechanical movement at
   the molecular scale, has been a difficult task. Here, we report a
   metal-organic framework, self-assembled from a porphyrin linker and a
   new type of Zn-based secondary building unit, serving as a joint in a
   hinged cube tessellation. Detailed structural analysis and theoretical
   calculation show that this material is a mechanical metamaterial
   exhibiting auxetic behavior. This work demonstrates that the topology of
   the framework and flexible hinges inside the structure are intimately
   related to the mechanical properties of the material, providing a
   guideline for the rational design of mechanically responsive
   metal-organic frameworks.}},

Abstract = {{Based on the known solutions of the problems of extension and torsion of
   cylindrically anisotropic chiral tubes, the analysis of variability of
   the Young's modulus, Poisson's ratios and torsional stiffness of
   monoclinic crystalline tubes was carried out using known experimental
   values of the compliance coefficients of the crystals. The extreme
   values of Young's modulus and torsional stiffness were determined and
   their variability was studied. It was shown that chirality had a
   significant effect on the values of the elastic characteristics of tubes
   made from monoclinic crystals. Thin-walled tubes (the ratio of the
   external and internal radii of about one), which had a negative
   Poisson's ratio, were identified. The largest negative values of
   Poisson's ratio among all the analysed tubes were achieved for tubes
   from LaNbO4 and CsH2PO4 crystals. Due to the change in the ratio of the
   radii and the chirality, the Young's modulus and the torsional stiffness
   of such tubes were changed in several times, and their Poisson's ratios
   could change by several units. Angular Poisson's ratio could reach the
   value of - 6.5 on the inner surface of a tube from CsH2PO4 crystal. The
   LaNbO4 and CsH2PO4 crystals also had large negative values of Poisson's
   ratios in the case of rectilinear anisotropy, which were significantly
   different from the Poisson's ratio for isotropic materials.}},

Abstract = {{Silver nanowire (AgNW) based flexible, stretchable and compressible

   compared to the CFS under both tension and compression modes, with
   improvement up to 290\% and 165\% (in terms of gauge factor),
   respectively. The AFS had good stability in air and water, showing
   repeatable and reliable sensing performance under cyclic loading and
   unloading situations in both. We further show the potential application
   and the advantages of the auxetic foam sensors through a series of

Title = {{A Traction-Free Model for the Tensile Stiffness and Bending Stiffness of
   Laminated Ribbons of Flexible Electronics}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED MECHANICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{86}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Laminated ribbons have been widely adopted for structures of flexible
   electronics to simultaneously achieve the electronic functions and
   mechanical performances. Their effective tensile stiffness and bending
   stiffness, which are extensively used as fundamental parameters in the
   mechanical analysis, are usually obtained by the plane-strain hypothesis
   for simplicity. However, it is found that the practical condition is
   usually closer to the traction free, even for the cases with a
   relatively large width. Here, a traction-free model is proposed to
   analytically obtain the effective tensile stiffness and bending
   stiffness of laminated ribbons, which can be used directly in the
   mechanical analysis of flexible electronics. The prediction of the
   traction-free model agrees very well with the precise result obtained by
   3D finite element analysis (FEA) for the cases that are in the range of
   structure designs of flexible electronics. It is found that the
   tensile/bending stiffness of traction-free model is between the
   plane-stress model and plane-strain model, but is closer to the
   plane-stress model. The use of the plane-strain model sometimes may
   yield a considerable error in the mechanical analysis of flexible
   electronics. The parameter study shows that this model is very important
   for the problems with advanced materials, such as metamaterials with
   negative Poisson's ratio. This work provides a theoretical basis for the
   mechanical analysis of flexible electronics.}},

Pages = {{572-587}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{We investigate the mechanical properties of penta-graphene (PG), a
   recently proposed two-dimensional carbon allotrope using atomistic
   simulation techniques combined with the empirical description of
   interatomic interactions. We report on the dependence of its three
   in-plane mechanical moduli (i. e. Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio and
   shear modulus) on the deformation direction, strain and temperature. We
   show that PG displays a strongly manifested mechanical anisotropy, being
   characterized by Poisson's ratio and the shear modulus which both depend
   strongly on the deformation direction. By analyzing bond energies we
   study the influence of different carbon-carbon bonds on the mechanical
   response of PG and based on that we explain the origins of the observed
   anisotropy. We show that it is mostly a consequence of the
   characteristics of the sp(3)-hybridizied bonds, which form the
   diamond-like tetrahedral blocks. We investigate the auxeticity of PG in
   detail and show that it displays complete auxetic behavior, having
   negative Poisson's ratio for all the deformation directions. We show
   that the auxeticity of PG is similar to that of defective graphene
   containing 5-8-5 double vacancies, as it also originates from the
   so-called de-wrinkling mechanism. We study the influence of temperature
   and show that it only slightly affects the mechanical moduli of PG. (c)

   hydroxyl functionalization via molecular dynamics simulations}},
Journal = {{CARBON}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{146}},
Pages = {{680-700}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The effects of clustered line patterns of hydroxyl functionalization and
   percent surface coverage along the armchair and zigzag directions of the
   graphene lattice on the mechanical response of graphene sheets (GS)
   under tension loading, in zigzag and armchair directions, and under
   shear loading in the zigzag direction were studied. The initial,
   functionalization induced bending deformation, caused by clustered line
   pattern arrangements, led to strong elastic anisotropy of graphene with
   an increased linear compressibility in the direction perpendicular to
   the line patterns and increased stiffness in the direction parallel to
   the line patterns. The line pattern functionalized graphene acted
   similar to a nanoscale mechanical spring. It is shown that clustered
   line pattern functionalization along the zigzag direction can increase
   the stiffness of the GS along the zigzag direction and stretchability
   along the armchair direction without significantly stretching the carbon
   bonds and can enhance the toughness of the GS relative to random
   functionalization. It was also found that the Poisson's ratio can be
   tuned from positive to negative through line pattern arrangements,
   reaching a minimum of -0.287 at an -OH percentage of 75\% for stretching
   along the zigzag direction, thus indicating auxetic behavior. (c) 2019

Abstract = {{Background. There is an increasing number of young adults living with
   congenital heart disease (CHD). The goal of this study was to ascertain
   the frequency of acute kidney injury (AKI) as well as the risk factors
   and outcomes associated with AKI in young adults with CHD after a
   surgical procedure.
   Methods. This was a single-center retrospective cohort study including
   all patients 18 to 40 years of age with a diagnosis of CHD admitted to a
   quaternary care children's hospital cardiac intensive care unit
   postoperatively from 2004 to 2015. We defined AKI using the Kidney
   Disease Improving Global Outcomes criteria for serum creatinine. We
   explored potential susceptibilities and exposures for AKI using
   multivariable logistic regression and determined the association of AKI
   with duration of mechanical ventilation and length of stay using Poisson
   regression.
   Results. In 699 consecutively admitted patients AKI occurred in 13.2\%.
   Suspected sepsis (odds ratio {[}OR], 2.87; 95\% confidence interval
   {[}CI], 1.17 to 7.05), exposure to calcineurin inhibitors (OR, 5.80;
   95\% CI, 1.06 to 31.59), vancomycin (OR, 3.35; 95\% CI, 1.11 to 10.14),
   and piperacillin-tazobactam (OR, 4.12; 95\% CI, 1.23 to 13.78) increased
   the odds of AM even after controlling for age, ejection fraction, recent
   cardiac catheterization, repeat cardiopulmonary bypass, bypass time,
   cross-clamp time, and other potential nephrotoxic medications. AKI was
   associated with a longer duration of mechanical ventilation (OR, 1.47;
   95\% CI, 1.15 to 1.89) and intensive care unit length of stay (OR, 1.50;
   95\% CI, 130 to 1.72).
   Conclusions. AKI is common in young adults with CHD postoperatively and
   is associated with negative outcomes. The results highlight the
   importance future research and clinical efforts aimed at prevention and
   improved management of AKI in this patient group. (C) 2019 by The

   Department Visits in 16 US States: 2007-2014}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. To examine the impact of state texting bans on motor vehicle
   crash (MVC)-related emergency department (ED) visits.
   Methods. We used ED data from 16 US states between 2007 and 2014. We
   employed a difference-in-difference approach and conditional Poisson
   regressions to estimate changes in counts of MVC-related ED visits in
   states with and without texting bans. We also constructed age cohorts to
   explore whether texting bans have differential impacts by age group.
   Results. On average, states with a texting ban saw a 4\% reduction in
   MVC-related ED visits (incidence rate ratio = 0.96; 95\% confidence
   interval = 0.96, 0.97). This equates to an average of 1632
   traffic-related ED visits prevented per year in states with a ban. Both
   primary and secondary bans were associated with significant reductions
   in MVC-related visits to the ED regardless of whether they were on all
   drivers or young drivers only. Individuals aged 64 years and younger in
   states with a texting ban saw significantly fewer MVC-related ED visits
   following its implementation.
   Conclusions. Our findings suggest that states' efforts to curb
   distracted driving through texting bans and decrease its negative
   consequences are associated with significant decreases in the incidence
   of ED visits that follow an MVC.}},

   7075-T651. First, a fatigue life curve and a cyclic curve were
   determined for the standard specimens. A special antibuckling device was
   applied to prevent the bending of the specimens. The same experimental
   arrangement was then applied to determine the low-cycle fatigue life of
   auxetic structures. In the continuation, the most appropriate method was
   selected to calculate the fatigue life on the basis of the measured
   fatigue life curves. Abaqus and SIMULIA fe-safe software were applied
   for this purpose. The best predictions for the standard specimens were

Abstract = {{Under compression, auxetic open cell cellular solids may lose auxeticity
   due to instability and/or self-contact between the ribs. This study
   explores the limiting strains for preserving auxetic effects for auxetic
   open cell materials of two different cellular structures: re-entrant
   honeycomb and the `missing-rib' type chiral cellular solids. Experiments
   of the 3D printed specimens, periodicity analysis, and ellipticity
   analysis showed that, under compressive loads, the auxetic effects and
   the limiting compressive strain for auxeticity are mutually exclusive.
   In other words, the limiting compressive strain has to be reduced if
   larger auxetic effect is desired, vice versa. It was found that compared
   with re-entrant honeycombs, due to chirality-induced rotation, the
   chiral cellular solids can preserve auxetic effects under much larger
   compressive strain (>-10-30\%). (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The structural, mechanical, thermodynamic and electronic properties of
   intermetallic compounds Al3Ti and Al3V in L1(2) structure in the
   pressure range of 0-100 GPa have been investigated using
   first-principles method. The calculated structural parameters and energy
   information at ambient pressure are consistent with the available
   experimental and theoretical results. The stability of Al3Ti and Al3V in
   L1(2) structure is checked both by Born's criteria and phonon
   calculation. The values of bulk modulus, shear modulus, Young's modulus,
   hardness, Poisson ratio, anisotropy index, Debye temperature, and wave
   velocities increase with the increasing external pressure. The compound
   Al3V in L1(2)structure possesses interesting properties, including
   ductility in low pressure region (up to 20 GPa) but weakly brittle
   behavior at high pressures (above 30 GPa) and the minimum value of
   Poisson ratio is negative under high pressure. Finally, the
   pressure-dependence behavior of density of states and charge densities
   are analyzed to explore the bond characteristics and physical origin of
   the pressure effect on the various properties of Al3Ti and Al3V.}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Cutting various patterns in elastomeric sheets has emerged as a simple
   yet effective way to fabricate soft mechanical metamaterials with
   unusual or auxetic properties. Upon stretching, the cut ligaments of the
   metamaterial deform severely and much higher stress is induced around
   the notch due to stress concentration. This would limit the
   stretchability or even result in fracture of the cut-mediated
   metamaterials. Optimization of cut-mediated mechanical materials has
   been rarely, if at all, been explored, partially due to the difficulty
   of nonlinear optimization and analysis of materials with large
   deformation. We present an integrated strategy and a platform based on
   commercial software to optimize cut-mediated soft mechanical
   metamaterials. Optimization of the metamaterial is realized by modifying
   the boundary shape of cut ligaments, which would reduce stress
   concentration, generate larger negative Poisson's ratio, and allow
   enhanced stretchability. Our optimization scheme of metamaterials would
   aid design and fabrication of mechanical metamaterials and transforming
   structures.}},

   composite}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{782}},
Pages = {{59-68}},
Month = {{APR 25}},
Abstract = {{One possible key to improve plasticity in a CuZrAl bulk metallic glass
   is to introduce soft metallic crystalline particles. Tantalum particles
   with two different geometries were chosen in the present work: (i)
   irregularly shaped particles of equivalent average diameter of 45 mu m
   (Ta-1) and (ii) spherical particles of average size 25 microns (Ta-2).
   When the volume fraction of tantalum goes from 0\% to 50\%, the modulus
   increases (from 95 GPa to 140 GPa), the Poisson's ratio decreases only
   slightly (from 0.37 to 0.35) and the hardness decreases regularly (from
   485 HV30 to about 300 HV30), whatever the particles size. All these
   results are in agreement with simple laws of mixtures, involving only
   the volume fraction of the second phase. The results obtained during the
   compression tests are more complicated. The yield strength decreases
   when the Ta content exceeds 20\% in volume. This evolution is identical
   for both types of particles. Similarly, an increase in plasticity is
   always observed when the tantalum content exceeds about 10\% in volume.
   For the highest values of this content, a significant damage of the
   sample follows this plastic deformation before rupture. But a large
   dispersion of the values is observed, more particularly for small
   particles of tantalum. This is due to a problem of heterogeneity of the
   particles dispersion and the presence of clusters; this difficulty in
   dispersing the particles is more marked for small spherical particles.
   An image analysis was performed to characterize this clustering effect.
   Clusters have a negative effect because they facilitate the propagation
   of cracks through Ta-Ta weak interface instead of deflecting it. An
   optimal content to combine a high elastic limit, a good hardness and a
   high plasticity seems to exist near 30\% vol. of crystalline particles.

   (re-entrant, arrow-head, tri-chiral, hexagonal) and the implications of
   their manufacturing using 3D printing techniques with PLA material. The
   dome-shaped configurations are modeled using full-scale non-linear
   quasi-static and explicit dynamic FE models that represent both the
   geometry and approximate constitutive models of the PLA filament
   material derived from tensile tests on dogbone specimens. The cellular
   metamaterials samples are subjected to indentation tests, with maps of
   strains obtained through DIC measurements. The correlation between
   experimental and numerical simulations is good, and shows the peculiar
   indentation behavior of these cellular structures. We also perform a
   comparative analysis by simulation of the force/displacement, strain and
   fracture history during quasi-static loading, and discuss the
   performance of the different cellular topologies for these dome-shape
   metamaterial designs.}},

Abstract = {{The extraordinary properties of mechanical metamaterials are created
   from the geometrical design of their internal structures. As a result,
   the nature of classical mechanical metamaterials usually would not
   change and one geometrical design only corresponds to one set of
   mechanical behaviors. This restricts the application of metamaterials
   where an adaptive behavior is desirable. In this work, we demonstrate
   the dynamic and on-demand regulation of mechanical metamaterials through
   a combination of structural design and multimaterial 3D printing. We
   design a soft periodic lattice metamaterial containing two distinct
   deformation modes. One deformation mode is controlled by the zig-zagged
   topological defects, and the other one is controlled by the thermal
   activation of the responsive materials imbedded in the lattice. By
   regulating the deformation mode with ambient temperature, the effective
   Poisson ratio of the lattice can be intentionally switched between
   negative values and positive values. The mechanism of thermally tunable
   deformation is investigated both experimentally and theoretically,
   resulting in a predictive design space of the metamaterial. We believe
   our design principle opens up a new route for the exploration of
   metamaterials exhibiting extraordinary and programmable mechanical
   behaviors.}},

Title = {{Does anthropometric status at 6months predict the over-dispersion of
   malaria infections in children aged 6-18months? A prospective cohort
   study}},
Journal = {{MALARIA JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{18}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundIn malaria-endemic settings, a small proportion of children
   suffer repeated malaria infections, contributing to most of the malaria
   cases, yet underlying factors are not fully understood. This study was
   aimed to determine whether undernutrition predicts this over-dispersion
   of malaria infections in children aged 6-18months in settings of high
   malaria and undernutrition prevalence.MethodsProspective cohort study,
   conducted in Mangochi, Malawi. Six-months-old infants were enrolled and
   had length-for-age z-scores (LAZ), weight-for-age z-scores (WAZ), and
   weight-for-length z-scores (WLZ) assessed. Data were collected for
   presumed', clinical, and rapid diagnostic test (RDT)-confirmed malaria
   until 18months. Malaria microscopy was done at 6 and 18months. Negative
   binomial regression was used for malaria incidence and modified Poisson
   regression for malaria prevalence.ResultsOf the 2723 children enrolled,
   2561 (94\%) had anthropometry and malaria data. The mean (standard
   deviation {[}SD]) of LAZ, WAZ, and WLZ at 6months were -1.4 (1.1), -0.7
   (1.2), and 0.3 (1.1), respectively. The mean (SD) incidences of
   presumed', clinical, and RDT-confirmed malaria from 6 to 18months were:
   1.1 (1.6), 0.4 (0.8), and 1.3 (2.0) episodes/year, respectively.
   Prevalence of malaria parasitaemia was 4.8\% at 6months and 9.6\% at
   18months. Higher WLZ at 6months was associated with lower prevalence of
   malaria parasitaemia at 18months (prevalence ratio {[}PR]=0.80, 95\%
   confidence interval {[}CI] 0.67 to 0.94, p=0.007), but not with
   incidences of presumed' malaria (incidence rate ratio {[}IRR]=0.97, 95\%
   CI 0.92 to 1.02, p=0.190), clinical malaria (IRR=1.03, 95\% CI 0.94 to
   1.12, p=0.571), RDT-confirmed malaria (IRR=1.00, 95\% CI 0.94 to 1.06,
   p=0.950). LAZ and WAZ at 6months were not associated with malaria
   outcomes. Household assets, maternal education, and food insecurity were
   significantly associated with malaria. There were significant variations
   in hospital-diagnosed malaria by study site.ConclusionIn children aged
   6-18months living in malaria-endemic settings, LAZ, WAZ, and WLZ do not
   predict malaria incidence. However, WLZ may be associated with
   prevalence of malaria. Socio-economic and micro-geographic factors may
   explain the variations in malaria, but these require further study.Trial

Abstract = {{Exploring the configurational space of specific origami patterns
   {[}e.g., Miura-ori (flat surface with parallelogram crease patterns),
   eggbox] has led to notable advances in science and technology. To
   augment the origami design space, we present a pattern, named
   ``Morph,{''} which combines the features of its parent patterns. We
   introduce a four-vertex origami cell that morphs continuously between a
   Miura mode and an eggbox mode, forming an homotopy class of
   configurations. This is achieved by changing the mountain and valley
   assignment of one of the creases, leading to a smooth switch through a
   wide range of negative and positive Poisson's ratios. We present elegant
   analytical expressions of Poisson's ratios for both in-plane stretching
   and out-of-plane bending and find that they are equal in magnitude and
   opposite in sign. Further, we show that by combining compatible unit
   cells in each of the aforementioned modes through kinematic bifurcation,
   we can create hybrid origami patterns that display unique properties,
   such as topological mode locking and tunable switching of Poisson's
   ratio.}},

Title = {{An experimental and numerical study on the transverse deformations in

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOMECHANICS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{87}},
Pages = {{120-126}},
Month = {{APR 18}},
Abstract = {{The transverse deformations of tendons assessed in tensile tests seems
   to constitute a controversial issue in literature. On the one hand,
   large positive variations of the Poisson's ratio have been reported,
   indicating volume reduction under tensile states. On the other hand,
   negative values were also observed, pointing out an auxetic material
   response. Based on these experimental observations, the following
   question is raised: Are these large and discrepant transverse
   deformations intrinsically related to the constitutive response of
   tendons or they result from artifacts of the mechanical test setup? In
   order to provide further insights to this question, an experimental and
   numerical study on the transverse kinematics of tendons was carried out.
   Tensile experiments were performed in branches of deep digital flexor
   tendons of domestic porcine, where the transverse displacements were
   measured by two high-speed, high accuracy optical digital micrometers
   placed transversely to one another. Aiming at a better understanding of
   the effects of the mechanical test setup in the transverse measurements,
   a three-dimensional finite element model is proposed to resemble the
   tensile experiment. The main achieved results strongly support the
   following hypotheses regarding tensile tests of tendons: the clamping
   region considerably affects the kinematics of the specimen even at a
   large distance from the clamps; the transverse deformations are mainly
   ruled by stiff fibers embedded in a soft matrix; the generalization of
   the Poisson's ratio to draw conclusions about changes in volume of
   tendons may lead to misinterpretations. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The quasi-static mechanical properties of re-entrant anti-trichiral
   honeycombs made from ABS polymer are studied by both experiments and
   theoretical analysis. The experimental results show that the deformation
   of honeycomb is dominated by the bending of ligaments, the rotation of
   ligaments around the plastic hinges and the rigid rotation of cylinders.
   Based on the deformation mechanism of the cell structures exhibiting in
   experiments, the collapse process of the honeycomb is divided into
   several stages. Theoretical formulas are deduced to predict the crushing
   stress of the re-entrant anti-trichiral honeycombs in each stage, which
   are functions of the honeycomb's global strain, the cells' geometry
   parameters and the properties of the base material. The analytical
   predictions are in good agreement with the experimental results. It is
   revealed that the crushing stress of the honeycomb increases with the
   global strain and the cell-wall thickness while decreases with the
   ligament-length ratio. An optimal value of the cylinders' radius is
   found which will result in the maximum load-carrying capacity of the
   honeycomb. The present work is supposed to shed light on the design and
   fabrication of re-entrant anti-trichiral honeycombs.}},

Title = {{Designing hierarchical metamaterials by topology analysis with tailored

Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},

Volume = {{214}},
Pages = {{359-378}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we present an innovative three-dimensional (3D)
   hierarchical design strategy to systematically summarize the
   configuration characteristics of existing cellular structures and
   propose a novel class of mechanical metamaterials based on topology
   analysis, which have tailored Poisson's ratio and Young's modulus.
   Theoretical, numerical and experimental analyses were conducted to
   reveal the basic mechanical properties of the metamaterials. And these
   results agree very well which validate the correctness of the theories.
   Samples of the proposed structures made of Nylon were fabricated through
   3D printing technology to carry out compression tests and finite element
   analysis (FEA) were performed to give an insight into the mechanical
   response. Experimental and numerical results revealed that the proposed
   3D second-order hierarchical metamaterials can achieve a series of
   special combinations of Poisson's ratio in three perpendicular
   directions. The sign and magnitude of Poisson's ratio can be tailored by
   appropriately adjusting the first and second order configurations and
   their geometrical parameters. Meanwhile, systemic analysis and
   comparison reveal that relative Young's modulus is contingent on
   deformation pattern, i.e., axial-deformation dominated stiffness is much
   higher than bending-dominated stiffness. Similar to Poisson's ratio, the
   magnitude of Young's modulus can be tailored by geometrical parameters
   and first and second order configurations in a relative large range in
   the case of given Poisson's ratio (sign and magnitude). This work can
   provide useful reference for the design, fabrication and analysis of 3D
   metamaterials with novel properties and functions, particularly with
   auxetic behavior, which are promising in some technical applications.}},

Abstract = {{Mechanical metamaterials are an extraordinary class of materials that
   harness their unusual characteristics from the geometrical features.
   Herein, we report a design strategy to decipher anisotropic and
   aperiodic nonwovens as auxetic metamaterials by carefully decorating
   with the slit perforations in a stochastic manner. These slit perforated
   nonwoven materials have been tested under uniaxial tensile deformation
   by altering the aspect ratio of the specimen dimensions. Ostensibly, the
   slit perforations in nonwovens created the invariant behavior towards
   the test direction and the aspect ratio of the specimen dimensions.
   These slit perforations have led to the geometrical frustration-free
   structures that are of paramount importance to avoid any hindrance to
   the desired functionality. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Effectiveness of oral rotavirus vaccination in England against
   rotavirus-confirmed and all-cause acute gastroenteritis}},
Journal = {{VACCINE: X}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{1}},
Month = {{APR 11}},
Abstract = {{Background: The monovalent oral rotavirus vaccine Rotarix (R) was
   introduced into the UK infant immunisation programme in 2013. We
   estimated vaccine effectiveness (VE) in the first two years of the
   programme.
   Methods: We used a test-negative case-control design and enhanced
   national surveillance data for 1869 vaccine-eligible children tested for
   rotavirus infection to obtain adjusted odds ratios and VE against
   laboratory-confirmed rotavirus infections. Linked anonymised UK primary
   care and hospitalisation data from the Clinical Practice Research
   Datalink (40,723 children) and random-effects Poisson regression were
   used in a cohort study to estimate VE against all-cause acute
   gastroenteritis (AGE) and AGE hospitalisations.
   Results: VE against laboratory-confirmed infection was 69\% (95\%
   Confidence Interval: 40-84\%) for one dose and 77\% (95\%CI: 66-85\%)
   for two doses. Two-dose VE in children aged <12 months and >= 12 months
   was 85\% (95\%CI: 74-91\%) and 54\% (95\%CI: 15-75\%), respectively. In
   contrast, we found no evidence that the vaccine was effective against
   all-cause AGE (VE = -20\%, 95\%CI: -36\% to -5\%), or against AGE
   hospitalisations (VE = 35\%, 95\% CI: -86\% to 77\%).
   Conclusions: In this first detailed assessment of VE of the Rotarix (R)
   vaccine in the English national programme, we show that Rotarix (R) was
   highly effective in preventing laboratory-confirmed rotavirus infection
   in young children. This provides reassurance about the vaccine's
   performance in real-life settings and gives key information for future
   cost-effectiveness analyses. The high VE against rotavirus-specific AGE,
   and the exceptionally successful implementation of the national
   rotavirus vaccine programme (with >90\% vaccine coverage), explains the
   lack of VE against all-cause AGE because most AGE in the post-vaccine
   era would not have been due to rotavirus, although some underestimation
   of VE could also have occurred due to differential healthcare
   utilisation by vaccinated and unvaccinated infants. This highlights the
   importance of using specific vaccine-preventable endpoints for these
   scenarios. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Two dimensional materials have been regarded as promising candidates for
   photocatalytic water splitting. Herein, we systematically investigated
   the potential of a novel two dimensional penta-X2C (X = P, As, Sb)
   family for photocatalytic water splitting by means of density functional
   theory. The penta-X2C family consists of semiconductors with indirect
   band gaps of 2.64 eV, 2.09 eV and 1.35 eV for X = P, As and Sb,
   respectively. Notably, the band edge positions of penta-P2C and
   penta-As2C can perfectly satisfy the redox potentials of photocatalytic
   water splitting via strain engineering, whereas penta-Sb2C only meets
   the reduction potential. The ultrahigh (up to 10(3)-10(5) cm(2) V-1
   s(-1)) and anisotropic carrier mobilities are crucial to suppressing the
   photogenerated electron-hole pair recombination. Meanwhile, the
   penta-X2C family exhibits excellent light absorption in the
   visible-ultraviolet region, favorable for the utilization of sunlight.
   In addition, compared with other common 2D materials such as graphene
   and h-BN, the penta-X2C family possesses a relatively smaller Young's
   modulus and larger critical strain, while penta-X2C have large negative
   Poisson's ratios of -0.103, -0.079 and -0.077, respectively. These
   results testify that the penta-X2C family has potential applications not
   only in photocatalytic water splitting but also in designing 2D
   electromechanical and optoelectronic devices.}},

Title = {{Thickness effect on mechanical behavior of auxetic sintered metal fiber
   sheets}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{167}},
Month = {{APR 5}},
Abstract = {{Sintered metal fiber sheets (MFSs) made by sequential-overlap method are
   transversely isotropic open-cell cellular materials with paper-like
   fiber network architectures, which exhibit auxeticity and are promising
   for various potential applications due to the reentrant micro-structure.
   The thickness effect on the out-of-plane auxeticity (negative Poisson's
   ratio) of MFSs samples of 2-20 mm thick subjected to in-plane tensile
   loading is investigated with digital image correlation technique.
   Furthermore, the deformation modes of fibers within MFSs during various
   loading stages are examined with X-ray tomography. It is found that in
   addition to the straightening of reentrant fibers, fiber layers with
   defects and joints failure induced slippage between adjacent layers
   leads to local shear and results in unique umbrella-like local
   deformation termed umbrella effect, which gradually dominates the
   auxeticity during tensile loading. Although remarkably increasing
   lateral deformation, the umbrella effect significantly diminishes the
   in-plane mechanical performance such as rigidity and strength. In
   particular, this effect is suppressed by sample thickness: the overall
   performance tends to stabilize with sample thickness greater than a
   certain value, provided that the MFS is uniform with all fibers randomly
   distributed. The finding facilitates wider application of auxetic MFSs
   with further understanding on the relationship between the thickness
   effect and performance. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{In the present article, a high-order global-local theory with
   three-dimensional elasticity corrections is employed to trace the local
   and instantaneous variations of lateral deflections and stress
   components of sandwich plates with auxetic (negative Poisson ratio)
   cores under static and dynamic loads. Effects of the auxetecity of the
   core material on the natural frequencies are evaluated as well. The
   governing equations are extracted based on Hamilton's principle. The
   main novelties of the present research in comparison to the available
   literature and previous researches of the second author of the present
   paper are: (i) Presenting a higher-order global-local plate theory with
   a novel equilibrium-based three-dimensional elasticity corrections, (ii)
   Incorporation of the transverse flexibility of the core; a fact that is
   crucial when studying behaviors of thick or soft core sandwich plates,
   (iii) Frequency and dynamic behavior analyses (in addition to the
   traditional static analysis) of sandwich plates with soft cores by means
   of the presented accurate global-local theory, and (iv) Investigation of
   the negative Poisson ratio (auxeticity) effects of the core material on
   the static (stress) and dynamic responses and natural frequencies. All
   these items are accomplished here, for the first time. Since the
   transverse shear stresses are extracted based on the three-dimensional
   elasticity theory, in contract the traditional constitutive-based
   theories, the inter-laminar continuity condition of the transverse shear
   stresses is met. The verification results show that the presented finite
   element formulation leads to highly accurate results, even for thick or
   soft core sandwich plates. A comprehensive parametric study is
   accomplished to evaluate effects of the auxeticity of the core material
   and transverse compliance of the core on the resulting displacement and
   stress distributions, natural frequencies, and dynamic responses.
   Results reveal that auxeticity of the core material decreases the global
   and relative stresses and lateral deflections of the face sheets and the
   core compliance may lead to asynchronized movements of the face sheets
   and strengthen the local bending and extensions.}},

Abstract = {{The auxetic metamaterials exhibit attractive mechanical properties,

   Although auxetic metamaterials have been extensively investigated using
   experimental and computational approaches, the consistent estimation of
   shear properties has still not been clarified. According to Cauchy
   elasticity, the shear properties of an auxetic structure should be
   enhanced owing to the negative Poisson's ratio. However, this study used
   homogenisation and experimental approaches to demonstrate that the shear
   elasticity is highly non-linear with respect to the characteristic
   geometrical parameters of a unit cell and that shear properties,
   particularly normal elasticity, are not always improved. Furthermore,
   the estimation of the shear elasticity based on the classical isotropic
   continuum elasticity relations can result in misleading values and
   should be avoided.}},

Abstract = {{Based on micropolar continuum theory, the closed-form stiffness tensor
   of auxetic chiral lattices with V-shaped wings and rotational joints
   were derived. Representative volume element (RVE) of the chiral lattice
   was decomposed into V-shape wings with fourfold symmetry. A unified
   V-beam finite element was developed to reduce the nodal degrees of
   freedoms of the RVE to enable closed-form analytical solutions. The
   elasticity constants were derived as functions of the angle of the
   V-shaped wings, nondimensional in-plane thickness of the ribs, and the
   stiffness of the rotational joints. The influences of these parameters
   on the coupled chiral and auxetic effects were systematically explored.
   The results show that the elastic moduli were significantly influenced
   by all three parameters, while Poisson's ratio was barely influenced by
   the in-plane thickness of the ribs but is sensitive to the angle of the
   V-shaped wings and the stiffness of the rotational springs. There is a
   transition region out of which the spring stiffness does not
   considerably affect the auxeticity and the overall lattice stiffness.}},

Abstract = {{This paper evaluates the longitudinal wave speed through a plate in
   which its two opposing sides are elastically restrained in the width
   direction, taking into consideration the material auxeticity and strain
   as well as changes to the density and cross-sectional area. Apart from
   the known role of Young's modulus and density, the present results
   reveal that the wave speed can be enhanced by increasing the width
   elastic restraint. In the case of high elastic restraint, the speed of
   both tensile and compressive waves can be minimized by selecting plate
   materials with Poisson's ratio of low magnitude. In the case of low
   elastic restraint, the speed of tensile and compressive waves can be
   greatly reduced by selecting plate materials with large positive and
   large negative Poisson's ratio, respectively. For the special case of
   negligible strain, the longitudinal wave speed reduces to the elementary
   wave speed in prismatic rods and in plates of infinite width when the
   width elastic restraint stiffness approaches zero and infinity,
   respectively. The obtained results not only avail more parameters for
   adjusting the longitudinal waves in plates, but also identify the
   differing methods of effectively controlling the wave speed between
   tensile and compressive waves when the strain magnitude is
   non-negligible.}},

Abstract = {{Rational design of artificial micro-structured metamaterials with
   advanced mechanical and physical properties that are not accessible in
   nature is challenging and important. Making use of the node rotation and
   ligament bending deformation features of chiral materials, innovative
   reentrant and antichiral hybrid metastructures are proposed for
   vibration attenuation, where elastic rubber coated mass inclusions are
   distributed within the chiral circular ring nodes of unit cells. The
   bandgaps and wave attenuation mechanisms of the proposed reentrant and
   anti-chiral hybrid metastructures are explored, and finite element
   simulations are performed for analyzing the relation between wave
   attenuation properties and structural parameters. Then, coupled
   deformation mechanism of reentrant and antichiral hybrid metastructures
   are analyzed, it is found that the geometrical topology and node elastic
   mass inclusion distribution schemes have remarkable effects on the
   bandgaps of the metastructures. Meanwhile, the wave mitigations of the
   reentrant and anti-chiral hybrid metastructures are explored through
   tuning the structural parameters and mass inclusions distributions.
   Finally, the wave attenuation performances of sandwich panels with
   reentrant and anti-chiral hybrid cores are studied, thus demonstrating
   the promising engineering application potentials for vibration

Abstract = {{The dynamic response of cylindrical sandwich panels with aluminum foam
   core, hexagonal honeycomb core, and auxetic honeycomb core are compared
   numerically. A novel curved auxetic honeycomb core is designed, and the
   finite element models are built by employing ABAQUS-Explicit. To
   calibrate the numerical models, the experiments of sandwich panels with
   honeycomb core and aluminum foam cores are modeled. And the numerical
   results have a good agreement with the experiment date. The calibrated
   numerical models are used to simulate the dynamic response of
   cylindrical panels subject to external blast loadings. It is found that
   the cylindrical panels with auxetic honeycomb cores have a better
   performance than that with aluminum foam cores and hexagonal honeycomb
   cores in resisting blast loadings. A material concentration effect was
   observed in the auxetic honeycomb core due to the negative Poisson's
   ratio (NPR) effect. According to parameter studies, it is concluded that
   with the increase of curvature and face sheet thickness the
   blast-resistance of panels with both auxetic honeycomb core, hexagonal
   honeycomb core, and foam cores increased obviously, especially the
   panels with auxetic honeycomb cores. For the panels with auxetic
   honeycomb cores, increasing the back face sheet thickness can improve
   the blast-resistance performance more efficiently than increasing the
   thickness of front face sheet, which is opposite for the panels with
   foam cores and hexagonal honeycomb cores. Auxetic cores with a smaller
   unit cell aspect ratio and a smaller unit cell length ratio has a larger
   Poisson's ratio, and achieves better blast resistance performance. These
   simulation findings can guide well the theoretical study and optimal
   design of cylindrical sandwich structures subject to external blast
   loading. (C) 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.}},

   ratio and thickness effects}},
Journal = {{THIN-WALLED STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{137}},
Pages = {{377-391}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Poisson's ratio is an extremely important physical parameter of
   materials, which can be defined as the ratio of transverse strain to
   longitudinal strain. Due to the fact that the Poisson's ratio for common
   structural materials is within a very narrow domain (i.e., from 0.25 to
   0.35), the Poisson's ratio effect on mechanical behaviors of nanobeams
   is few investigated. However, the Poisson's ratio for isotropic solids
   is from 1 to 0.5, and the structures with special Poisson's ratio,
   especially the negative Poisson's ratio, have attracted wide attention.
   Thus, it is necessary to study the Poisson's ratio effect on mechanical
   behaviors of nanobeams. Free vibration of nanobeams was performed by
   many works based on nonlocal strain gradient theory (NSGT), but most of
   them did not consider the size-dependent effect in thickness direction.
   In this study, the effects of Poisson's ratio and thickness are examined
   for the vibration behaviors of nanobeams via NSGT. Based on NSGT with
   the thickness effect, the analytical solution for the bending
   frequencies of hinged-hinged nanobeams are derived. When neglecting the
   thickness effect in NSGT, the stiffness-hardening effect is
   underestimated, especially for thin beams where the size-dependent
   effect of loss of neighboring atoms on the beam's surface is
   significant. By numerical results and the molecular dynamics simulation,
   it is found that the stiffness-hardening effect in {[}110] copper
   nanowire attenuates with an increased vibrational mode number. Moreover,
   the Poisson's ratio effect in vibration frequency of reflexyne and
   flexyne nanobeams is different. The Poisson's ratio effect in flexyne
   and reflexyne nanobeams with the thickness effect is extraordinarily
   remarkable.}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with the dynamic response of sandwich plates subjected
   to blast load. The sandwich plate is composed of auxetic honeycombs core
   layer with negative Poisson's ratio integrated with nanocomposite at the
   top and bottom surfaces. The nanocomposite layers are reinforced by
   carbon nanotubes (CNTs) where the effective material properties are
   calculated by Mori-Tanaka approach considering agglomeration effects.
   Due to the existence of CNTs, the structure is subjected to magnetic
   field. Based on the Kelvin-Voigt theory, the viscoelastic properties of
   the structure are considered. The viscoelastic medium is simulated by
   orthotropic visco-Pasternak model. Utilizing sinusoidal shear
   deformation theory (SSDT), the motion equations are derived based on
   Hamilton's principle. Differential cubature method (DCM) in conjunction
   with Newmark method is used for obtaining the dynamic deflection of the
   sandwich structure for different boundary conditions. The effects of
   various parameters such as structural damping, viscoelastic medium
   constants, geometric parameters of plates, volume fraction and
   agglomeration of CNTs, duration of blast pulse, geometrical parameters
   of auxetic honeycombs core and magnetic field on the dynamic deflection
   of the sandwich structure are investigated. The results reveal that by
   reinforcing the structure with CNTs, the dynamic deflection induced by
   blast load decreases about 59\%. In addition, with increasing the
   geometrical parameters of auxetic honeycombs core, the dynamic
   deflection will be enhanced.}},

Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The aim of this paper is to introduce tunable continuous-stable
   metamaterials with reversible thermo-mechanical memory operations by
   four-dimensional (4D) printing technology. They are developed based on
   an understanding on glassy-rubbery behaviors of shape memory polymers
   and hot/cold programming derived from experiments and theory. Fused
   decomposition modeling as a well-known 3D printing technology is
   implemented to fabricate mechanical metamaterials. They are
   experimentally tested revealing elastic-plastic and hyper-elastic
   behaviors in low and high temperatures at a large deformation range. A
   computational design tool is developed by implementing a 3D
   phenomenological constitutive model coupled with a geometrically
   nonlinear finite element method. Governing equations are then solved by
   an elastic-predictor plastic-corrector return map procedure along with
   the Newton-Raphson and Riks techniques to trace nonlinear equilibrium
   path. A tunable reversible mechanical metamaterial unit with bi-stable
   memory operations is printed and tested experimentally and numerically.
   By a combination of cold and hot programming, the unit shows potential
   applications in mimicking electronic memory devices like tactile
   displays and designing surface adaptive structures. Another design of
   the unit shows potentials to serve in designing self-deployable
   bio-medical stents. Experiments are also conducted to demonstrate
   potential applications of cold programming for introducing recoverable
   rolling-up chiral metamaterials and load-resistance supportive auxetics.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a study of the mechanical response of hexachiral
   honeycombs with transversally curved ligaments under planar uniaxial
   tensile, compressive and shear loads. The impact of the chiral cell
   design parameters on the resulting macroscopic behaviour is assessed
   utilising finite elements calculations. It is shown that the presence of
   ligament curvature permits to attain mechanical responses which are not
   achievable through conventional chiral honeycomb designs. In addition,
   the resulting responses exhibit, for all considered load cases,
   significant tunability through the investigated geometrical design
   parameters. Two chiral lattices with identical geometries, only
   differing in their ligament curvature, were manufactured and
   experimentally tested to validate the finite elements predictions. A
   connection and assembly strategy is presented and utilised, offering a
   fast and robust approach to build larger finite lattice structures
   through 3D printed single basic cells. The hexachiral lattices were
   tested in tension, compression and in-plane shear, showing good
   agreement with the numerical predictions. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Objective This study investigated whether a move to public housing
   affects people's use of healthcare services.
   Method Using administrative data from Manitoba, the number of
   hospitalizations, general practitioner (GP), specialist and emergency
   department (ED) visits, and prescription dnigs dispensed in the years
   before and after the housing move-in date (2012/2013) were measured for
   a public housing and matched cohort Generalized linear models with
   generalized estimating equations tested for differences between the
   cohorts in utilization trends. The data were modeled using Poisson (rate
   ratio, RR), negative binomial (incident rate ratio, IRR), and binomial
   (odds ratio, OR) distributions.
   Results GP visits (IRR = 1.04, 95\% CI 1.01-1.06) and prescriptions (IRR
   = 1.04, 95\% CI 1.02-1.05) increased, while ED visits (RR = 0.90, 95\%
   CI 0.82-1.00) and hospitalizations (OR = 0.95, 95\% CI 0.93-0.96)
   decreased over time. The public housing cohort had a significantly
   higher rate of GP visits (IRR = 1.08, 95\% CI 1.04-1.13), ED visits (IRR
   =1.18, 95\% CI 1.01-1.37), and prescriptions (IRR = 1.09, 95\% CI
   1.05-1.13), and was more likely to be hospitalized (OR =1.39, 95\% CI
   1.21-1.61) compared to the matched cohort. The rate of inpatient days
   significantly decreased for the public housing cohort, but did not
   change for the matched cohort.
   Conclusion Healthcare use changed similarly over time (except inpatient
   days) for the two cohorts. Public housing provides a basic need to a
   population who has a high burden of disease and who may not be able to
   obtain and maintain housing in the private market.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports the application of additive manufacturing technology
   to fabricate bi-dimensional lightweight composite meshes capable of
   demonstrating auxetic properties (negative Poisson's ratio (NPR)) in
   combination with negative thermal expansion (NTE) behaviour, using as

   describe the combination of NPR and NTE characteristics, the designation
   of `anepectic' is being proposed. Each mesh, obtained from varying
   either the material combination or the design parameters, was tested on
   a heated silicone bath to study the effects of the different
   combinations on the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE). It was found
   that all meshes studied demonstrated a successful combination of NPR and
   NTE behaviours, and it was revealed that there is a possibility to
   tailor the meshes to activate the NTE behaviour within a chosen range of
   temperatures. For an extreme case, a Poisson's ratio of -0.056, along
   with a CTE of -1568 x 10(-6) K-1 has been achieved.}},

Abstract = {{Phytophagous stink bugs are major soybean pests, and knowledge of
   spatial distribution models of the pest in the crop is fundamental to
   establishing an appropriate sequential sampling plan, and thus, allowing
   the correct utilization of control strategies. This work aimed to study
   the spatial distribution of phytophagous stink bugs in soybean grown in
   different cropping systems and determine a sequential sampling plan. The
   experiment was conducted in Maracaju, MS, Brazil, during the
   agricultural year of 2012/2013. Soybean cultivars BRS 284 and SYN 1163
   RR were placed in an experimental area comprising six fields (two
   soybean cultivars x three cropping systems). Sampling was performed
   weekly, using a beat cloth per plot and counting the number of stink
   bugs found, virtually throughout the soybean reproductive period.
   Concerning the statistical analyses, we used the dispersion indexes
   (variance-to-mean ratio, Morisita's index, exponent k of the negative
   binomial and Green's coefficient) and probabilistic methods of frequency
   adjustment (negative binomial and Poisson). Adult and nymph phytophagous
   stink bugs showed aggregate disposition in the field regardless of the
   cropping system, and their numbers were adjusted to the negative
   binomial probability distribution. There was no difference in the
   behaviour of adult and nymphs considering the tested cultivars. We
   elaborated a practical sequential sampling plan for phytophagous stink
   bug complexes, considering crops intended for the production of grains
   and seeds.}},

   algorithm. Two assumptions (normal distribution or non-normal) were used
   for the random variables. The comparison between analysis using
   negatively correlated and uncorrelated variables (Young's modulus and
   Poisson's ratio) indicates that the results are conservative if a
   negative correlation is considered among the elastic parameters. The
   assumption of non-normal distribution for the random variables has an
   effect on the reliability index of the surface settlements and lining
   bending moments.}},

Abstract = {{Through the achievement of elastic parameter equivalence by the
   structural mechanics method, the beam truss space frame model for
   graphene sheet has been simplified; moreover a representative unit cell
   of the periodic grapheme structure has been extracted. On this basis,
   the Bloch theorem is combined with the finite element method to
   determine the phonon dispersion relation of graphene. For the widely
   used thickness values of the carbon-carbon (C-C) bond, the aspect ratios
   (thickness/length) are so large that the shear deformation should be
   considered such that as a result, the negative Poisson's ratio (NPR)
   characteristic of the C-C bond is observed. Analytical expressions for
   the elastic constants of graphene sheet have been obtained with varied
   C-C bond Poisson's ratios. The reasonable coherence with previous
   results reveals the effectiveness of the structural mechanics method for
   analysing the mechanical properties of nanostructures. The effect of
   deformation modes on the phonon dispersion relation of graphene sheet is
   further discussed; it is concluded that the acoustic phonon modes are
   sensitive to the deformation modes of the C-C bond, whereas these
   deformation modes negligibly influence the optical phonon modes. The
   numerical results also reveal that the shear deformation and the
   resulting NPR effect play an important role in the mechanical property
   analysis of graphene sheet. To summarise, the interrelation between NPR
   materials and nano materials has stimulated a wide field of research;
   moreover, numerous novel phenomena have been observed.}},

   analyzing the involved geometry with computer software but without

   flat material and, depending on the cuts and the material used, we
   enable the kinematical movement of the structures. We also analyze
   monostable auxetic structures whose movements can be described as
   geometrically precise, as well as bistable ones. Based on geometric
   considerations, we combine rigid materials and composites and select
   appropriate joint connections to allow the application of this system in

Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE}},

Volume = {{160}},
Pages = {{309-314}},
Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{Mechanical properties of the PdSe2 monolayer are calculated by using
   first-principles calculations. By adding uniaxial strain along x- and
   y-directions, our results show that the negative Poisson's ratio (NPR)
   can be observed in the Two Dimensional (2D) puckered structure of PdSe2
   monolayer. The occurrence of the NPR is directly caused by the fact that
   the decrease of Se-Se bond is larger than the increase of Se-Pd-Se bond
   when compressing the lattice along the x-direction. Our calculations
   exhibit that the electronic locality of Se-Se bond is strong and the
   orbit of the Se atom in the Se-Se bond has changed significantly.
   Consequently, our calculated results indicate that monolayer PdSe2 will
   have many potential applications in nanoelectronics and
   microelectromechanical devices.}},

Pages = {{194-204}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{This study presents the electromechanical properties of the 3-3
   piezoelectric metamaterial based on variants of honeycomb (HC)
   structure. Three kinds of three-dimensional (3D) elastically anisotropic
   and piezoelectrically active HC structures were introduced, namely,
   conventional HC (3D-CHC), a re-entrant HC (3D-RE) and a semi re-entrant
   HC (3D-SRE). Highly porous 3D finite element models of the mentioned
   three kinds of metamaterials were developed and the role of ligament
   orientation on their effective elastic, piezoelectric and dielectric
   properties was completely characterized. The intrinsic symmetry of HC
   structure was utilized and simplified mixed boundary conditions
   equivalent to periodic boundary conditions were recognized. In
   comparison to their bulk constituent, all the 3-3 type piezoelectric HC
   networks exhibited an enhanced response, especially for the longitudinal
   poling. The normalized figures of merit show a mild dependence on the
   angle theta and the underlying deformation mechanisms associated with
   the zero, positive and negative Poisson's ratios. Figures of merit such
   as hydrostatic strain coefficient (d(h)), the hydrostatic figure of
   merit (d(h).g(h)) and the acoustic impedance (Z) reached their best
   values at small angles, i.e., theta = 30 degrees. Longitudinally poled
   networks exhibited four order of magnitude increase in their hydrostatic
   figure of merit (foam to solid ratio > 10,000) and one order of
   magnitude decrease in the acoustic impedance indicating their
   applicability for the design of hydrophones.}},

   changes within the context of the smoothed interface. The level set
   method and the shape derivative obtained in the smoothed interface
   context allows to capture, within the unit cell, the optimal
   micro-geometry. We test the algorithm by computing several multi-layer
   auxetic micro-structures. The multi-layer approach has the added benefit
   that contact during movement of adjacent ``branches{''} of the
   micro-structure can be avoided in order to increase its capacity to

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The structural and mechanical properties of the deltic, squaric and
   croconic cyclic oxocarbon acids were obtained using theoretical
   solid-state methods based in Density Functional Theory employing very
   demanding calculation parameters in order to yield realistic theoretical
   descriptions of these materials. The computed lattice parameters, bond
   distances, angles, and x-ray powder diffraction patterns of these
   materials were in excellent agreement with their experimental
   counterparts. The crystal structures of these materials were found to be
   mechanically stable since the calculated stiffness tensors satisfy the
   Born mechanical stability conditions. Furthermore, the values of the
   bulk modulus and their pressure derivatives, shear and Young moduli,
   Poisson ratio, ductility and hardness indices, as well as mechanical
   anisotropy measures of these materials were reported. A complete review
   of the literature concerning the negative Poisson ratio and negative
   linear compressibility phenomena is given together with the theoretical
   study of the mechanical behavior of cyclic oxocarbon acid materials. The
   deltic, squaric, and croconic acids in the solid state are highly
   anisotropic materials characterized by low hardness and relatively low
   bulk moduli. The three materials display small negative Poisson ratios.
   The croconic acid displays the phenomenon of negative linear
   compressibility for applied pressures larger than similar to 0.4 GPa
   directed along the direction of minimum Poisson ratio and undergoes a
   pressure induced phase transition at applied pressures larger than
   similar to 1.0 GPa.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanical behaviors of a series of two-dimensional (2-D) crystals
   X3M2 (X = S, Se; M = N, P, As) are explored through density functional
   theory (DFT) calculations. Two atomic structures exist for 2-D X3M2,
   namely alpha-heart and beta-heart, which exhibit different out-of-plane
   Negative Poisson's Ratio (NPR) phenomena. For alpha-heart structures, a
   general out-of-plane NPR exists under in-plane tension in the y
   direction, while for beta-heart type structures, a general NPR exists
   under in-plane tension in the x direction. Through DFT calculations, we
   revealed that a NPR is a general phenomenon for 2-D X3M2 with
   heart-shaped atomic structures, and the absolute value of the
   out-of-plane NPR for 2-D X3M2 is always one order of magnitude larger
   than other 2-D crystals reported before. At the same time, the in-plane
   NPR at certain angles around two in-plane principal axes also exists for
   2-D X3M2 except for S3P2 due to the special heart-shaped structure. The
   coexistence of out-of-plane and in-plane NPRs for 2-D crystals has not
   been reported before and these special three-dimensional (3-D) auxetic
   properties in 2-D crystals may enormously enrich research studies on
   novel mechanical, electrical and chemical behaviors of 2-D crystals.
   This discovery will extend the family of 2-D crystals with a NPR and
   also provide new insights for designing novel negative Poisson's ratio
   materials.}},

Abstract = {{The paper is present 3D numerical simulation data on elastoplastic
   deformation in auxetic single crystals with account of anisotropic

   effect in Zn single crystals is observed in full-scale experiments at
   any loading rate in the {[}0001] direction. It is shown that anisotropic
   pressure should be entered into mathematical models of materials whose
   elastic properties are characterised by five and more independent
   elastic constants and hence by bulk compression anisotropy. The use of
   isotropic pressure in simulating the deformation of such materials leads

   structures with damping composite materials}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{212}},
Pages = {{609-624}},
Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{Damping performance of the free-layer damping structure mainly depends
   on the damping material layout and its material physical properties.
   This paper proposes a concurrent topology optimization method for the
   design of the multi-scale free-layer damping structures with damping
   composite materials. In order to maximize the structural damping
   performance, the density-based topology optimization method is adopted
   to find the optimal layout on both macro and micro scales. For this
   coupled system, the macrostructure is composed of periodic damping
   composite materials, a stiff damping material which is designed for
   maintaining the structural stiffness and a soft damping material which
   is used for improving structural damping. The homogenized effective
   complex elastic matrix is obtained by considering the two damping
   materials layout in the microstructure. Mathematical model is
   established and sensitivity analysis is deduced. Several numerical
   examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
   multi-scale optimization method. In-depth discussions are given for the
   effects of the volume fraction of soft damping material in the micro
   scale on the design results. The results show that there is an optimal
   volume ratio of the stiff and soft damping material to make the
   structure reach optimal vibration performance due to the effective
   competition of soft and stiff characteristics of different damping
   materials. The optimal microstructure has relatively great loss moduli
   and high material loss factor, and it also presents a negative Poisson's
   ratio. The structural vibration performance of the optimal multi-scale
   layer damping structure with damping composite materials is
   significantly improved.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Female sex workers (FSW) are disproportionately affected by
   HIV in Cameroon, with an estimated 23.6\% HIV prevalence. Given the
   unavailability of HIV incidence data, to better understand associations
   with acquiring HIV we assessed the prevalence and associations with new
   HIV diagnoses among FSW in Cameroon.
   Methods: In 2016, FSW were recruited through respondent-driven sampling
   from 5 cities for a biobehavioral survey. Participants sel-freporting
   living with HIV or with an indeterminate test status were excluded from
   analysis. New diagnoses were defined as testing HIV-positive when
   participants self-reported HIV-negative or unknown status. A
   multivariable modified Poisson regression model was developed to assess
   determinants of new HIV diagnosis (referent group: HIV-negative) using
   key covariates; adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) are reported if
   statistically significant (P < 0.05).
   Results: Overall 2255 FSW were recruited. Excluding participants who
   self-reported living with HIV (n = 297) and indeterminate test results
   (n = 7), 260/1951 (13.3\%) FSW were newly diagnosed with HIV. Variables
   significantly associated with new HIV diagnosis were: no
   secondary/higher education {[}aPR: 1.56, 95\% confidence interval (CI):
   1.12 to 2.15], 5+ dependents compared with none (aPR: 2.11, 95\% CI:
   1.01 to 4.40), 5+ years involved in sex work compared with <1 year (aPR:
   2.84, 95\% CI: 1.26 to 6.42), history of incarceration (aPR: 2.13, 95\%
   CI: 1.13 to 3.99), and low social capital (aPR: 1.53, 95\% CI: 1.12 to
   2.10). Higher monthly income (>250,000 FCFA vs. <50,000 FCFA) was
   associated with lower prevalence of new HIV diagnosis (aPR: 0.22, 95\%
   CI: 0.05 to 0.86).
   Conclusions: There are significant sociostructural factors that seem to
   potentiate risk of HIV infection and delay diagnosis among FSW in
   Cameroon. Initiatives to build social capital and integrate services
   such as pre-exposure prophylaxis and HIV self-testing into HIV programs
   may reduce new infections and decrease time to diagnosis and treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional auxetic materials with negative Poisson's ratio expand
   in response to a tensile strain in cross-section. Such counter-intuitive
   behaviours have been mainly ascribed to concave structures with ideal
   rigid ball-stick models. Here, based on first-principles calculations,
   we systematically analyze the mechanical behaviours of three life-boat
   structured two-dimensional (2D) materials and report two new auxetic
   materials: delta-arsenic and delta-graphane. The calculated Poisson's
   ratio values are correlated with Young's modulus, cohesive energy, and
   valence shell electron pair repulsion of isostructures. Combining with
   previous research, we provide a self-consistent explanation of the
   origin of the 2D in-plane negative Poisson's ratio and an algorithmic
   route to discover new auxetic materials by comparing the energy restored
   in bond rotation and stretch.}},

Abstract = {{The variation of negative corona-generated space charge related to the

   and the Poisson equation was computed by the successive over relaxation
   method. The variations of important parameters due to humidity were
   discussed including ionisation coefficient, attachment coefficient,
   effective ionisation coefficient and electron generation rate. Each of
   them increases with the rise in relative humidity (RH). The particles
   densities of electrons, positive ions and negative ions when RH is 50,
   80 and 90\% were also calculated, respectively, which decreased as RH

   graphene}},
Journal = {{DIAMOND AND RELATED MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{93}},
Pages = {{66-74}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{To investigate the property of anisotropic Poisson's ratio in graphene,
   we use the molecular dynamics (MD) method to simulate the stretching
   process. Pristine graphene and graphene with Stone - Wales (SW) defect,
   5-8-5 defect and di-vacancy defect are investigated. The results show
   that the Poisson's ratio always depends on the tensile strain and is
   sensitive to the tensile angle between the tensile direction and the
   armchair direction. For perfect graphene, its Poisson's ratio will
   transform from a positive value to a negative value at a critical
   strain. In the cases of smaller tensile angles, the corresponding
   Poisson's ratio and the critical strain are smaller, and even the
   negative Poisson's ratio is observed. For the defective graphene cases,
   it is found that a negative Poisson's ratio is more easily observed with
   higher defect concentrations. The negative Poisson's ratios of the
   graphene with 5-8-5 type defect and SW defect always arise from the
   wrinkles induced by these topologic defects. However, the negative
   Poisson's ratio of graphene with di-vacancy defect is caused by the
   deformation of graphene lattice structure, which is the same as the
   pristine graphene. The wrinkles in defective graphene are more likely to
   cause negative Poisson's ratio of graphene than its lattice structure
   deformations.}},

   sandwich structure were tested experimentally in a clamp-free
   configuration. In addition, a finite element model was developed to
   evaluate the loss factors and natural frequencies regarding different

Abstract = {{Chiral hyper-structure is a family of lightweight structure with
   negative Poisson's ratio, which leads benefit in mechanical properties
   and designability. In order to further improve some mechanical
   properties of chiral hyper-structures, the concept of gradient is
   introduced into the structure. Five groups of gradient tetra-chiral
   hyper-structure with different gradient factors are fabricated based on
   waterjet cutting technology, and the in-plane quasi-static lateral
   compression tests are carried out. Finite element models are developed
   for the in-plane linear elastic mechanical properties and plastic
   deformation modes under lateral compression condition. Theoretical
   prediction models of elastic modulus in gradient direction and Poisson's
   ratio of the gradient tetra-chiral hyper-structure is derived based on
   geometric assumptions and inhomogeneous deformation mode which are
   verified by experiments and finite element analysis. Simultaneously, the
   effects of gradient factors on the deformation characteristics and
   mechanical behaviors of the tetra-chiral hyper-structure are discussed
   and analyzed.}},

Abstract = {{In the past decade, mechanical metamaterials have garnered increasing
   attention owing to its novel design principles which combine the concept
   of hierarchical architecture with material size effects at
   micro/nanoscale. This strategy is demonstrated to exhibit superior
   mechanical performance that allows us to colonize unexplored regions in
   the material property space, including ultrahigh strength-to-density
   ratios, extraordinary resilience, and energy absorption capabilities
   with brittle constituents. In the recent years, metamaterials with
   unprecedented mechanical behaviors such as negative Poisson's ratio,
   twisting under uniaxial forces, and negative thermal expansion are also
   realized. This paves a new pathway for a wide variety of multifunctional
   applications, for example, in energy storage, biomedical, acoustics,
   photonics, and thermal management. Herein, the fundamental scientific
   theories behind this class of novel metamaterials, along with their
   fabrication techniques and potential engineering applications beyond
   mechanics are reviewed. Explored examples include the recent progresses
   for both mechanical and functional applications. Finally, the current

Abstract = {{Periodic lattices offer enhanced mechanical and dynamic properties per
   unit mass, and the ability to engineer the material response by
   optimizing the unit cell. Characterizing the effective properties of
   these lattice materials through experiments can be a time consuming and
   costly process, so analytical and numerical methods are crucial.
   Specifically, the Bloch-wave homogenization approach allows one to
   characterize the effective static properties of the lattice while
   simultaneously analyzing wave propagation properties such as band gaps,
   propagating modes, and wave directionality. While this analysis has been
   used for some time, a thorough study of this approach on
   three-dimensional (3D) lattice materials with different symmetries and
   geometries is presented here. Bloch-wave homogenization is applied to
   extract the effective stiffness tensor of 3D periodic lattices and
   confirmed with elastostatic homogenization, both within a finite element
   framework. Multiple periodic lattices with cubic, transversely
   isotropic, and tetragonal symmetry, including an auxetic geometry, over
   a wide range of relative densities are analyzed. Further, this approach
   is used to analyze 3D periodic composite structures, and a way to tailor
   their overall anisotropy is demonstrated. This work can serve as the
   basis for nondestructive evaluation of metamaterials properties using
   ultrasonic velocity measurements. (C) 2019 Acoustical Society of

Abstract = {{Oxide spinels of general formula AB(2)O(4) (A = Mg2+, Fe2+; B = Al3+,
   Cr3+, etc.) constitute one of the most abundant crystalline structures
   in mineralogy. In this structure, cations distribute among octahedral
   and tetrahedral sites, according to their size and the crystal-field
   stabilization energy. The cationic arrangement determines the
   mechanical, magnetic, and transport properties of the spinel and can be
   influenced by external parameters like temperature, pressure, or
   epitudal stress in the case of thin films. Here, we report a progressive
   change in the sign of the Poisson ratio, v, in thin films of CoFe2O4,
   defining a smooth crossover from auxetic (v < 0) to non-auxetic (v > 0)
   behavior in response to epitaxial stress and temperature.
   Microstructural and magnetization studies, as well as ab initio
   calculations, demonstrate that such unusual elastic response is actually
   due to a progressive redistribution of Co2+ among the octahedral and
   tetrahedral sites of the spinel structure. The results presented in this
   work clarify a long standing controversy about the magnetic and elastic
   properties of Co-ferrites and are of general applicability for
   understanding the stress-relaxation mechanism in complex crystalline
   structures. (C) 2019 Author(s).}},

Abstract = {{This study examines the variation in the number of strikes, and days
   lost to strikes, in the Mexican automobile industry. The analysis draws
   on an original data set on strikes in 11 Mexican finished vehicle plants
   for the period of 1980 and 2012. The statistical models are estimated
   using pooled Poisson and negative binomial regression. The findings of
   the study provide empirical support for perspectives that emphasize the
   legacies of state corporatism, and theories that focus on the effects of
   regional integration. Unions that were independent from the
   Confederation of Mexican Workers, and democratic unions, were associated
   with a higher count of strikes, and strikes of longer duration in each
   plant. Higher tariffs on imported vehicles also had a positive effect on
   strikes. However, the ratio of exports to national production in each
   firm was associated with a reduction in the number and duration of
   strikes. After adjusting for these influences, lagged real wage changes
   in each plant, local unemployment rates, and other factors had no
   influence.}},

Abstract = {{The results of studies on the influence of periodically stacked
   nanolayer inclusions, introduced into the face-centered cubic (f.c.c.)
   hard sphere crystal, on Poisson's ratio of the obtained nanocomposite
   system are presented. The monolayers are orthogonal to the
   {[}001]-direction. They are formed by hard spheres with diameter
   different from the spheres forming the matrix of the system. The Monte
   Carlo computer simulations show that in such a case the symmetry of the
   system changes from the cubic to tetragonal one. When the diameter of
   the inclusion spheres increases at certain range, a decrease of the
   negative Poisson's ratio in the {[}101]{[}101]-directions is observed,
   i.e., the system enhances its partial auxeticity. The dependence of the
   maximal, average, and negative parts of the minimal Poisson's ratio on
   the direction of the applied load are shown in a form of surfaces in
   spherical coordinates, plotted for selected values of nanolayer particle
   diameters. The most negative value of the Poisson's ratio found among
   all studied systems was -0.11 (at pressure p{*}100, which is about ten
   times higher than the melting pressure) what is almost twice more
   negative than in the f.c.c. crystal of identical hard spheres. The
   observed effect weakens along with the decrease of pressure and becomes
   hardly noticeable near melting. This study indicates that modifying only
   the size of the inclusion particles one can change Poisson's ratio of
   nanocomposites at high pressures.}},

Title = {{3D-Printed Mechanical Metamaterials with High Energy Absorption}},
Journal = {{ADVANCED MATERIALS TECHNOLOGIES}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Recently, 3D metamaterials have been achieved with inaccessible
   mechanical properties in natural materials such as negative Poisson's
   ratio, stiffness, and thermal expansion coefficient. While most of the
   developed metamaterials are with engineerable deformation evolution of
   structures, few studies have revealed their potential in energy
   absorption due to the limited mechanical properties of 3D-printed
   constituent materials and inevitable structural defects induced by the
   manufacturing process. Herein, an approach is proposed for creating 3D
   metamaterials of auxetic composite lattices via laser-sintering of
   carbon nanotubes reinforced nanocomposites, which provide a platform for
   the design and manufacturing of systems with programmable energy
   absorption capability. The optimization of constituent material and
   structural design enables the improvement of energy absorption
   performance across multiple scales. The energy absorption capacity of
   auxetic metamaterials was exponentially scaled with the relative density
   with the order of 2.5-3. The rationally topologized auxetic
   metamaterials exhibit a combination of high specific densification
   strength (0.0195 MPa kg(-1) m(-3)), ultrahigh energy absorption capacity
   (6.29 MJ m(-3)), and excellent specific energy absorption (20.42 J
   g(-1)). Impressively, this group of auxetic metamaterials possesses the
   advantageous specific energy absorption approaching that of titanium
   alloy foams as well as over a broad range of materials including plastic
   foams, aluminum alloy foams, and other 3D-printed lightweight
   structures.}},

Journal = {{ADVANCES IN ENGINEERING SOFTWARE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{129}},
Pages = {{69-80}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Compliant mechanisms are monolithic structures where the movement is
   given by the flexibility of the structure rather than the presence of
   joints and pins. The absence of joints allows the construction of
   compliant mechanisms in microscale. In this work, the compliant
   mechanism is designed by using topology optimization to generate
   microstructure unit cells that simulate the effect of auxetic materials,
   i.e. those with negative Poisson's ratio. Polygonal finite element
   meshes are introduced in the topology optimization formulation to avoid
   the hinges (one-node connections) in the compliant mechanism design. A
   pattern repetition constraint is applied to generate auxetic
   macrostructures. An integrated approach that combines a projection
   technique with a mapping technique is adopted to include the minimum
   member size constraint, making the topology optimization results
   possible to be manufactured. The connection of the topology optimization
   approach with additive manufacturing is demonstrated using 3D printers
   based on FFF (fused filament fabrication) and PolyJet technologies.
   Thus, computational simulation in connection with rapid prototyping are
   carried out to verify the results.}},

Abstract = {{A kinetic formulation is developed to investigate low-frequency dust ion
   acoustic waves (DIAWs) and dust acoustic waves (DAWs) as well as
   numerically for a four-component, collisionless, unmagnetized dusty
   plasma, using the linearized Vlasov-Poisson model for species obeying
   the Maxwellian distribution. In particular, the dynamics of
   low-frequency DIAWs is investigated by considering two cases. In the
   first case, ions and positive dust particles are assumed to be
   dynamically adiabatic while the negative dust particles are static in
   the background. In second case, the ions are taken adiabatic, while both
   positive and negative dust particles are static in the background. For
   DAWs, the ions are assumed to be isothermal, while both positive and
   negative dust species are considered adiabatic. Electrons are assumed to
   be isothermal in all cases. The linear characteristics and Landau
   damping rates for DIAWs and DAWs are investigated with effects of the
   dust particle concentrations and different temperature ratios. It is
   noted that for higher values of positive dust concentration, DIAWs
   (DAWs) are less (more) damped. It is also observed that the damping rate
   increases (decreases) as T-i approaches T-e for DIAWs (DAWs). It is
   worth adding here that the theoretical results presented here are
   supported by numerical analyses and illustrations. The relevance of the
   study to laboratory and cosmic plasmas is also pointed out.}},

Abstract = {{Socioeconomic status (SES) appears to have positive and negative
   associations with sexually transmitted infection (STI) risk in
   resource-limited settings, but few studies have evaluated nationally
   representative data. We assessed multiple SES measures and their effect
   on STI risk. We conducted a secondary analysis of data from the Uganda
   Demographic and Health Survey (UDHS 2011). The primary outcome (STI
   risk) was self-reported STIs and/or symptoms in the prior 12 months. We
   examined associations between multiple SES measures and STI risk using a
   mixed-effects Poisson regression model. The results showed that of the
   9256 sexually active individuals, 7428 women and 1828 men were included
   in the analysis. At an individual level, middle wealth quintile and
   disposable income were associated with STI risk, whereas being in the
   richest wealth quintile was protective. Residence in wealthier regions
   (adjusted incidence rate ratio {[}aIRR] 3.92, 3.62, and 2.75, for

   increased STI risk. Regional level analysis revealed stochastic
   variability of STI risk across geographical region (variance 0.03; p =

   the need for multi-sectoral interventions to address the upstream
   effects of poverty on STI risk and downstream effects of STIs on health

Abstract = {{Three 3D models with negative compressibility have been presented in our
   previous paper {[}X. Q. Zhou et al., Phys. Status Solidi B 2016, 253,
   1977]. However, the 2D mechanism (i.e., wine-rack mechanism) which we
   used to design 3D models is so symmetrical that the axial properties of
   it are equivalent, so we have only focused on geometry features. In this
   work, an extended study is conducted in order to find a more efficient
   method to design 3D structures with evident negative compressibility.
   Through theoretical modeling, the compressibility properties of three 3D
   models made from hinging hexagonal truss mechanism are analyzed and the
   conditions for negative compressibility to be exhibited are discussed.
   The study shows that in addition to the geometry features, negative
   compressibility effects can also be significantly affected by the
   arrangement of the framework and layout orientations of 2D mechanism.}},

   microstructure}},
Journal = {{LETTERS ON MATERIALS}},

Volume = {{9}},

Pages = {{45-50}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Structural, discrete and continual models of the Cosserat triangular
   lattice with a chiral microstructure are elaborated. The structural
   model is constructed on the base of particles of finite size with
   complex spring bonds. With symmetric diagonal bonds, one has the usual
   Cosserat triangular lattice, while with different diagonal bonds the
   Cosserat lattice with a chiral microstructure is realized. The choice of
   different variants enables one to compare the lattices with the ordinary
   and chiral microstructures and to select the specific properties caused
   by the chirality. For this purpose, the problems for the hexagonal cell
   are solved. In the first problem, the behaviour of the cell under a
   uniform compression (tension) of the cell is investigated. The ordinary
   lattice is compressed (elongated) in the direction of the force action.
   The particles of the chiral cell deviate from the direction of the force
   action during their displacements. The direction of the deviation is
   different for compressive (tensile) forces, i.e. the chiral lattice
   responds qualitatively differently to compression and tension. In the
   second problem, the top and bottom layers of the cell are rigidly
   compressed (stretched). The middle layer of the ordinary lattice is then
   stretched (compressed). This is a typical reaction of ordinary materials
   to tension (compression). The particles displace along the layer. In the
   chiral lattice, the middle layer is compressed under compression and is
   stretched under tension of the cell, i.e. chiral cell possesses the
   auxeticity property. In this case, the middle layer is inclined. The
   direction of inclination is different for compression or tension. Thus,
   the chirality effect is manifested. On the basis of the discrete model,
   equations of the continuum micropolar model are obtained. For symmetric
   connections, one has equations of the ordinary micropolar theory. The
   chiral lattice enables one to obtain equations of the chiral micropolar
   theory and to select the terms of the equations provided by chirality.
   Using the continuum model, one can find the values of the parameters,
   for which the second-order derivatives disappear in the rotational
   equations for the triangular lattice. Thus, it is possible to select a
   special case of parameters, for which the lattice is described by the
   equations of the reduced Cosserat theory.}},

Abstract = {{Based on density functional theory, the structural and elastic
   properties of InSb1-xBix alloys have been studied using first principle
   calculations. The generalized gradient approximation in the presence of
   spin-orbit coupling is utilized to perform the calculations presented in
   this paper. The calculated lattice constants of InSb1-xBix alloys are in
   good agreement with the available experimental data. The mechanical
   stability of these alloys is demonstrated using elastic constants. The
   ductility and brittleness of these alloys are investigated using both
   Poisson's ratio and Pugh's ratio. Moreover, the anisotropy of InSb1-xBix
   alloys is studied using the universal index and the 3D representation of
   Young's modulus. According to the obtained values of Poisson's ratio,
   the InSb0.5Bi0.5 and InBi alloys are auxetic materials. (C) 2018

Abstract = {{Rationally designed artificial materials providing unusual mechanical
   properties are attracting continuous interests due to the wide
   technological applications such as metamaterials for flexible electron
   and biomedical devices. A variety of natural biological tissues exhibit
   ``J-shaped{''} stress-strain behavior, so a challenge and interesting
   subject is to offer protection to electronics from a certain strain that
   may induce potential device failures. In the current letter, a novel
   porous auxetic metamaterial with ``J-shaped{''} stress-strain curve is
   designed and a method for tuning Poisson's ratio and stress-strain curve
   is illustrated. Experimental tests, numerical simulations, and
   analytical modeling are implemented to quantify the evolution of the
   Poisson's ratio and stress-strain curve, revealing the underlying
   mechanisms responsible for the unusual behavior. The structure
   simultaneously shows elastic wave bandgaps at certain frequency, which
   can finally extend to three-dimension. The designed structural
   metamaterial has potential for applications in tissue engineering,
   bio-medical devices, and comfortable integration of stretchable
   electronics with biological tissues, it also provides a new routine to
   design architected metamaterial systems exhibiting desired properties.}},

   that energy absorption of auxetic warp-knitted spacer fabric is mainly
   determined by its structural deformation capacity and yarn loading
   capacity, between which the yarn loading capacity of fabrics plays the
   dominant part in energy absorption, while the structural deformation
   capacity, which is affected by Poisson's ratio, has relatively little
   influence. With equivalent yarn loading capacity, the energy absorption
   of fabrics with negative Poisson's ratios are relatively better.}},

Abstract = {{Currently, auxetic yarns consisting of a core filament and a wrap
   filament are generally utilized as complex materials, which are
   attributed to residual torque. Thus, the main content dealt with in this
   paper was to analyze the structure formation and effect of heat
   treatment of helical auxetic complex yarn spun by a modified
   ring-spinning system. Firstly, an orthogonal experiment with three
   factors and three levels was carried out to study the effects of
   diameter ratio, yarn twists and initial helical angle on the structure
   and Poisson's ratio of complex yarn. Secondly, a heat treatment process
   with polyamide filament with low melting point (80celcius) was conducted
   to improve the structural stability of auxetic complex yarn. It was
   found that the heat treatment process can not only improve the
   structural stability of complex yarn, but also promote the expansion
   effect. By comparing experimental and theoretical results, it was found
   that the variation of Poisson's ratio with axial strain had good
   consistency. Therefore, the heat treatment method can effectively solve
   the slippage problem of helical auxetic complex yarn.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the thermal post-buckling behavior of sandwich
   beams with functionally graded (FG) negative Poisson's ratio (NPR)
   honeycomb cores. Two symmetric FG configurations of re-entrant honeycomb
   cores along the beam thickness direction are proposed for the first
   time. The material properties of both face sheets and core of the
   sandwich beams are assumed to be temperature-dependent. The thermal
   post-buckling behavior and the variation of effective Poisson's ratio
   (EPR) of the sandwich beam in the large deflection region are studied by
   using 3D full scale finite element simulations. Numerical results are
   presented for the sandwich beams with FG-NPR honeycomb core under a
   uniform temperature field, from which results for the same sandwich beam
   with uniform distributed NPR honeycomb core are obtained as a
   comparator. The EPR-deflection curves are obtained for the first time,
   and the results reveal that greater bending stiffness could bring about
   higher EPR-deflection curve. The effects of functionally graded
   configurations, boundary conditions, facesheet-to-core thickness ratios,
   cell wall-to-facesheet thickness ratios and length-to-thickness ratios
   on the thermal post-buckling load-deflection curves and EPR-deflection
   curves of sandwich beams are discussed in detail.}},

Title = {{Towards the design of mechanically superior tubular structures for
   microcatheters}},
Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Cardiac catheterization (CC) procedures in children and adults, and
   especially within vasculature of small cross-section comes with the
   increased risk of complications due to acute occlusive arterial injuries
   and (or) thrombosis. Micro-catheters play a vital role in enabling CC
   procedures, however, to extend their functionality beyond large blood
   vessels and into pediatric wards, necessitates superior mechanical
   attributes that are fundamental to their structure. There exists a
   strong correlation between tool footprint and the risk of these
   injuries, nevertheless, changes in tool-size are impeded by mechanical
   constraints and manufacturing. In this paper, we propose pattern
   geometries for tubular structures that can be tuned to obtain desired
   mechanical characteristics, while retaining a minimum tool
   cross-section. We perform numerical simulations to systematically
   investigate the effect of pattern design parameters on the tube's
   properties, and present guidelines for obtaining the preferred behavior.
   The rounded re-entrant honeycomb (RRH) is introduced as the base
   structure for more responsive catheters, and is contrasted with the
   dog-bone geometry (DB), and the conventional slot. Notably, the RRH
   patterned tubes are highly compliant in bending yet strong in torsion
   while the DB tubes are strong in both torsion and bending. Therefore,
   our results indicate positively for a wide-range of tunable behavior in
   patterned tubes, with the RRH poised as a promising alternative for
   achieving the design goals that are introduced.}},

Title = {{Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs and Opioid Overdoses Exploring

Abstract = {{Background: Prescription drug monitoring program are designed to reduce
   harms from prescription opioids; however, little is known about what
   populations benefit the most from these programs. We investigated how
   the relation between implementation of online prescription drug
   monitoring programs and rates of hospitalizations related to
   prescription opioids and heroin overdose changed over time, and varied
   across county levels of poverty and unemployment, and levels of medical
   access to opioids.
   Methods: Ecologic county-level, spatiotemporal study, including 990
   counties within 16 states, in 2001-2014. We modeled overdose counts
   using Bayesian hierarchical Poisson models. We defined medical access to
   opioids as the county-level rate of hospital discharges for noncancer
   pain conditions.
   Results: In 2010-2014, online prescription drug monitoring programs were
   associated with lower rates of prescription opioid-related
   hospitalizations (rate ratio 2014 = 0.74; 95\% credible interval = 0.69,
   0.80). The association between online prescription drug monitoring
   programs and heroin-related hospitalization was also negative but tended
   to increase in later years. Counties with lower rates of noncancer pain
   conditions experienced a lower decrease in prescription opioid overdose
   and a faster increase in heroin overdoses. No differences were observed
   across different county levels of poverty and unemployment.
   Conclusions: Areas with lower levels of noncancer pain conditions
   experienced the smallest decrease in prescription opioid overdose and
   the faster increase in heroin overdose following implementation of
   online prescription drug monitoring programs. Our results are consistent
   with the hypothesis that prescription drug monitoring programs are most
   effective in areas where people are likely to access opioids through
   medical providers.}},

Journal = {{CARBON}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Ten different simulation models are used to investigate the effects of
   content and chirality of graphene on the mechanical properties of
   nanolayered graphene/Cu composites. The increasing volume fraction of
   graphene can significantly enhance the Young's modulus and tensile
   strength of composites, but it leads to a lower yield strain. The
   negative Poisson's ratio of composites (NPRC) under uniaxial tension is
   observed at an atomic level. The corresponding mechanism is revealed by
   enhanced surface effect and inhomogeneous distribution of stress due to
   graphene-Cu interface. The strengthening mechanism of graphene is
   investigated by constraining effect in elastic region and blocking
   effect in plastic region. In a multi-layer structure, the middle copper
   film shows better tensile properties as its movement is constrained
   between two graphene layers. The blocking effect plays an important role
   in the interface interaction between graphene and dislocations. Graphene
   effectively blocks dislocations from penetrating through and restricts
   the synergistic movement of copper atoms. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Straight beams, rods and trusses are common elements in structural and
   mechanical engineering, but recent advances in additive manufacturing
   now also enable efficient freeform fabrication of curved, deformable
   beams and beam structures, such as microstructures, metamaterials and
   conformal lattices. To exploit this new design freedom for applications
   with nonlinear mechanical behavior, we introduce an isogeometric method
   for shape optimization of curved 3D beams and beam structures. The
   geometrically exact Cosserat rod theory is used to model nonlinear 3D
   beams subject to large deformations and rotations. The initial and
   current geometry are parameterized in terms of NURBS curves describing
   the beam centerline and an isogeometric collocation approach is used to
   discretize the strong form of the balance equations. Then, a nonlinear
   optimization problem is formulated in order to optimize the positions of
   the control points of the NURBS curve that describes the beam
   centerline, i.e., the geometry or shape of the beam. To solve the design
   problem using gradient-based algorithms, we introduce semi-analytical,
   inconsistent analytical and fully analytical approaches for calculation
   of design sensitivities. The methods are numerically validated and their
   performance is investigated, before the applicability and versatility of
   our 3D beam shape optimization method is illustrated in various
   numerical applications, including optimization of an auxetic 3D
   metamaterial. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: This study examines the relationship between economic
   adversity transitions from childhood to older adulthood and older
   adulthood physical performance among 1,998 community-dwelling older
   adults from five demographically diverse sites from middle and
   high-income countries. Method: The principal exposure variable was
   economic adversity transition. No adversity encompassed not experiencing
   poverty in both childhood and older adulthood, improved described having
   only experienced poverty in childhood, worsened captured having
   experienced poverty in older adulthood, and severe is having experienced
   poverty in both childhood and older adulthood. The short physical
   performance battery (SPPB) was used for outcome measures. Analyses of
   the continuous SPPB score used linear regression, while analysis of a
   binary outcome (SPPB < 8 vs. >= 8) used Poisson regression models with
   robust error variance, both adjusting for sex, education, and site
   location. Result: In sex-stratified models, the SPPB < 8 prevalence rate
   ratio (PRR) was higher for the severe (PRR: 2.80, 95\% confidence
   interval {[}CI] = {[}1.70, 4.61]), worsened (PRR: 2.40, 95\% CI =
   {[}1.41, 4.09]), and improved (PRR: 1.82, 95\% CI = {[}1.11, 3.01])
   groups, compared with those with no adversity in childhood or as adults,
   but only for females. Discussion: Findings from this study indicate that
   persistent economic adversity has a negative effect on older adult
   physical performance, especially among women.}},

Title = {{Analysis of crash frequency in motorway tunnels based on a correlated
   random-parameters approach}},
Journal = {{TUNNELLING AND UNDERGROUND SPACE TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{85}},

Abstract = {{The paper provides an analysis of the frequency of total accidents
   (accidents involving material damage, physical injuries and fatalities),
   which occurred in 226 unidirectional motorway tunnels over a four-year
   monitoring period, based on unrelated and correlated random-parameter
   models. The so-called random-intercept model, in which only the
   regression intercept is assumed to be random, was also developed a
   priori for recording the random-effects (temporal correlations among
   accidents occurring in the same tunnel in different years). The
   independent variables were: tunnel length (L), annual average daily
   traffic (AADT) per lane, percentage of trucks (\%Tr), presence of a
   sidewalk (SW), longitudinal slope (LS), and mechanical ventilation (MV).
   The comparison among the aforementioned three models showed that the
   correlated random-parameters model, which takes into account the cross
   correlation among the random-parameters, provided a better
   goodness-of-fit than the corresponding uncorrelated random-parameter and
   intercept-random models. This means that more precise estimations of
   accidents can be obtained when the random-parameters are assumed to be
   correlated in statistical analysis. The developed model also offers
   additional insights into showing how different combinations of
   parameters affect tunnel safety. In particular, through the correlation
   coefficient matrix of random-parameters, we found that the non-constant
   longitudinal slope (LS) alleviates the effect of the annual average
   daily traffic (AADT) per lane on increasing crash frequency. In
   addition, the presence of the mechanical ventilation (MV) in tunnels
   makes less significant the influence of AADT per lane on increasing
   crash frequency, too. The knowledge of these correlations may be useful
   for future applications, for example, for road engineers in designing
   tunnel. The model proposed can also be used by Tunnel Management
   Agencies (TMAs) for estimating possible variations in accident frequency
   in a specific tunnel due to modifications of traffic control systems.}},

Title = {{Unique mechanical responses of layered phosphorus-like group-IV
   monochalcogenides}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{125}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{FEB 28}},
Abstract = {{As interesting analog of black phosphorus, group-IV monochalcogenides MX
   (M = Ge, Sn; X = S, Se) are greatly expected to have potential
   applications in photodetectors, photovoltaics, thermoelectric, and
   piezoelectric devices. In this paper, we conduct a thorough
   investigation on the mechanical properties of four MX monochalcogenides,
   i.e., single-and multi-layered GeS, GeSe, SnS, and SnSe, including their
   ideal tensile strength, evolution of monolayer bulking height, and phase
   transition under uniaxial strain within the framework of density
   functional theory. The ultimate tensile strengths of the four
   monochalcogenides are found rather low, while the failure strains are
   remarkably high, showing ultrahigh mechanical flexibility. Meanwhile,
   the ideal strength demonstrates strong anisotropy, which may induce the
   exfoliated MX thin flakes showing an obvious in-plane cleavage tendency
   of much easier to crack along the zigzag orientation. In addition, it is
   found that all of them are potential auxetic materials with large
   negative Poisson's ratios, just like single-layer black phosphorus.
   Furthermore, we find all the monolayer monochalcogenides will
   demonstrate geometrical phase transition when uniaxial compressive
   strains are applied. It is expected that these newly found unique
   features of monolayer group-IV monochalcogenides and their derivatives
   make them attractive candidates for their incorporation in future
   mechanical, nanoelectronics, and thermal applications.}},

Title = {{Determinants and outcomes of access-related blood-stream infections
   among Irish haemodialysis patients; a cohort study}},
Journal = {{BMC NEPHROLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{20}},
Month = {{FEB 26}},
Abstract = {{BackgroundInfections are the second leading cause of death and
   hospitalisation among haemodialysis (HD) patients. Rates of
   access-related bloodstream infections (AR-BSI) are influenced by patient
   characteristics and local protocols. We explored factors associated with
   AR-BSI in a contemporary cohort of HD patients at a tertiary nephrology
   centre.MethodsA retrospective cohort of 235 chronic HD patients was
   identified from a regional dialysis programme between Jan 2015 and Dec
   2016. Data on demographics, primary renal disease, comorbid conditions
   and dialysis access type were obtained from the Kidney Disease Clinical
   Patient Management System (KDCPMS). Data on blood cultures were captured
   from the microbiology laboratory. Poisson regression with robust
   variance estimates was used to compare infection rates and relative risk
   of AR-BSI according to the site and type of vascular access.ResultsThe
   mean age was 65 ( 15) years, 77\% were men, and the median follow up was
   19months (IQR: 10-24months), accumulating 2030 catheter-months and 1831
   fistula-months. Overall rates of AR-BSI were significantly higher for
   central venous catheter (CVC) compared to arteriovenous fistula (AVF),
   (2.22, 95\% (CI): 1.62-2.97) versus 0.11 (0.01-0.39) per 100
   patient-months respectively), with a rate ratio of 20.29 (4.92-83.66),
   p<0.0001. This pattern persisted across age, gender and diabetes
   subgroups. Within the CVC subgroup, presence of a femoral CVC access was
   associated with significantly higher rates of AR-BSI (adjusted RR 4.93,
   95\% CI: 2.69-9.01). Older age (75+ versus <75years) was not associated
   with significant differences in rates of AR-BSI in the unadjusted or the
   adjusted analysis. Coagulase negative Staphylococcus (61\%) and
   Staphylococcus aureus (23\%) were the predominant culprits. AR-BSIs
   resulted in access loss and hospitalisation in 57 and 72\% of events
   respectively, and two patients died with concurrent AR-BSI.Conclusions
   Rates of AR-BSI are substantially higher in CVC than AVF in contemporary
   HD despite advances in catheter design and anti-infective protocols.
   This pattern was consistent in all subgroups. The policy of AVF
   preference over CVC should continue to minimise patient morbidity while
   at the same time improving anti-infective strategies through better care
   protocols and infection surveillance.}},

Abstract = {{Malgaigne fractures are the most common and widespread pelvic injuries
   resulting from the shear forces the action mechanism of which has not
   been explained in the literature yet. Military accidents with improvised
   explosive devices (IED) perfectly reflect this type of pelvic fracture.
   The finite element (FE) model of lumbar-pelvic complex (LPC) was
   developed based on computed tomography (CT) scans with the seat
   including steel frame, padding and soft tissue. The correlation
   coefficients of both low (100 N) and high (500 N) loads were greater
   than that currently obtained in the literature due to the presence of
   muscle force, pubic symphysis and joint cartilage. The dynamic analysis
   was performed to determine the influence of varying kinds of foam
   materials i.e. polyurethane, aluminium honeycomb structured and
   polyurethane auxetic foam on the stress/strain distribution in LPC under
   vertical impact load with the velocity of 7 m/s. Performed analysis
   showed the first fracture occurred in the L5 vertebrae resulting in the
   sacroiliac ligaments disruption and stress concentration in the pelvic
   ring causing further fractures of the wing of ilium, pubis and ischium
   bones. This results clearly explain the inconclusive findings about the
   second fracture that occurs in the pelvic area under a vertical impact
   load. The applied seat padding foam significantly reduced the stresses
   transmitted to the anatomical structures, thereby avoiding the risk of
   pelvic fracture. The analysis has proven that the auxetic polyurethane
   foam can be used as a good energy absorber.}},

Abstract = {{The structural, mechanical, and electronic properties of typical
   iron-containing phases, Al3Fe, Al6Fe, and Al7Cu2Fe, in Al-Cu alloys were
   determined using first-principles calculations. The calculated lattice
   constants were in good agreement with experimental values. Al3Fe
   exhibited the highest structural stability and most superior alloying
   ability. Al6Fe had the worst alloying ability and required a high
   cooling rate for its formation during solidification. Al7Cu2Fe was the
   easiest to dissolve into the Al matrix because it has the lowest
   negative cohesion energy. Mechanical properties improved with increasing
   pressure. Al3Fe exhibited the highest stiffness and strongest resistance
   to volume change and shear deformation. Al6Fe had better ductility owing
   to the high bulk-to-shear modulus ratio and Poisson's ratio; however, it
   had the lowest hardness and highest anisotropy, leading to a strong
   tendency for crack initiation. Density of states data showed that no
   structural variation or phase transformation occurs for any of the
   phases under applied pressure; moreover, they indicated covalent bonding
   in Al3Fe, accounting for the relatively high structural stability.
   Finally, all iron-containing phases were confirmed to be paramagnetic.}},

Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{210}},
Pages = {{167-178}},

Abstract = {{Chiral auxetic cellular structures were fabricated from Ti6Al4V alloy
   using the Selective Electron Beam Melting method, and tested
   experimentally under quasi-static and dynamic compression loading
   conditions. The experimental results were used to validate built
   computational models of auxetic cellular structure in LS-DYNA. The
   models were used to study the geometry effect on the Poisson's ratio of
   the analysed chiral auxetic structure. The response of sandwich
   composite panels with auxetic core under blast loading was studied
   extensively computationally, where the maximum panel displacement and
   the Specific Energy Absorption (SEA) of the composite panel were
   evaluated. Three different methods for blast loading (ConWep, Smooth
   Particle Hydrodynamic, Multi-Material Arbitrary Lagrange-Eulerian) were
   compared and validated based on the experimental data. It was determined
   that larger thickness of the cover plate lowers the panel maximum
   displacement, while the SEA is larger when thinner cover plates are
   used. Also, it was shown that the chiral unit cell amplitude effect on
   the maximum displacement and SEA is, in most analysed cases, negligible
   in comparison to the cell length effect, which is more prominent. The
   presented study illustrates great potential of using sandwich structures
   with designed auxetic cellular cores to improve the response of modern
   composite structures to blast loading.}},

Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{210}},
Pages = {{327-338}},
Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{Design of materials and structures with quite low coefficient of thermal
   expansion (CTE), even zero or negative CTE is important for industrial
   application where drastic temperature changes are encountered. In this
   paper, making use of the bending of bi-material beam and the unique
   deformation mechanism of chiral lattice structures, five sets of chiral
   lattice composite structures with tailorable CTEs are proposed, where
   synergic effects of rigid node rotation and bi-material ligament bending
   deformation are responsible for giant range of structural deformation
   due to temperature change, from positive CTE to negative CTE through
   adjusting the geometrical parameters of composite bi-material chiral
   unit cell, and the relationship between unit cell geometric parameters
   and CTEs of the structure are studied systematically through finite
   element analysis. Finally, design of bi-material cylindrical shells
   consisting of anti-tetra chiral unit cells are proposed, and its axial
   CTEs with different number of the unit cells along the circumferential
   are studied systematically, demonstrating the robust range of CTEs can
   be generated through adjusting the geometrical parameters of chiral
   bi-material unit cells. The proposed chiral structures demonstrated
   promising application potentials in industrial fields, such as:
   aerospace and microelectronics, where extremely high structural accuracy
   is required during harsh working temperature environment.}},

Title = {{Study on the strain-induced mechanical property modulations in monolayer
   Tellurene}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{125}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{FEB 14}},
Abstract = {{Two-dimensional monolayer Tellurium, termed as Tellurene (Te), has
   recently been fabricated in the experiment. In this work, under uniaxial
   strain applied along either the armchair or zigzag direction with strain
   strength varying from 0 to 40\%, we have investigated the mechanical
   property of Te including three allotropes (alpha-Te, beta-Te, and
   gamma-Te). Our results show that the beta-Te exhibits the most obvious
   anisotropy in the stress-strain curve, Young's modulus, and Poisson's
   ratio, which is thought to originate from its inherent structure
   characteristic. The stress-strain curve demonstrates that the beta-Te
   can withstand relatively high critical strain up to 36\% in the armchair
   direction and 35\% in the zigzag direction. The calculated Young's
   modulus E(theta) of the beta-Te is 55 GPa in the zigzag direction and
   that is 27 GPa in the armchair direction. The comparative high critical
   strain and small Young's modulus mean that beta-Te has good flexibility.
   Moreover, under the strain range within 15\%, the direction being easy
   to be stretched has a reversion, which is thought to be decided by the
   competition between the puckered structure and the transfer charge
   resistant to deformation. Furthermore, when the strain is applied along
   the direction parallel to the pucker of beta-Te, it is interesting to
   find that Poisson's ratio is negative in the out-of-plane direction. The
   hinged structure of the beta-Te contributes to the negative Poisson's
   ratio, which can be comprehended by the hypothetical step-by-step
   evolution process. Published under license by AIP Publishing.}},

   (AgNW) conductors through dip-coating AgNWs on a 3D polymeric scaffold
   and following a simple triaxial compression approach. The resulting 3D
   AgNW conductors exhibit good stability of resistance under multimodal
   deformation, such as stretching, compressing, and bending as well as
   comparable conductivity with those elastomer-based ones. Moreover, the
   buckled structures endow our 3D conductors with novel negative Poisson's
   ratio behavior, which can offer good comfortability to curvilinear
   surfaces. The combination of mechanical properties, conductive
   performance, and unique deformation characteristics can satisfy
   multiscale conformal mechanics with a soft, curvilinear human body.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the interplay between prestress and mechanical properties
   in random elastic networks. To do this in a controlled fashion, we
   introduce an algorithm for creating random free-standing frames that
   support exactly one state of self-stress. By multiplying all the bond
   tensions in this state of self-stress by the same number-which with the
   appropriate normalization corresponds to the physical prestress inside
   the frame-we systematically evaluate the linear mechanical response of
   the frame as a function of prestress. After proving that the mechanical
   moduli of affinely deforming frames are rigorously independent of
   prestress, we turn to nonaffinely deforming frames. In such frames,
   prestress has a profound effect on linear response: not only can it
   change the values of the linear modulus-an effect we demonstrate to be
   related to a suppressive effect of prestress on nonaffinity-but
   prestresses also generically trigger a bistable mechanical response.
   Thus, prestress can be leveraged to both augment the mechanical response
   of network architectures on the fly, and to actuate finite deformations.
   These control modalities may be of use in the design of both novel
   responsive materials and soft actuators.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanical properties of oxalic acid dihydrate and anhydrous oxalic
   acid ( and polymorphic forms) were obtained by using rigorous
   theoretical solid-state methods based on density functional theory using
   plane waves and pseudopotentials. The calculated crystal structures and
   X-ray powder diffraction patterns of these materials were found to be in
   excellent agreement with the experimental information. Since the
   calculated elasticity matrices fullfilled the Born stability conditions,
   the corresponding crystal structures were found to be mechanically
   stable. A large number of relevant mechanical properties including the
   values of the bulk moduli and their pressure derivatives, shear and
   Young moduli, Poisson ratios, ductility and hardness indices, and
   mechanical anisotropy values of these materials were reported. The three
   forms of oxalic acid are highly anisotropic ductile materials having low
   hardness and bulk moduli. The three materials are shown to display small
   negative Poisson ratios (NPR) and to exhibit the phenomenon of negative
   linear compressibility (NLC) for applied pressures along the direction
   of the minimum Poisson ratio. In addition, they undergo pressure induced
   phase transitions for relatively small applied pressures. The analysis
   of the crystal structures of these materials as a function of pressure
   demonstrates that the mechanism of NLC of these materials is unrelated
   to the wine-rack structural mechanism commonly used to rationalize this
   phenomenon. The three forms of oxalic acid considered in this work are
   molecular crystals whose structures are characterized by structural
   elements which are not directly bonded but held together by weak van der
   Waals forces. The weak bonding between these elements is able to
   accommodate the structural variations originating from the application
   of pressure, but the resulting structural deformations appear to be
   counterintuitive and lead to the anomalous mechanical behavior of these
   materials.}},

Title = {{Non-Auxetic Mechanical Metamaterials}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{FEB 2}},
Abstract = {{The concept of mechanical metamaterials has become increasingly popular,
   since their macro-scale characteristics can be designed to exhibit
   unusual combinations of mechanical properties on the micro-scale. The
   advances in additive manufacturing (AM, three-dimensional printing)
   techniques have boosted the fabrication of these mechanical
   metamaterials by facilitating a precise control over their
   micro-architecture. Although mechanical metamaterials with negative
   Poisson's ratios (i.e., auxetic metamaterials) have received much
   attention before and have been reviewed multiple times, no comparable
   review exists for architected materials with positive Poisson's ratios.
   Therefore, this review will focus on the topology-property relationships
   of non-auxetic mechanical metamaterials in general and five topological
   designs in particular. These include the designs based on the diamond,
   cube, truncated cube, rhombic dodecahedron, and the truncated
   cuboctahedron unit cells. We reviewed the mechanical properties and
   fatigue behavior of these architected materials, while considering the
   effects of other factors such as those of the AM process. In addition,
   we systematically analyzed the experimental, computational, and
   analytical data and solutions available in the literature for the
   titanium alloy Ti-6Al-4V. Compression dominated lattices, such as the
   (truncated) cube, showed the highest mechanical properties. All of the
   proposed unit cells showed a normalized fatigue strength below that of
   solid titanium (i.e., 40\% of the yield stress), in the range of 12-36\%
   of their yield stress. The unit cells discussed in this review could
   potentially be applied in bone-mimicking porous structures.}},

Title = {{Metamaterials with Poisson's ratio sign toggling by means of
   microstructural duality}},
Journal = {{SN APPLIED SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{1}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Neither positive nor negative Poisson's ratio materials are fully
   advantageous across a wide range of load bearing applications. In some
   cases, it is advantageous for structures to possess duality in material
   properties so as to take advantage of auxetic behavior under one loading
   condition as well as conventional behavior when the loading condition
   changes. This paper proposes two metamaterials-the hybrid
   rhombic-re-entrant metamaterial and the hybrid kite-arrowhead
   metamaterial-in which the prescription of either compressive or tensile
   load always leads to lateral expansion. Specifically, the Poisson's
   ratio of these metamaterials range from negative infinity to zero upon
   tensile load, and from zero to positive infinity upon compressive load.
   This duality of auxetic and conventional behavior for each of these
   metamaterial is achieved by employing a simultaneous lock and slide
   mechanism that is interchangeable upon load reversal. When loaded in one
   direction, the locked part takes effect while the sliding part becomes
   redundant. Upon load direction reversal, the previously locked and
   sliding parts convert to sliding and locked parts, respectively, thereby
   activating the redundant part while deactivating the functional part.
   The change in effective microstructural components, therefore,
   facilitates Poisson's ratio sign toggling with load reversal. Due to the
   indiscriminate lateral expansion regardless of the axial loading
   direction, such behavior in a fiber is useful to resist both fiber
   pull-out as well as fiber push-out from the matrix material.}},

Abstract = {{Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has the potential to be an empowering
   HIV prevention tool among female sex workers (FSW), yet little is known
   about PrEP awareness and interest in this population. Sex workers and
   Police Promoting Health in Risky Environments (SAPPHIRE) is a
   prospective cohort study of street-based FSW in Baltimore, MD. A
   cross-sectional analysis explored awareness and interest in PrEP among
   HIV-negative FSW. Multivariable Poisson regressions modeled associations
   between individual, interpersonal, and structural variables and PrEP
   awareness and interest. Of n = 232 FSW, 66\% were white, half were less
   than 35 years old, 59\% injected drugs daily, and 66\% sold sex daily.
   Only 21\% of FSW were aware of PrEP, though 74\% were interested. PrEP
   awareness was associated with experiencing client condom coercion
   {[}adjusted incidence rate ratio (aIRR) = 0.50, 95\% CI: 0.28-0.90] and
   condomless sex with an intimate partner (aIRR = 0.54, 95\% CI:
   0.30-0.98). PrEP interest was associated with perceiving PrEP as ``very
   easy{''} to take (aIRR = 1.91, 95\% CI: 1.49-2.45) and moving to an
   unfamiliar geographic area to sell sex (aIRR = 1.20, 95\% CI:
   1.04-1.39). Women who had a current gonorrhea or chlamydia infection
   were less likely to be interested in PrEP (aIRR = 0.75, 95\% CI:
   0.59-0.95). Though PrEP awareness among FSW is low, there are FSW who
   are significantly more likely to express interest in PrEP and outreach
   efforts should target these women. Results suggest that women-controlled
   HIV prevention methods may be important for reducing incidence among
   FSW.}},

Abstract = {{We determined whether rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-cyclic
   citrullinated peptide antibody (ACPA) can predict remission or severe
   disability in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients treated with anti-tumor
   necrosis factor (TNF) alpha drugs. We performed a cohort study based on
   the clinical data from a referral center for the treatment of RA in
   Bogota, Colombia, were included patients aged >= 18 years with diagnosis
   of RA with an active disease and for whom a treatment scheme was begun
   with anti-TNF alpha medication, with a minimum follow-up time of 12
   months. Disease activity of Rheumatoid Arthritis was assessed through
   measurement of RF, ACPA, disease activity score (DAS28), and health
   assessment questionnaire (HAQ). We calculated the incidence rates (IRs)
   for remission and severe disability. We also calculated the incidence
   rate ratio (IRR) for each outcome by adjusting for possible confounders
   using the Poisson regression method. The hypothesis was tested with a P
   value of <.05. Statistical analysis was performed in Stata 15. We
   included 400 patients receiving an anti-TNF alpha agent. Median age was
   60 years, and 322 patients were women (80.5\%). RF was positive in 357
   patients (89\%), ACPA in 348 patients (87\%), and co-positivity in 324
   patients (81\%). Median follow-up was 41 months (range, 12-79 months).
   The IR for remission was 23 per 100 person-years in RF-negative patients
   and 16 per 100 person-years in RF-positive patients. The adjusted IRR
   (age sex, treatment, and ACPA) was 1.51 (95\%CI, 1.05-2.18). The IR for
   severe disability was 10.8 per 100 person-years in the RF-positive
   cohort and 2.3 per 100 person-years in the RF-negative cohort. The IRR
   adjusted for these factors was 4.37 (95\%CI, 1.6-12). Co-positivity had
   a similar behavior to RF. No differences were recorded in the rates of
   remission or disability in ACPA-positive and ACPA-negative patients. Our
   findings suggest that remission is less frequent and severe disability
   more frequent in RF-positive patients treated with anti-TNF alpha agents
   than in RF-negative patients.}},

Abstract = {{For many decades, it has been challenging to synthesize auxetic
   materials at the molecular level. Auxetic materials exhibit
   counterintuitive behavior; they expand perpendicularly to the direction
   in which they are stretched. An aromatic macrocycle containing a
   sequence of N-substituted and N-unsubstituted amides was designed to
   resemble the re-entrant structure found in macromolecular auxetic
   materials. Upon application of tensile force, bent cis amides change to
   linear trans amides. This was anticipated to trigger the expansion of
   the macrocycle perpendicular to the direction of the applied force. To
   investigate the proposed configurational change by atom force microscopy
   (AFM), we designed and prepared a cis-trans aramide motif incorporated
   into an end-functionalized polymer which ensured covalent attachment to
   the AFM tip. At large extensions, polymer chains were envisioned to
   unfold and induce cis-trans isomerization.}},

Abstract = {{A new 2D microstructure is proposed herein in the form of rigid unit
   cells, each taking the form of a cross with two opposing crossbars
   forming slots and the other two opposing crossbars forming sliders. The
   unit cells in the microstructure are arranged in a rectangular array in
   which the nearest four neighboring cells are rotated by 90 degrees such
   that a slider in each unit cell is connected to a slot from its nearest
   neighbor. Using a kinematics approach, the Poisson's ratio along the
   axes of symmetry can be obtained, while the off-axis Poisson's ratio is
   obtained using Mohr's circle. In the special case of a square array, the
   results show that the Poisson's ratio varies between 0 (for loading
   parallel to the axes) and -1 (for loading at 45 degrees from the axes).
   For a rectangular array, the Poisson's ratio varies from 0 (for loading
   along the axes) to a value more negative than -1. The obtained results
   suggest the proposed microstructure is useful for designing materials
   that permit rapid change in Poisson's ratio for angular change.}},

Title = {{Dynamic Crushing Analysis of a Three-Dimensional Re-Entrant Auxetic
   Cellular Structure}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{Dynamic behaviors of the three-dimensional re-entrant auxetic cellular
   structure have been investigated by performing beam-based crushing
   simulation. Detailed deformation process subjected to various crushing
   velocities has been described, where three specific crushing modes have
   been identified with respect to the crushing velocity and the relative
   density. The crushing strength of the 3D re-entrant auxetic structure
   reveals to increase with increasing crushing velocity and relative
   density. Moreover, an analytical formula of dynamic plateau stress has
   been deduced, which has been validated to present theoretical
   predictions agreeing well with simulation results. By establishing an
   analytical model, the role of relative density on the energy absorption
   capacity of the 3D re-entrant auxetic structure has been further
   studied. The results indicate that the specific plastic energy
   dissipation is increased by increasing the relative density, while the
   normalized plastic energy dissipation has an opposite sensitivity to the
   relative density when the crushing velocity exceeds the critical
   transition velocity. The study in this work can provide insights into
   the dynamic property of the 3D re-entrant auxetic structure and provides
   an extensive reference for the crushing resistance design of the auxetic
   structure.}},

Abstract = {{The crash box can absorb energy from the beam as much as possible, so as
   to reduce the collision damage to the front part of the car body and
   protect the safety of passengers. This work proposes a novel crash box
   filled with a three-dimensional negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) inner
   core based on an inner hexagonal cellular structure. In order to
   optimize and improve the crash box's energy absorption performance, the
   multi-objective optimization model of the NPR crash box is established,
   which combines the optimal Latin hypercube design method and response
   surface methodology. Then, the microstructure parameters are further
   optimized by the multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm
   to obtain an excellent energy absorption effect. The simulation results
   show that the proposed NPR crash box can generate smooth and
   controllable deformation to absorb the total energy, and it can further
   enhance the crashworthiness through the designed optimization algorithm.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICS OF PLASMAS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The kinetic theory of an electron emitting electrode immersed in a
   low-density isotropic plasma is developed for the first time to include
   the theory of formation of a virtual cathode in this scenario. In
   addition to virtual cathode solution for supercritical emission, the
   potential profile solution for subcritical and critical emission is also
   included. The plasma-electron and emitted-electron are assumed to have
   half Maxwellian velocity distributions at the sheath entrance and
   electrode surface, respectively, while the plasma ions are assumed to be
   cold. Poisson's equation is then solved numerically for charge densities
   in the assumed negative sheath structure. The resulting potential
   profiles in the sheath for the floating and current carrying
   electrode/wall are calculated numerically. These potential profiles show
   a smooth transition from subcritical to critical and to supercritical
   emissions with increasing emitted-electron temperature T-e,T-em
   (decreasing parameter alpha = T-e,T-pl/(Te,em), plasma-electron to
   emitted-electron temperature ratio). The numerical solution of potential
   profiles for supercritical emission confirms the formation of a virtual
   cathode. The structure of the virtual cathode is dependent on the chosen
   boundary values. These results also show that the virtual cathode
   potential profile structure exists around alpha < 5 to alpha = 1.5 but
   the solution at alpha = 1 does not exist in this scenario. It indicates
   that the present model is applicable only to the situation where the
   sheath potential is negative relative to plasma potential. Published

Title = {{Local discontinuous Galerkin method for modeling the nonplanar
   structures (solitons and shocks) in an electronegative plasma}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF PLASMAS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Using the hydrodynamic equations of cold inertial positive ions with the
   Maxwellian distribution for light negative ion and electron densities
   and the Poisson equation, the family of nonplanar (cylindrical and
   spherical) Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equations, i.e., the KdV, modified
   KdV, and extended KdV (EKdV), are obtained for small but finite
   amplitude ion-acoustic waves. The nonplanar EKdV equation is used to
   analyze the time-dependent planar and nonplanar soliton and shock
   structures. It is well-known that the exact solutions of the family of
   nonplanar KdV equations are not possible. Therefore, a local
   discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) method is developed for solving the
   nonplanar EKdV equation numerically. According to this method, the
   initial and boundary conditions for the solitary and shock waves are
   accurately identified. The L-2 stability of the LDG method is proved for
   the general nonlinear case. The existence regions for both solitary and
   shock excitations have been defined precisely depending on the
   laboratory plasma parameters. Moreover, the effects of the negative-ion
   temperature ratio and the negative ion concentration on the profiles of
   the nonlinear structures (solitons and shocks) are examined. The effect
   of the geometrical divergence on the pulse profile is also reported
   which indicates that the localized pulses deform as time goes on.
   Furthermore, it is found that the amplitude of cylindrical structures
   (solitons and shocks) is larger than that of planar ones but smaller
   than that of the spherical ones. Moreover, in cylindrical geometry, the
   nonlinear structures travel slower than in the spherical ones. The
   implications of our results agree with the experimental observations.

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{.This paper investigates the nonlinear dynamic response of sandwich
   beams with functionally graded (FG) negative Poisson's ratio (NPR)
   honeycomb core in thermal environments. The novel constructions of
   sandwich beams with four FG configurations of re-entrant honeycomb cores
   through the beam thickness direction are proposed for the first time.
   The temperature-dependent material properties of both face sheets and
   core of the sandwich beam are considered. 3D full scale finite element
   analyses are conducted to investigate the nonlinear dynamic response,
   and the variation of effective Poisson's ratio (EPR) of the sandwich
   beam in the large deflection region. The numerical simulations are
   carried out for the sandwich beam with FG-NPR honeycomb core, from which
   results for the same sandwich beam with uniform distributed NPR
   honeycomb core are obtained as a comparator. Present results indicate
   that, when subjected to transverse dynamic pressure, the induced dynamic
   bending moment of the sandwich beam with core of positive EPR is much
   bigger than that of the sandwich beam with NPR core, and the thickness
   of which will extraordinarily increase. The effects of loading types,
   functionally graded configurations, temperature changes, boundary
   conditions, and length-to-thickness ratios on the deflection-time curves
   and EPR-deflection curves of sandwich beams are discussed in detail.}},

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional auxetic materials have attracted considerable attention
   due to their potential applications in medicine, tougher composites,
   defense, and so on. However, they are scare especially at low dimension,
   as auxetic materials are mainly realized in engineered materials and
   structures. Here, using first-principles calculations, we identify a
   compelling two-dimensional auxetic material, single-layer Ag2S, which
   possesses large negative Poisson's ratios in both in-plane and
   out-of-plane directions, but anisotropic ultralow Young's modulus. Such
   a coexistence of simultaneous negative Poisson's ratios in two
   directions is extremely rare, which is mainly originated from its
   particular zigzag-shaped buckling structure. In addition, contrary to
   the previously known metal-shrouded single-layer M2X (M = metal, X =
   nonmetal), single-layer Ag2S is the first nonmetal-shrouded M2X.
   Electronic calculations show that it is an indirect-gap semiconductor
   with gap value of 2.83 eV, and it can be turned to be direct with
   strain. These intriguing properties make single-layer Ag2S a promising
   auxetic material in electronics and mechanics.}},

Title = {{Architected Origami Materials: How Folding Creates Sophisticated
   Mechanical Properties}},
Journal = {{ADVANCED MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Origami, the ancient Japanese art of paper folding, is not only an
   inspiring technique to create sophisticated shapes, but also a
   surprisingly powerful method to induce nonlinear mechanical properties.
   Over the last decade, advances in crease design, mechanics modeling, and
   scalable fabrication have fostered the rapid emergence of architected
   origami materials. These materials typically consist of folded origami
   sheets or modules with intricate 3D geometries, and feature many unique
   and desirable material properties like auxetics, tunable nonlinear
   stiffness, multistability, and impact absorption. Rich designs in
   origami offer great freedom to design the performance of such origami
   materials, and folding offers a unique opportunity to efficiently
   fabricate these materials at vastly different sizes. Here, recent
   studies on the different aspects of origami materials-geometric design,
   mechanics analysis, achieved properties, and fabrication techniques-are
   highlighted and the challenges ahead discussed. The synergies between
   these different aspects will continue to mature and flourish this
   promising field.}},

   Poisson ratios under large stretching}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{151}},
Pages = {{314-321}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Recently, open cellular substrates instead of traditional solid
   substrates have been used in flexible electronics, catering to the need
   for high permeability of bio-fluids through the device. The Poisson
   ratio of the existing open cellular designs, however, remains positive,
   which is inappropriate for the cellular substrates mounting on some
   biological auxetic materials, as the resulting mismatch in deformation
   may cause irritation. In the current work, a type of triangular lattice
   networks is presented with satisfactory negative Poisson ratio effect
   over large strains. A finite deformation model is developed for the
   deformed angles, constitutive relation and maximum strain of the
   building block, with nonlinear finite element method (FEM) validations.
   Results demonstrate desired negative Poisson ratios and mechanical
   properties can be achieved in an isotropic manner by tailoring three
   geometric parameters (arc angle theta(0), length/radius ratio L/R and
   width/radius ratio w/R). Thereinto, longer arm lengths not only yield
   lower equivalent modulus and maximum strain, but also enable wider range
   of isotropic negative Poisson ratios (from -0.35 to 0) and applied
   strains (from 0\% to 80\%), providing more flexibility in network
   designs and new possibilities to emerging biomedical applications.}},

Title = {{In-plane dynamic crushing behaviors of a novel auxetic honeycomb with
   two plateau stress regions}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{151}},
Pages = {{746-759}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{In order to obtain honeycomb structure with higher energy absorption
   capacity, a novel honeycomb is proposed by adding double arrowhead
   honeycomb (DAH) cells into star-shaped honeycomb (SSH), and therefore
   named as star-arrowhead honeycomb (SAH). An analytical model is built to
   investigate the in-plane elastic properties of the newly proposed
   honeycomb and the results are in good agreement with the finite element
   simulations. The in-plane dynamic crushing behaviors and energy
   absorption capabilities of SAH are studied systematically by finite
   element method and are compared with that of SSH and DAH. Two plateau
   stress regions in the stress-strain curves of SAH are observed under
   low-velocity impact loading, and the second plateau stress is over three
   times higher than the first one. The in-plane Poisson's ratio of SAH
   under static and high-velocity impact loading always shows negative
   value. However, the Poisson's ratio of SAH changes from negative to
   positive under low-velocity and medium-velocity impact loading. In
   addition, the Poisson's ratio of SSH and DAH are negative during the
   entire dynamic deformation processes. The results of finite element
   simulations show that SAH can absorb much more energy than SSH with the
   same relative densities under different impact velocities, especially
   under low-velocity impact loading. Furthermore, the effects of the cell
   wall thickness and the impact velocity on plateau stress of SAH are
   discussed, and therefore a deformation map is summarized. It can be
   concluded that SAH is a better choice for energy absorption. This study
   may provide a new design concept for the high performance honeycomb
   structure with multi plateau stress regions.}},

Abstract = {{Family affluence plays a crucial role in adolescent well-being and is
   potential source of health inequalities. There are scarce research
   findings in this area from a cross-national perspective. This study
   introduces several methods for measuring family affluence inequality in
   adolescent life satisfaction (LS) and assesses its relationship with
   macro-level indices. The data (N=192,718) were collected in 2013/2014 in
   39 European countries, Canada, and Israel, according to the methodology
   of the cross-national Health Behavior in School-aged Children study. The
   11-, 13- and 15-year olds were surveyed by means of self-report
   anonymous questionnaires. Fifteen methods controlling for confounders
   were tested to measure social inequality in adolescent LS. In each
   country, all measures indicated that adolescent from more affluent
   families showed higher satisfaction with their life than did those from
   less affluent families. According to the Poisson regression estimations,
   for instance, the lowest inequality in LS was found among adolescents in
   Malta, while the highest inequality in LS was found among adolescents in
   Hungary. The ratio between the mean values of LS score at the extreme
   highest and lowest family affluence levels (Relative Index of
   Inequality) derived from the regression-based models distinguished for
   its positive correlation with the Gini index, and negative correlation
   with Gross National Income, Human Development Index and the mean Overall
   Life Satisfaction score. The measure allows in-depth exploration of the
   interplay between individual and macro-socioeconomic factors affecting
   adolescent well-being from a cross-national perspective.}},

Title = {{Mechanical performance of additively manufactured meta-biomaterials}},
Journal = {{ACTA BIOMATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{85}},
Pages = {{41-59}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Additive manufacturing (AM) (=3D printing) and rational design
   techniques have enabled development of meta-biomaterials with
   unprecedented combinations of mechanical, mass transport, and biological
   properties. Such meta-biomaterials are usually topologically ordered and
   are designed by repeating a number of regular unit cells in different
   directions to create a lattice structure. Establishing accurate
   topology-property relationships is of critical importance for these
   materials. In this paper, we specifically focus on AM metallic
   meta-biomaterials aimed for application as bone substitutes and
   orthopaedic implants and review the currently available evidence
   regarding their mechanical performance under quasi-static and cyclic
   loading conditions. The topology-property relationships are reviewed for
   regular beam-based lattice structures, sheet-based lattice structures
   including those based on triply periodic minimal surface, and graded
   designs. The predictive models used for establishing the topology
   property relationships including analytical and computational models are
   covered as well. Moreover, we present an overview of the effects of the
   AM processes, material type, tissue regeneration, biodegradation,
   surface bio-functionalization, post-manufacturing (heat) treatments, and
   loading profiles on the quasi-static mechanical properties and fatigue
   behavior of AM meta-biomaterials. AM meta-biomaterials exhibiting
   unusual mechanical properties such as negative Poisson's ratios (auxetic
   meta-biomaterials), shape memory behavior, and superelasitcity as well
   as the potential applications of such unusual behaviors (e.g. deployable
   implants) are presented too. The paper concludes with some suggestions
   for future research.
   Statement of Significance
   Additive manufacturing enables fabrication of meta-biomaterials with
   rare combinations of topological, mechanical, and mass transport
   properties. Given that the micro-scale topological design determines the
   macro-scale properties of meta-biomaterials, establishing
   topology-property relationships is the central research question when
   rationally designing meta-biomaterials. The interest in understanding
   the relationship between the topological design and material type on the
   one hand and the mechanical properties and fatigue behavior of
   meta-biomaterials on the other hand is currently booming. This paper
   presents and critically evaluates the most important trends and findings
   in this area with a special focus on the metallic biomaterials used for
   skeletal applications to enable researchers better understand the
   current state-of-the-art and to guide the design of future research
   projects. (C) 2018 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Recent advances in the design of structural composites often mimic
   natural microstructures. Specifically, the structure of abalone nacre
   with its high stiffness, tensile strength, and toughness is a source of
   inspiration from the process of evolution. The inspiration from nacre
   can lead to design of a new class of architected structural materials
   with superb mechanical properties. This work presents a combined
   experimental and computational study on a set of bioinspired architected
   composites created using a cement mortar cast with brick-and-mortar and
   auxetic polymer phases. The impact of this unit-cell polymer phase on
   the flexural and compressive strengths, resilience, and toughness is
   thoroughly studied as a function of architected geometry. All mechanical
   properties of the architected composite specimens are found to be
   greater than those of control samples due to prevention of localized
   deformation and failure, resulting in higher strength. The architected
   composites showed more layer shear sliding during fracture, whereas the
   control samples showed more diagonal shear failure. After initial
   cracking, the architected composites gradually deformed plastically due
   to interlocking elements and achieved high stresses and strains before
   failure. Results also show that composites with the architected polymer
   phase outperform control samples with equal volume fraction of a
   randomly oriented polymer fiber phase. Extensive computational studies
   of the proposed unit cells are also performed and the results suggest
   that the orientation of cells during loading is critical to achieve
   maximum performance of a cementitious composite. The implications of
   these results are immense for future development of high performing
   construction materials.}},

Abstract = {{Localized deformations in materials and structures are usually due to
   instability and are sensitive to various stochastic imperfections
   introduced during either the manufacturing processes or in-service life.
   As a result, they always occur in an uncertain manner. In this study, a
   two dimensional bistable cellular mechanical metamaterial (CMM) is
   designed, showing highly ordered localized deformation under static
   loading. The metamaterial consists of periodically distributed
   elliptical holes of dual sizes. By varying the geometrical parameters of
   the holes, the CMM can be monostable or bistable. The responses of the
   CMM to uniaxial compression are systematically explored by finite
   element (FE) simulations. It is shown that the monostable CMM can have
   either positive or negative Poisson's ratio and undergo homogeneous
   deformation up to moderate uniaxial compression. However, the bistable
   CMM has negligible Poisson's ratio and, most interestingly, shows highly
   ordered localized deformation zones, similar to the multi-soliton
   feature in fluids and physics. Based upon the unit cell of the CMM, a
   simplified spring chain model is developed. In the continuum limit, the
   model reduces to the Klein-Gordon equation. Analytical trivial solution
   and kink-antikink solution of the spring chain model are obtained. They
   are found to faithfully capture the FE simulated homogeneous deformation
   of the monostable CMM and the ordered localized deformations of the
   bistable CMM. The findings can provide insight into the ordered
   localized deformation, phase transformation, and static topological
   soliton of mechanical metamaterials. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Prolonged or serious conflicts at work and incident dementia: a 23-year

Abstract = {{PurposeOnly a few studies have investigated the impact of negative
   aspects of social relations on cognitive function, and they have shown
   mixed results. Conflicts at work are part of the negative aspects of
   social relations, but the impact of experiencing conflicts at work has
   not yet been investigated as a risk factor for dementia. Therefore, we
   investigated whether experiencing prolonged or serious conflicts with a
   supervisor or colleagues at work was associated with incident dementia
   in old age.MethodsWe analyzed data of 6,436 men and women from the third
   survey of the Copenhagen City Heart Study. At baseline in 1991-1994, the
   participants reported whether they had ever had a prolonged or serious
   conflict at work. The participants were followed until 2014. We used
   Poisson regression to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRR) and their
   95\% confidence intervals (CI).ResultsAfter adjusting for potential
   confounders, the IRR for dementia was 1.53 (95\% CI 0.77-3.03) among
   participants who had reported having prolonged or serious conflicts both
   with a supervisor and colleagues compared with participants who had
   never had such conflicts. In separate analyses stratified by sex, the
   IRRs were 2.14 (95\% Cl 0.97-4.71) for men and 0.98 (95\% Cl 0.29-3.32)
   for women.ConclusionsOur findings did not support an overall association
   between experiencing prolonged or serious conflicts at work and incident
   dementia. However, because of the large differences in the point
   estimates for men and women, future research could aim at investigating
   potential sex differences regarding the association between conflicts at
   work and dementia.}},

Abstract = {{The association between invasive dental treatments (IDTs) and a
   short-term risk of myocardial infarction (MI) and ischemic stroke (IS)
   remains controversial. Bacterial dissemination from the oral cavity and
   systemic inflammation linked to IDT can induce a state of acute vascular
   dysfunction. The aim of study is to investigate the relation of IDTs to
   MI and IS by using case-only study designs to analyze data from a large
   Taiwanese cohort. A nationwide population-based study was undertaken by
   using the case-crossover and self-controlled case series design to
   analyze the Taiwanese National Health Care Claim database. Conditional
   logistic regression model and conditional Poisson regression model were
   used to estimate the risks of MI/IS. In addition, we used burn patients
   as negative controls to explore the potential effect of residual
   confounding. In total, 123,819 MI patients and 327,179 IS patients in
   the case-crossover design and 117,655 MI patients and 298,757 IS
   patients were included in the self-controlled case series design.
   Results from both study designs showed that the risk of MI within the
   first 24 wk after IDT was not significantly different from or close to
   unity except for a modest risk during the first week for patients
   without other comorbidities (odds ratios {[}95\% confidence intervals]
   of 1.31 {[}1.08-1.58] and 1.15 {[}1.01-1.31] for 3 d and 7 d,
   respectively). We also observed no association between IDTs and IS, or
   the risk ratio was close to unity. IDTs did not appear to be associated
   with a transient risk of MI and IS in the Taiwanese population, with
   consistent findings from both case-only study designs. However, we
   cannot exclude that dental infections and diseases may yield a long-term
   risk of MI and IS.}},

Abstract = {{A rectangular-cells with triangular array and a triangular-cells with
   rectangular array composite microstructures are introduced herein, which
   can exhibit Poisson's ratio sign switching upon reversal of applied
   stress direction. Each of these microstructures consists of short rigid
   rods and long flexible rods held together by pin joints. The choice of
   microstructures permits them to be converted into either conventional or
   auxetic microstructural geometries depending on the collective
   deflection patterns of the long flexible rods. Specifically, the
   micro-structures convert into conventional and auxetic ones when loading
   causes the long flexible rods to deflect outward and inward,
   respectively. The same consideration applies in the case of thermal
   expansion analysis, which leads to positive and negative thermal
   expansivities under constraint condition. Generated results were made on
   the basis of moderately large deflection analysis and buckling analysis.
   A greater range of applications can be made on a single structure when
   it can exhibit greatly differing, or even opposing, properties under
   loadings of opposite directions.}},

   auxetic cores and (3) laminates with randomly arranged and ordered
   auxetic and negative thermal expansion layers. We evaluate the effective
   characteristics of these hybrids by analysing representative volume
   elements using the finite element method. We observe that the plate-like
   auxetic inclusions increase the effective stiffness of the hybrid. This
   stiffening effect was previously reported for spherical and cubic
   auxetic inclusions and is further investigated in this study. We
   demonstrate that the aspect ratio of the plate-like shapes has strong
   influence on this stiffening effect the decrease in the aspect ratio
   reduces stiffening in the direction parallel to the layers and enhances
   it in the direction perpendicular to them. In the auxetic laminates, the
   stiffening effect strengths with the increase in the number of auxetic
   layers. We also show that thinner inclusions provide lower effective
   linear coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) in the direction parallel
   to the layering and higher effective CTE in the direction perpendicular
   to it.}},

Abstract = {{A theoretical analysis of longitudinal stretching of a thin rectangular
   two-layered plate formed of hexagonal crystals with the same orientation
   is given. The effective elastic properties (Young's modulus and
   Poisson's ratios) of the plate are dependent on such properties of the
   constituent crystal as the sign and value of Poisson's ratios, the ratio
   of Young's moduli and the ratio of the thicknesses of the layers. These
   dependencies can be either simple or complex. It is shown that effective
   Young's modulus of the two-layered plate always exceeds the result
   calculated by the rule of mixtures of Voigt. For small differences
   between Young's moduli (or Poisson's ratios) of the initial crystals,
   the accuracy of predicting effective Young's modulus by the rule of
   mixtures turns out to be quite satisfactory. Effective in-plane
   Poisson's ratio can be either larger or smaller than the prediction by
   the rule of mixtures. Special results were obtained for plates of the
   auxetic-nonauxetic type. In the case of plates with varying layers
   thickness ratios, the increase in the thickness of the auxetic layer
   makes it possible to control the value of negative effective in-plane
   Poisson's ratio of the two-layered auxetic-nonauxetic plate.}},

Abstract = {{A rational new plate theory must meet specific guidelines and cannot be
   proposed by merely choosing a different function for the transverse
   variations of the displacement components. In the present research, a
   novel hyperbolic global-local plate theory is proposed based on 8
   criteria, for the first time and implemented in a new energy formulation
   that takes into account the potential energy of the contact region, for
   behavior analysis of biaxially preloaded sandwich plates with
   unevenly-distributed SMA wires and soft cores under impulsive/impact
   loads. The proposed theory contains both odd and even functions and
   consequently, is more appropriate for asymmetric lamination schemes; in
   addition to satisfying the continuity condition of the interlaminar
   stresses. It is the first time that stress-strain asymmetry and
   anisotropy of the SMA is incorporated in the impact response analysis.
   Modified micro-macro-mechanical and bridging models are employed to
   relate the apparent properties to the local ones and vice versa. Effects
   of the uniform, double-linear, and double-sinusoidal distributions of
   the SMA wires are compared. The localized time variations of phases
   evolutions of the anisotropic SMA wires are predicted based on a

Abstract = {{Statistical tolerance intervals for discrete distributions are widely
   employed for assessing the magnitude of discrete characteristics of
   interest in applications like quality control, environmental monitoring,
   and the validation of medical devices. For such data problems,
   characterizing extreme counts or outliers is also of considerable
   interest. These applications typically use traditional discrete
   distributions, like the Poisson, binomial, and negative binomial. The
   discrete Pareto distribution is an alternative yet flexible model for
   count data that are heavily right-skewed. Our contribution is the
   development of statistical tolerance limits for the discrete Pareto
   distribution as a strategy for characterizing the extremeness of
   observed counts in the tail. We discuss the coverage probabilities of
   our procedure in the broader context of known coverage issues for
   statistical intervals for discrete distributions. We address this issue
   by applying a bootstrap calibration to the confidence level of the
   asymptotic confidence interval for the discrete Pareto distribution's
   parameter. We illustrate our procedure on a dataset involving cyst
   formation in mice kidneys.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The mechanical responses of two novel kinds of two-dimensional (2D)
   mechanical metamaterials containing opposite or parallel snapping curved
   (U-shaped) segments with elastic snap-through instability mechanism are
   systematically investigated. Under uniaxial loading, the metamaterials
   undergo a large deformation caused by stiffness mismatch between
   snapping (buckling instabilities) and supporting (relative
   stiffer/thicker) components, exhibiting very small transverse
   deformation after every snapping. Based on the multi-stable mechanism,
   phase transformation/shape-reconfiguration and zero Poisson's ratio are
   achieved up to large morphological change. Nonlinear mechanical
   responses including self-recovering snapping and multi-stability
   enabling snapping behaviors can be generated by tuning the geometric
   parameters (the relative thickness of the snapping and supporting
   segments as well as the amplitude of the snapping curved segments). Then
   topology analysis is carried out to develop the 2D structures to a
   series of 3D hierarchical configurations from which can be chosen for
   various engineering conditions with enhanced snapping mechanism.
   Specifically, multi-stable/shape-reconfigurable tubes and cylinders are
   designed using the 3D configurations. Besides, one of the 3D
   metamaterials is developed for functional applications as shock absorber
   and damper, i.e., the process from fully stretched state to fully
   compacted state is used to absorb energy and reduce incoming pressure
   with small stiffness and strength; then the fully compacted
   metamaterials are used to carry load and attenuate vibration with
   relative bigger stiffness and strength. This work gives advance to the
   design, analysis and manufacture of functionally reconfigurable
   mechanical metamaterials.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we address the problem of testing the fit of three
   discrete distributions, giving a brief account of existing tests and
   proposing two new tests. One of the new tests is for any discrete
   distribution function. This general test is a discrete version of a
   recently proposed test for the skew-normal in Potas et al. (Appl Math
   Sci 8(78):3869-3887, 2014), which in turn is based on a test for
   normality in Zhang (J R Stat Soc Ser B 64(2):281-294, 2002). The other
   test which is proposed is given explicitly for testing the Poisson, the
   negative binomial or the binomial distributions. It is based on earlier
   work by Gonzalez-Barrios et al. (Metrika 64:77-94, 2006) done for
   distributions within the power series family. This test uses the
   conditional density (probability) of the observed sample, given the
   value of the minimal sufficient statistic. The proposed new test is
   defined as a conditional probabilities ratio, modifying the previous
   criterion. An extensive simulation study to compare the power of the
   proposed new tests with established tests of fit is carried out, using
   alternatives that had been used in previous simulations, for these
   particular distributions. In the study, all tests compared were used
   identifying their exact conditional distribution given the adequate
   sufficient statistic, so no approximations were made by using asymptotic
   distributions and possibly estimates of the unknown parameters present
   in their asymptotic distributions.}},

Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{125}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{JAN 28}},
Abstract = {{The discovery of auxetic behavior (negative Poisson's ratio) within
   elements and alloys had focused attention on their elastic anisotropy in
   an effort to understand the range of crystal orientations that manifest
   this property. A comparison of elastic constant data to atomistic models
   based on pair-wise, central force models provides key insights into
   deformation behavior of cubic crystals over a wide range of anisotropy,
   including, for the first time, those with Zener anisotropy ratios less
   than 1. A simple criterion is derived which dictates all cases in which
   a crystal whose atomic ordering obeys cubic symmetry will display
   auxetic deformation, where the extrema in Poisson's ratio involves (110)
   orientations. In the field of stress determination through x-ray
   diffraction, these findings also shed light on strain anisotropy in
   polycrystalline materials, where the elastic incompatibility between
   adjacent grains alters their overall deformation. By applying these same
   atomistic models, we can predict the Voigt/Reuss weighting fractions
   associated with Kroner limit x-ray elastic constants for cubic
   materials, a necessary component in quantifying stress using diffraction
   data. We also establish that greater elastic anisotropy in a constituent
   crystal leads to a more rigid mechanical response in the corresponding
   polycrystalline aggregate, with implications for auxetic crystal
   ensembles. Published under license by AIP Publishing.}},

Abstract = {{Background
   Ukraine has the second largest European HIV epidemic. This study aimed
   to describe stigma, demographic and social factors and their association
   with anxiety among perinatally and behaviourally-HIV-infected (PHIV;
   BHIV) young people in Kiev and Odessa.
   Methods
   104 PHIV and 100 BHIV young people aged 13-25 years completed a
   confidential tablet-based survey. Survey tools included the Hospital
   Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) (anxiety sub-scale scores of 8-10
   indicating mild and >= 11 moderate/severe symptoms in last 7 days),
   Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) and HIV Stigma Scale (HSS) (short
   version, composite of disclosure, negative self-image and public
   attitudes sub-scales). Unadjusted Poisson regression models were fitted
   to explore factors associated with moderate/severe anxiety symptoms.
   Results
   PHIV and BHIV young people were of median age 15.5 {[}IQR 13.9-17.1] and
   23.0 {[}21.0-24.3] years, having registered for HIV care a median 12.3
   {[}10.3-14.4] and 0.9 {[}0.2-2.4] years previously; 97\% (97/100) and
   66\% (65/99) respectively were on ART. Overall 43\% (95\% CI 36-50\%)
   reported any and 13\% (95\% CI 9-19\%) moderate/severe anxiety symptoms,
   with no difference by HIV acquisition mode (p = 0.405) or gender (p =
   0.700). 42\% (75/180) reported history of an emotional health problem
   for which they had not been referred/attended for care. Moderate/severe
   anxiety symptoms were associated with HIV-related stigma (prevalence
   ratio (PR) 1.24 95\% CI 1.14-1.34 per HSS unit increase), lower
   self-esteem (PR 0.83 95\% CI 0.78-0.90 per RSES point increase), CD4 <=
   350 cells/mm(3) (PR 2.29 95\% CI 1.06-4.97), having no-one at home who
   knew the respondent's HIV status (PR 9.15 95\% CI 3.40-24.66 vs all
   know) and, among BHIV, less stable living situation (PR 6.83 95\% CI
   1.99-23.48 for >= 2 vs no home moves in last 3 years) and history of
   drug use (PR 4.65 95\% CI 1.83-11.85).
   Conclusions
   Results indicated unmet need for psychosocial support. Further work is
   needed to explore strategies for mental health support, particularly
   around disclosure, self-esteem and stigma.}},

Title = {{Differential Impacts of HIV status on short-term fertility desires among
   couples in Rakai, Uganda}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 24}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Fertility desires of female and male partners in current relationships
   are often correlated. We examined the influence of HIV seropositive
   status of female and male partners on short-term fertility desires in
   Rakai, Uganda, a setting with high fertility and HIV infection rates.
   Methods
   Participants were couples (15-49 years old) enrolled in the Rakai
   Community Cohort Study, from 2011 to 2013 (n = 2,291). Cohen's kappa
   coefficient was used to measure the correlation of female and male
   partners' short-term fertility desires (measured as `wanting a child in
   the next 12 months'), in both total sample and stratified serostatus
   groups. HIV serostatus and additional characteristics of female and male
   partners were included in Poisson regression models to estimate the rate
   ratios (RR) for each partner's short-term fertility desires. Individual
   and partner characteristics included HIV status, partner HIV status, age
   in years, partner age in years, educational attainment, number of living
   children, community of residence, and socioeconomic status (SES).
   Results
   Short-term fertility desires among female and male partners were
   moderately associated (Kappa = 0.37, p-value<0.001). The association was
   weakest among female sero-positive and male sero-negative couples (Kappa
   = 0.29, p-value<0.001). When adjusting for parity and other covariates
   in the model, women's short-term fertility desires were significantly
   associated with their positive sero-status regardless of male partners'
   sero-status (adjRR = 1.58, p<0.001 for F+M-; adjRR = 1.33, p = 0.001 for
   F+M+; in comparison with F-M-). Men's short-term fertility desires were
   significantly associated with their positive sero-status, in addition to
   their female partners' positive sero-status (adjRR = 1.23 with p-value =
   0.022 for F-M+; adjRR = 1.42 with p-value<0.001 for F+M-; adjRR = 1.26
   with p-value<0.001 for F+M+; in comparison with F-M-). When the
   differential effect of parity was included in the model, similar
   associations remained for both female and male partners when the number
   of living children was small, but largely reduced when the number of
   living children was large (3 or more).
   Conclusion
   Female and male partners in couple dyads demonstrated moderate
   agreements about short-term fertility desires. The HIV seropositive
   status of female partners was most strongly associated with short-term
   fertility desires of both genders, and this association was even
   stronger for women who had few or no living children.}},

Journal = {{NATURE}},
Year = {{2019}},

Number = {{7739}},

Month = {{JAN 17}},
Abstract = {{Architected materials that consist of periodic arrangements of nodes and
   struts are lightweight and can exhibit combinations of properties (such
   as negative Poisson ratios) that do not occur in conventional solids.
   Architected materials reported previously are usually constructed from
   identical `unit cells' arranged so that they all have the same
   orientation. As a result, when loaded beyond the yield point, localized
   bands of high stress emerge, causing catastrophic collapse of the
   mechanical strength of the material. This `post-yielding collapse' is
   analogous to the rapid decreases in stress associated with dislocation
   slip in metallic single crystals. Here we use the hardening mechanisms
   found in crystalline materials to develop architected materials that are
   robust and damage-tolerant, by mimicking the microscale structure of
   crystalline materials-such as grain boundaries, precipitates and phases.
   The crystal-inspired mesoscale structures in our architected materials
   are as important for their mechanical properties as are crystallographic
   microstructures in metallic alloys. Our approach combines the hardening
   principles of metallurgy and architected materials, enabling the design
   of materials with desired properties.}},

   resistance}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{208}},
Pages = {{758-770}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{Recently, auxetic honeycombs have attracted considerable attention for
   their excellent mechanical properties, especially the potential
   applications for energy absorption. In this paper, a novel re-entrant
   auxetic honeycomb is proposed and named as re-entrant star-shaped
   honeycomb (RSH), with the in-plane impact responses explored
   theoretically and numerically. Three types of microstructural
   deformation modes are observed under different impact velocities,
   including low-velocity mode, medium-velocity mode and high-velocity
   mode. Moreover, a deformation map is summarized to illustrate the
   effects of the impact velocity and the relative density on the
   deformation modes. Two typical plateau stress regions are detected under
   low-velocity impact loading, and the second plateau stress is almost
   twice higher than the first one. The transverse contraction of the RSH
   mainly occurs at the first plateau region, which is different for the
   classical re-entrant honeycomb (RH). In addition, the absorbed energy of
   the RSH decreases slightly and then increases with the impact velocity.
   The results of the finite element simulations suggest that the RSH shows
   more excellent impact resistance, compared with the RH and SSH with same
   cell wall thickness. Furthermore, the effects of the cell wall thickness
   and the impact velocity on the crushing strength of the RSH are
   discussed, and the theoretical results are in good agreement with the
   finite element simulations.}},

Abstract = {{This paper mainly concerns effects of the auxetic structure on the crash
   performances in terms of the axial crash force, specific energy
   absorption, and deceleration, which are evaluated with the conventional
   and honeycomb structures. Based on the systematic design procedure, the
   re-entrant units for the auxetic structure are regularly arranged in the
   tube wall, which are produced by the additive manufacturing with SUS316L
   metal powder. Under the low impact condition, the auxetic does not only
   exhibit higher specific energy absorption, but also demonstrate
   substantially low deceleration due to effect of the densification during
   the axial crash compared with the conventional tube. Furthermore, while
   the honeycomb tube demonstrates oscillating behavior in the
   deceleration, the auxetic tube tends to maintain steady deceleration
   after the first peak during the axial crash, which is able to guarantee
   enhanced damping performances under the low impact condition.}},

Abstract = {{Conductive rubber nanocomposites have been attracting interest for
   strain sensing applications owing to their large deformation and high
   sensitivity. In this paper, the strain sensing behavior of room
   temperature vulcanized (RTV) hybrid silicone rubber composites
   containing carbon nanotubes and graphene was systematically
   investigated. We studied the effects of the nanofiller content and
   strain amplitude on the strain sensing behavior of the nanocomposites,
   and found good stability and durability during cyclic loading. The
   shoulder peaks appeared in the cyclic loading curves owing to the
   competition between the reconstruction process of the conductive network
   during deformation and time-dependent features of the polymer material.
   Furthermore, our test results of different loading histories indicated
   that a sufficient recovery time could reduce or even eliminate the
   shoulder peak. Finally, the mechanical structure with a negative
   Poisson's ratio is designed to regulate the resistance response of the
   RTV nanocomposites, exhibiting a monotonic and more sensitive resistance
   response. Our research results explain the main factors contributing to
   the shoulder peak phenomenon of conductive nanocomposites and provide a
   regulation strategy for achieving a monotonic and highly sensitive
   resistance response.}},

Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{161}},
Pages = {{22-34}},
Month = {{JAN 5}},
Abstract = {{Structures with negative Poisson's ratios have been widely applied in
   existing engineering, especially in the field of energy absorption. To
   design double-arrowed auxetic structures to better absorb energy, it is
   essential to conduct parametric analysis on their crashworthiness. In
   this paper, the effect of the geometric parameters on the
   crashworthiness performance is analyzed thoroughly on both macro-and
   micro-sized scales. At the macro scale, the effect of the slenderness
   ratio and size of the unit cell are analyzed. Additionally, the critical
   slenderness ratio is derived to distinguish the deformation modes under
   axial impact loading. At the micro scale, analysis of the effect of the
   angles and thickness of beams on the crashworthiness performance is
   conducted. It is found that the crashworthiness performance of
   double-arrowed auxetic structure is more sensitive to the parameters of
   the long-inclined beam than those of the short one. The discussion in
   this paper can help engineers to better design and optimize the
   double-arrowed crash box. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{In a Poisson process, it is well-known that the forward and backward
   recurrence times at a given time point t are independent random
   variables. In a renewal process, although the joint distribution of
   these quantities is known (asymptotically), it seems that very few
   results regarding their covariance function exist. In the present paper,
   we study this covariance and, in particular, we state both necessary and
   sufficient conditions for it to be positive, zero or negative in terms
   of reliability classifications and the coefficient of variation of the
   underlying inter-renewal and the associated equilibrium distribution.
   Our results apply either for an ordinary renewal process in the steady
   state or for a stationary process.}},

Abstract = {{Objective(s): HIV-positive individuals have elevated rates of anal
   squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and sexually transmitted infections with
   its causative agent, high-risk human papillomavirus, and other
   oncoviruses including hepatitis B virus (HBV). HBV infection can cause
   liver cancer, and has been associated with increased risk of some
   extra-hepatic cancers including biliary tract cancer, pancreatic cancer,
   and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Whether HBV is associated with anal SCC risk
   is unknown.
   Design: Prospective study of anal SCC risk in HIV-positive and
   HIV-negative MSM in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study from 1984 to 2014.
   Methods: Poisson regression models were used to examine the association
   between past or current HBV infection (positive tests for HBV core
   antibodies, surface antigen, and/ or DNA) and anal SCC risk.
   Results: We observed 53 cases of anal SCC among 5298 participants with
   79 334 person-years follow-up. Among HIV-positive men, past or current
   HBV infection was associated with anal SCC risk in models adjusted for
   age, CD4(+) cell counts, HAART use, and other risk factors {[}incidence
   rate ratio (IRR), 95\% confidence interval 3.15, 1.27-7.82]. Additional
   risk factors included immunological parameters 1 and 6 years prior to
   diagnosis (IRR, 95\% confidence interval 2.45, 1.31-4.58 and 2.44,
   1.3-4.59 for CD4(+) cell counts < 500 cells/ml; 2.43, 1.34-4.42 and
   2.77, 1.5-5.11 for CD4(+) : CD8(+) ratios < 0.5, respectively). Among
   HIV-negative men, IRR for prior HBV and anal SCC risk was similar, but
   NS due to small number of cases.
   Conclusion: HIV-positive MSM with prior HBV infection have increased
   anal SCC risk. This population may benefit from screening. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{The object of this research is the design of pneulastics, initially
   flat, pneumatically activated stretchable membranes with areas of
   differentiated thickness- and therefore elasticity- that respond with a
   different expansion rate and create complex tension conditions on their
   surface when sealed and pneumatically inflated. Previous work
   {[}1],{[}2],{[}4] has already shown interest in the analysis and
   acquisition of control over the geometry of inflatable structures, by
   introducing tension conditions upon the uniform pressure stresses, by
   means of additional third members other than air and membrane that raise
   the complexity of the structure. Other precedents {[}3] manage to embody
   constraints in pneumatic activation, laying emphasis on the activation
   itself rather than the final shape. Pneulastics introduce the
   integration of active material strategies in order to encode the
   differentiated activation into one single skin. With a series of
   physical experimentations that confirm the initial hypothesis, that
   pneulastics can provide a wide range of doubly curved shapes, we
   empirically decipher and describe material behaviour into digital
   simulation. Starting with a target shape input, our design method
   translates curvature and topology into flat membrane configuration that
   may lead upon inflation to the best approximation of the initial shape.}},

Abstract = {{The thermal properties of the new negative Poisson's ratio honeycomb
   structure is investigated. The Poisson's ratio is calculated subject to
   pure bending. On this basis, the influence of auxetic effect caused by
   negative Poisson's ratio on thermal conductivity is further
   investigated. The thermal anisotropic characteristics are also reported
   in accordance with the anisotropic physical mechanism. Applying this
   structure to the satellite antenna reflection surface, the thermal
   deformation value of the antenna reflection surface under a uniform
   temperature field can be calculated by finite element analysis. Using
   particle swarm optimization, the optimization target is the accuracy of
   the antenna reflection surface profile and the total mass of the
   antenna. The optimization parameter is the design parameters of the
   negative Poisson's ratio honeycomb structure. The results show that the
   satellite's overall profile accuracy is reduced by 22.6\%. Effectively
   improving the accuracy of the reflective surface of the antenna.}},

Abstract = {{Most two-dimensional negative Poisson's ratio structures are highly
   porous, resulting in insufficient structural bearing capacity and only
   for small strain conditions. In this paper, the simulation method is
   used to prove that the low porosity and negative Poisson's ratio
   structure with concave hexagon has ``incremental{''} behavior, and then
   the correctness of the simulation model is verified by experiments based
   on digital image technology (DIC). In addition, the effect of unit cell
   parameters on the negative Poisson's ratio at the same porosity is
   studied. The results show that at the same porosity, the length of the
   unit cell has the greatest influence on the Poisson's ratio, and the
   longer the unit cell, the smaller the Poisson's ratio; at different
   porosity, the larger the porosity, the lager the Poisson's ratio.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, Electron Beam Melting (EBM) is used to produce chiral
   auxetic lattices, and the compression of chiral auxetic lattice is
   investigated experimentally and numerically in the edgewise direction,
   where auxeticity can be experienced. Titanium Alloy (Ti6Al4V) metallic
   powder is used in this study. To understand mechanical behaviour and to
   characterize EBM printed parts, tensile tests are conducted. According
   to the tensile test results, a constitutive equation is selected,
   calibrated and adopted to represent the behaviour of the material.
   Furthermore, a chiral unit cell is manufactured and tested with a
   compressive load profile to investigate its displacement limit by
   applying large displacements without experiencing permanent
   deformations, degradation or failures. The same scenarios explored in
   the experiments are then analyzed by means of non-linear computational
   models using a commercial finite element code to validate a numerical
   approach for optimal design and performance prediction.}},

Abstract = {{A new kind of chiral stent was designed by three-dimensional lozenge
   grid structure structure with four ligaments. Based on the conventional
   beam theory and energy conservation principle, in-plane Poisson's ratio
   and equivalent Young's modulus are derived, and finite element analysis
   was employed to validate the analytical estimates of the elastic module.
   Then the FEM models are used to investigate the elastic deformation
   behaviours of lozenge grid structure. The calculated results of
   equivalent elastic modulus based on beam theory are in consistent with
   those obtained by finite element method. The theoretical and numerical
   results show that lozenge grid structure stent proposed in this paper is
   negative Poisson's ratio material. The presented theory could be used in
   designing new hierarchical honeycomb structures for multifunctional
   applications.}},

   mechanical response of low porosity thin metal samples under fatigue
   loads. The specimens, characterized by an overall porosity of 10\%, were
   designed using selected patterns of voids and then fatigue tested to
   estimate the influence of both auxetic and non-auxetic tessellations on
   the mechanical performance. During the loading, detailed deformation
   maps were recorded by means of bi-dimensional Digital Image Correlation
   (DIC). The experimental data collected during this study indicate that
   the use of auxetic patterns could be a strategy to enhance the fatigue
   life of porous structures. In addition, DIC analysis is shown to be an
   excellent non-contact experimental method to assess the cumulative
   damage of the samples and to predict the crack starting points well

Abstract = {{The effectiveness and efficiency of any road safety policy measure

   reports on the distribution of unreported accidents among Malaysian
   drivers. Based on survey conducted to 2000 Malaysian drivers, we measure
   the under-reporting information through three variables which are count,
   proportions and ratio of the unreported accidents. Our aim is to find
   the best distribution that describes the features of unreported
   accidents for three variables studied. Results shown that for the count
   data, the best fitted distribution is Negative Binomial whereas for the
   proportion, Beta distribution is found to be the best. Lastly, for the
   ratio data, the best fitted distribution is found to be Lognormal.}},

Abstract = {{Volume change has become a critical actuation method in robotics.
   However, the need for fluid flow or thermal processes to generate volume
   changes limits the durability, speed, and efficiency of these actuators.
   In this paper, we develop a new electromechanical actuator that
   volumetrically expands. By combining auxetic materials with a servo, we
   produce a simple isotropically expanding actuator that can be modularly
   composed. We discuss the symmetry considerations in selecting an
   appropriate auxetic framework for our actuator, eventually choosing a
   double-layered polyhedral auxetic design. Characterization shows that a
   single actuator can expand in radius to 119\% of the original size and
   generate 90N of force, while maintaining a small package and a speedy
   expansion / contraction cycle. Finally, we demonstrate the modularity of
   our actuators by linking three actuators to create a vertical
   tubecrawling robot. The small package and fast cycle time of our system
   highlight how viable these electromechanical volumetric actuators can be
   as an important actuator modality.}},

Abstract = {{In this letter, a fully analytical compact drain current model of
   back-gated two-dimensional (2D) negative capacitance (NC) FET including
   interface trap charges has been developed by solving Poisson's,
   drift-diffusion and 1-D Landau-Khalatnikov equations, and it is
   validated against the experimental data. In addition, the impact of
   interface trap charges on the electrical characteristics of the
   back-gated 2D NC-FET is investigated systematically based on the model.
   It is found that the subthreshold swing (SS) and on-off current ratio
   (I-on/I-off) are seriously degraded because of the presence of interface
   traps at 2D channel/oxide interface and 2D NC-FET with a big t(f) is
   more immune to the degradation induced by the interface traps. In
   addition, the underlying physics are elucidated by the capacitance
   matching of 2D NC-FET.}},

Abstract = {{Presented paper deals with experimental study on compressive properties
   of auxetics with controlled stiffness of strut joints. The variable
   strut joints properties were simulated by adding extra amount of
   material in the struts' intersection regions. Four groups of inverted
   honeycomb structures were prepared by multi-jet 3D printing and tested
   in quasi-static compression. The structure collapsed gradually, however
   after the first collapse, failure in entire cross-section occurred due
   to the brittle nature of the base material. The behavior up to the first
   collapse was consistent among the specimens within each group, while
   differed slightly subsequently. With higher reinforcement in the joints,
   results showed increasing stress at the first collapse (ultimate
   compressive stress) while the strain at the first collapse remained
   unchanged. The auxetic behaviour became less significant with increasing
   joints' reinforcement.}},

Abstract = {{We study a paradigm of active learning we call cost effective active
   search, where the goal is to find a given number of positive points from
   a large unlabeled pool with minimum labeling cost. Most existing methods
   solve this problem heuristically, and few theoretical results have been
   established. Here we adopt a principled Bayesian approach for the first
   time. We first derive the Bayesian optimal policy and establish a strong
   hardness result: the optimal policy is hard to approximate, with the
   best-possible approximation ratio bounded below by Omega(n(0.16)). We
   then propose an efficient and nonmyopic policy, simulating future search
   progress using the negative Poisson binomial distribution. We propose
   simple and fast approximations for its expectation, which serves as an
   essential role in our proposed policy. We conduct comprehensive
   experiments on drug and materials discovery datasets and demonstrate
   that our proposed method is superior to a popular (greedy) baseline.}},

Abstract = {{Most thermal interactions between indoor and outdoor environments take
   place through building envelopes and particularly through windows due to
   glazing's inherently higher Uvalues. Therefore, an effective shading
   structure for windows, which simultaneously can provide sufficient
   illuminance levels, minimize excessive sun exposure, and ensure
   acceptable visual comfort by controlling the glare is highly desirable.
   Unlike static daylight control systems, dynamic daylight admission
   systems adjust the amount of intake sunlight with assistance from
   building occupants or mechanical devices. Studies to date have not
   thoroughly and comprehensively developed an alternative system in which
   a self-morphing structure that is responsive to changing outdoor
   environmental conditions in real-time can function as an ``adaptive
   daylight admission system.{''}
   This paper has studied the effects of the adaptable auxetic shading
   structure with varying geometries to optimize illuminance levels, sun
   exposure, and reduce probability of glare. This study has developed a
   model to evaluate the illuminance and glare performance of the proposed
   shading system, and tested in the City of Gainesville, Florida, which is
   also applicable to other locations. The results suggest that the auxetic
   shading structure can effectively block sunlight from entering the space
   by adjusting its geometry in response to varying outdoor and sky
   conditions. In addition, a strong correlation can be found among
   daylight availability, sun exposure, and glare probability. Future
   studies may explore the effect of auxetic shading structures on energy
   consumption and thermal comfort parameters. In addition, the relation
   between auxetic shading devices and the health and wellbeing of building
   occupants may also be another factor to evaluate the effectiveness of
   this new generation of shading devices. Although this study focuses on
   the building-scale level of this shading system, future studies can
   investigate the urban-scale implementation of the proposed shading
   strategy.}},

Abstract = {{The ship's pedestal is the connection structure between the ship's
   equipment and the hull, and is also the basis for the installation of
   the equipment. The pedestal bears both the static load generated by the
   weight of the equipment and the dynamic load generated during the
   operation of the equipment, and at the same time transmits the external
   load received by the hull to the equipment, and the load it bears is
   very complicated. If there is a problem with the pedestal in an impact
   environment, the accuracy of the system equipment will be affected, the
   system equipment will not work properly. Negative Poisson's ration
   structures have a unique set of properties because of their tensile
   expansion, such as increased shear modulus, enhanced fracture toughness,
   better energy absorption and co-curvature. In recent years, the negative
   Poisson's ration honeycomb structure has been applied to the pedestal of
   marine equipment, which demonstrates good vibration damping effect.
   However, the pedestal has two functions: vibration damping and impact
   resistance, there is not much research on the impact resistance of the
   pedestal. In this paper, an ``arrow-shaped{''} honeycomb pedestal is
   taken as the research object. Firstly, the analytical expression of the
   Poisson's ration of the honeycomb pedestal is derived theoretically and
   the influence of each parameter on the Poisson's ration is analyzed.
   Secondly, the effect of Poisson's ration on the impact resistance of the
   pedestal was analyzed by ensuring that the pedestal height was constant.
   It was found that with the reduction of Poisson's ration, the impact
   resistance of the pedestal and the output impact environment of the
   pedestal panel were effectively optimized. Finally, by ensuring that the
   height of the pedestal is constant and the Poisson's ration is the same,
   the influence of the number of honeycomb layers on the impact resistance
   of the pedestal is analyzed.}},

Abstract = {{The Boltzmann-Volterra linear constitutive equation for isotropic
   non-aging viscoelastic materials is studied analytically in order to
   elucidate its abilities to provide a qualitative simulation of
   rheological effects related to different behavior types of lateral
   strain and the Poisson's ratio (i.e. lateral contraction ratio) observed
   in uni-axial tests under tension or compression at constant stress rate.
   The viscoelasticity equation is controlled by two material functions of
   a positive real argument (that is shear and bulk creep compliances);
   they are implied to be positive, differentiable, increasing and convex
   up functions. General properties of the volumetric, longitudinal and
   lateral strain-time curves, stress-strain curves and the Poisson's ratio
   evolution in time generated by the viscoelasticity relation (with an
   arbitrary shear and bulk creep functions) are examined, their dependence
   on stress rate and on qualitative characteristics of two creep functions
   are analyzed, conditions for their monotonicity and convexity or for
   existence of extrema, inflection points and sign changes are studied.
   Taking into account compressibility and volumetric creep (governed by a
   time-dependent bulk creep function) is proved to affect strongly the
   qualitative behavior of lateral strain and the Poisson's ratio. In
   particular, it is proved that the linear theory can reproduce
   increasing, decreasing or non-monotone and convex up or down
   dependencies of lateral strain and Poisson's ratio on time under tension
   or compression at constant stress rate, it can provide existence of
   minimum, maximum or inflection points and sign changes from minus to
   plus and vice versa. It is shown, that the Poisson's ratio at any moment
   of time is confined in the interval from -1 to 0.5 and the restriction
   on creep compliancies providing negative values of the Poisson's ratio
   is derived. Criteria for the Poisson's ratio increase or decrease and
   for extrema existence are obtained. The analysis revealed the set of
   characteristic features of the theoretic volumetric, axial and lateral
   strain-time curves, stress-strain curves families and the Poisson's
   ratio dependence on time which are convenient to check in tensile tests
   at constant stress rates and should be employed as indicators of the
   linear viscoelasticity theory applicability (or non-applicability) for
   simulation of a material behavior before identification.
   The specific properties of the two models are considered based on the
   assumption that the Poisson's ratio is time-independent or the
   assumption that bulk creep function is constant which neglects bulk
   creep and simulates purely elastic volumetric strain dependence on a
   mean stress. This assumptions reduce the number of material function to
   the single one and one scalar parameter and are commonly (and very
   often) used for simplification of viscoelasticity problems solutions. A
   number of restrictions and additional applicability indicators are found
   for this models. In particular, it is proved that elastic volumetric
   deformation assumption does not cut the overall range of the Poisson's
   ratio values and does not demolish the Boltzmann-Volterra relation
   ability to describe non-monotonicity and sign changes of lateral strain
   and to produce negative values of the Poisson's ratio, but neglecting
   bulk creep restricts this ability significantly and reduces drastically
   the variety of possible behavior modes of lateral strain-time curves and
   the Poisson's ratio evolution and so contracts applicability field of
   the model. The model with constant bulk compliance generates only
   convex-up lateral strain-time curves which can not have minima or
   inflection points and can change sign from minus to plus only and the
   Poisson's ratio is increasing convex-up function of time (without any
   extrema or inflection points which are possible in general case) and can
   not change sign from positive to negative.}},

Abstract = {{Modeling sparse and discrete omics data such as microbiome and
   transcriptomics is challenging due to the exceeding number of zeros.
   Many probabilistic models have been used, including Poisson, negative
   binomial, zero-inflated Poisson, and zero-inflated negative binomial
   models. In this paper, we propose a statistical procedure for
   identifying the most appropriate discrete probabilistic models for
   zero-inflated or Hurdle models based on the p-value of the discrete
   Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test. We develop a general procedure for
   estimating the parameters for a large class of zero-inflated models and
   Hurdle models. We also develop a general likelihood ratio test based on
   Neyman-Pearson lemma for choosing the best model when appropriate ones
   are more than one.}},

   properties of the skins were investigated in order to develop the
   evolution of mechanical properties as well as clamping coefficient for
   each material. Then, the same characterization was tested on the
   sandwich structures with different core densities. The results obtained
   showed that both coin densities and flax fibre as reinforcement plays a

   laser power of 200W and a scanning speed of 800 mm/s, a series of clips
   was made using the direct metal laser-sintering (DMLS) of powder. The
   tests revealed a mechanical response of the metal plate, which is
   characteristic for materials with an auxetic property. The
   ``load-displacement{''} diagrams were drawn. The nature of the response
   is established. It was determined that the change in direction of the

Abstract = {{A modelling method of auxetic yam (Helical Auxetic Yarn type)
   cooperating with the composite matrix was presented. The two component
   yarn surrounded by a flexible material is a fragment of composite, that
   consists of an auxetic fabric as a reinforcement and a flexible matrix.
   Such composite can be used in energy absorbing structures. The HAY as an
   auxetic material is characterized by a negative Poisson's ratio. The
   stiff fiber spirally wrapped around the elastic core with a larger
   diameter gives this structure anomalous behaviour during tensile.
   Stretching of such yarn increases its dimensions in transverse
   directions. Helical Auxetic Yams are sewn into fabric which is durable,
   flexible and light. The conducted analysis of the fragment of the
   composite reflecting one yarn allows for pre-adjustment of values of
   matrix material parameters. The purpose of the modelling is to determine
   the values of a composite matrix parameters that should allow the
   effective work of auxetic yam. If the matrix were too stiff, it would
   block the capability of bending the core fiber during stretching and the
   auxetic phenomenon would be cancelled. The key problem is performing
   these analyses with appropriate value of the Young's modulus of the
   composite matrix material to get the optimal composite structure. Finite
   Element Method analyses were conducted in LS-Dyna solver. Discrete model
   was build using hexagonal, solids elements. It was assumed that the
   matrix completely filled the spaces between the fibers, and at the
   outside it had the shape of the cylinder. The choice of such matrix
   shape allowed to carry out proper interpretation of the displacement
   values of nodes located at the boundary plane of the matrix model. The
   displacement of these nodes determines the proper work of the auxetic
   yarn. Relevant constitutive material models were used to reflect the
   work of the aramid wrap as well as the elastomeric core and matrix.
   Nodal displacement was applied to the one of the end of model to
   simulate tension under static conditions. FEM analyses were based on the
   implicit method, which is well suited for simulation of static
   processes, where final state is the most interesting. Based on the
   results of the conducted analyses, it was possible to choose the
   appropriate matrix material of the composite without preparation of many
   composite samples with various elastomer matrix and carrying out many
   experimental tests. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The auxetic composites are materials characterized by a negative
   Poisson's ratio value. Such composites can be made of conventional
   materials with a positive value of Poisson's ratio, but the specific

   composition with a negative Poisson's ratio. It is also possible to
   create such structures from already existing auxetic subassemblies. In
   comparison to conventional composites, the auxetic reinforced ones have
   a lot of positive features, i.e.: higher shear resistance, better crack
   resistance and better damping properties. The aim of this article was to
   present the review of elastomeric materials for the possible application

   nonlinear mathematics, computational power and manufacturing techniques,
   the exploitation of the geometrically nonlinear range is becoming
   increasingly feasible for a wider range of applications. Currently, a
   pilot study is presented concerning the design of sandwich structures
   and in particular the lattice core metamaterial. The internal structure
   of the lattice core is deliberately disrupted by auxetic inclusions to
   engineer potentially exploitable features for energy absorption or
   structural isolation applications. A pilot numerical study shows the
   effect that the inclusions have on the nonlinear mechanical response
   such that the post-buckling behaviour may be adjusted by design to

Abstract = {{The processes of elastoplastic deformation in single-crystal alloys
   characterized by cubic symmetry of properties are investigated. Using
   the heat-resistant single-crystal alloy VZhM8 used to create gas turbine
   engine blades by directional crystallization as an example, the
   dependences of deformation processes on the orientation of loading
   directions with respect to crystallographic axes are shown. Significant
   anisotropy of mechanical properties, including the presence of negative
   Poisson's ratios, in heat-resistant nickel alloys is maintained up to a
   temperature of 1150 degrees C. Therefore, over the entire range of
   operating temperatures, the propagation velocities of elastic and
   plastic waves in single-crystal heat-resistant nickel alloys depend on
   the propagation direction. On the example of a VZhM8 single-crystal
   alloy under dynamic loading in a three-dimensional formulation, the
   differences in the processes of deformation realized in a single crystal
   under loading along the {[}011], {[}111] and {[}001] axes are

   conditions by NSCW (Near-Surface Cross Well testing) method. Field
   seismic records are processed. Kinematic and dynamic parameters of
   pressure and differently polarized shear waves are determined.
   Thin-layered one-dimensional models of physical properties of the medium
   are created and interpreted on the basis of nonlinear theory of
   elastodynamics.
   Results. It is determined that the medium with high porous, water
   saturated rocks and anomalous high reservoir pressure has anomalous low
   value of velocities and gradient of their increase with depth. When this
   medium was re-examined after deep piles were built there, the
   overestimated seismic velocities are obtained, which is explained by a
   decrease in the section of anomalously high reservoir pressure and,
   accordingly, the porosity of the rocks after piles were built. When the
   hollowness is increased in unsaturated pebble rocks, the negative value
   of Poisson's ratio is obtained on the standard method. Seismic
   anisotropy related with the direction of the grains packing of the rocks
   is revealed on velocities of shear waves. The change of property of
   rocks on depth is manifested clearer on frequencies of waves than on
   their amplitudes.
   Scientific novelty. The elasticity moduli of the 3rd order are
   determined which are more sensible to variability of nonlinear elastic
   properties of rocks of the medium than the moduli of the 2nd order. The
   values of Poisson's ratio are recalculated for one and the same rocks
   located in different conditions of rock pressure on the basis of
   nonclassical theory of deformation.
   Practical importance. The obtained results can be applied to study the
   media characterized by complex seismogeological hydrodynamic conditions
   with clay-sandy rocks of high porosity and water saturation.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to compare count regression models to identify
   the best model and evaluate the effect of year, season, parity and
   litter size of sows at farrowing on the number of mummified fetuses per
   litter. Data from a commercial production unit in Yucatan, Mexico were
   used. Management and feeding of the animals were typical of the region.
   Poisson, negative binomial, zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP), zero-inflated
   negative binomial (MB) and normal distribution regression models were
   evaluated and their goodness-of-fit was compared. Among the 1689 litters
   60.27\% had zero mummies. The mean number of mummies was 0.649 +/- 1.028
   for litter for data including zeros and 1.634 +/- 1.025 for data with at
   least one mummified fetus. The ratio of the Pearson Chi-square
   value/degrees of freedom was significantly different front 1 for
   Poisson, negative binomial and ZIP models, indicating overdispersion
   (variance> mean) of the trait studied. However, the ZINB model indicated
   no overdispersion (P=0.0684). The ZINB model was considered the best
   model based on log likelihood, AIC and BIC. The significance of factors
   varied according to the model used. Furthermore, Poisson models had
   minor standard errors and in consequence tended to reject the null
   hypothesis more easily than negative binomial models. Under the ZAN B
   model, year and parity number had significant effects on the number of
   mummified fetuses per litter (P<0.05). In conclusion, parity number was
   an important risk factor associated to the number of mummified piglets.
   The best model that describes the number of mummified piglets was the
   zero inflated negative binomial regression procedure.}},

Abstract = {{A temperature-dependent intrinsic property of monolayer graphene, the
   negative Poisson's ratio (NPR), is investigated in the present study.
   The classical molecular dynamics (MD) method is employed and the
   Erhart-Albe hybrid potential, i.e. the combination of the reactive
   empirical bond order (REBO) and the Tersoff potentials, is used for the
   graphene sheet in the numerical simulation. In the simulation process,
   the graphene sheet is assumed to be free standing with in-plane
   periodical boundary condition and under an ambient temperature up to
   1000 K. Our study shows that the graphene NPR is decreased with the
   increase of temperature. Besides, we also perform the simulation of the
   graphene negative temperature expansion coefficient (NTEC) as an
   indirect validation of the present MD model. The characteristics of the
   nonlinear variations for both the NPR and the NTEC of a pristine
   graphene sheet are investigated. Our MD results at low temperature (0.1
   K) further prove the intrinsic and anisotropic property of NPR for
   graphene.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, an isogeometric density field method is proposed for the
   design of micro-architected materials with the specific mechanical
   properties, consisting of the maximum bulk and shear modulus and the
   Negative Poisson's ratio (NPR). Firstly, the non-uniform rational
   B-splines (NURBS) basis functions are employed to construct the density
   field function (DFF), where the Shepard function is used to improve the
   smoothness of the nodal densities assigned to control points. The NURBS
   basis functions and the Shepard function can ensure the sufficient
   continuity and smoothness of the DFF, owing to their significant
   properties. The optimization formulation for micro-architected materials
   is developed using the DFF, where the isogeometric analysis (IGA) is
   applied to evaluate the unknown structural responses. Effective
   macroscopic properties of materials are predicted by the asymptotic
   homogenization method. The same NURBS basis functions used in the IGA
   and the DFF can keep the consistency of the geometric model and analysis
   model, which provides the unique benefits. Numerical examples are used
   to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed topology optimization
   approach for micro-architected materials.}},

   offer higher quality fracture resistance {[}1] and high energy
   absorption {[}2]. film cooling effectiveness results for test geometries
   were non-dimensionalized by a baseline case of circular inline orifices.
   Ton-intrusive pressure sensitive paint (PSP) technique was utilized to
   obtain local surface pressure gradients for each experimental geometry.
   Adiabatic film cooling effectiveness measurements were tested for
   multiple blowing ratios (BR) ranging between 0.05-1.15. Three plate
   configurations were studied with inclination angles of 0 degrees.
   Analyses demonstrate that lowing ratios of 0.5 and 0.75 are optimal for
   S-slot adiabatic effectiveness. Film cooling results for the Ellipse
   configuration how increasing effectiveness up to an optimal blowing
   ratio of 0.5, and decreases as BR is increased beyond that. Additional
   experiments were performed by keeping the differential pressure cross
   the plates constant. Results indicate that the S-slot pro ides optimum
   film cooling effectiveness while the differential pressure conserved in

Abstract = {{In axial compressor design for aero engines high system efficiency and
   operational stability are two main objectives. Both depend on
   clearance-induced losses. Previous investigations at the Institute have
   resulted in a passive clearance controlled compressor design using
   additively manufactured auxetic casing structures. The extension to an
   active clearance controlled device to keep an approximately constant tip
   gap ratio during the entire flight mission is currently investigated.
   Constructive on these deliverables, the implementation of tip blowing
   casing treatment modification in a double-walled compressor casing
   including an auxetic inner structure is covered in this work and
   studiedfor maximum load conditions by means ofFinite Element Analysis.
   The idea to supplement the current auxetic casing construction with
   casing treatment modification emerges from the aspiration to generate
   further stability improvements in the high-pressure domain and the
   exploitation ofthe design freedom provided by additive manufacturing.
   Key issues addressed in this work by conducting parameter studies are
   casing treatment positioning and corresponding structural correlations
   depending on circumferential quantity. The evaluation section
   concentrates mainly on the calculated stress level associated with tip
   blowing casing treatments because this value is crucial for prospective
   fatigue predictions. In order to compare the results, the auxetic casing
   structure without casing treatment modification serves as reference.
   Promising solutions for local stress reductions are also proposed and
   discussed.
   From a structural mechanics perspective, the casing treatment
   modification generates very high and comparable notch stress levels at
   each position. Placing the casing treatments at the framework ofthe
   auxetic cells and splitting the inner casing ring results in tolerable
   stress levels.}},

   and manipulation tasks, especially when paired with tactile and

   towards achieving proprioceptive soft robotic grippers, current efforts

   paper, we present a simple scalable soft robotic gripper integrated with
   high-deformation strain and pressure sensors. The gripper is composed of
   structurally-compliant handed shearing auxetic structures actuated by
   electric motors. Coupling deformable sensors with the compliant grippers
   enables gripper proprioception and object classification. With this
   sensorized system, we are able to identify objects' size to within 33\%
   of actual radius and sort objects as hard / soft with 78\% accuracy.}},

   called equidispersion. However, the variance can also be greater than
   the average value, called overdispersion. This can be caused by excess
   opportunities for the emergence of zero values in the response variable
   or zero excess. The parameter of the overdispersed data analysis can be
   underestimated so that the results become biased. This bias issue can
   be, hopefully, overcome by the Zero Inflated Negative Binomial (ZINB)
   regression analysis. In the 2016 Maternal Mortality Rate data in
   Bojonegoro District, overdipersion was overcome by ZINB regression even
   though there was no significant predictor variable found affecting the
   response variable. ZINB regression analysis can also be applied to
   generated data (simulation). We had the data with average lambda = (0.2,
   0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 5.0) proportion of zeros p = (0.4, 0.6, 0.8), and
   the number of observations n = (200,500, 800), with each setting was
   repeated 100 times. From the simulation study it was found that all
   overdispersion events were always accompanied by zero excess events but
   not vice versa. The greater the value of lambda then the greater the
   dispersion coefficient. The ZINB regression is proven to be able to
   overcome overdispersion in various conditions of different values of
   lambda, p, n which can be seen from the value tau (dispersion
   coefficient) after ZINB regression is less than 1 in all conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Background Type D personality, described as a consistent tendency to
   experience increased levels of social inhibition and negative
   affectivity, has a robust association with negative outcomes following
   myocardial infarction (MI). However, little is known about its
   determinants in our setting. Our aim was to assess the prevalence and
   correlates of Type D personality among survivors following acute MI
   (AMI). Methods Two hundred participants with AMI were recruited over an
   18-month period. Type D scale-14 was used to evaluate the presence of
   Type D personality. Apart from sociodemographic factors, depression,
   anxiety, stress, coping, personality, quality of life, and perceived
   social support were assessed using standard measures. Results Type D
   personality was present in 24\% of samples (n = 48). In multivariate
   Poisson regression analysis, younger age (prevalence ratio {[}PR]:
   0.950, 95\% confidence intervals {[}CIs]: 0.927-0.974), high depression
   (PR: 1.372, 95\% CI: 1.216-1.548), and low family support (PR: 0.898,
   95\% CI: 0.849-0.949) emerged as independent predictors of Type D
   personality in participants with AMI. Conclusion Type D personality is
   seen in a significant proportion of AMI, consistent with global
   literature. Our findings suggest that among Indian patients with AMI,
   the presence or absence of Type D personality may represent two distinct
   subpopulations.}},

Abstract = {{In this work we examine the impact behavior of single and doubly curved
   structures with auxetic cores by using numerical methods. We have
   evaluated twelve different doubly and one single curved panels impacted
   by a spherical projectile at a velocity of 100 m/s. The results are
   firstly discussed by considering the effects of the curvature on the
   backplane displacement and the energy absorption of the panels. A
   selected toroidal configuration is then modeled as sandwich structure
   with an auxetic (re-entrant) core and a spherical projectile is shot on
   different locations from center to edge. The sandwich structure is made
   by carbon fiber/epoxy laminates, while the re-entrant core is
   represented with ABSplus plastic. It is found that the damaged area of
   the auxetic core differs from a traditional honeycomb under impact
   loading, and this is mainly due to its negative Poisson's ratio.}},

Abstract = {{Impact phenomenon is significant for our lives. It can be encountered in
   many fields. The critical areas are debris impact in space, bird
   striking on aircraft, ballistic and traffic accidents. For preventing
   the effect of impacts, some engineering structures are improved and used
   recently. These structures are used to absorb impact energy by avoiding
   the transfer of the high magnitude of the load which risks human life
   and essential part of vehicles that stems from the impact. For road
   vehicles, crush tubes are used for this purpose. However, they are not
   efficient, so that tube filling materials are used. Integration of
   filling materials to tubular systems shows a positive effect on the
   performance. However, in the case of impact, the impact load crushes the
   filling material, and filling materials expand laterally. This expansion
   pushes the boundary of tubular systems and causes bending moment in
   addition to the uniaxial compressive load at the tubular systems.
   Auxetic materials which expand laterally under tensile loads and shrink
   under compressive loads can prevent this incident. Auxetic materials
   exist in two forms. One of them is a foam form, and the other of them
   are lattices form. In this study, auxetic lattices are crushed with
   quasi-dynamic loads to determine their crush efficiencies. Re-entrant,
   anti-tetrachiral, chiral circular, chiral hexagonal auxetic structures
   are crushed with 10 mm/min velocity. Specific energy absorption (SEA)
   values are calculated for each other and compared.}},

Abstract = {{Compliant structures allow robots to overcome environmental challenges
   by deforming and conforming their bodies. In this paper, we investigate
   auxetic structures as a means of achieving this compliance for soft

   cylindrical auxetic structures to create tiled auxetic cylinders (TACs).
   We characterise the relative stiffness of the structures and show that
   variation in behaviour can be achieved by modifying the geometry within
   the same tiling family. In addition, we analysed the equivalent
   Poisson's ratio and found the range between the investigated designs to
   span from -0.33 to -2. Furthermore, we demonstrate a conceptual
   application in the design of a soft robot using the auxetic cylinders.
   We show that these structures can reactively change in shape, thereby
   reducing the complexity of control, with potential applications in
   confined spaces such as the human body, or for exploration through
   unpredictable terrain.}},

Abstract = {{Single-stream recycling is currently an extremely labor intensive
   process due to the need for manual object sorting. Soft robotics offers
   a natural solution as compliant robots require less computation to plan
   paths and grasp objects in a cluttered environment. However, most soft
   robots are not robust enough to handle the many sharp objects present in
   a recycling facility. In this work, we present a soft sensorized robotic
   gripper which is fully electrically driven and can detect the difference
   between paper, metal and plastic. By combining handed shearing auxetics
   with high deformation capacitive pressure and strain sensors, we present
   a new puncture resistant soft robotic gripper. Our materials classifier
   has 85\% accuracy with a stationary gripper and 63\% accuracy in a
   simulated recycling pipeline. This classifier works over a variety of
   objects, including those that would fool a purely vision-based system.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamics of periodic structures has fascinated researchers for decades.
   Metamaterials are one of the exemplars of these periodic structures.
   Spatial periodicity of mechanical unit cells in artificially engineered
   metamaterials exhibits idiosyncratic physical properties like negative
   mass, negative Young's modulus, and negative Poisson's ratio. These
   extreme physical properties are beyond the properties found in the
   natural materials. This exceptional dynamic behaviour is frequency
   dependent, which in turn forms the attenuation and transmission band
   during wave transmission through these metamaterials. The frequency
   ranges in which a wave can transmit or attenuate along the length of the
   metamaterial are known as transmission and attenuation bands
   respectively. In this work, the band structure of piezo-embedded
   negative mass metamaterial is analysed using generalized Bloch theorem.
   The addition of the piezoelectric material at the resonating unit
   increases the damping and complexity of the solution. Bloch theorem is
   used to solve several periodic media and using this theory, the
   relationship between frequency and wavenumber can be established.
   Implementation of Bloch theorem has not been reported yet in the context
   of the piezo embedded mass-in-mass metamaterial. Therefore, wave
   propagation through finite units is studied through band structure. In
   addition, voltage and power produced by piezoelectric material are
   estimated. This research can be considered as the first step towards
   modelling an active metamaterial.}},

Abstract = {{The auxetic meta-material is a special class of macro-structure designed
   for exhibiting negative Poisson's ratio. The spatial repetition of the
   lattice affects the wave propagation and dynamic responses. In this
   study, a mathematical basis of Bloch analysis for auxetic media have
   been presented and shaded some important light on the application of the
   technique. For this design an analysis has been carried out to show how
   the periodic boundary condition changes with the connectivity,
   orientation and geometry of unit lattice. The corresponding eigen value
   problem is developed to obtain the propagation frequency which is the
   function of mass, stiffness matrix and the wave vector. Mapping of
   different forms which are associated with the nodal displacements of a
   unit cell to adjacent cell have been demonstrated and formulated
   mathematically and observed its effect on the reduced stiffness and mass
   matrices is studied. Modal analysis has been carried out using Abaqus
   6.14 and the transverse nodal displacements obtained from the F.E
   analysis. The Bloch formulation for revolving-square type auxetic
   structure has been formulated and validated. Further, we have obtained
   the changes in auxetic behavior of the structure under different
   boundary conditions. The periodicity of a given lattice assists in
   determining the frequency bands within which the propagation of elastic
   waves is permitted. Further study is proposed for attenuation and
   transmission band analysis to steer the waves which roots the idea of
   vibration sink, in which we can damp the mechanical waves effectively at
   a specific location. The Auxetic meta-materials is envisaged to have a
   significant role in wave attenuation and wave steering, and can be used
   effectively for vibration control.}},

Title = {{Motor impairments in transient ischemic attack increase the odds of a
   positive diffusion-weighted imaging: A meta-analysis}},

Abstract = {{Background: Unilateral motor impairment is a key symptom used in the
   diagnosis of transient ischemic attack (TIA). Diffusion-weighted imaging
   (DWI) is a promising diagnostic tool for detecting ischemic lesions.
   While both motor impairments and DWI abnormalities are linked to the
   diagnosis of TIA, the association between these prognostic factors is
   not well understood.
   Objective: To examine the association between unilateral motor
   impairments and the odds of a positive DWI in TIA. Further, to determine
   whether the time between symptom onset and neuroimaging (delay to scan)
   influences the odds of a positive DWI.
   Methods: We used PRISMA guidelines to conduct a systematic search from
   1989 to 2018. We included studies that reported number of individuals
   with/without unilateral motor symptoms and a positive/negative DWI.
   Results: Twenty-four studies from North America, Australia, Asia, and
   Europe were submitted to a meta-analysis. A pooled odds ratio of 1.80
   (95\% CI, 1.45-2.24, p = 0.00; I-2 = 57.38) suggested that the odds of a
   positive DWI are greater in TIA individuals who experience motor
   symptoms as compared with those who experience no motor symptoms.
   Further, increasing the time delay to scan from the symptom onset (>2
   days) did not influence the odds of a positive DWI as compared with an
   earlier scan (<= 2 days).
   Conclusions: The current meta-analysis provides cumulative evidence from
   6710 individuals with TIA that the presence of motor symptoms increases
   the odds of a positive DWI by two-folds. These findings transform the
   clinical perception into evidence-based knowledge that motor impairments
   elevate the risk for brain tissue damage. Unilateral motor impairments
   in a cerebrovascular event should increase a physician's suspicion of
   detecting brain infarctions. These findings may influence the clinical
   management of TIA by generating faster response to motor impairments in
   TIA and accelerating referral to specialized stroke clinic.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials have unique properties which still require further
   evaluation. One of the least researched topics in terms of auxetics is
   their fatigue strength. In this article, high-cycle fatigue life of
   auxetic re-entrant structure unit cell was calculated using Finite
   Element Analysis. A fully reversed cycle consisting of alternating
   compressive and tensile loads was applied. Also, stress-life data had to
   be defined as approximated Wohler's curve. Result in form of cycles to
   failure contour plot was compared with corresponding contour plot
   obtained for regular hexagonal honeycomb lattice unit cell. It was
   observed that re-entrant cell has significantly higher fatigue strength
   than non-auxetic honeycomb cell. The test was also carried out for the
   models of the structure made of array of unit cells. Their results
   confirmed the previous observations which bring the conclusion that
   auxetic materials exhibit superior fatigue life properties compared with
   regular microstructures.}},

Title = {{Overall Effects of Risk Factors Associated with Dental Caries Indices
   Using the Marginalized Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial Model}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is to identify risk factors for decayed,
   missing, and filled permanent teeth (DMFT) in a population of
   12-15-year-old schoolchildren and to apply the marginalized
   zero-inflated negative binomial (MZINB) model for determination and
   estimation of the overall effects of the risk factors. A cross-sectional
   survey comprising 764 students aged between 12 and 15 years was used to
   analyze the association between caries in children and some background
   characteristics in children and their parents. Information on the
   samples' social, behavioral, and demographic status was obtained through
   a series of closed questions. The incidence rate ratios (IRR) were used
   to associate some risk factors with caries. In the entire sample, the
   frequency of zero was 194 (25.4\%). The result of the shared-parameter
   marginalized zero-inflated negative binomial (SP-MZINB) model showed
   that being a girl (IRR = 1.18; p value = 0.021), higher dental visits
   frequency (IRR = 1.20; p value <0.001), lower tooth brushing frequency
   (IRR = 0.91; p value = 0.019), higher flossing frequency (IRR = 1.11; p
   value = 0.001), and lower mothers' education (IRR = 0.89; p value =
   0.042) are associated with DMFT. Our results may provide better insights
   of the factors associated with DMFT, and health programs should focus
   their efforts on healthcare services, for both preventive and curative
   purposes. This regression model provides an appropriate fit and
   meaningful interpretation to handling zero-inflated count outcomes.
   Also, it provides direct estimates of the effects of risk factors on the
   overall mean that does not require postmodeling computations.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of the present study was to analyze the association

   domains scores lower than the median and to compare the multiple
   logistic regression model with the multiple Poisson regression model. In
   the elderly population of four ICC in the city of Cuiaba-MT with a
   sample of 317 elderly. The main dependent variable was health
   perception, assessed through the WHOQOL-BREF with the following
   question: How satisfied are you with your health? The independent
   variables were the WHOQOL-BREF and WHOQOL-OLD domains scores lower than
   the median. Gross odds ratios and gross prevalence ratios. To verify the
   normal distribution of domain score data, the Shapiro test was used,
   identifying that these scores were not symmetric.
   Due to this, for the data analysis, a bivariate categorical analysis
   using crude odds ratio and crude prevalence ratio and a categorical
   multiple analysis using binary logistic regression and Poisson
   regression was considered. In this study, both models were adequate to
   the data, however the Poisson model was more accurate than the logistic
   model and with these models it was found that the domains that together
   presented risks in the perception of negative health were: the scores of
   the physical and past, present and future activities; both smaller than
   the median.}},

Abstract = {{The A. N. Stavrogin's experimental data are observed during triaxial
   compression of sandstone samples under proportional loading according to
   T. Karman's scheme. Sandstones have a sufficiently high porosity in the
   initial state, so their deformation within elasticity has the following
   peculiar properties. When the cylindrical sample is uniaxially
   compressed at small initial stresses (of the order of 0.05 divided by
   0.15 of the elastic limit), a nonlinear part is observed on the
   longitudinal strain diagram, which is associated with the material
   densification occurring on this section. This circumstance causes a
   certain difficulty in determining the modulus of elasticity. An
   elaboration of the method for determination the elastic constants
   (Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio) are proposed taking into account
   the initial deformation diagram's special feature, which was mentioned.
   Earlier A. N. Stavrogin proposed to consider on the longitudinal strain
   diagram a linear part from the indicated initial stress to the
   conditional elastic limit. The elastic modulus is determined by this
   part of the diagram. Linear extrapolation of this segment to zero stress
   level provides a virtually new point of origin for the longitudinal
   strain under consideration. In this paper, it is shown that under
   triaxial compression of a cylindrical specimen, the longitudinal strain
   (satisfying Hooke's law) can be measured from the same new point of
   origin, which is established under uniaxial compression. In this case,
   the lateral strain of the sample is considered in the such range of
   stress variation, at which the increment of the axial stress causes a
   negative increment in the lateral strain. Based on the initial
   experimental values of longitudinal and lateral strain, which were
   adjusted by this method, the conditional elastic limit was determined.}},

Abstract = {{The Boltzmann-Volterra linear constitutive equation for isotropic
   non-aging visco-elastic materials is studied analytically in order to
   examine its capabilities to provide an adequate qualitative description
   of rheological phenomena related to creep under uni-axial loading
   combined with constant hydrostatic pressure and of evolution types of
   the Poisson's ratio (lateral contraction ratio) in creep. The
   constitutive equation does not involve the third invariants of stress
   and strain tensors and implies that their hydrostatic and deviatoric
   parts do not depend on each other. It is governed by two material
   functions of a positive real argument (that is shear and bulk creep
   compliances); they are implied to be positive, differentiable,
   increasing and convex up functions. General properties and
   characteristic features of the creep curves for volumetric, longitudinal
   and lateral strain produced by the linear theory (with an arbitrary
   shear and bulk creep functions) under constant tensile load and constant
   hydrostatic pressure are investigated. Conditions for creep curves
   monotonicity and for existence of extrema and sign changes of strains
   are studied. The Poisson's ratio evolution in time and its dependences
   on pressure and tensile stress levels and on qualitative characteristics
   of two creep functions are analyzed.
   Taking into account compressibility, volumetric creep and pressure
   influence (governed by the bulk creep function) affects strongly the
   qualitative behavior of longitudinal creep curves and the Poisson's
   ratio evolution and its range. In particular, it is proved that the
   linear theory can simulate non-monotone behavior and sign changes of
   lateral strain and Poisson's ratio under constant tensile load (even if
   the pressure is zero) and the longitudinal strain may start to decrease
   provided the pressure level is high enough.
   The expressions for Poisson's ratio via the strain triaxiality ratio
   (which is equal to volumetric strain divided by deviatoric strain) and
   in terms of pressure ratio to axial stress and the creep functions ratio
   are derived. Assuming creep functions are arbitrary (permissible),
   general accurate two-sided bounds for the Poisson's ratio range are
   obtained and the influence of pressure level on the range is studied.
   Additional restrictions on material functions and loading parameters are
   derived to provide negative values of Poisson's ratio. Criteria for the
   Poisson's ratio increase or decrease and for its non-dependence on time
   are found.
   The analysis revealed the set of immanent features and quantitative
   characteristics of the theoretic creep curves families and the Poisson's
   ratio dependence on time and pressure to axial stress ratio which are
   convenient to check in creep tests (with various levels of pressure and
   tensile stress) and can be employed as indicators of the linear
   viscoelasticity theory applicability (or non-applicability) for
   simulation of a material behavior. The specific properties and
   restrictions of the model with constant bulk creep compliance which
   simulates a material exhibiting purely elastic volumetric deformation
   are considered.}},

Title = {{Intrinsic Ultrahigh Negative Poisson's Ratio in Two-Dimensional
   Ferroelectric ABP(2)X(6) Materials}},
Journal = {{ACTA PHYSICO-CHIMICA SINICA}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{35}},

Pages = {{1128-1133}},
Abstract = {{Recently, ferroelectric materials have attracted considerable research
   attention. In particular, two dimensional (2D) strain ferroelectric
   materials have been considered as most crucial for next- generation
   circuit designs because of their application as novel electric memory
   devices. However, a 2D ferroelectric material is very rare. The
   ferroelectric materials with the form ABP(2)X(6) (A = Ag, Cu; B = Bi,
   In; X = S, Se) are of interest because of their ferroelectric property
   maintained in their ultrathin structures. Within the ABP(2)X(6)
   monolayer, the P-P bonds form the pillars that hold the top and bottom X
   planes, while the off-center A-B atoms between the X layers induce a
   spontaneous ferroelectric polarization. If the two off-center A-B sites
   are equally aligned, this would lead to the appearance of the
   paraelectric state. Such intriguing structures must impart novel
   mechanical properties to the materials. Until now, there has been no
   report on the mechanical properties of monolayerABP(2)X(6). Based on
   first-principles calculations, we studied the structural, electronic,
   mechanical as well as the electromechanical coupling properties of
   monolayer ABP(2)X(6) (A = Ag, Cu; B = Bi, In; X = S, Se). We found that
   they are all semiconductors with wide bandgaps of 2.73, 2.17, 3.00, and
   2.31 eV for CulnP(2)Se(6), CuBiP2Se6, AgBiP2S6, and AgBiP2Se6,
   respectively, which are calculated based on the Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof
   (HSE) exchange correlation functional model. The conduction band minimum
   is mainly from p orbitals of X and B atoms, whereas the valence band
   maximum is due to the hybridization of the p orbital of X atoms and the
   d orbital of A atoms. Moreover, there are three short and three long NB
   -X bonds due to the A-B off center displacement. Together with the d-p
   orbital hybridization, the main reason for the distorted ferroelectric
   structure in ABP(2)X(6) monolayers is the Jahn-Teller effect. ABP(2)X(6)
   monolayers are predicted to be a new class of auxetic materials with an
   out-of-plane negative Poisson's ratio, i.e., the values of the negative
   Poisson's ratio are in the order AgBiP2S6 (-0.805) < AgBiP2Se6 (-0.778)
   < CuBiP2Se6 (-0.670) < CulnP(2)S(6) (-0.060). This is mainly due to the
   tensile strain applied in the x/y direction enlarging the angle(
   )between P-P bonds and top layer X atoms, thereby enhancing the bucking
   height of monolayer ABP(2)X(6). Moreover, external strain has a
   significant impact on the A-B off-center displacement, rendering an
   out-of-plane piezoelectric polarization. The values of e(13) for
   CulnP(2)S(6), CuBiP2Se6, AgBiP2S6, AgBiP2Se6 monolayers are calculated
   to be -3.95 x 10(-12), -5.68 x 10(-12), - 3.94 x 10(-12), -2.71 x
   10(-12) C.m(-1) , respectively, which are comparable to the only
   experimentally confirmed 2D out-of-plane piezoelectric Janus system
   (piezoelectric coefficient = -3.8 x 10(-12 )C.m(-1)).
   This unusual auxetic behavior, ferroelectric polarization, and the
   electromechanical coupling in monolayerABP(2)X(6) could potentially lead
   to enormous technologically important applications in nanoelectronics,
   nanomechanics, and piezoelectrics.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic structures attain certain abnormal mechanical attributes such as
   negative Poisson's ratios due to the macro level structural forms.
   Achieving the auxetic responses is often the central focus of the design
   of any auxetic structural form. However, the stress distribution across
   the structures and in particular, the stress concentration aspects are
   often paid little attention. A numerical simulation analysis is
   conducted in this paper to establish the stress distribution patterns as
   well as the stress concentration effects based on variations in the
   filleting around the critical points of the structure. A square grid
   auxetic structural form is selected and finite element simulation of the
   stress fields indicated specific roles of the slight geometrical
   modifications in terms of filleting leading to variations in both peak
   stresses and the locations of the stress concentration points. Optimum
   fillet dimensions could be established based on the results of the
   numerical experiments. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose is to develop deformation criterion or predecessors of
   geodynamic phenomena within rock mass relying upon the systemized
   experimental data concerning rock behaviour in a volumetric field of
   compressive stress.
   Methods. Experiments as for rock deformation and failure in a volumetric
   stress state were carried out with the help of a device of non-uniform
   volumetric compression. The device was designed by Donetsk Institute for
   Physics and Engineering (DonlPhE) of the NAS of Ukraine. Volumetric
   deformations and share deformations, elastic parameters, parameters of a
   type of deformation state and stress state of Lode Nadai, and Lode
   angles were determined separately for each load grade taking into
   consideration corresponding increase in deformations. Sudden arching and
   its characteristic features were observed in longwall 2 of inclined
   drift of l(1) seam in Kapitalna mine.
   Findings. It has been demonstrated that rock are classic auxetics in
   which elastic factors change their values and signs. It has been
   determined that the characteristic deformations, in terms of which
   elastic characteristics change their values, are quantized and constant
   for each material. Four characteristic stages, inherent to all rocks
   despite their stress state type and comprehensive pressure value, have
   been singled out during deformation. It has been defined that jump of
   amplitude of linear and shear deformations, resulting from double vortex
   and wave resonance in terms of velocity, dimensions of structures and
   frequency (stage 3), is a failure predecessor. Increase in minimum
   relative deformations (i.e. oscillations of a working face of a seam)
   and in maximum relative deformations (i.e. oscillations of roof or walls
   of a mine working) up to several percent have been proposed as the
   failure criterion.
   Originality. It has been determined for the first time that in the
   context of volumetric stress state, deformation increase is of
   alternative nature; elastic characteristics of rocks are not constants
   of a material varying in terms of a value and a sign during mechanical
   loading and shear deformations are of rotational nature.
   Practical implications. Resonance increase in the amplitude of maximum,
   minimum, and shear deformation growth is a criterion of total failure
   and dynamic failure in particular which can be used in practice as a
   predecessor of a failure or its prognostic criterion.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic structures exhibiting non-linear deformation are a prevalent
   research topic in the material sciences due to their negative Poisson's
   ratio. The auxetic behavior is most efficiently accomplished through
   buckling or hinging of 3d printed structures created with soft or
   flexible materials. These structures have been hypothesized to have some
   unique characteristics and may provide advantages over conventional
   engineering materials in certain applications. The objective of present
   study is to gain a better understanding of behavior of auxetic
   structures subjected to tensile, compressive and impact loads and assess
   geometric parameters affecting these structures in applications such as
   impact shielding or biomedicine. Analytical and experimental methods
   were employed to investigate two different types of auxetic structures
   which were 3d-printed with TPU (thermoplastic polyurethane). The first
   was based on symmetric re-entrant angles cells patterned to form
   sheet-like structure. Rotation of members in opposite directions in a
   cell induces negative Poisson's ratio when the structure is subjected to
   tensile loading. The second structure was based on rectangular lattice
   of circular holes. This structure exhibited auxeticity due to formation
   of pattern of alternating mutually orthogonal ellipses when subjected to
   compressive and impact loads. Parameters of interest in this study
   included hardness of the plastic used in printing the structures, the
   fill pattern of 3d-printed solid parts, porosity of cylinders in the
   lattice structure, angles and thickness of members in the re-entrant
   structure. Preliminary results indicated that per unit weight of
   material, the re-entrant structure requires less tensile load to strain
   than a solid structure. This is advantageous in applications where
   expansion in lateral direction is required. The lattice of circular
   holes structure exhibited similar trend in impact and compressive
   loading. The results indicate that geometric parameters influence
   auxeticity of the structure a great deal. When the porosity of the
   lattice is too small, positive Poisson's ratio is observed. The length
   to height ratio of the re-entrant cell has similar effect on the
   structure's Poisson's ratio. The main advantage gained by employing such
   structures is their overall ability to resist buckling and withstand
   impact load without cracking. This study will help to develop
   3D-printing techniques in manufacturing better performing structures
   under similar conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic mechanical metamaterials that exhibit a negative Poisson's ratio
   (NPR) can be artificially designed to exhibit a unique range of physical
   and mechanical properties. Novel sandwich structures composed of uniform
   and gradient auxetic double arrowhead honeycomb (DAH) cores were
   investigated in terms of their vibration and sound transmission
   performance stimulated by nonhomogeneous metamaterials with nonperiodic
   cell geometries. The spectral element method (SEM) was employed to
   accurately evaluate the natural frequencies and dynamic responses with a
   limited number of elements at high frequencies. The results indicated
   that the vibrating mode shapes and deformations of the DAH sandwich
   models were strongly affected by the patterned gradient metamaterials.

   sandwich models was investigated regarding the sound transmission loss
   (STL) from 1Hz to 1500Hz under a normal incident planar wave, and this
   performance was compared with that for hexagonal honeycomb sandwich
   panels. A programmable structural-acoustic optimization was implemented
   to maximize the STL while maintaining a constant weight and high
   strength. The results showed that the uniform DAH sandwich models with
   larger NPRs generally exhibited better vibration and acoustic
   attenuation behaviors and that the optimized gradient increasing NPR
   models yielded higher STL values than the optimized gradient decreasing
   NPR models for two specified frequency cases, with improvements of
   6.52dB and 2.52dB and a higher bending stiffness but a lower overall
   STL. Thus, sandwich panels consisting of auxetic DAHs can achieve
   desirable vibroacoustic performance with a higher bending stiffness than
   conventional hexagonal honeycomb sandwich structures, and the design of
   gradient DAHs can be extended to obtain optimized vibration and
   noise-control capabilities.}},

Abstract = {{This study sought to identify eating patterns among children and to
   verify their association with maternal characteristics. We studied 1,185
   children aged 13 to 35 months. Food consumption was investigated using
   the 24h dietary recall and the eating patterns were identified using
   principal components factor analysis, followed by orthogonal varimax
   rotation. We carried out a hierarchical modeling using poisson
   regression with robust variance estimates in order to estimate
   prevalence ratios. We identified four eating patterns: common Brazilian,
   dairy/porridge, healthy and unhealthy. The variance explained by these
   factors was of 34.3\% and the common Brazilian pattern was the one that
   most contributed to proportional variance. We highlight the
   dairy/porridge pattern, in which breast milk had negative factorial
   loading, suggesting its substitution by cow and modified milk. The data
   reveal that the characterization of children's eating patterns diverges
   according to maternal characteristics, such as age, educational level
   and number of children. Three of the four patterns we found are
   represented by foods rich in starch, saturated fat and simple sugar and
   poor in vitamins, minerals and fibers. Multiparity, lower educational
   levels and maternal age under 20 years were associated with a lower
   consumption of foods considered to be healthy and important in child
   development.}},

Abstract = {{Background: HIV infection in gay and bisexually active men (GBM) is an
   international public health concern and increasing HIV testing frequency
   is an important prevention goal. In this study we assessed the effect of
   introducing the Xpress clinic on repeat HIV testing in high-risk GBM in
   Sydney, Australia. Methods: The study population consisted of
   higher-risk (>5 male partners in the preceding 3 months) HIV-negative
   GBM attending the Sydney Sexual Health Centre for HIV screening between
   1 October 2009 and 31 December 2013 (12 months before Xpress was
   introduced and 3 years after). Poisson regression models were used to
   calculate the average annual trend of retesting within 6 months by
   quarter, and a retrospective cohort was constructed in which
   multivariate regression methods were used to assess the association
   between attendance at the Xpress clinic and repeat HIV testing in 6
   months. Results: Among high-risk GBM, HIV retesting increased from 32\%
   in Quarter 1 of 2011 to 48\% in Quarter 4 of 2013 (P-trend < 0.001).
   There was no significant trend in the proportion of high-risk GBM
   retesting within 6 months by quarter in the period before Xpress (1
   October 2009-30 September 2010; P-trend = 0.69), but there was a
   significant upward trend after Xpress implementation (1 January 2011-31
   December 2013; P-trend < 0.001). The summary rate ratio in the before
   versus during Xpress period in all GBM was 1.27 (95\% confidence
   interval (CI) 1.15-1.40; P < 0.001). In the multivariate analysis,
   attending the Xpress clinic was independently associated with retesting
   within 6 months of an initial test (adjusted OR 2.78; 95\% CI 2.12-3.66;
   P < 0.001) after adjusting for other demographics and risk factors.
   Conclusions: This study consistently shows that optimising current
   services by introducing express clinics was able to increase HIV testing
   frequency in high-risk GBM and should be adopted more widely.}},

Title = {{Health care are associated with worsening of frailty in community older
   adults}},
Journal = {{REVISTA DE SAUDE PUBLICA}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{53}},
Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To identify the factors associated with the worsening of
   frailty in older adults resident in the community.
   METHODS: This is a prospective, longitudinal, and analytical study. The
   data collection in the baseline occurred in the participants' homes from
   a random sampling by conglomerates. Demographic and socioeconomic
   variables, morbidities, and use of health services were analyzed.
   Frailty was measured by the Edmonton Frail Scale. The second data
   collection was performed after an average period of 42 months. The
   adjusted prevalence ratios were obtained by multiple Poisson regression
   analysis with robust variance.
   RESULTS: A total of 394 older adults participated in both phases of the
   study, with 21.8\% of them presenting worsening of the frailty
   condition. The variables that remained statistically associated with the
   transition to a worse state of frailty were: polypharmacy, negative
   self-perception of health, weight loss, and hospitalization over the
   past 12 months.
   CONCLUSIONS: The factors associated with worsening of frailty along the
   studied period among older adults in the community were those related to
   health care. This result must be considered by health professionals when
   addressing frail and vulnerable older adults.}},

Title = {{Trigonometric comparison measure: A feature selection method for text
   categorization}},
Journal = {{DATA \& KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{119}},
Pages = {{1-21}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Text data represented using vector space model is high dimensional data
   since the number of words can easily grow to tens of thousands for a
   moderate sized dataset. It may contain lots of redundant or irrelevant
   features that degrade the performance of a classifier for text
   categorization. To address this problem, feature selection can be
   applied for dimensionality reduction and it aims to find a set of highly
   distinguishing features. Most of filter feature selection methods for
   text categorization are based on document frequencies in positive and
   negative classes. Considering only document frequencies favors terms
   frequently used in a larger class and ignores relative document
   frequencies in the classes. In this paper, we present a new filter
   feature selection method, named Trigonometric Comparison Measure (TCM)
   considering relative document frequencies. The proposed method utilizes
   true positive rate and false positive rate to determine a better subset
   of features for text categorization and prefers terms that appear only
   in documents of one class with high probability. In order to assign a
   higher rank to terms that are frequently used in one class and rarely
   appears in another class, TCM calculates off axis angles of a vector
   represented as (tpr, fpr) and gives a larger score to terms with a small
   angle using sin and cos functions. The proposed method is compared with
   eight well-known filter feature selection methods including balanced
   accuracy measure (ACC2), information gain (IG), chi-squared (CHI), odds
   ratio (OR), Gini index (Gini), Deviation from a Poisson distribution
   (DP), distinguishing feature selector (DFS) and normalized difference
   measure (NDM) on ten datasets using the multinomial naive Bayes and
   support vector machines. The experimental results show that TCM achieves
   significantly better performance for text categorization.}},

Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{2019}},
Abstract = {{The intrinsic negative Poisson's ratio effect in 2-dimensional
   nanomaterials have attracted a lot of research interests due to its
   superior mechanical properties, and new mechanisms have emerged in the
   nanoscale. In this paper, we designed a novel graphyne-like
   two-dimensional carbon nanostructure with a butterfly shape (GL-2D-1)
   and its configuration isomer with a herring-bone form (GL-2D-2) by means
   of density functional theoretical calculation and predicted their
   in-plane negative Poisson's ratio effect and other mechanical
   properties. Both GL-2D-1 and GL-2D-2 present a significant negative
   Poisson's ratio effect under different specific strains conditions. By
   contrast, GL-2D-2 presents a much stronger negative Poisson's ratio
   effect and mechanical stability than does GL-2D-1. It is hoped that this
   work could be a useful structural design strategy for the development of
   the 2D carbon nanostructure with the intrinsic negative Poisson's ratio.}},

Abstract = {{Needlepunched nonwovens represent a special class of three-dimensional
   (3D) fiber networks that successfully generated a host of applications

   materials possessing out-of-plane auxetic characteristics has been
   investigated by unraveling the anisotropic structure. The evolution of
   the 3D intricate architecture of anisotropic nonwoven materials under
   prescribed levels of tensile strain has been determined using a 3D
   optical profiler. Most importantly, the analytical models expressed in
   terms of the initial modulus and in-plane Poisson's ratio of the
   nonwoven materials are presented. A comparison between the theory and
   experiments revealed a satisfactory agreement for the modulus and
   in-plane Poisson's ratio. Further, a comparative analysis of well-known
   analytical models of in-plane Poisson's ratio with the experimental data
   clearly demonstrated that the plausible mechanism of deformation of

Abstract = {{Objective: To evaluate the influence of socioeconomic and psychological
   factors on glycemic control in young children with type 1 diabetes
   mellitus.
   Methods: This was a cross-sectional study assessing prepubertal children
   with type 1 diabetes mellitus. The authors analyzed the socioeconomic
   status using the Brazil Economic Classification Criterion (Criterio de
   Classificacao Economica Brasil {[}CCEB]) and psychological conditions
   through the Brazilian version of the Problem Areas in Diabetes,
   associated with glycemic control, measured by glycated hemoglobin
   (HbA1c). Descriptive analysis was used. The variables were assessed by
   bivariate and multivariate robust Poisson regression model, as well as
   Fisher's exact and Pearson's chi-squared tests to obtain the ratios of
   gross and adjusted prevalence ratio, with confidence interval being
   estimated at 95\%.
   Results: A total of 68 children with type 1 diabetes mellitus were
   included in the study. A negative association between glycemic control
   (glycated hemoglobin levels), socioeconomic status (Brazil Economic
   Classification Criterion), and psychological condition (Brazilian
   version of the Problem Areas in Diabetes) was observed. Among the study
   participants, 73.5\% (n= 50) of the children had an unfavorable
   socioeconomic status; these participants were 1.4 times more likely to
   present altered glycated hemoglobin values. In relation to individuals
   with compromised psychological status, 26 (38.2\%) had a score above 70,
   thus being classified with psychological stress; these children were
   1.68 times more likely (95\% confidence interval: 1.101, 1.301) to have
   higher glycated hemoglobin levels.
   Conclusions: The socioeconomic conditions and psychological
   characteristics of the study participants were negatively associated
   with glycated hemoglobin results. These data reinforce the importance of
   the studied variables as predictors of glycemic control. (C) 2018

Abstract = {{Research on intergenerational social mobility and health-related
   behaviours yields mixed findings. Depending on the direction of mobility
   and the type of mechanisms involved, we can expect positive or negative
   association between intergenerational mobility and health-related
   behaviours. Using data from a retrospective cohort study, conducted in
   more than 100 towns across Belarus, Hungary and Russia, we fit
   multilevel mixed-effects Poisson regressions with two measures of
   health-related behaviours: binge drinking and smoking. The main
   explanatory variable, intergenerational educational mobility is
   operationalised in terms of relative intergenerational educational
   trajectories based on the prevalence of specified qualifications in
   parental and offspring generations. In each country the associations
   between intergenerational educational mobility, binge drinking and
   smoking was examined with incidence rate ratios and predicted
   probabilities, using multiply imputed dataset for missing data and
   controlling for important confounders of health-related behaviours. We
   find that intergenerational mobility in relative educational attainment
   has varying association with binge drinking and smoking and the strength
   and direction of these effects depend on the country of analysis, the
   mode of mobility, the gender of respondents and the type of
   health-related behaviour. Along with accumulation and Falling from Grace
   hypotheses of the consequences of intergenerational mobility, our
   findings suggest that upward educational mobility in certain instances
   might be linked to improved health-related behaviours.}},

Journal = {{QUALITY MANAGEMENT IN HEALTH CARE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{39-44}},

Abstract = {{Background: Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infection (SAB) in health
   care settings contributes significantly to mortality, and improved
   processes are associated with reduced burden of infection. In Australia,
   health care-associated SAB (HA-SAB) rates are reported as a health care
   performance indicator, but standardized methods for analyzing
   longitudinal data are not applied. Our objective was to evaluate the
   utility of statistical process control chart methodology for reporting
   HA-SAB and flagging higher than expected rates. Methods: A real-world
   test data set was defined as HA-SAB surveillance data collected by 155
   Australian health care facilities between June 1, 2015, and June 30,
   2017. This included 788 HA-SAB events, corresponding to an overall rate
   of 0.7 HA-SAB events per 10 000 occupied bed-days. The u-chart was
   selected as an appropriate tool, given the need for reporting natural
   units (HA-SAB rates) to a range of stakeholders. Facility-level data
   were plotted as u-charts, applying warning and control limits (2- and
   3-SD thresholds, respectively). Results: Sixty-eight of the 155
   participating facilities (43.9\%) observed at least 1 HA-SAB event
   during the studied period. Using the traditional method of Poisson
   modeling, 56 of these 68 facilities demonstrated overdispersion with
   variance-to-mean ratio spanning 1.03 to 42.82. Modeling by negative
   binomial (NB) distribution was therefore applied to enhance
   functionality. Conclusion: The u-chart is an accessible method for
   monitoring HA-SAB, interpretable by a range of stakeholders. We
   demonstrate the benefit of NB modeling to account for overdispersion,
   providing an effective tool to avoid inappropriate flags while
   maintaining early detection of out-of-control systems throughout a wide
   range of health care settings.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Background: Frailty reflects decreased resilience to physiological
   stressors; its prevalence and prognosis are not fully defined in heart
   failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).
   Methods: The Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) was prospectively
   obtained in 114 outpatients with HFpEF. The SPPB tests gait speed,
   tandem balance, and timed chair rises, each scored from 0 to 4 points.
   Severe and mild frailty were respectively defined as an SPPB score <= 6
   and 7-9 points. We used risk-adjusted logistic, Poisson, and negative
   binominal regression, respectively, to assess the relationship between
   SPPB score and risk of death or all-cause hospitalization, number of
   hospitalizations, and days hospitalized or dead longer than 6 months.
   Results: Patients were similar to other HFpEF cohorts (age 68 +/- 13
   years, 58\% female, body mass index 36 +/- 8 kg/m(2), multiple
   comorbidities). Mean SPPB score was 6.9 +/- 3.2, and 80\% of patients
   were at least mildly frail. Over a 6-month period, the SPPB score
   independently predicted death or all-cause hospitalization (odds ratio
   0.81 per point, 95\% confidence interval {[}CI] 0.69-0.94, P =.006),
   number of hospitalizations (incidence rate ratio 0.92 per point, 95\% CI
   0.86-0.97, P =.006), and days hospitalized or dead (incidence rate ratio
   0.85 per point, 95\% CI 0.73-0.99, P =.04).
   Conclusions: Lower extremity function, as measured by the SPPB,
   independently predicts hospitalization burden in outpatients with HFpEF.
   Additional studies are warranted to explore shared mechanisms and
   treatment implications of frailty in HFpEF.}},

Abstract = {{Simultaneous application of composite layers and steel bars/wires may
   considerably increase buckling strength of the civil structures. In the
   present paper, influence of the material heterogeneity on snap-through
   and snap-back post-buckling behaviors of the steel-wire-reinforced
   hybrid functionally graded orthotropic shallow cylindrical panels is
   investigated. In this regard, various arrangements are adopted for the
   steel-wires to constitute 3D (simultaneous radial, circumferential, and
   axial) gradations of the materials within some layers in addition to
   using some traditional composite layers in between. The non-linear
   governing equations of post-buckling are derived based on the principle
   of minimum potential energy. Sanders' shell theory is utilized to ensure
   that the results are reliable in the deep post-buckling region. A
   nonlinear finite element scheme is employed to trace the post-buckling
   paths using the modified arc-length method. Finally, some parametric
   studies in terms of material arrangement, size of the embedded steel
   wires, the overall lamination scheme, and geometric parameters of the
   shell are performed. Results emphasize the significant effects of the
   steel wires on the post-buckling strength and indicate the advantage of
   using steel fibers with exponential or uniform longitudinal
   distributions and linear transverse distribution, for weight
   optimization.}},

Title = {{Heterogeneous Strain Distribution of Elastomer Substrates To Enhance the
   Sensitivity of Stretchable Strain Sensors}},
Journal = {{ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{52}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{82-90}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Stretchable strain sensors, which convert mechanical stimuli into
   electrical signals, largely fuel the growth of wearable bioelectronics
   due to the ubiquitous, health-related strain in biological systems. In
   contrast to rigid conventional strain sensors, stretchable strain
   sensors present advantages of conformality and stretchability, solving
   the mechanical mismatch between electronics and the human body. However,
   the great challenge of stretchable strain sensors lies in achieving high
   sensitivity, which is required for both signal fidelity and cost
   considerations. Recent advances to solve this sensitivity challenge have
   focused on material optimization, in search of the optimum combination
   of conductive active materials and elastomer substrates among a myriad
   of artificial or natural materials. However, high sensitivity with a
   gauge factor larger than 50 remains a grand challenge, especially within
   large-strain regions.
   Here we present heterogeneous strain distribution of elastomer
   substrates as a powerful strategy to significantly enhance the
   sensitivity of stretchable strain sensors. The theoretical foundation of
   this strategy is mathematically proven on the basis of Ohm's law in
   electrics and mechanics of materials. First, the extent of the
   sensitivity enhancement is proved to be determined by the local strain
   in resistance-testing segments of heterogeneous strain sensors. Next,
   the local strain is proved to be quantitatively decided by material
   properties such as section area and Young's modulus. Thus, the necessary
   and sufficient condition to achieve high sensitivity in heterogeneous
   strain sensors is that the Young's modulus reciprocal or section area
   reciprocal in the resistance-testing segment is larger than the mean
   value. This provides a theoretical design guideline to achieve high
   sensitivity via heterogeneous strain distribution.
   On the basis of this guideline, we systematically summarize concrete
   instances of heterogeneity-induced sensitivity improvement in
   stretchable strain sensors, in sequence of increasing dimensionality. A
   typical example of a one-dimensional heterogeneous strain sensor is a
   structured fiber with microbeads, where the varied section area along
   the fiber axis results in heterogeneous strain and sensitivity
   improvement. Two-dimensional heterogeneous sensors in the form of thin
   films contain thickness gradient sensors and auxetic mechanical
   metamaterial sensors. The former exhibit heterogeneous section area via
   the self-pinning method, while the latter show heterogeneity in both the
   strain direction and amplitude, leading to a 24-fold improvement in
   sensitivity. Three-dimensional strain sensors include rationally
   structured sensors for out-of-plane force detection and asymmetric
   active materials in electronic whiskers. The resultant enhanced
   sensitivity in these heterogeneous strain sensors is beneficial for
   applications such as continuous health monitoring, biomedical
   diagnostics, and replacement prosthetics, taking advantage of augmented
   detection accuracy and declined device cost. Finally, we discuss
   possible future work in exploiting heterogeneous strain distributions,
   involving extended methodology to achieve heterogeneity, employing
   suppressed strain for stretchable electrodes, cyclic durability for
   long-term applications, and multifunctional system-level integration. We
   believe that this strategy of using heterogeneous strain distribution to
   enhance sensitivity can strongly promote the development of stretchable
   strain sensors for both practical and theoretical requirements.}},

Title = {{Household Implementation of Smoke-Free Rules in Homes and Cars: A Focus
   on Adolescent Smoking Behavior and Secondhand Smoke Exposure}},
Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HEALTH PROMOTION}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{33}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: This study addresses the dearth of population-based research on
   how comprehensive household smoke-free rules (ie, in the home and car)
   relate to tobacco use and secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure among
   adolescents. Design: Analysis of 2014 Minnesota Youth Tobacco Survey.
   Setting: Representative sample of Minnesota youth. Participants: A total
   of 1287 youth who lived with a smoker. Measures: Measures included
   household smoke-free rules (no rules, partial rules-home or car, but not
   both-and comprehensive rules), lifetime and 30-day cigarette use, 30-day
   cigarette and other product use, and SHS exposure in past 7 days in home
   and car. Analysis: Weighted multivariate logistic, zero-inflated
   Poisson, and zero-inflated negative binomial regressions were used.
   Results: Compared to comprehensive rules, partial and no smoke-free
   rules were significantly and positively related to lifetime cigarette
   use (respectively, adjusted odds ratio {[}AOR] = 1.80, 95\% confidence
   interval {[}CI] = 1.24-2.61; AOR = 2.87, 95\% CI = 1.93-4.25), and a
   similar significant pattern was found for 30-day cigarette use
   (respectively, AOR = 2.20, 95\% CI = 1.21-4.02; AOR = 2.45, 95\% CI =
   1.34-4.50). No smoke-free rules significantly predicted using cigarettes
   and other tobacco products compared to comprehensive rules. In both
   descriptive and regression analyses, we found SHS exposure rates in both
   the home and car were significantly lower among youth whose household
   implemented comprehensive smoke-free rules. Conclusions: Comprehensive
   smoke-free rules protect youth from the harms of caregiver tobacco use.
   Relative to both partial and no smoke-free rules, comprehensive
   smoke-free rules have a marked impact on tobacco use and SHS exposure
   among youth who live with a smoker. Health promotion efforts should
   promote comprehensive smoke-free rules among all households and
   particularly households with children and adolescents.}},

Abstract = {{This work describes the identification of the shear modulus of open cell
   polyurethane thermoformed auxetic foams from 3- and 4-point bending
   tests. The foams are incorporated in sandwich beams with carbon
   fibre/epoxy face skins, and benchmarked against similar sandwich
   structures made with the conventional counterpart open cell foam. Three
   types of beams are tested: one with auxetic foams, another type related
   to a conventional foam core with the same thickness of the auxetic
   porous materials, and a third type of beam consisting in conventional
   foam with a thickness corresponding to an iso-weight configuration to
   the auxetic specimen. The auxetic foam has a shear modulus 7\% lower
   than the one of the bulk conventional specimens, but higher shear
   stresses at large deformations and a smoother strain stiffening response
   compared to the beams with the conventional thinner core. The paper also
   highlights the low shear wave speed of these auxetic foams compared to
   other porous polymers used in helmet and head protection applications,
   as well as potential uses of the quasi-zero-stiffness behavior here
   observed for the auxetic foam sandwich beam.}},

Abstract = {{Poly(phenylacetylene) sheets that mimic the geometry of a wine-rack-like
   structure have been predicted to exhibit negative Poisson's ratios
   off-axis. However, their potential to exhibit negative linear
   compressibility (NLC) has remained largely unexplored. In this work, the
   compressibility and other mechanical properties of wine-rack-like
   poly(phenylacetylene) networks with 1,2,4,5 tetra-substituted phenyls as
   well as their equivalent with allene or cyclobutadiene centres are
   simulated to assess their ability to exhibit negative linear
   compressibility on-axis and off-axis. It is shown that some of these
   systems can indeed exhibit negative linear compressibility whilst others
   exhibit a near-zero compressibility. The results are compared to the
   compressibility properties of other poly(phenylacetylene) networks
   reported in literature as well as with those predicted from the
   analytical model for an idealised wine-rack structure deforming through
   hinging. Results suggest that these mechanical properties are arising
   from a wine-rack-like mechanism, and there is a good agreement with the
   theoretical model, especially for systems with longer acetylene chains
   whose geometry is closer to that of the idealised wine-rack.}},

Title = {{Auxeticity in Metals and Periodic Metallic Porous Structures Induced by
   Elastic Instabilities}},
Journal = {{PHYSICA STATUS SOLIDI B-BASIC SOLID STATE PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{256}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Materials with a negative Poisson's ratio (auxetics) are counter
   intuitive because their mechanical response is unusual. On the other
   hand, instabilities are usually regarded as deleterious phenomena and
   thus their prevention is needed. Here, numerical and theoretical
   evidences have been provided to show that two different elastic
   instabilities are, rather than deleterious, useful phenomena that cause
   auxeticity. It has been shown that a negative Poisson's ratio can be
   found in some face-centered cubic (FCC) single crystals at a finite
   strain as they are under uniaxial stress along the {[}100]-direction.
   The auxeticity is associated with a phase transformation induced by the
   Born-Hill's elastic instability, i.e., an elastic material instability.
   In addition, it has been found that periodic metallic porous structures
   can also show a negative Poisson's ratio at finite compressive strain.
   In this case, buckling of the micro-structure of the porous structures,
   which is an elastic and geometric instability, is respondent for the
   auxeticity.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of thermo-mechanical auxetic foam conversion parameters on
   the Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of open-cell polyurethane foam
   are related to changes in chemical bonding and cell structure. Applied
   volumetric compression, conversion temperature, and duration are
   reported on foam Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, and structural
   stability. Fourier transform infrared spectral analysis on samples
   converted at and above 160 degrees C strongly indicates a hydrogen bond
   interaction increase in urea groups (C=O---H-N) and an increase in
   hydrogen bonding population. Spectral changes inferred soft segment
   degradation following extensive heat exposure (200 degrees C, 180 min),
   specifically a shift and intensity change in CH2 and C-O-C polyol bands
   and a broad baseline increase between 3600 and 2400 cm(-1). These
   changes are linked to (i) resistance to dimensional recovery over time
   and during re-heating; (ii) Poisson's ratio becoming negative, then zero
   in tension or marginally positive in compression; (iii) Young's Modulus
   reducing then increasing; (iv) mass loss, evidenced by thermogravimetric
   analysis increasing from 150 degrees C. The minimum mean values of
   Poisson's ratio of approximate to-0.2 (to 10\% compression/tension) are
   comparable to other studies. All samples that retain their imposed
   compression over time are isotropic, with near constant Young's moduli
   and Poisson's ratio (to 10\% compression/tension).}},

Abstract = {{An extensive investigation is carried out on the missing rib square grid
   structure using finite element simulations. This showed that, in the
   cases considered in this study, the type of deformation is primarily
   dependent on the ratio of the thickness of different ribs with the
   structure behaving like an anti-tetrachiral at particular ratios. The
   analysis also showed that the ability of the structure to deform
   predominantly through the bending of the ligament allows it to achieve
   much more negative values of the Poisson's ratio than previously
   reported. Confirmation of the numerical results is obtained through
   experimental methods involving the 3D printing of representative
   structures which are subsequently subjected to compression.}},

Abstract = {{A novel three-dimensional lattice based on a generalization of the
   anti-tetrachiral geometry is presented and investigated using
   experimental, numerical, and analytical methods. The lattice is built
   through the use of a novel connectivity that is not only able to
   transmit the force imposed to other orthogonal directions but also
   induce a contraction in these other directions when uniaxially
   compressed. The experimental results for a specific geometry confirmed
   that the structure behaves auxetically when compressed along the Ox(1)
   direction. The parametric behavior of the structure is investigated
   using commercially available finite element software with the
   methodology being validated using experimental results. The results
   indicate that the structure will have a negative Poisson's ratio in all
   directions with the magnitude depending on the relative lengths of the
   ligaments, their thickness, and to a minor extent, their width. An
   analytical model is also derived and tested against the experimental and
   numerical results showing good agreement.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{This paper reports a new type of auxetic yarn made with circular
   braiding technology to overcome the yarn slippage problem in the
   conventional helical auxetic yarn structure. Various auxetic yarn
   structures are firstly produced on a vertical circular braiding machine
   with 16 yarn carries by changing the number and arrangement of stiff
   yarn as well as diameter of elastic yarn and core yarn, and then tested
   under single and repeating tensile conditions. The results show that not
   only yarn slippage problem could be overcome in the newly developed
   auxetic yarn structure, but also an early activation and a higher
   magnitude of negative Poisson's ratio could be achieved. The results
   also show that all structural parameters including stiff yarn number and
   arrangement, core yarn, and elastic yarn diameter have an influence on
   the auxetic effect of the novel yarn structure. Since the new auxetic
   yarn is produced by using standard braiding manufacturing technique and
   conventional non-auxetic yarns, there are few technological barriers for
   its large-scale manufacture for practical application.}},

Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{256}},

Abstract = {{With the help of molecular dynamics simulations, delocalized nonlinear
   vibrational modes (DNVM) in graphene are analyzed. Such modes are
   dictated by the lattice symmetry, they are exact solutions to the atomic
   equations of motion, regardless the employed interatomic potential and
   for any mode amplitude (though for large amplitudes they are typically
   unstable). In this study, only one- and two-component DNVM are analyzed,
   they are reducible to the dynamical systems with one and two degrees of
   freedom, respectively. There exist 4 one-component and 12 two-component
   DNVM with in-plane atomic displacements. Any two-component mode includes
   one of the one-component modes. If the amplitudes of the modes
   constituting a two-component mode are properly chosen, periodic in time
   vibrations are observed for the two degrees of freedom at frequencies
   omega and 2 omega, that is, second harmonic generation takes place. For
   particular DNVM, the higher harmonic can have frequency nearly two times
   larger than the maximal frequency of the phonon spectrum of graphene.
   Excitation of some of DNVM results in the appearance of negative
   in-plane pressure in graphene. This counterintuitive result is explained
   by the rotational motion of carbon hexagons. Our results contribute to
   the understanding of nonlinear dynamics of the graphene lattice.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICA STATUS SOLIDI B-BASIC SOLID STATE PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{256}},

Abstract = {{Perforated systems constitute one of the most important classes of
   mechanical metamaterials. In this work, two types of ``I{''}-shaped slit
   perforation patterns are proposed which may be used to design perforated
   systems that mimic the deformation mechanisms of a variety of re-entrant
   and anti-tetrachiral honeycomb systems. Using finite element analysis,
   it is shown how these systems have the potential to exhibit a large
   spectrum of negative Poisson's ratios, ranging from extremely negative
   to zero, which are retained over a wide tensile strain range. A detailed
   analysis of the deformation behavior of these systems is also presented
   along with a comparison of the changes in overall expansion and
   Poisson's ratios of both systems observed upon loading with those
   predicted by previously formulated theoretical models of re-entrant and
   anti-tetrachiral systems. It is hoped that this work will be of
   considerable aid in the efforts of scientists to understand the
   underlying principles governing the production of auxetic mechanical
   metamaterials through the use of perforations and also stimulate further
   research on how these and similar mechanisms may be implemented in
   perforated systems to design other metamaterials with anomalous
   mechanical properties.}},

Abstract = {{Preliminary results on the influence of periodically distributed
   cylindrical nanoinclusions introduced into the f.c.c. hard sphere
   crystal on its elastic properties and the Poisson's ratio are presented.
   The nanoinclusions are oriented along the {[}001]-direction and filled
   with hard spheres of diameter different from the spheres forming the
   matrix crystal. The Monte Carlo simulations show that symmetry of the
   crystal changes from the cubic to tetragonal one. In the case when
   spheres inside the inclusion are smaller than spheres forming the
   crystal, the changes of Poisson's ratio are qualitatively similar to the
   changes observed earlier in the Yukawa sphere crystal, that is, the
   introduction of nanochannels causes simultaneous decrease of the
   Poisson's ratio in the {[}110]{[}11 over bar 0]-direction, and its
   increase in {[}110]{[}001]-direction. Filling the nanochannel with
   spheres having diameters greater than that of the spheres in the
   crystalline matrix, causes a decrease of the Poisson's ratio value from
   0.065 down to -0.365 in {[}111]{[}112 over bar ]-direction. The
   dependence of the minimal Poisson's ratio on the direction of the
   applied load is shown in a form of surfaces in spherical coordinates,
   for selected values of nanochannel particle diameters. The most negative
   value of the Poisson's ratio found amongst all systems studied was as
   low as -0.873.}},

   by the selective electron-beam melting method. A detailed geometrical
   analysis of the fabricated samples based on micro computed tomography
   (microCT) scans is performed to determine the variation of strut
   thickness and other fabrication imperfections. The samples are subjected
   to high strain rate compression loading in two specimen orientations
   (specimens with low or high porosity facing the impacting plate) using
   the powder gun. Appropriate computational models are later developed and
   validated to provide a more detailed insight into the crushing mechanism
   of auxetic structures during impact. The experimental and computational
   results show dependency of the plateau stress inclination
   (progressive/regressive) on the gradation of the auxetic cellular
   structures (specimens with low or high porosity in front). These initial
   results prove that it is possible to tailor the mechanical behavior of a
   porous structure with introduction of graded porosity, especially in the
   case of high strain rate impact, where the main deformation occurs at
   the impacting front.}},

Abstract = {{Diamond-like structures, that include sp(2) and sp(3) hybridized carbon
   atoms, are of considerable interest nowadays. In the present work,
   various carbon auxetic structures are studied by the combination of
   molecular dynamics (MD) and analytical approach. Two fullerites based on
   the fullerene C-60 and fullerene-like molecule C-48 are investigated as
   well as diamond-like structures based on other fullerene-like molecules
   (called fulleranes), carbon nanotubes (called tubulanes) and graphene
   sheets. MD is used to find the equilibrium states of the structures and
   calculate compliance and stiffness coefficients for stable
   configurations. Analytical methods are used to calculate the engineering
   elastic coefficients (Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, shear modulus
   and bulk modulus), and to study their transformation under rotation of
   the coordinate system. All the considered structures are partial
   auxetics with the negative value of Poisson's ratio for properly chosen
   tensile directions. It is shown that some of these structures, in a
   particular tension direction, have a very high Young's modulus, that is,
   1852 GPa for tubulane TA6.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the dynamic behavior of a three-layered sandwich beam
   with a metal foam core is investigated. Outer layers of the sandwich
   beam are made of AlSi12 alloy and the core is metal porous foam made of
   AlSi12. Numerical analysis is made for different parameters of the core
   - average damping loss factor, densities, Young modulus, and Poisson's
   ratio of core foam. The simulations are used to determine the mechanical
   impedance for a sandwich beam with the applied harmonic load. Numerical
   calculations are made with the use of finite element method. The results
   imply that the auxetic core of the composite beam can have a great
   impact on the dynamic behavior (mobility) of the system. Furthermore, it
   appears that there are ranges of frequencies in which the mobility of
   the system can be minimized by using the auxetic foam core.}},

Abstract = {{Various clamp designs have been proposed over the years with different
   degrees of complexity and actual performance vis-a-vis correct grip and
   reduced impact on the surface strains of the tendon sample. The previous
   studies all focused on impact on ultimate tensile strain and Young's
   modulus of the tendons. Here an innovative clamp design is proposed that
   utilizes the fairly recently available technology that is 3D printing to
   produce a made-to-measure tendon sleeve that encloses the sample ends
   and also enables straightforward alignment within the testing equipment.
   All experiments are carried out using the superficial digital flexor
   tendons obtained from pig hind legs. The Young's moduli for the linear
   region of the tendon obtained using this clamp design are very similar
   to those obtained using the cryo Jaw by other researchers for the same
   tendon. Furthermore, negative Poisson's ratios are also obtained for the
   toe-region, in agreement with previous work.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports a development of bi-stretch auxetic woven fabrics by
   using non-auxetic yarns and weaving technology. The fabric structure is
   first designed based on a re-entrant hexagonal geometry by combination
   of loose weave and tight weave in a woven fabric structure, and then
   fabricated on a rapier weaving machine by using both non-elastic and
   elastic yarns. Two variations of the fabric are produced by using
   different elastic yarn arrangement in weft direction. The designed
   auxetic geometry is finally achieved after a washing process due to
   creation of non-uniform contraction or shrinkage profiles within the
   fabric structural unit cell. The testing results showed that the
   developed fabrics exhibit negative Poisson ratio effect in both weft and
   warp directions in a large range of tensile strain.}},

Abstract = {{A novel porous mechanical metamaterial with variable Poisson's ratio
   (VPR) is proposed for compression and impact applications. Constructed
   by stacking layers of varying void aspect ratio, VPR structures combine
   the collapsing penetration resistance of auxetic materials with the
   lateral expansion of positive Poisson's ratio (PPR) materials. The
   concept is analyzed via numerical simulation of both compression and
   impact loading of VPR structures composed of silicone rubber. In
   addition, compression testing is performed with deformation maps
   obtained through digital image correlation. Results indicate that VPR
   structures, compared with uniform porous PPR structures, are resistant
   to global buckling instabilities. Moreover, in low-energy impact events,
   VPR structures respond to the impulse with a comparable force spread
   over a longer time than uniform PPR structures of the same porosity. At
   impact energies above approximately 45 J, the considered silicone VPR
   structures transition to a regime of more sharply peaked force response.
   At all energies, VPR structures deform more smoothly than their porous
   PPR counterparts. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: This study aimed to investigate the associations of multiple
   metals with chromosome damage, and further explore the mediation roles
   of microRNAs (miRNAs) and their potentials in lung cancer.
   Methods: We determined the urinary levels of 23 metals, lymphocytic
   micronucleus (MN) frequency, and ten candidate miRNAs in plasma among
   365 healthy workers. Poisson and linear regression models were conducted
   to analyze the associations of urinary metals with MN frequency and
   miRNAs, respectively. The mediation effects of miRNAs on the metal-MN
   frequency associations were assessed by causal mediation analysis.
   Additionally, the levels of effective metal and miRNAs were measured in
   43 pair-wised tumor and normal lung tissues.
   Results: The urinary level of titanium was inversely associated with MN
   frequency after Bonferroni correction {[}frequency ratio (FR) and 95\%
   confidence interval (95\% CI) = 0.88 (0.82, 0.94), p = 5.0 x 10(-4)]. A
   doubling in urinary titanium was associated with 14.72\%-38.17\%
   decrease in plasma miRNAs. After multiple comparison, miR-24-3p and
   miR-28-5p significantly mediated 24.8\% (7.7\%, 70.0\%) and 20.4\%
   (5.7\%, 52.0\%) of the association between titanium and MN frequency
   (p(mediation) = 0.002 and 0.004, respectively). Besides, a doubling in
   titanium was associated with a separate 53.4\% and 47.2\% decreased
   miR-24-3p and miR-28-5p expression in normal lung tissues. Lower
   titanium but higher levels of miR-24-3p and miR-28-5p were shown in
   tumor than normal tissues of lung squamous cell carcinoma patients (all
   p < 0.05).
   Conclusions: Our study proposed the negative associations of titanium
   with chromosome damage and lung cancer, and highlighted the mediating
   roles of miR-24-3p and miR-28-5p. Further investigations are warranted
   to validate these associations and uncover the underlying mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we give a review of the state of the art in the study of
   mechanical metamaterials. The very attractive property of having a
   microstructure capable of determining exotic and specifically tailored
   macroscopic behaviour makes the study of metamaterials a field that is
   actually in expansion, from both a theoretical and a technological point
   of view. This work is divided into two sections, describing the
   phenomenological and theoretical aspects of metamaterials. We first give
   an overview of some existing metamaterials, such as pentamode materials,
   auxetic materials, materials with negative mechanical constitutive
   coefficients and materials with enhanced mechanical properties. We also
   focus on some emerging areas, such as origami. Then, we present some
   theoretical studies in the field of mechanical metamaterials, such as
   those related to first- and second-gradient theories.}},

Abstract = {{As a first step, variational formulations and governing equations with
   boundary conditions are derived for a pair of Euler-Bernoulli beam
   bending models following a simplified version of Mindlin's strain
   gradient elasticity theory of form II. For both models, this leads to
   sixth-order boundary value problems with new types of boundary
   conditions that are given additional attributes singly and doubly,
   referring to a physically relevant distinguishing feature between free
   and prescribed curvature, respectively. Second, the variational
   formulations are analyzed with rigorous mathematical tools: the
   existence and uniqueness of weak solutions are established by proving
   continuity and ellipticity of the associated symmetric bilinear forms.
   This guarantees optimal convergence for conforming Galerkin
   discretization methods. Third, the variational analysis is extended to
   cover two other generalized beam models: another modification of the
   strain gradient elasticity theory and a modified version of the couple
   stress theory. A model comparison reveals essential differences and
   similarities in the physicality of these four closely related beam
   models: they demonstrate essentially two different kinds of
   parameter-dependent stiffening behavior, where one of these kinds
   (possessed by three models out of four) provides results in a very good
   agreement with the size effects of experimental tests. Finally,
   numerical results for isogeometric Galerkin discretizations with
   B-splines confirm the theoretical stability and convergence results.
   Influences of the gradient and thickness parameters connected to size
   effects, boundary layers and dispersion relations are studied thoroughly
   with a series of benchmark problems for statics and free vibrations. The
   size-dependency of the effective Young's modulus is demonstrated for an
   auxetic cellular metamaterial ruled by bending-dominated deformation of
   cell struts.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates the structural compression properties of the
   additive manufactured (AM) Ti-6Al-4V lattice structure using LS-Dyna
   simulation analysis software and calculates its mechanical properties
   under different porosities and different pattern designs. Ti-6Al-4V
   alloys formed by using additive manufacturing produced elliptic holes
   with long and short axes due to the difference in the direction of
   construction. These holes could be eliminated and the materials could be
   compacted by hot isostatic pressing (HIP) treatment. Compactness of the
   frame element achieved 99.9\% and drastically reduced the anisotropic
   behavior caused by the fabrication process. For the experimental
   testing, the samples with different porosities and the A-type and
   AZ-type designs were employed in compression experiment. In the
   meantime, the Young's modulus, the yield strength, plateau stress and
   other mechanical behavior were investigated by CAE simulation. The
   plateau stress, which is an important property for some biomedical
   applications, was calculated with satisfactory accuracy compared with
   experimental measurements. The simulated results of the designed lattice
   structures with different porosity contents were able to adopt the
   Gibson-Ashby model to determine their failure mechanisms. Finally, the
   CAE simulation for the design of an auxetic material was demonstrated.}},

Title = {{Dynamic indentation of auxetic and non-auxetic honeycombs under large

Abstract = {{It is generally acknowledged that the indentation resistance or hardness
   of auxetic materials is higher than that of their conventional
   counterparts under elastic deformation. However, this property of the
   auxetic material may not always be superior to that of the non-auxetic
   materials when the deformation is relatively large with plasticity
   considered. In this study, we come up with an index to quantitatively
   depict the indentation resistance of the hexagonal honeycombs under
   large deformation. The indentation resistance of both the auxetic and
   nonauxetic hexagonal honeycombs is compared and discussed. Results show
   that in the premise of honeycombs possessing the same relative density,
   the indentation resistance of auxetic hexagonal honeycombs is not always
   higher than that of the non-auxetic honeycombs. This phenomenon is
   verified by the numerical simulations. Further analysis shows that there
   is a critical value of the absolute value of Poisson's ratio, which is
   determined by the cell-wall length ratio, to estimate the higher
   indentation resistance between the auxetic and non-auxetic hexagonal
   honeycombs. The influence of indentation velocity is also analyzed based
   on numerical simulations. This present work is supposed to shed light on
   the design and evaluation of the indentation resistance for both auxetic
   and conventional honeycombs.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we have characterized a cellular structure constituted by
   a new cell on which we carried out, initially, tensile and shear tests
   in order to get its in-plane mechanical properties; in the second time,
   we explored the effects that geometry will have on these mechanical
   properties by varying the geometric parameters of the cell. The
   specimens were designed by Computer Aided Designsoftware and obtained by
   rapid prototyping (laser cutting). In the quest for results, we used the
   technique of marker tracking. This optical method of correlating images
   consists in measuring the plane components of the displacement of a
   plane surface leaving some marks on the specimen. This makes it possible
   to determine the in-plane components of the transformation gradient
   tensor and to reach the plane components of the deformation tensor under
   certain assumptions (axisymmetric or isochoric transformation, small
   deformations, etc). The material of the studied structure is a
   polymethylmethacrylate, often abbreviated to PMMA. The first results
   gave a negative Poisson's ratio, announcing an auxetic behavior. The
   following results have confirmed the auxetic character of the cell and
   show great influence of the geometric parameters on the mechanical
   properties of the new structure.}},

Title = {{Symmetry and degeneracy of phonon modes for periodic structures with

Volume = {{122}},
Pages = {{244-261}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{A large class of phononic crystals and mechanical metamaterials exhibit
   glide symmetry that dictates their functionality or exceptional
   performance. The glide symmetry gives rise to a number of intriguing
   phenomena like sticking-bands and degeneracy in the phononic band
   structures. Fully understanding of these phenomena demands analysis of
   the phonon modes' symmetry property, which is, however, a challenging
   task since it involves nonsymmorphic space group analysis and special
   treatment of the Brillouin zone boundary. Therefore, this work
   introduces a systematic group-theoretical procedure determining the
   symmetry of phonon modes for periodic structures with glide symmetry. By
   taking the p4g group as an example, the symmetry of phonon modes is
   discussed by deriving the small representations for high symmetry
   k-points, and different types of degeneracies are elucidated. This work
   provides insight into the role of glide symmetry on phononic band
   structures and guides the symmetry analysis of periodic structures of
   other types. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{MATERIALS CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},

Abstract = {{The stability, mechanical properties and electronic structures of Ti3Al,
   TiAl, TiAl2 and TiAl3 have been systematically investigated by the
   first-principles calculation. The four Ti-Al binary compounds are
   thermodynamically stable intermetallics depending on their negative
   formation enthalpy and cohesive energy. The bulk modulus (B), shear
   modulus (G), Young's modulus (E), Vicker's hardness (H-v) and Poisson's
   ratio (v) are calculated. With the increment of Al content, the bulk
   modulus and Poisson's ratio decrease while the shear modulus, Young's
   modulus and hardness gradually increase. The ratio of B/G decreases with
   Al increment, implying the weakening of ductility. In addition, the
   mechanical anisotropy of Ti-Al compound has been revealed by the
   analysis of the anisotropy index, three-dimensional surface contours of
   the Young's modulus and the planar projections on the low index planes
   (including (100), (010), (100) and (110)). TiAl shows the most
   anisotropic structure while Ti3Al has the least anisotropy. The density
   of states (DOS) and electron density distribution map are discussed to
   analyze the electronic structures and chemical bonding characters. The
   Ti-Al binary compounds are composed of both metallic and covalent bonds,
   and the covalent bonding character can be strengthened with the increase
   of Al content.}},

Title = {{A bio-inspired novel active elastic component based on negative
   Poisson's ratio structure and dielectric elastomer}},
Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Dielectric elastomer is one of the most concerned type of electroactive
   polymer. When a membrane of dielectric elastomer is subject to a voltage
   on both sides, the membrane reduces thickness and expands area, and vice
   versa. Due to this unique behavior, dielectric elastomer can be applied
   as active structure, actuator, sensor, energy harvesting component, etc.
   However, the mechanical performance of active structure is limited by
   the low Young's modulus of dielectric elastomer. Inspired by the human's
   bone-muscle system, a novel active structure that applying dielectric
   elastomer on the double-V type Negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) structure
   was proposed in this paper. When voltage and load vary, mechanical
   performance and dimensions of proposed Electroactive NPR (ENPR)
   structure change. The electro-mechanical model of ENPR structure was
   established from the perspective of Helmholtz free energy. And the
   theoretical model was verified by the experiment of an ENPR structure
   prototype. Furthermore, the influences of dimensions of dielectric
   elastomer and structural parameters on the electro-mechanical
   performance were researched. The results indicated that all variables
   influenced the stiffness of ENPR structure. Width L-2, number of cells
   n(x) and number of layers n(y) had limited effects on the electroactive
   response, but tuning of others variables which can improve stiffness
   will weaken the electroactive response. Through periodic replication of
   ENPR cells, the electro-mechanical property can be superimposed to
   satisfy higher bearing requirements and larger size demands. ENPR
   structure can realize integration, electronization, informatization and
   intellectualization of elastic component, sensor, actuator, and energy
   harvesting system theoretically, which is significant and can be
   expected to be widely applied on mechanical systems.}},

Title = {{Negative refraction of Lamb modes: A theoretical study}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{98}},
Number = {{21}},
Month = {{DEC 26}},
Abstract = {{This paper provides a theoretical investigation of negative refraction
   and focusing of elastic guided waves in a freestanding plate with a
   steplike thickness change. Under certain conditions, a positive phase
   velocity (forward) Lamb mode can be converted into a negative phase
   velocity (backward) mode at such interface, giving rise to negative
   refraction. A semianalytical model is developed to study the influence
   of various parameters such as the material Poisson's coefficient, the
   steplike thickness, the frequency, and the incidence angle. To this end,
   all the Lamb and shear horizontal propagating modes and also a large
   number of their inhomogeneous and evanescent counterparts are taken into
   account. The boundary conditions applied to the stress-displacement
   fields at the thickness step yields an equation system. Its inversion
   provides the transmission and reflection coefficients between each mode
   at the interface. The steplike thickness and Poisson's ratio are shown
   to be key parameters to optimize the negative refraction process. In
   terms of material, Duralumin is found to be optimal as it leads to a
   nearly perfect conversion between forward and backward modes over broad
   frequency and angular ranges. An excellent focusing ability is thus
   predicted for a flat lens made of two symmetric thickness steps. A laser
   ultrasonic experiment quantitatively confirms those theoretical
   predictions. This study paves the way toward the optimization of elastic
   devices based on negative refraction, in particular for cloaking or
   superfocusing purposes.}},

Volume = {{98}},
Number = {{24}},
Month = {{DEC 17}},
Abstract = {{In contrast to the well-defined lattices of various two-dimensional (2D)
   systems, the atomic structure of borophene is sensitive to growth
   conditions and type of the substrate which results in rich polymorphism.
   By employing ab initio methods, we reveal a thermodynamically stable
   borophene polymorph without vacancies which is a semiconductor unlike
   the other known boron sheets, in the form of an asymmetric
   centered-washboard structure. Our results indicate that asymmetric
   distortion is induced due to Peierls instability which transforms a
   symmetric metallic system into a semiconductor. We also show that
   applying uniaxial or biaxial strain gradually lowers the obtained band
   gap and the symmetric configuration is restored following the closure of
   the band gap. Furthermore, while the Poisson's ratio is calculated to be
   high and positive in the semiconducting regime, it switches to negative
   once the metallicity is retrieved. The realization of semiconducting
   borophene polymorphs without defects and tunability of its electronic
   and mechanical response can extend the usage of boron sheets in a
   variety of nanoelectronic applications.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, an auxetic cellular structure consisting of re-entrant
   hexagonal cells have been analyzed, exhibiting different elastic
   properties in two orthogonal directions. A novel strain-based expansion
   homogenization method has been proposed and used to contrastively
   analyze the Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of the re-entrant
   auxetic cellular structure in two principal directions. The comparison
   of the obtained theoretical results with the simulation results and the
   experimental results shows good agreement, which validates the
   effectiveness of the analytical model. With the validated model, the
   dependence of the elastic properties on the geometric parameters of the
   unit cell, including the aspect ratio, length ratio and re-entrant
   angle, has been further investigated. The results also indicate that the
   analyzed auxetic structure features a stiffer modulus along the
   re-entrant direction especially for a small re-entrant angle. Moreover,
   the auxetic structure shows a stronger auxeticity along the re-entrant
   direction when the re-entrant angle is smaller than the transitional
   point. A design map has been presented to show the great potential of
   the structure in function-oriented design, providing an extensive
   reference for the practical engineering application. (C) 2018 Elsevier

   structures}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{160}},
Pages = {{949-963}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Curved-Layer Manufacturing (CLM) is a method of depositing material
   along the local curvature of the manufactured part, rather than building
   up parts in planar layers like traditional additive manufacturing.
   Lattice-based materials have been shown to have useful structural
   properties and wide-ranging applications, though they are limited to
   patterns along Cartesian axes. Additionally, materials with a negative
   Poisson's ratio, called auxetics, can be created with engineered
   lattices and have wide applications across biomedical, aeronautical, and
   structural fields, though manufacturing is often limited to 2D. This
   provides an opportunity to explore applications of CLM in the
   fabrication of metamaterial lattices such as auxetics outside of
   Cartesian planes. Here, the development of a process for the fabrication
   of non-planar lattice-shells along parametric surfaces is described.
   This method employs Bezier surfaces of arbitrary order, allowing a wide
   variety of parent surfaces. Using this method, a variety of lattices
   were fabricated on Bezier surfaces to demonstrate the propensity of the
   method, while showing it has zero waste material when a reusable mandrel
   is used. Further, a brief experimental exploration demonstrates the
   differences among lattice types, finding that significantly auxetic
   lattice-shells are more resistant to fracture than quadratic and
   disrupted lattices of similar patterns and densities. (C) 2018 Elsevier

Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{160}},
Pages = {{1305-1321}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{This work presents a comparative study on the reliability of auxetic
   (re-entrant honeycomb) and non-auxetic (diamond lattice and conventional
   honeycomb) lattice composites. The analyzed specimen consists of two
   unidirectional carbon fiber reinforced composite (CFRP) face sheets and
   a 3D-printed polymeric core. Low velocity impact tests are conducted
   first to characterize the unit cell deformation pattern, and we further
   explore its influence on core structure behavior as well as sandwich
   panel performance. It is found that the re-entrant topology exhibits
   lower energy absorption capacity but superior robustness and durability.
   Consequently, the re-entrant panel performs best in both force
   mitigation and energy dissipation, provided that the impact energy is
   appropriate. Furthermore, employing re-entrant core not only stabilizes
   the occurrences of the face sheet penetration as the impact energy
   increases, but also grants the sandwich panel consistent behaviors under
   multi-cycle impacts. These unique performances are due to the global
   instability of the auxetic structure, which yields more compliant
   deformation and less stress concentration. Resultant discrepancies shall
   be interpreted with the sandwich core deformation for validation. These
   findings pave the way for developing new class of auxetic lattice
   composites, especially under cyclic loading conditions, through a
   combination of rational design and 3D printing. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{As a new class of two-dimensional (2D) materials, 2D covalent organic
   frameworks (COFs) are proven to possess remarkable electronic and
   magnetic properties. However, their mechanical behaviours remain almost
   unexplored. In this work, taking the recently synthesised
   dimethylmethylene-bridged triphenylamine (DTPA) sheet as an example, we
   investigate the mechanical behaviours of 2D COFs based on molecular
   dynamics simulations together with density functional theory
   calculations. A novel phase transformation is observed in DTPA sheets
   when a relatively large in-plane compressive strain is applied to them.
   Specifically, the crystal structures of the transformed phases are
   topographically different when the compressive loading is applied in
   different directions. The compression-induced phase transformation in
   DTPA sheets is attributed to the buckling of their kagome lattice
   structures and is found to have significant impacts on their material
   properties. After the phase transformation, Young's modulus, band gap
   and thermal conductivity of DTPA sheets are greatly reduced and become
   strongly anisotropic. Moreover, a large in-plane negative Poisson's
   ratio is found in the transformed phases of DTPA sheets. It is expected
   that the results of the compression-induced phase transformation and its
   influence on the material properties observed in the present DTPA sheets
   can be further extended to other 2D COFs, since most 2D COFs are found
   to possess a similar kagome lattice structure.}},

Abstract = {{Metamaterials with artificially designed architectures can achieve
   unique and even unprecedented physical properties, which show promising
   applications in actuators, amplifiers and micromechanical controls. An
   initiator-integrated 3D printing technology (i3DP) was applied in this
   study to create scalable, metal/polymer meta-mechanical materials, which
   can gradually achieve negative Poisson's ratio, high strength and
   ultralow density, as well as high compressive and super-elastic
   behavior. The i3DP was enabled by integrating an atomic-transfer radical
   polymerization (ATRP) initiator with UV-curable resin, followed by
   polyelectrolyte brushes (PMETAC) grafting via surface-initiated ATRP and
   thereafter electroless plating to form metal coatings. Compared with
   polymer structures, the compressive stress of metal-polymer structure
   can be doubled when deposited with a 190 nm copper layer. The hollow
   metallic materials possess a tunable Poisson's ratio, and the highest
   average recoverability, which can recover nearly completely to their
   original shape after over 30\% compression. Overall, this i3DP approach
   provides meta-structures with substantial benefits from the hierarchical
   design and fabrication flexibility.}},

Abstract = {{We employ a combination of the single chain in mean field simulation
   approach with the solution of Poisson's equation to study the influence
   of charge heterogeneities on the structure of protein-polyelectrolyte
   complexes. By adopting a coarse-grained model of representing proteins
   as charged nanoparticles, we studied the influence of the pattern of
   charge heterogeneities, net charge, ratio of positive to negative
   charges on the patches, and the volume fraction of the particles on the
   structural and aggregation characteristics of proteins in
   polyelectrolyte solutions. Our results demonstrate that the pattern of
   charge heterogeneities can exert a significant influence on the
   resulting characteristics of the aggregates, in some cases leading to a
   transformation from polymer-bridged complexes into direct particle
   aggregates driven by the attraction between oppositely charged patches.}},

   elastic properties through spatial distribution of hard and soft phases}},
Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{113}},
Number = {{24}},
Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{Up until recently, the rational design of mechanical metamaterials has
   usually involved devising geometrical arrangements of
   micro-architectures that deliver unusual properties on the macro-scale.
   A less explored route to rational design is spatially distributing
   materials with different properties within lattice structures to achieve
   the desired mechanical properties. Here, we used computational models
   and advanced multi-material 3D printing techniques to rationally design
   and additively manufacture multi-material cellular solids for which the
   elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio could be independently tailored in
   different (anisotropic) directions. The random assignment of a hard
   phase to originally soft cellular structures with an auxetic, zero
   Poisson's ratio, and conventional designs allowed us to cover broad
   regions of the elastic modulus-Poisson's ratio plane. Patterned designs
   of the hard phase were also used and were found to be effective in the
   independent tuning of the elastic properties. Close inspection of the
   strain distributions associated with the different types of material
   distributions suggests that locally deflected patterns of deformation
   flow and strain localizations are the main underlying mechanisms driving
   the above-mentioned adjustments in the mechanical properties. Published

Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{159}},
Pages = {{90-102}},
Month = {{DEC 5}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, a two-step optimization method is developed for designing
   microstructures with desired mechanical properties for 3D printing.
   Particularly, this method takes the numerical advantages of both
   material-based and boundary representation-based approaches to create
   microstructures with desired Poisson's ratios. The optimized
   microstructures possess explicit and smooth boundaries and thus they can
   be 3D printed without tedious post processing. In addition, the method
   can effectively prevent property deviations when interpreting the
   numerical solutions involving stepwise boundaries. Three 3D
   microstructures with different Poisson's ratios are numerically
   optimized and then fabricated using the Selective Laser Sintering
   technique. The practical Poisson's ratios of the samples are measured by
   conducting compression experiments. It will be seen that the tested
   Poisson's ratios match the numerical estimations in a high consistency,
   which demonstrates the advance of our design method for creating
   reliable microstructures for 3D printing and practical use. (C) 2018

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{DEC 4}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic materials have negative Poisson's ratios and so expand rather
   than contract in one or several direction(s) perpendicular to applied
   extensions. The auxetics community has long sought synthetic molecular
   auxetics - non-porous, inherently auxetic materials which are simple to
   fabricate and avoid porosity-related weakening. Here, we report,
   synthetic molecular auxeticity for a non-porous liquid crystal
   elastomer. For strains above similar to 0.8 applied perpendicular to the
   liquid crystal director, the liquid crystal elastomer becomes auxetic
   with the maximum negative Poisson's ratio measured to date being -0.74
   +/- 0.03 - larger than most values seen in naturally occurring molecular
   auxetics. The emergence of auxeticity coincides with the liquid crystal
   elastomer backbone adopting a negative order parameter, Q(B) = -0.41 +/-
   0.01 - further implying negative liquid crystal ordering. The reported
   behaviours consistently agree with theoretical predictions from Warner
   and Terentjev liquid crystal elastomer theory. Our results open the door
   for the design of synthetic molecular auxetics.}},

Abstract = {{The crystal structure, phase transformation, and elastic properties of

   The calculated results first predict the phase transformation from

   high-pressure phase is identified as cubic CuO. With increasing
   pressure, the variations of the elastic constant C-ij, bulk modulus B,
   shear modulus G, Young's modulus E, Poisson's ratio upsilon, the ratio
   of the bulk to shear modulus B/G, and normalized primitive cell volume
   V/V-0 are investigated. Our results show that the pressure has a
   positive effect firstly and then negative effect on the ductility of
   monoclinic CuO, but results in the opposite of hardness. Moreover, we

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Chiral and reentrant metastructures with auxetic deformation abilities
   can serve as the building blocks in many industrial applications because
   of their light weight, high specific strength, energy absorption
   properties. In this paper, we report an innovative tubular-like
   structure by a combined mechanical effect of antichiral and reentrant.
   2D antichiral-reentrant hybrid structures consisting of circular nodes
   and tangentially-connected ligaments are predesigned and fabricated
   using laser cutting technology with high-resolution. The elastic
   properties and auxeticity of the plane structure are analyzed and
   compared based on finite element analysis (FEA) and experimental
   results. For the first time, the antichiral-reentrant hybrid
   intravascular stents with the auxetic feature are proposed and
   parametric models are devised with good geometrical structure
   demonstrated. A series of large-scale stents are manufactured with
   stereolithography apparatus (SLA) additive manufacturing technique, and
   their mechanical behaviors are investigated in both experimental tests
   and FEA. As the selected antichiral-reentrant hybrid stents with
   tailored expansion ability are subjected to radial loading by the
   dilation of the balloon, stents undergo identifiable deformation
   mechanism due to the beam-like ligaments and circular node elements in
   the varied geometrical design, resulting in the distinct stress outcomes
   in plaque. It is also demonstrated that the antichiral-reentrant hybrid
   stents with tunable auxeticity possess robust mechanical properties
   through implantation inside the obstructed lesion.}},

Abstract = {{Computer simulations using Monte Carlo method in the isobaric-isothermal
   ensemble were used to investigate the impact of nanoinclusions in the
   form of very narrow channels in the {[}111]-direction on elastic
   properties of crystals, whose particles interact via Yukawa potential.
   The studies were performed for several selected values of Debye
   screening length ((kappa sigma)(-1)). It has been observed that
   introduction of the nanoinclusions into the system reduces the negative
   value of Poisson's ratio towards {[}110]{[}1 (1) over bar0], maintaining
   practically constant values of Poisson's ratio in the directions {[}100]
   and {[}111]. These studies also show that concentration of particles
   forming the nanoinclusions in the system has a significant effect on the
   value of Poisson's ratio in the {[}110]{[}1 (1) over bar0]-direction. A
   strong (more than fourfold) decrease of Poisson's ratio in this
   direction was observed, from 0.147 (3) (system without inclusions) to
   0.614 (14) (system with nanoinclusions) at kappa sigma = 10 when the
   inclusion particles constituted about 10 percent of all particles. The
   research also showed an increase in the degree of auxeticity in the
   system with increasing concentration of nanoinclusion particles for all
   the screening lengths considered.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Although superior vena cava (SVC) stenosis may be a
   life-threatening complication of haemodialysis (HD) catheters, its
   prevalence and risk factors in HD patients are unknown. Our aim was to
   assess the prevalence and risk factors for SVC stenosis in HD patients
   with a tunnelled cuffed catheter (TCC) and to describe its clinical
   presentation.
   Methods. In this single-centre, retrospective cohort study, all
   in-centre chronic HD patients carrying a TCC (1 January 2008-31 December
   2012) were included (n = 117 patients, 214 TCC, 80 911 catheter-days).
   SVC stenosis was defined as a diameter reduction >50\% on phlebography
   or computed tomography. Imaging was triggered by clinical SVC stenosis
   syndrome or vascular access (VA)-related concerns. We recorded
   demographics, conditions potentially influencing catheter permeability
   (medications, carriage of thoracic devices), number of TCCs, total
   duration of TCC carriage, previous arteriovenous VA and last (in use at
   time of stenosis detection) TCC details (location, diameter and length).
   VAs created while a TCC was still used were also recorded.
   Results. An SVC stenosis was found in 11 patients (9.4\%, 0.14/1000
   catheter-days), which represents almost one-quarter of patients
   undergoing imaging, whatever the cause (11/45). Only two presented with
   clinically obvious SVC stenosis. The number of TCCs per patient was 2.64
   +/- 1.8 in the SVC stenosis group versus 1.75 +/- 0.94 in the negative
   group (P = 0.13). On multivariate analysis (Poisson), diabetes
   \{incidence rate ratio {[}IRR] 4.63 {[}confidence interval (CI)
   1.2-17.8]; P = 0.02\} and total duration of TCC carriage {[}IRR 1.47 (CI
   1.2-1.8) per year; P = 0.001] were associated with SVC stenosis, whereas
   age had a slightly protective effect {[}IRR 0.96 (CI 0.91-1.01); P =
   0.01]. Limitations are the retrospective design, detection and survivor
   bias.
   Conclusion. SVC stenosis is not a rare condition, is mostly asymptomatic
   in the absence of a peripheral VA, is strongly associated with diabetes
   and is promoted by long TCC carriage. Age is slightly protective.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. To investigate the association between illness perceptions
   and disability both cross-sectionally and over 2 years in patients with
   hand OA.
   Methods. Illness perceptions and self-reported disability were assessed
   at baseline and after 2 years in 384 patients with primary hand OA (mean
   age 61 years, 84\% women, n = 312 with follow-up) with the Illness
   Perception Questionnaire - Revised (IPQ-R), Functional Index for Hand
   OA, Australian/Canadian Hand OA Index and HAQ. Risk ratios for high
   disability (highest quartile) at both time points were estimated for
   tertiles of IPQ-R dimensions, using Poisson regression. The mean IPQ
   dimension change difference between patients with and without disability
   progression (change Functional Index for Hand OA >= 1,
   Australian/Canadian Hand OA Index> 1.4, HAQ> 0.22) was estimated with
   linear regression. Analyses were adjusted for age, Doyle index and
   baseline score.
   Results. At baseline, stronger negative illness perceptions were
   associated with high disability. Baseline illness perceptions were also
   associated with high disability after 2 years, although adjustment made
   apparent that these associations were confounded by baseline disability
   status. Most illness perceptions changed over 2 years; understanding
   increased, OA was regarded as more chronic and fewer emotions and
   consequences and less personal and treatment control were experienced.
   The 2 year change in disability was different between patients with and
   without progression for the illness perceptions of more perceived
   consequences, symptoms, treatment control and emotions.
   Conclusion. Illness perceptions seemed to be implicated in disability
   and its progression. Our results suggest that interventions could focus
   on improving baseline disability, potentially using illness perceptions
   to accomplish this goal.}},

Abstract = {{The dynamic behavior of two-dimensional nanostructures is important to
   the future application of nano devices. The vibrational behaviors of
   single-layered hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) are studied by molecular
   dynamics simulation and continuum plate model. The bending stiffness and
   Poisson's ratios of h-BN along zigzag direction and armchair direction
   are calculated. H-BN is softer compared with graphene. The continuum
   plate model can predict the vibration of h-BN with four edge-clamped
   boundary conditions well. The electric fields in different directions
   have obvious influence on the vibration of h-BN. The natural frequency
   of h-BN changes linearly with the electric field intensity along the
   polarization direction. The natural frequency of h-BN decreases with the
   increase of electric field intensity along both positive and negative
   non-polarization direction. While the natural frequency of h-BN
   increases with the increase of electric field intensity along both
   positive and negative transverse electric field. (c) 2018 The Authors.

Abstract = {{Objective: Due to concerns over increasing fluoroquinolone (FQ)
   resistance among gram-negative organisms, our stewardship program
   implemented a preauthorization use policy. The goal of this study was to
   assess the relationship between hospital FQ use and antibiotic
   resistance.
   Design: Retrospective cohort. Setting: Large academic medical center.
   Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of FQ susceptibility of
   hospital isolates for 5 common gram-negative bacteria: Acinetobacter
   spp., Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and
   Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Primary endpoint was the change of FQ
   susceptibility. A Poisson regression model was used to calculate the
   rate of change between the preintervention period (1998-2005) and the
   postimplementation period (2006-2016).
   Results: Large rates of decline of FQ susceptibility began in 1998,
   particularly among P. aeruginosa, Acinetobacter spp., and E. cloacae.
   Our FQ restriction policy improved FQ use from 173 days of therapy (DOT)
   per 1,000 patient days to <60 DOT per 1,000 patient days.
   Fluoroquinolone susceptibility increased for Acinetobacter spp. (rate
   ratio {[}RR], 1.038; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI], 1.005-1.072), E.
   cloacae (RR, 1.028; 95\% CI, 1.013-1.044), and P. aeruginosa (RR, 1.013;
   95\% CI, 1.006-1.020). No significant change in susceptibility was
   detected for K. pneumoniae (RR, 1.002; 95\% CI, 0.996-1.008), and the
   susceptibility for E. coli continued to decline, although the decline
   was not as steep (RR, 0.981; 95\% CI, 0.975-0.987).
   Conclusions: A stewardship-driven FQ restriction program stopped overall
   declining FQ susceptibility rates for all species except E. coli. For 3
   species (ie, Acinetobacter spp, E. cloacae, and P. aeruginosa),
   susceptibility rates improved after implementation, and this improvement
   has been sustained over a 10-year period.}},

Abstract = {{We analyze thousands of receiver-function data recorded by 43 temporary
   seismic stations to reveal the crustal structure beneath the Nuomin
   River volcanoes in Northeast China. The H-k method is applied to measure
   crustal depth and average V-p/V-s ratio. Results show that the crustal
   thickness of this area varies from 32 km to 38 km. The Moho depth is
   relatively larger in the west, decreasing significantly to similar to 32
   km beneath the volcanoes and adjacent areas, then increasing slowly to
   similar to 35 km. The crust is thin in NNW direction, consistent with
   the trend of the volcanic belt centered at Wudalianchi. The region
   nearby Wudalianchi volcanoes has an average V-p/V-s ratio of 1. 80,
   higher than in the west part of the study area, extending towards Nuomin
   River volcanoes and Xiaoguli River volcanoes. Research suggests that the
   delamination of K-rich lithosphere mantle triggered the upwelling of
   magma in Northeast China. Negative correlation between crustal thickness
   and Poisson's ratio is thought to result from simultaneous underplating
   of mafic magmas from upper mantle into crust which has likely modified
   crustal composition during Mesozoic-Cenozoic tectonic extension.}},

Abstract = {{A re-entrant chiral auxetic (RCA) structure is a new structure, which
   comprises three topologies: re-entrant, trichiral and anti-trichiral.
   The aim of this study is to numerically investigate the influences of
   geometrical parameters of a RCA unit cell on the in-plane tensile
   properties. Finite element (FE) models were developed using commercial
   software, ABAQUS 6.11-2, and verified by experimental results. Based on
   the verified FE models, a parametric study was performed to examine the
   effects of geometrical parameters on the stress-strain curve and
   Poisson's ratio of a RCA structure. In order to reduce the variables
   studied, three dimensionless groups of geometrical parameters were
   proposed. Results showed that the RCA structure predominantly deformed
   by bending and stretching of walls as well as rotation of cylinders. The
   RCA structure displayed high stress, low strain and large negative
   Poisson's ratio when it was loaded in the X direction. On the other
   hand, the RCA structure exhibited low stress, high strain and a
   transition from negative to positive Poisson's ratio when it was loaded
   in the Y direction. The geometrical parameters of the RCA structure had
   significant effects on its stress-strain curves and Poisson's ratios.
   The findings of this study provide an insight into the mechanical
   response of the RCA structure under uniaixal tensile loading.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic cellular structures build from inverted tetrapods were
   experimentally tested at high strain rate compression loading for the
   first time. The strain rates up to 10,000 s(-1) were achieved with gas
   powder gun, where the shock deformation mode is predominant. The
   deformation localizes in the deformation front between the impacting
   specimen and the fixed plate due to the inertia effects. This
   deformation mode results in stiffness increases in comparison to the
   quasi-static response. The results from experimental testing were used
   for validation of developed computational models in finite element
   explicit code LS-DYNA. Furthermore, the validated computational models
   were used for critical strain rate analysis, determination of critical
   loading velocities and analysis of deformation modes together with
   analytical constitutive crushing models of cellular structures.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, engineers and researchers reconsider honeycomb sandwich
   structures due to their vast application in industries and aviation
   arenas. In this study, a new honeycomb sandwich material was developed
   and tested. The purpose of the present work is to investigate
   numerically and experimentally with a comparative study on the effects
   of heat transfer on design parameters and geometry for different types
   of exotic honeycomb structures taking in account radiation within the
   cell and conduction in the cell walls. The numerical solution for
   temperature profiles for different types of exotic honeycomb structures
   and solid disk are performed in order to inspect the variation of heat
   transfer. The modeling results show a good agreement with the
   experimental results. The present work demonstrates that the temperature
   profile for reentrant is the highest one compared to splined and
   stiffened which reaches around 10\% at temperature of the front surface
   T-in = 100 degrees C. It was found that the rib length enhances
   significantly heat transfer. Results showed also that stiffened
   honeycomb has a good insulation and metallic honeycomb core structure
   has a good thermal insulation characteristic for the highest
   instantaneous temperature, whereas reentrant honeycomb has a good heat

Abstract = {{Textile structures with negative Poisson's ratio (PR) behavior are
   called auxetic textile structures. They have received increasing
   attention in recent years and have been designed and fabricated through
   spinning, knitting, weaving and non-woven methods. However, auxetic
   textile structures fabricated using braiding method have not been
   reported so far. This paper reported a novel type of auxetic braided
   structure based on a helical structural arrangement. The geometry of the
   structure and its deformation mechanism were first introduced and
   described. Then a special manufacturing process was developed by the
   modification of commonly used tubular braiding technology. Various
   auxetic braids were fabricated with different structural parameters and
   yarns and tested under uniaxial extension conditions. The results showed
   that all manufactured braids exhibited high negative PR behavior and
   maintained this behavior until the fracture of the component wrap yarn.
   Among three structural parameters discussed, namely wrap angle, braiding
   angle and braiding yarn diameter, the wrap angle had more effects on the
   tensile properties of auxetic braided structure than the other two
   parameters. The success of fabricating auxetic braids with commercially
   available yarns in this study provides an alternative way to manufacture
   auxetics from positive PR materials.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives To investigate whether oral health literacy (OHL) impacts
   missing data obtained through self-reporting in oral health
   epidemiological research. Methods Results A cross-sectional study was
   conducted with parents (n = 344) of 4- to 5-year-old children randomly
   selected from public schools within the city of Curitiba, Brazil.
   Parental OHL was measured using the Brazilian version of the Rapid
   Estimate of Adult Literacy in Dentistry (BREALD-30). Parents answered a
   set of questionnaires comprising 88 items concerning sociodemographic
   and economic data, children's access to dental services, oral hygiene
   behaviour, diet and mealtime behaviour. The total number of unanswered
   items (TUI) and the number of unanswered items in each type of question
   (open-ended, dichotomous, multiple choice with up to 4 options and with
   5-9 options) for each participant was compared across different levels
   of OHL (chi-squared, Mann-Whitney, Kruskal-Wallis and Spearman's
   correlation test). Multiple Poisson regression was used to estimate rate
   ratios (RR) of TUI between OHL scores and their respective 95\%
   confidence interval (95\% CI). Approximately one-third of studied
   parents (37\%) exhibited low OHL (BREALD-30 <= 21). The prevalence of
   missing data in at least one item was 85.5\%. Low OHL was associated
   with failing to respond open-ended items (P = 0.003) and multiple-choice
   items with up to 4 (P = 0.003) and between 5 and 9 options (P = 0.030).
   There was a negative correlation between OHL scores and TUI (r = -0.195;
   P < 0.001), as well as with the number of unanswered items in all types
   of questions (P < 0.01), except dichotomous questions. Parents with
   lower OHL were more likely to show higher values of TUI (RR 0.95:
   0.93-0.98), when adjusted by income and education. Conclusions
   Participants with lower OHL were significantly more likely to fail to
   complete research questionnaires. The impact of OHL on missing data was
   greater with more complex types of items.}},

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{88}},
Pages = {{442-452}},

Abstract = {{Stent implantation at a highly curved artery has always been a
   challenge, considering the relatively high chance of in-stent restenosis
   (ISR) caused by severe straightening effect and high strain energy over
   the vessel wall. In this paper, a novel optimization based design method
   was proposed to manipulate the deformation behavior of the common
   ring-and-link stent. By changing the location of the connection point
   between rings and links, traditional ring-and-link structure was
   modified to achiever tunable Poisson's ratio (PR). With the nonuniform
   cellular structure design method proposed in a previous study, PR
   distribution of the stent structure was optimized to achieve the desired
   curvature. As a result, the obtained stent structure with nonuniform PR
   could perfectly fit into the curved artery after expansion, without
   causing any obvious vessel straightening. To validate the proposed
   method, two different vessel models were introduced. Firstly, a short
   vessel with a constant curvature was set as the design objective, and
   both numerical and experimental tests were conducted. Further, a
   patient-specific vessel was applied. Both test results showed that
   optimized stents would cause much smaller vessel straightening.
   Moreover, vessels stented by the optimized structures had much lower
   stress concentration and strain energy. All those properties will
   decrease the possibility of ISR significantly.}},

Abstract = {{Timoshenko beam model is widely exploited in the literature to examine
   the mechanical behavior of stubby beamlike components. Timoshenko beam
   theory is well-known to require the shear correction factor in order to
   recognize the non-uniform shear distribution at a section. While a
   variety of shear correction factors are appeared in the literature so
   far, there is still no consensus on the most appropriate form of the
   shear correction factor. The Saint-Venant's flexure problem is first
   revisited in the frame work of the classical theory of elasticity and a
   highly accurate approximate closed-form solution is presented employing
   the extended Kantorovich method. The resulted approximate solution for
   the elasticity field is then employed to introduce two shear correction
   factors consistent with the Cowper's and energy approaches. The
   mathematical form of the proposed shear correction factors are then
   simplified and compared with the results available in the literature
   over an extended range of Poisson's and aspect ratios. The proposed
   shear correction factors do not exhibit implausible issue of negative
   values and do not result in numerical instabilities too. Based on the
   comprehensive discussion on the shear correction factors, a piecewise
   definition of shear correction factor is introduced for rectangular
   cross-sections having excellent agreement with the numerical results in
   the literature for both shallow and deep cross-sections.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the advance of on-skin sensors over the last decade, a sensor
   that solves simultaneously the critical issues for using in everyday
   life, such as stable performance in various environments, use over a
   long period of time, and repeated use by easy handling, has not yet been
   achieved. Here, we introduce an auxetic hygroscopic sensor that
   simultaneously meets all of the conditions. The auxetic structure with a
   negative Poisson's ratio matches with deformation of the skin in ankles;
   hence, a conformal contact between the sensor and the skin could be
   maintained during repeated movements. Sweat was absorbed in the auxetic
   electrode made of a hydrogel pattern coated with Ag nanowires and
   evaporated quickly; such hygroscopic characteristic led to excellent
   breathability. An electrocardiogram sensor and a haptic device were
   fabricated according to the proposed design for a sensor electrode. The
   sensors provide stable detecting performance in various environments,
   such as exercising, submersion in water, exposure to concentrated salt
   water, and continuous wearing for long time (7 days). Also, the sensors
   could be manually attached repeatedly without degrading the performance.
   This study provides new structural insights for on-skin sensors and
   presents future research directions.}},

Title = {{Tunable auxetic properties in group-IV monochalcogenide monolayers}},

Abstract = {{Negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) is a counterintuitive material elastic
   constant that can lead to many unusual auxetic properties. Here, using
   first-principles calculations, we report tunable negative Poisson's
   ratio in the out-of-plane direction in group-IV monochalcogenide
   monolayers MX (M = Sn, Ge and X = S, Se). SnSe, GeS, and SnS monolayers
   have intrinsic NPR v(zx) ranging from -0.004 to -0.210 in armchair (x)
   tension, whereas GeSe monolayer possesses a much larger NPR v(zy) of
   -0.433 in zigzag (y) tension. Our analysis attributes the NPR effects to
   the relative position of M and X in the puckered structure and the
   smaller bending stiffness of M-X-M bond angle. We further established
   the correlation between electronic structures of materials and their
   crystal structures. It allows us to fine tune GeSe structure via
   electron doping, leading to a reversible and continuous change of v(zy)
   from -0.821 up to 0.895. We also demonstrate the concept of strain
   engineering GeSe monolayer to switch its Poisson's ratio v(zx) between
   two different values: 0.583 and -0.433. Our in-depth study provides not
   only fundamental knowledge but also practical routes for designing 2D
   smart materials with tunable negative Poisson's ratio, which are
   desirable for smart devices at small scale.}},

Title = {{Axisymmetric auxetics}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{204}},
Pages = {{438-444}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic materials expand/contract transversely while
   tensioned/compressed in the longitudinal direction, thus they possess a
   negative Poisson's ratio. According to the theory of elasticity, their
   existence in isotropic forms is theoretically possible, however, they
   are found in nature only in anisotropic forms. Auxetics are expected to
   possess enhanced relative static and dynamic properties, thus, several
   auxetic composites have been proposed and manufactured to mimic such
   behavior. This study shows the development of axisymmetric auxetics, a
   novel class of negative Poisson's ratio composites obtained by the
   revolution of reentrant lattices in turn of an axis. It is shown by
   experimental testing and FEA that an auxetic circumferential deformation
   mechanism increases the overall Poisson's ratio and promotes an
   elevation of the Specific Young's modulus relative to regular
   honeycombs. Furthermore, the developed composites are compared in terms
   of Specific Young's modulus and densities to commercial foams and other
   non-stochastic auxetics. It is concluded that they present enhanced
   specific properties for relative densities in the range of 0.28-0.35 and
   may be a promising route for future applications.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this paper is to explore a novel bumper system consisting of

   using the first-principles calculations based on the density functional

   of hexagonal boron phosphide/blue phosphorus(h-BP/BlueP)
   heterostructure. The stacking configurations induced electronic
   structures, and the mechanical flexibility of h-BP/BlueP heterostructure
   was studied systematically. Their negative formation energy and binding
   energy as well as excellent lattice match guarantee structural
   stability. The calculated band structure shows that largest band gap is
   AB stacking pattern with a direct band gap of 1.07 eV. Additionally, the
   AB pattern is the most stable one. The biggest band gap can be observed
   (such as delta = 3\%). Compared with stretch, the energy gap is more
   sensitive under compression. The ultimate strains of h-BP/BlueP
   heterostructure are 14\% in the AB pattern. Furthermore, the different
   strains of h-BP/BlueP heterostructure have been studied; we found that

Abstract = {{Chiral cellular structures inspired by the microstructure of

   revealed that the anti-chiral shell and chiral-axial shell can achieve

   performance. Given the distinction in the geometrical configuration of

Abstract = {{Metal-insulator transition in zigzag graphene nanoribbon has been
   studied using random matrix theory. By employing inverse participation
   ratio and spectral analysis, our results show that metal-insulator
   transition occurs in the presence of a random distribution of
   substitutional nitrogen atoms. We have observed quantum chaotic Wigner
   energy levelstatistics distribution for low nitrogen concentration. At
   sufficiently high doping, system is at the begging of transition from
   Wigner to Poisson distribution. For doped graphene, our calculations
   indicate that this transition becomes fast by applying transverse
   electric field. Additionally, a threshold value for the transverse
   electric field is reported. For this threshold value, the change of the
   conductivity is drastically and Poisson level-spacing sets in. More
   interestingly, a negative differential resistance and quasi-ohmic
   behavior can be found for various values of impurity and electric field,
   such that for these values quantum chaotic predicts Wigner distribution.}},

Title = {{An analytical model for pore volume compressibility of reservoir rock}},
Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{232}},
Pages = {{543-549}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{The pore volume compressibility of reservoir rock is usually measured by
   volume method and the relation between compressibility and porosity
   follows the Hall plot. However, the volume method yields a high pore
   volume compressibility value and a negative correlation between
   compressibility and porosity. Both results illustrate that
   unconventional reservoirs with low porosity has higher elastic energy
   than conventional reservoirs with high porosity, which disagrees with
   the production practice.
   In this paper, volume method of pore volume compressibility is
   investigated and problems of Hall plot are analyzed. Then a novel
   analytical model on pore volume compressibility of reservoir rock is
   derived to resolve these problems. The reason on the improper results
   using volume method is discussed. The calculated results from our new
   model are validated by the experimental tests using mercury immersion
   method for pore volume compressibility measurement. The effects of
   compressibility on original oil in place and the flow radius are
   analyzed.
   The analytical model shows that pore volume compressibility of reservoir
   rock is related not only to porosity but also to elastic modulus and
   Poisson's ratio. There is a positive correlation between pore volume
   compressibility and porosity. The compressibility value of our model is
   much lower than that measured using volume method. The reason of the
   improper results from volume method is the micro interstice in core
   holder. Without the effects of micro interstice (mercury immersion
   method or loading and unloading stress treatment before the test), the
   measured pore volume compressibility shows a relatively low value and a
   positive correlation between pore compressibility and porosity, which
   validate the results of our analytical model. The pore volume
   compressibility calculated by volume method and Hall plot will
   overestimate the elastic energy of the reservoir and bring substantial
   errors in evaluation of original oil in place and the flow radius.}},

Title = {{Use of Geographically Weighted Poisson Regression to examine the effect
   of distance on Tuberculosis incidence: A case study in Nam Dinh, Vietnam}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 12}},
Abstract = {{Objectives
   This study aimed to examine the potential of combining routine
   tuberculosis (TB) surveillance and demographic and socioeconomic
   variables into the Geographic Information System (GIS) to describe the
   geographical distribution of TB notified incidence in relation to
   distances to health services as well as local demographic and
   socioeconomic factors, including population density, urban/rural status,
   and household poverty rates in Nam Dinh, Vietnam. It also aimed to
   compare the conventional Generalized Linear Models (GLM) Poisson
   regression model and Geographically Weighted Poisson Regression (GWPR)
   models in order to determine the best fitting model that can be used to
   investigate the relationship between TB notified incidence and distances
   and the social risk factors.
   Methods
   The data of new and relapse patients with all forms of TB aged >= 15
   years residing in Nam Dinh (Vietnam) from 2012 to 2015 were collected
   from the Administration of Medical Services' (Ministry of Health of
   Vietnam) TB surveillance database. Data on the population and household
   poverty rates from 2012 to 2015 were gathered from the Nam Dinh
   Statistical Office. Distances between communes and the nearest TB
   diagnostic facilities in districts were computed. The TB notified
   incidence per 100,000 population was denoted by indirect age and sex
   standardized incidence ratio. GLM Poisson regression and GWPR were
   performed to assess the relationship between distance and TB incidence.
   Results
   The average notified TB incidence level measured from 2012 to 2015 is 82
   per 100,000 population (range: 79-84/100,000). The distance to the
   nearest TB diagnosis presents a negative effect on TB notified
   incidence. By capturing spatial heterogeneity, the GWPR may be better at
   fitting data (corrected Aikake information criterion {[}AICc] = 245.71,
   residual deviance = 221.12) than the traditional GLM (AICc = 251.53,
   residual deviance = 241.21)
   Conclusions
   GIS technologies benefit TB surveillance system. Distances should be
   considered when planning methods of improving access for those who live
   far from TB diagnostic services, thereby improving TB detection.
   Additional studies must confirm the association between geographic
   distance and TB case detection and must explore other factors that may
   affect TB notified incidence.}},

Abstract = {{Motivated by the challenges in the harnessing of energy and the
   continuing trend of miniaturizing devices, an exhaustive evaluation of
   the electronic, mechanical and piezoelectric properties of surface
   modified penta-graphene (PG), including fluorinated PG (F-PG-F),
   hydrofluorinated PG (H-PG-F) and hydrogenated PG (H-PG-H), was carried
   out via a first-principles approach based on density functional theory.
   We first predicted the H-PG-F system and calculated its phonon
   dispersion and magnetic properties. All three systems were found to
   exhibit an e(31) piezoelectric effect, and the e(31) (96.88 pC m(-1))
   effect of H-PG-F was found to be much greater than that of the other two
   systems. So, it could be concluded that hydrofluorination can
   significantly enhance the piezoelectric properties of PG. The binding
   energy and formation energy of the H-PG-F system were found to be the
   lowest among the three surface modified PG systems, showing that the
   H-PG-F system is the most energetically favorable state. The e(31)
   piezoelectricity can be potentially engineered into a PG monolayer by
   surface modification, providing an avenue for monolithic integration of
   electronic and electromechanical devices with a PG monolayer for use in
   mechanical stress-sensors, nano-sized actuators and energy harvesting
   systems. The H-PG-F system stands out in terms of its combination of a
   larger piezoelectric coefficient (e(31) = 96.88 pC m(-1)), negative
   Poisson's ratio and low formation energy (-3.37 eV) and is recommended
   for experimental exploration.}},

Title = {{Mechanics of disordered auxetic metamaterials}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL B}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{91}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 5}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic materials are of great engineering interest not only because of
   their fascinating negative Poisson's ratio, but also due to the
   possibility to increase by design the toughness and indentation
   resistance. The general understanding of auxetic materials comes often
   from ordered or periodic structures, while auxetic materials used in
   applications are typically strongly disordered. Yet, the effect of
   disorder in auxetics has rarely been investigated. Here, we provide a
   systematic theoretical and experimental study of the effect of disorder
   on the mechanical properties of a paradigmatic two-dimensional auxetic
   lattice with a re-entrant hexagonal geometry. We show that disorder has
   a marginal effect on the Poisson's ratio until the point when the
   lattice topology becomes altered, and in all cases examined disorder
   preserves the auxetic characteristics. Depending on the direction of
   loading applied to these disordered auxetic lattices, either brittle or
   ductile failure is observed. It is found that brittle failure is
   associated with a disorder-dependent tensile strength, whereas in
   ductile failure disorder does not affect strength. Our work thus
   provides general guidelines to design and optimize elasticity and
   strength of disordered auxetic metamaterials.}},

   Metastable Shape Memory}},
Journal = {{ADVANCED ENGINEERING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Hierarchically structuring materials open the door to a wide range of
   unexpected and uniquely designed properties. This work presents a novel
   mechanical metamaterial unit cell with strain-dependent solid-solid
   phase changes resultant from hierarchically structured ``mechanisms{''}
   built into an auxetic unit cell, and further presents a realization of
   this kind. The interaction of auxetic structure and mechanism allows
   stable or metastable elastic energy states to be reached as a result of
   mechanical deformation. The result is a principally elastic analog to a
   shape memory material with a functional dependency on its negative
   Poisson's ratio. Prototypes are additively manufactured using direct
   laser writing, and are subsequently subjected to uniaxial compression
   with a customized micromechanical test set up. Experimental results
   depict reversible states initially triggered by deformation; the unit
   cell is a building block for a programmable material with a nonlinear
   ``if horizontal ellipsis then horizontal ellipsis `` relationship.
   Implementing interior mechanisms as a hierarchical level unlocks new
   directions for mechanical metamaterials research, and the authors see
   potential impacts or applications in multi-scale modeling, medicine,
   micro-actuation and -gripping, programmable matter/materials.}},

Abstract = {{Men who have sex with men (MSM) commonly use inhaled nitrites, or
   poppers, though their use is a risk factor HIV seroconversion.
   Pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, is effective for HIV prevention, but
   is not widely used, and little is known regarding PrEP use and
   acceptability among MSM who use inhaled nitrites. We surveyed 580 MSM in
   Paris, France in 2016 about popper use, sexual behaviors including
   condomless anal intercourse (CAI), serosorting, and sexual positioning,
   PrEP use, PrEP candidacy, and interest in alternate PrEP delivery
   modalities. We included 444 HIV negative participants for the current
   study. 46.2\% reported popper use in the prior 3months. Using
   multivariate adjusted logistic regression, we found that popper users
   were more likely than non-users to consider themselves candidates for
   PrEP {[}adjusted relative risk ratio (aRRR)=2.73; 95\% CI 1.54-4.83],
   but they were not more likely to be current (aRRR=1.54; 95\% CI
   0.71-3.33) or past (aRRR=1.37; 95\% CI 0.44-4.28) PrEP users. Mediation
   analyses indicated that increased CAI and serosorting partly explained
   the relationship between popper use and PrEP candidacy. There was
   considerable interest in alternate proposed PrEP delivery modalities,
   particularly long-acting injectable PrEP {[}adjusted risk ratio
   (aRR)=1.43; 95\% CI 1.15-1.79]. ResumenLos hombres que tienen relaciones
   sexuales con hombres (HSH) usan con frequencia los nitritos inhalados,
   tambien conocidos poppers, aunque su uso es un factor de riesgo para la
   seroconversion del virus de inmunodeficiencia humana (VIH). La
   profliaxis prexposicion o PrEP es eficaz para la prevencion del VIH,
   pero no se utiliza ampliamente, y poco se sabe en cuanto al uso y la
   aceptabilidad de PrEP entre los HSH que usan los nitritos inhalados.
   Hicimos una encuesta de 580 HSH en Paris, Francia en cuanto a su uso de
   los poppers, su comportamiento sexual (incluyendo el sexo anal sin
   condones {[}CAI, por sus siglas en ingles, condomless anal intercourse],
   el serosorting {[}tener sexo con personas con el mismo estatus de VIH],
   y el rol sexual {[}active o pasivo]), el uso de PrEP, su candidatura
   percibida para PrEP, y su interes en modalidades alternativas para la
   administracion de PrEP. Incluimos 444 individuos HIV-negativos para este
   studio. 46,2\% indicaron el uso de poppers durante los 3 meses antes de
   la encuesta. Usando la regresion logistica ajustada, descubrimos que los
   HSH que usaban los poppers se consideraban como candidatos para PrEP con
   mas frecuencia que los que no usaban los poppers (indice de riesgo
   relativo ajustado (aRRR, por sus siglas en ingles, adjusted relative
   risk ratio)=2.73; 95\% interval de confianza (CI, por sus siglas en
   ingles, confidence interval) = 1.54-4.83), pero no usaban el PrEP ahora
   (aRRR=1.54; 95\% CI=0.71-3.33) o en el pasado (aRRR=1.37; 95\%
   CI=0.44-4.28) con mas frecuencia que los que no usaban los poppers.
   Analisis de mediacion indicaron que niveles mas altos de CAI y
   serosorting explicaron una parte de la relacion entre el uso de poppers
   y la candidatura percibida para PrEP. Tambien habia interes considerable
   en otras modalidades para la administracion de PrEP, especialmente PrEP
   inyectable de accion prolongada (indice de riesgo ajustado (aRR, por sus
   siglas en ingles, adjusted relative risk)=1.43; 95\% CI=1.15-1.79).}},

Abstract = {{The mechanical behavior of the uranyl carbonate mineral, rutherfordine,
   UO2CO3, was studied by means of theoretical solid-state methods based in
   Density Functional Theory using plane waves and pseudopotentials. The
   results of the computations reported in this work show that this mineral
   exhibits the important negative Poisson ratio (NPR) phenomenon. In order
   to show that this feature is not an artifact associated to the
   theoretical treatment employed, additional calculations were carried out
   using very large calculation parameters. These calculations improved the
   mechanical description of this mineral and confirmed its auxeticity,
   i.e., it shows NPR values. Rutherfordine is a highly anisotropic
   material showing a maximum value of the NPR of the order of -0.3 +/- 0.1
   for applied stresses directed along the X-axis, the transverse direction
   being the Y-axis perpendicular to the structural sheets in rutherfordine
   structure. The underlying reason for this observation is that under the
   effect of applied positive pressures, the interlayer space between the
   sheets of rutherfordine vary in the opposite way to the expected
   behavior; that is, it decreases instead of increasing.}},

Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},

Abstract = {{Chiral-type cells consisting of rigid nodes and rotatable ligaments
   provide an opportunity to develop lightweight engineering structures
   with unique mechanical performances. For a 2D or 3D chiral-type cellular
   structure system with a periodic arrangement of chiral cells, a distinct
   rotational response will present because of the asymmetrical and
   geometrical configuration. In this article, a tetra-chiral cylindrical
   shell is proposed on the basis of natural plant architecture. This shell
   exhibits a reversible bi-directional twisting deformation in the axial
   compression and tension processes. A theoretical model is proposed via
   the geometrical parameters of cells to describe the relationship between
   twist angle and axial displacement. Two categories of tetra-chiral
   cylindrical shell specimens are fabricated utilizing additive
   manufacturing technique involving the application of nylon and AlSi10Mg
   materials. Uniaxial compressive tests and finite element simulation are
   conducted to reveal the twist deformation mechanism. Results verify that
   the twist characteristics of the chiral-type shell, which are adjustable
   in terms of the rotational direction and angle, are only related to the
   distribution and geometrical sizes of ligaments. The innovative
   chiral-type cylindrical shell provide a new design strategy which can be
   used in engineering applications as compress- or stretch-twist coupled
   smart actuators, biomechanical devices, and micro sensors.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials and structures as a class of metamaterials have been
   extensively studied and evaluated for many applications. This paper
   focuses on the fabrication and vibration damping of the carbon fiber
   composite auxetic double-arrow corrugated sandwich panels (DACSPs). The
   negative Poisson's ratio effects of the composite auxetic DACSPs are
   analytically studied based on energy method. 3D finite element (FE)
   models combined with Modal Strain Energy (MSE) approach are developed to
   investigate their vibration and damping characteristics. To validate the
   numerical models in the present study, the composite auxetic DACSPs and
   such structures inserted with high damping layer are designed and
   manufactured. Modal vibration and three-point bending tests are
   conducted to investigate their vibration damping and bending responses.
   The results show that the 3D FE models combined with MSE approach are
   valid to predict the modal properties of the composite auxetic DACSPs.
   The influence of the different inclined corrugated angles on the natural
   frequencies and damping loss factors are plotted and discussed.
   Meanwhile, the effect of Poisson's ratio on the nominal Young's modulus,
   natural frequencies and damping loss factors of the composite auxetic
   DACSPs are also revealed. It is observed from the results that it is
   possible to obtain both increased stiffness and high damping capacity of
   such composite auxetic DACSPs by optimizing the inclined corrugated
   angles and inserting suitable damping layers.}},

Abstract = {{Shape memory polymers, as a kind of smart materials, play an important
   role in more and more fields, such as aerospace, biomedicine and
   intelligent clothing field and so on. Comparing with traditional
   materials, negative Poisson's ratio foam has excellent mechanical
   properties, such as double curvature, light weight, high shear
   resistance, auxetic etc., and it has a great potential application in
   the field of aerospace. Therefore, in this project, shape memory
   composite foam was fabricated based on the commercial soft polyurethane
   foam material as matrix and shape memory epoxy resin as functional
   phase. Negative Poisson's ratio of foam was fabricated based on its
   shape memory feature through a process of triaxial compression with heat
   treatment. Microstructure deformation was characterized after the
   transformation of auxetic foam. By adjusting the processing parameters,
   the auxetic shape memory foam with different ``re-entrant{''} structure
   was obtained. Such fabricated shape memory composite foams display
   variable stiffness with auxetic behavior. Effective compressive and
   tensile modulus was obtained by compression and tension tests. The
   effect of processing parameters on foam Poisson's ratio was analyzed,
   which provided certain guiding significance for the further shape memory
   foam preparation.}},

Abstract = {{In the current work we analyze the bulk and normal to shear properties
   of a wide range of two-dimensional artificial materials under small
   deformations. To that scope, we employ reentrant, chiral, triangular and
   rectangular-shaped based unit-cell arrangements. We characterize their
   mechanical response, using a homogenization analysis method. We identify
   inner material architectures of high and low relative resistance to
   pressure and to shear loads. We classify the metastructures' mechanical
   behavior with respect to the one expected for common isotropic
   engineering materials. We observe considerable differences for most of
   the analyzed structures for which we provide insights making use of
   symmetry analysis notions. What is more, we identify lightweight inner
   material designs for certain bulk and normal to shear behaviors to be
   obtained, while we unravel the role of the Poisson's ratio value on the
   retrieved effective attributes. We quantify the impact of alterations in
   the metamaterials' inner design parameters, such as in the slenderness
   ratio of its inner elements, reporting unit-cell designs that yield
   macroscopic relative mechanical properties (bulk and normal to shear
   attributes) that are insensitive to inner element slenderness changes.}},

Abstract = {{The two-component complex yarn with helical wrapping structure has been
   reported with auxetic behavior and unique performance, however, the
   residual torque could lead to the slippage of the wrap component from
   the core in the natural state and poor stability and applicability.
   Therefore, this paper aims to introduce a novel interlaced-helical
   wrapping yarn with negative Poisson's ratio, stable structure,
   practicability and continuous preparation. The differences in geometry
   and auxetic behavior between helical structure and interlaced-helical
   structure were presented and analyzed. Both the structure stability and
   auxetic effect of the interlaced-helical complex yarn have advantages
   over the helical wrap yarn with same materials and initial wrap angle.
   It can be shown that the interlaced-helical wrap yarns with lower
   initial wrap angle and bigger tensile modulus of the stiff yarns will
   produce better auxetic effect. Besides, the deformation mechanism and
   the manufacturing process were described in detail. Several kinds of
   yarns have been fabricated to discuss the effect of initial wrap angle
   and tensile modulus on the Poisson's ratio of the structure. The maximum
   value of Poisson's ratio for the yarns manufactured was -2.8. It is also
   expected that auxetic yarns with novel braided structure can prompt the
   applications of auxetic textiles.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials expand in at least one dimension, when stretched
   longitudinally i.e. they have negative Poisson's ratio. Development of
   2D woven auxetic fabrics (AF) is a new approach to develop mechanically
   stable auxetic textile structures. However, the mechanical response of
   such emerging structure is still not studied in detail yet, therefore
   different mechanical properties of 2D woven AF are compared with
   conventional non-auxetic fabric (NAF). AF was developed by orienting
   yarns in auxetic honey-comb (AHC) geometry and auxeticity is induced due
   to such orientation of yarns. AF was developed using conventional
   (non-auxetic) materials; cotton yarn and elastane cotton yarn in warp
   and weft dimension respectively, using air jet loom. Structure and
   auxeticity of AF were analyzed using a digital microscope and its
   different mechanical properties (tensile strength, tear strength,
   bursting strength, cut resistance, and puncture resistance) were
   studied. AF showed superior mechanical properties with a lower initial
   modulus, which is beneficial for different protective textiles
   applications like cut resistance gloves, blast resistant curtains, and
   puncture tolerant elastomeric composites.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This paper deals with the auxetic deformation behavior of periodically
   perforated aluminum sheets and their application for lightweight design.
   If commercially available metal sheets are provided with perforations,
   this can significantly change the mechanical properties of the sheets.
   For example, with certain perforation patterns, it is possible to
   achieve a negative Poisson's ratio in the sheet plane. Such material
   behavior is called auxetic. Macroscopic auxetic behavior can be
   explained by mechanisms that are based on the geometry of the
   perforation. Sheets are made of an isotropic aluminum alloy, provided
   with periodic perforation patterns and are mechanically characterized in
   tensile tests. The investigations focus on an exemplarily pattern with
   rectangular perforations leading to the auxetic behavior of the sheet.
   By means of passive thermography, highly stressed areas of the samples
   can be identified in situ and nondestructively during tests. The
   experimental results are verified in numerical simulations. The insights
   gained will help to better understand the mechanisms underlying the
   mechanical behavior of auxetically perforated sheet metal. Based on
   this, concepts for possible applications of auxetically perforated
   sheets in lightweight design can be developed for the future.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of the numerical simulation of negative
   corona discharge in SF6 at 0.4 Mpa for a point-plane configuration. A 2D
   axisymmetric model considering three charged species has been
   investigated with an applied voltage equal to -25 kV. Three
   drift-diffusion equations coupled with Poisson's equation were solved
   simultaneously to obtain the temporal and spatial properties of Trichel
   pulses. The distributions of charged species at different instants of
   time and the time-dependent total number of charged species have been
   determined. The characteristics of current pulses with voltages varying
   from -24 kV to -27 kV were compared and it has been found that the
   characteristics of the current magnitude and frequency are similar to
   those in air. The effects of the model coefficients-the ionization
   coefficient, the attachment coefficient, the mobility of charged species
   and the secondary emission coefficient-on the characteristics of current
   pulses have also been studied to investigate the sensitivities of the
   pulse parameters to these coefficients.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction and objectives: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
   (COPD) is a major public health problem. The aim of this study was to
   ascertain the prevalence of COPD and whether such prevalence was
   positively or negatively associated with COPD admissions, using all the
   data of a regional health care system.
   Materials and methods: We designed a descriptive cross-sectional study
   which included all subjects aged over 45 years, diagnosed with COPD in
   primary care in 2013. We also calculated the number of such patients who
   had a record of hospital admissions due to this disease. COPD prevalence
   and incidence of admissions were calculated. Poisson regression models
   were then used to analyse the association between cases with diagnosis
   of COPD and admissions due to COPD, by sex, adjusting for
   socio-demographic variables and distance to hospital. Sensitivity
   subanalyses were performed by reference to the respective municipal
   rurality indices.
   Results: Median municipal prevalence of COPD was 5.29\% in men and
   2.19\% in women. Among patients with COPD, 28.22\% of men and 16.00\% of
   women had at least one hospital admission. The relative risk of
   admission per unit of the standardised prevalence ratio was 0.37 (95\%
   CI 0.34-0.41) for men and 0.39 (95\% CI 0.34-0.45) for women.
   Conclusions: There is a significant negative association between COPD
   prevalence and hospital admissions due to this disease. The proportion
   of admissions is lower in municipalities lying furthest from hospitals.
   There is considerable municipal variability in terms of COPD prevalence
   and proportion of admissions. In-depth attention should be given to
   disease-management training programmes. (C) 2018 Sociedade Portuguesa de

Abstract = {{Objectives The objective of this study was to compare the prevalence of
   polydrug use, use of drugs associated with chemsex, specific drug use,
   and HIV-related behaviours, between two time periods, using two groups
   of HIV-negative men who have sex with men (MSM) attending the same
   sexual health clinics in London and Brighton, in two consecutive periods
   of time from 2013 to 2016.
   Methods Data from MSM in the cross-sectional Attitudes to and
   Understanding Risk of Acquisition of HIV (AURAH) study (June 2013 to
   September 2014) were compared with baseline data from different MSM in
   the prospective cohort study Attitudes to and Understanding Risk of
   Acquisition of HIV over Time (AURAH2) (November 2014 to April 2016).
   Prevalence of polydrug use, drug use associated with chemsex and
   specific drug use, and 10 measures of HIV-related behaviours including
   condomless sex, post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) use, pre-exposure
   prophylaxis (PrEP) use, and HIV testing, were compared. Prevalence
   ratios (PRs) for the association of the study (time period) with drug
   use and HIV-related behaviour measures were estimated using modified
   Poisson regression analysis, unadjusted and adjusted for
   sociodemographic factors.
   Results In total, 991 MSM were included from AURAH and 1031 MSM from
   AURAH2. After adjustment for sociodemographic factors, use of drugs
   associated with chemsex had increased (adjusted PR (aPR) 1.30, 95\% CI
   1.11 to 1.53) and there were prominent increases in specific drug use;
   in particular, mephedrone (aPR 1.32, 95\% CI 1.10 to
   1.57),gamma-hydroxybutyric/gamma-butryolactone (aPR 1.47, 95\% CI 1.15
   to 1.87) and methamphetamine (aPR 1.42, 95\% CI 1.01 to 2.01). Use of
   ketamine had decreased (aPR 0.54, 95\% CI 0.38 to 0.78). Certain
   measures of HIV-related behaviours had also increased, most notably PEP
   use (aPR 1.50, 95\% CI 1.21 to 1.88) and number of self-reported
   bacterial STI diagnoses (aPR 1.24, 95\% CI 1.08 to 1.43).
   Conclusions There have been significant increases in drug use associated
   with chemsex and some measures of HIV-related behaviours among
   HIV-negative MSM in the last few years. Changing patterns of drug use
   and associated behaviours should be monitored to enable sexual health
   services to plan for the increasingly complex needs of some clients.}},

Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2018}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic perforated mechanical metamaterials (APMMs) with artificially
   designed architectures have attracted growing attention in recent years
   due to the relatively simple fabrication process and their unusual
   physical properties for broad ranges of potential applications. We
   present a new topological configuration of APMMs with low porosity that
   simultaneously exhibits the properties of negative Poisson's ratio and
   band gaps. The finite element method is employed to investigate the
   effects of the parameters of void porosity, aspect ratio and chord
   length on the Poisson's ratio and the range of band gaps. Our results
   demonstrate that a large range of Poisson's ratio can be achieved with
   low porosity, and interestingly, the Poisson's ratio and the frequency
   of lower band gap edge are decreased monotonically as the chord length
   increases. Furthermore, the comparison of stress-strain behaviors,
   tensile strength, and acoustic transmission characteristics between the
   proposed and the classical configurations of low porosity APMMs is
   given. The results show that the new configuration owns special
   underlying tensile deformation pattern and long ligament, which

Abstract = {{Using a continuum-based design sensitivity analysis (DSA) method, a
   configuration design optimization method is developed for curved
   Kirchhoff beams with shape memory polymers (SMP), from which we
   systematically synthesize lattice structures achieving target negative
   Poisson's ratio. A SMP phenomenological constitutive model for small
   strains is utilized. A Jaumann strain, based on the geometrically exact
   beam theory, is additively decomposed into elastic, stored, and thermal
   parts. Non-homogeneous displacement boundary conditions are employed to
   impose mechanical loadings. At each equilibrium configuration, an
   additional nonlinear analysis is performed to calculate the Poisson's
   ratio and its design sensitivity of the SMP material. The design
   objectives are twofold: for purely elastic materials, lattice structures
   are designed to achieve prescribed Poisson's ratios under finite
   compressive deformations. Also, SMP-based lattice structures are
   synthesized to possess target Poisson's ratios in specified temperature
   ranges. The analytical design sensitivity of the Poisson's ratio is
   verified through comparison with finite difference sensitivity. Several
   configuration design optimization examples are demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a novel extrusion process for manufacturing
   helical auxetic yarn (HAY). A range of semi-coextruded HAYs have been
   manufactured in a cost-effective, consistent and readily usable form.
   The semi-coextruded HAYs were compared to the conventional spun yarns in
   terms of tensile properties and auxetic behavior. The results show the
   presence of the auxetic effect in newly fabricated semi-coextruded HAYs.
   Similar to the traditional spun HAYs, the new HAYs are sensitive to
   parameters such as the initial wrap angle, the core/wrap diameter ratio
   and component moduli. Importantly, a few new manufacturing parameters
   have been identified for tailoring the auxetic behavior of the
   semi-coextruded HAYs. The semi-coextruded HAYs are auxetic when an
   instantaneous true Poisson's ratio analysis method is applied. The
   semi-coextruded HAYs give a larger maximum negative Poisson's ratio than
   the conventional HAYs due to the advantages of the pre-formed helical
   wrap structure.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction Oral health affects the general health of people with Down
   syndrome (DS), with repercussions on their ability to chew and to
   communicate. Objective Methods To evaluate the influence of
   sociodemographic characteristics and clinical indicators on the
   perceptions of parents/caregivers regarding the oral health of
   individuals with DS. Parents/caregivers completed a questionnaire
   containing sociodemographic information and answered the 20 questions of
   the Brazilian version of the Oral Health Scale for People with DS.
   Intra-oral clinical exam of children/adolescents was performed to assess
   dental caries, periodontal disease, and malocclusion. Descriptive
   statistics, bivariate analyses, and Poisson regression model analyses
   were carried out. Results Conclusion In this study, 55.1\% of the
   parents/caregivers showed a positive perception regarding the oral
   health of their children/adolescents. Parents/caregivers of individuals
   between 4 and 9 years old (Prevalence Ratio (PR) = 1.13; Confidence
   Interval (CI), 1.04 - 1.23; p = 0.003) and parents/caregivers of those
   with definite malocclusion (PR = 1.14; CI, 1.00 - 1.31; p = 0.047) had a
   higher prevalence of reporting a more negative perception of their
   children's/adolescents' oral health. DS individuals' age and the
   severity of malocclusion were indicators of a more negative perception
   of parents/caregivers regarding their sons'/daughters' oral health.}},

Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{Electrokinetic peristaltic multi-layered transport is considered in a
   micro-channel under the action of an axial electrical field. Three
   different layers i.e. the core layer, intermediate layer and peripheral
   layer are simulated with three different viscosities for each fluid
   layer. The unsteady two-dimensional conservation equations for mass and
   momentum with electrokinetic body forces, are transformed from the wave
   frame to the laboratory frame and the electrical field terms are
   rendered into electrical potential terms via the Poisson-Boltzmann
   equation, Debye length approximation and ionic Nernst-Planck equation.
   The dimensionless emerging linearized electrokinetic boundary value
   problem is solved using integral methods. Closed-form expressions are
   derived for stream functions in the core, intermediate and peripheral
   layers. Expressions are also derived for the core-intermediate interface
   shape and the intermediate-peripheral interface shape. Maximum pressures
   are also computed. To study bolus migration, the range of the trapping
   limit is also determined in the peripheral layer. It is found that in
   the core layer larger boluses are computed in the case of lower
   intermediate layer viscosity relative to peripheral layer viscosity
   although the number of boluses is greater when the intermediate layer
   viscosity exceeds the peripheral layer viscosity. Furthermore, in the
   intermediate layer, stronger concentration of streamlines is computed in
   the lower half space with positive Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity. Also
   negative Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity reduces the core layer (H-1)
   interface shape whereas it enhances the peripheral layer (H) and
   intermediate layer (H-2) shapes. At lower values of volume flow rate
   ratio, hydromechanical efficiency is maximum for positive
   Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity whether intermediate layer viscosity is
   less or greater than peripheral layer viscosity. Finally, greater with
   greater peristaltic wave amplitude and also for positive
   Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity there is an increase in time-averaged
   flow rate, whether intermediate layer viscosity is less or greater than
   peripheral layer viscosity. The analysis is relevant to electro-kinetic
   hemodynamics and bio-micro-fluidics. (C) 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS. All

Abstract = {{First-principles method was performed to investigate the stabilities,
   electronic structures and elastic properties of L1(2)-Al-3(Sc1-xZrx)

   consistent with previous literature. The obtained negative values of
   both formation and mixing enthalpies suggested all the
   L1(2)Al(3)(Sc1-xZrx) possessed structural stabilities. As Zr atoms
   replaced for Sc in L1(2)-Al-3(Sc1-xZrx) structure, the interactions
   between Zr-d state as well as Al-p and (Sc, Zr)-d were promoted, and not
   only the covalent bonding strength was enhanced, but also its bonding
   characteristics on (100) and (110) planes tended to be consistent. The
   bulk modulus, shear modulus, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio and
   elastic anisotropy of these phases were also derived from the calculated
   elastic constants. It is found that for L1(2)-Al-3(Sc1-xZrx) that had
   high substitution of Zr atoms, the volume changing resistance was
   promoted with the resistance to reversible deformations being subdued.
   Besides, the ductility was enhanced for the increase of B/G ratio and

Abstract = {{Low coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) lattices occupy a unique area
   of property space. With such a system, it is possible to achieve
   relatively high stiffness, with opportunities to combine low thermal
   expansion and with a range of advantageous properties. Possibilities
   include combinations that are not rivaled by any bulk material, e.g.,
   low CTE and high melting temperature, and low CTE with low conductivity.
   One design in particular, the UCSB Lattice, has biaxial stiffness very
   near theoretical upper bounds when the joints are pinned. Bonded
   lattices are found to inherit the near optimal performance of the parent
   pin-jointed design. Despite near optimal performance, however,
   stiffnesses and strengths are limited to a few percent of the relative
   property of the constituents. The local deformations necessary to
   accommodate low net CTE are similar to those of auxetic lattices, with
   similar behavior, having a low, zero, or negative tunable Poisson's
   ratio. An investigative framework, including experiments, finite
   element, and analytical formulas, is used to construct these
   assessments.}},

Title = {{Odds ratios from logistic, geometric, Poisson, and negative binomial
   regression models}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{18}},
Month = {{OCT 20}},
Abstract = {{BackgroundThe odds ratio (OR) is used as an important metric of
   comparison of two or more groups in many biomedical applications when
   the data measure the presence or absence of an event or represent the
   frequency of its occurrence. In the latter case, researchers often
   dichotomize the count data into binary form and apply the well-known
   logistic regression technique to estimate the OR. In the process of
   dichotomizing the data, however, information is lost about the
   underlying counts which can reduce the precision of inferences on the
   OR.MethodsWe propose analyzing the count data directly using regression
   models with the log odds link function. With this approach, the
   parameter estimates in the model have the exact same interpretation as
   in a logistic regression of the dichotomized data, yielding comparable
   estimates of the OR. We prove analytically, using the Fisher information
   matrix, that our approach produces more precise estimates of the OR than
   logistic regression of the dichotomized data. We also show the gains in
   precision using simulation studies and real-world datasets. We focus on
   three related distributions for count data: geometric, Poisson, and
   negative binomial.ResultsIn simulation studies, confidence intervals for
   the OR were 56-65\% as wide (geometric model), 75-79\% as wide (Poisson
   model), and 61-69\% as wide (negative binomial model) as the
   corresponding interval from a logistic regression produced by
   dichotomizing the data. When we analyzed existing datasets using our
   approach, we found that confidence intervals for the OR could be up to
   64\% shorter (36\% as wide) compared to if the data had been
   dichotomized and analyzed using logistic regression.ConclusionsMore
   precise estimates of the OR can be obtained directly from the count data
   by using the log odds link function. This analytic approach is easy to
   implement in software packages that are capable of fitting generalized
   linear models or of maximizing user-defined likelihood functions.}},

Title = {{Control of Uniaxial Negative Thermal Expansion in Layered Perovskites by
   Tuning Layer Thickness}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{OCT 18}},
Abstract = {{Uniaxial negative thermal expansion (NTE) is known to occur in low n
   members of the A(n+1)B(n)O(3n+1) Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) layered
   perovskite series with a frozen rotation of BO6 octahedra about the
   layering axis. Previous work has shown that this NTE arises due to the
   combined effects of a close proximity to a transition to a competing
   phase, so called ``symmetry trapping{''}, and highly anisotropic elastic
   compliance specific to the symmetry of the NTE phase. We extend this
   analysis to the broader RP family (n = 1, 2, 3, 4,...,infinity),
   demonstrating that by changing the fraction of layer interface in the
   structure (i.e., the value of 1/n) one may control the anisotropic
   compliance that is necessary for the pronounced uniaxial NTE observed in
   these systems. More detailed analysis of how the components of the
   compliance matrix develop with 1/n allows us to identify different
   regimes, linking enhancements in compliance between these regimes to the
   crystallographic degrees of freedom in the structure. We further discuss
   how the perovskite layer thickness affects the frequencies of soft zone
   boundary modes with large negative Gruneisen parameters, associated with
   the aforementioned phase transition, that constitute the thermodynamic
   driving force for NTE. This new insight complements our previous
   work-showing that chemical control may be used to switch from positive
   to negative thermal expansion in these systems-since it makes the layer
   thickness, n, an additional design parameter that may be used to
   engineer layered perovskites with tuneable thermal expansion. In these
   respects, we predict that, with appropriate chemical substitution, the n
   = 1 phase will be the systemin which the most pronounced NTE could be
   achieved.}},

Title = {{Monolayer Mg2C: Negative Poisson's ratio and unconventional
   two-dimensional emergent fermions}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 17}},
Abstract = {{Two-dimensional (2D) emergent fermions and negative Poisson's ratio in
   2D materials are fascinating subjects of research. Here, based on
   first-principles calculations and theoretical analysis, we predict that
   the hexacoordinated Mg2C monolayer hosts both exotic properties. We
   analyze its phonon spectrum, reveal the Raman-active modes, and show
   that it has small in-plane stiffness constants. Particularly, under the
   tensile strain in the zigzag direction, the Mg2C monolayer shows an
   intrinsic negative Poisson's ratio similar to - 0.023, stemming from its
   unique puckered hinge structure. The material is metallic at its
   equilibrium state. A moderate biaxial strain can induce a
   metal-semimetal-semiconductor phase transition, during which several
   types of 2D unconventional fermions emerge, including the anisotropic
   Dirac fermions around 12 tilted Dirac points in the metallic phase, the
   2D double Weyl fermions in the semimetal phase where the conduction and
   valence bands touch quadratically at a single Fermi point, and the 2D
   pseudospin-1 fermions at the critical point of the
   semimetal-semiconductor phase transition where three bands cross at a
   single point on the Fermi level. In addition, uniaxial strains along the
   high-symmetry directions break the threefold rotational symmetry and
   reduce the number of Dirac points. Interestingly, it also generates 2D
   type-II Dirac points. We construct effective models to characterize the
   properties of these fermions. Our result reveals Mg2C monolayer as an
   intriguing platform for the study of 2D unconventional fermions, and
   also suggests its great potential for nanoscale device applications.}},

Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{This paper develops an auxetic (negative Poisson's ratio) piezoelectric
   energy harvester (APEH) to increase the power output when harnessing
   strain energy. The APEH consists of a piezoelectric element bonded to an
   auxetic substrate. The auxetic substrate concentrates the applied stress
   and strain into the region of the piezoelectric element and introduces
   auxetic behaviour in the piezoelectric element, both of which increase
   the electric power output. A finite element model was developed to
   optimise the design and verify the mechanism of the power increase.
   Three APEHs were manufactured and characterised. Their performance was
   compared with two equivalent strain energy harvesters with plain
   substrates. Experimental results show that the APEHs, excited by
   sinusoidal strains of 250 is peak-to-peak at 10 Hz, are able to produce
   electric power of up to 191.1 mu W, which is 14.4 times that of the peak
   power produced by the plain harvesters (13.4 mu W). The power gain
   factor is constant between samples as the amplitude and frequency of
   their applied strains are varied. The model and experimental results are
   in good agreement, once accounting for the imperfect bonding of the
   epoxy using the spring constant of the Thin Elastic Layers on the
   modelled epoxy surfaces. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

   about 50\% and 30\% lower than those of pristine GeC. Pristine and

Abstract = {{Fluctuations of conserved quantities such as baryon number, charge, and
   strangeness are sensitive to the correlation length of the hot and dense
   matter created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions and can be used to
   search for the QCD critical point. We report the first measurements of
   the moments of net-kaon multiplicity distributions in Au+Au collisions
   at root s(NN) = 7.7, 11.5, 14.5, 19.6, 27, 39, 62.4, and 200 GeV. The
   collision centrality and energy dependence of the mean (M), variance
   (sigma(2)), skewness (S), and kurtosis (kappa) for net-kaon multiplicity
   distributions as well as the ratio sigma(2)/M and the products S sigma
   and kappa sigma(2) are presented. Comparisons are made with Poisson and
   negative binomial baseline calculations as well as with UrQMD, a
   transport model (UrQMD) that does not include effects from the QCD
   critical point. Within current uncertainties, the net-kaon cumulant
   ratios appear to be monotonic as a function of collision energy. (c)

Abstract = {{Motivated by the recent successful growth of quasi-free-standing single
   layer blue phosphorus (BlueP) on tellurium functionalized Au(1 1 1) by
   using black phosphorus as the precursor (Zhang et al 2016 Nano Lett. 16
   4903; Gu et al 2017 ACS Nano 11 4943), here we study the strain
   performance for zigzag BlueP nanoribbons (zBluePNRs) with different edge
   chemical modifications. Based on the first-principles calculations,
   interestingly, we find that a narrow zBluePNR of width up to similar to
   2 nm with edge sulfur (S) passivation under an uniaxial strain exhibits
   an important effect of negative Poisson's ratio because of the
   particularity of the P-S bonds at edges, and as the ribbon width further
   increases the Poisson's ratio varies from negative to positive.
   Meanwhile, the S-passivation also induces magnetism, and applying a
   strong enough strain can transfer this zBluePNR from magnetic metal
   state to half-metal one. All these physical properties are discussed in
   connection with the variation of microstructure of the ribbons. Our
   findings may paving the way for both a fundamental understanding of
   nanoscale physics and applied device engineering.}},

Abstract = {{Background: A great proportion of deaths due to traffic crashes occur
   for pedestrians, both in developing and developed countries. Objectives:
   The aim of the present study was to determine the spatial factors
   related to the frequency of traffic crashes on pedestrians in districts
   of Tehran city. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study. All traffic
   crashes on pedestrians during 2013-2015 were included in this study. The
   data were extracted from different sources such as traffic police main
   office, Tehran municipal office, and Iran statistics center. Poisson and
   negative binomial regression models were used to analyze the role of
   environment and district on frequency of traffic crashes. Moreover, the
   likelihood-ratio test has been used for comparison between models, while
   assessment of goodness-of-fit has been reported using R-2, Akaike
   information criteria, and Bayesian information criteria. Results: Of
   12,090 crashes, 11,895 (98.4\%) had led to injuries, while 195 (1.6\%)
   had led to deaths. The frequency of crashes varied substantially in
   different districts of Tehran. The incidence of injuries did not show
   any particular pattern, whereas the pattern of incidence of deaths was
   lower in central districts in comparison to higher incidence in marginal
   districts (e.g., north, south, west, and east of Tehran). The results of
   the final model showed a statistically significant association among
   various variables such as demographics, web of roads, rate of traveling,
   and land use with the outcome as number of crashes in geographic units.
   Conclusions: Frequency distribution of traffic crashes leading to injury
   and/or death is completely different in various districts of Tehran.
   Demographic as well as spatial characteristics also play an important
   role in determining this distribution. Regional planning, appropriate
   traffic management, control measures on spatial risk factors, and
   educational programs could substantially improve the safety of
   pedestrians in Tehran.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives To investigate the role of individual factors (including age,
   health and personal circumstances) and external factors associated with
   clients having a job start while engaging with the Work Programme and
   variations by benefit type.
   Setting The UK Government's main return to work initiative (The Work
   Programme) in Scotland.
   Design Piecewise Poisson regression to calculate incident rate ratios
   using administrative data from 2013 to 2016 to identify factors
   associated with job start.
   Participants 4322 Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) clients not in
   work due to poor health and 8996 Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA) clients,
   aged 18-64 years, referred to the Work Programme between April 2013 and
   July 2014.
   Main outcome measures Starting a job and the time to first job start
   after entering the Work Programme.
   Results JSA clients (62\%) were more likely to return to work (RTW) than
   ESA clients (20\%). There is a strong negative relationship between age
   and the predicted probability of having a job start during the 2-year
   engagement with the programme for both JSA and ESA clients. JSA clients
   were most likely to RTW in the first 3 months, while for ESA clients the
   predicted probability of having a first job start was fairly constant
   over the 2 years. Health, including the number of health conditions,
   length of unemployment, client perception of job start and other
   individual factors were associated with job starts for both groups.
   Conclusions Age plays an important role in influencing RTW; however,
   important potentially modifiable factors include the length of
   unemployment, the management of multimorbidity and the individual's
   perception of the likelihood of job start. Future welfare-to-work
   programmes may be improved by providing age-specific interventions which
   focus on health and biopsychosocial factors to enable more people to
   realise the potential health benefits of RTW.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To examine contemporary treatment patterns for women
   diagnosed with stage I-III triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) in the
   United States.
   Methods: We identified 48,961 patients diagnosed with stage I-III TNBC
   from 2010 to 2013 in the National Cancer Data Base and created 3
   treatment subcohorts (definitive locoregional therapy {[}appropriate
   local therapy, including surgery/radiation], adjuvant chemotherapy
   {[}stage II-III disease or stage I tumors with tumor size >= 1 cm], and
   adjuvant chemotherapy for small tumors {[}stage I tumors with tumor size
   <1 cm and node negative]). We performed descriptive analyses, calculated
   percentages for treatment receipt, and used multivariable modified
   Poisson regression models to estimate risk ratios (RRs) with 95\%
   confidence intervals (CIs) predicting receipt of treatments.
   Results: Older age, larger tumor size, positive nodal status, and
   Southern/Pacific US regions, but not race/ethnicity, were strongly
   associated with a lower probability of receiving definitive locoregional
   therapy. Older age was also strongly associated with lower likelihood of
   adjuvant chemotherapy receipt, as were grade, negative nodal status, and
   higher comorbidity. For example, compared with women aged 18 to 39
   years, those aged 75 to 90 years were 17\% less likely to receive
   definitive locoregional therapy (RR, 0.83; 95\% CI, 0.73-0.88), and 62\%
   less likely to receive adjuvant chemotherapy (RR, 0.38; 95\% CI,
   0.35-0.41). Age, tumor grade, tumor size, and comorbidity score were
   also independently associated with receipt of chemotherapy for women
   with small TNBC.
   Conclusions: Advancing age but not race/ethnicity was associated with
   lower likelihood of recommended treatment receipt among women with TNBC.
   Although omission of therapy among older patients with breast cancer may
   be appropriate in the case of smaller and lower risk TNBC, some were
   likely undertreated.}},

Abstract = {{Pursuing two-dimensional (2D) intrinsic ferromagnetism with high Curie
   temperature and great mechanical flexibility has attracted great
   interest in flexible spintronics. In the present work, we carried out a
   density functional theory (DFT) investigation on the 2D M2Se3 (M = Co,
   Ni, and Pd) monolayers to understand their structural stabilities,
   electronic, magnetic and mechanical properties. Our results show that
   the Co2Se3 monolayer exhibits a fascinating half-metallic ferromagnetism
   with high Curie temperature (similar to 600 K). In addition, due to
   their unique buckling hinge-like structure, M2Se3 monolayers possess the
   large out-of-plane negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) and superior
   mechanical flexibility evidenced by their unusual critical strain
   (similar to 50\%-60\%) two times greater than the well-known 2D
   materials. These findings imply that 2D M2Se3 family is the promising
   materials for the applications in the flexible and high-density

Abstract = {{Recently, the Neotropical brown stink bug, Euschistus heros
   (Pentatomidae: Hemiptera), has been detected in cotton in the Brazilian
   Cerrado. Several reliable surveys have been conducted on the spatial
   distribution of stink bugs in soybean; however, few studies have
   examined the behavior of this insect in cotton in Brazil. Thus, this
   study examined the spatial distribution of E. heros in cotton using
   aggregation indices based on the variance-to-mean ratio, Morisita index,
   exponent k, Poisson and negative binomial distributions. Inverse
   Distance Weighting interpolation maps were also used to represent insect
   density. The study was conducted in a 1.1 hectare experimental cotton
   field in which 64 equally-sized plots were sampled on a weekly basis.
   Our findings revealed that stink bugs presented an aggregate
   distribution in 2 sampling weeks based on aggregation indices, and this
   pattern was best described by a negative binomial distribution. Maps
   showing the density of pests can be an important tool for sampling pests
   in crops and control measures in early stages of infestation, when there
   is an edge effect on the distribution of E. heros, can be an efficient
   strategy in cotton.}},

Abstract = {{Honeycomb structures are increasingly being used in many important
   fields. A novel combined embedded enhanced honeycomb (CEEH) in developed
   in this paper based on the two existing embedded enhanced honeycombs,
   the single rib embedded enhanced honeycomb (SREEH) and the rhombic grid
   embedded enhanced honeycomb (RGEEH). Analytical model related to the
   in-plane Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio is built and validated by
   using two different finite element (FE) models (3D beam model and 3D
   solid model). The in-plane elastic behavior of the honeycomb is also
   investigated against the geometrical parameters by using the numerically
   validated analytical solutions. The results show that the new CEEH can
   achieve a wide range value of Poisson's ratio and Young's modulus by
   tailoring geometric parameters. The results also show that the new CEEH
   exhibits higher x- directional specific stiffness than SREEH while
   higher y- directional specific stiffness than RGEEH. Moreover, the new
   CEEH can weaken even eliminate the difference between the two principal
   directions which can be hardly achieved by the SREEH and RGEEH. Given
   these advantages, this new design may be promising in some applications.
   This work provides a new insight into the designs of embedded enhanced
   honeycombs.}},

Abstract = {{In the present work, the mechanical properties, in particular, the
   Poisson's ratio of four two-dimensional silica structures, called here
   alpha, beta, gamma, and delta are studied by means of molecular dynamics
   simulations. The alpha structure has been synthesized experimentally and
   the others have been reported as the most stable low-energy structures
   that reveal in-plane negative Poisson's ratio based on the first
   principles calculations. Among these structures, beta-silica exhibits
   the largest in-plane negative Poisson's ratio which is 2-4 times higher
   than penta-graphene. Our results illustrate that the classical molecular
   dynamics simulation reproduces results in agreement with those of the
   first principles calculations. Consequently, it enables us to study the
   mechanical responses of considerably larger systems at finite
   temperatures in contrast to the ab initio simulations. Furthermore, we
   systematically study the temperature effects on the stability and
   mechanical properties of these two-dimensional silica structures, up to
   their rupture points. It is found that the mechanical properties of
   these structures vary significantly with temperature, and gamma-silica
   exhibits a switchable behavior in its Poisson's ratio with temperature.}},

Abstract = {{Metabolic syndrome (MetS), a multicomponent condition, is a
   cardiovascular disease predictor. Although exposure to agricultural
   pesticides has been suggested as a potential contributor to the rising
   rates of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and other features of metabolic
   disorders, no studies have focused on the association between
   consumption of organic food (produced without synthetic pesticides) and
   MetS. We aimed to investigate the cross-sectional association between
   organic food consumption and MetS in French adults to determine whether
   it would be worth conducting further studies, particularly large
   prospective and randomised trials.
   A total of 8174 participants from the NutriNet-Sant, study who attended
   a clinical visit and completed an organic food frequency questionnaire
   were included in this cross-sectional analysis. We evaluated the
   association between the proportion of organic food in the diet (overall
   and by food group) and MetS using Poisson regression models while
   adjusting for potential confounders.
   Higher organic food consumption was negatively associated with the
   prevalence of MetS: adjusted prevalence ratio was 0.69 (95\% CI 0.61,
   0.78) when comparing the third tertile of proportion of organic food in
   the diet with the first one (p value < 0.0001). Higher consumption of
   organic plant-based foods was also related to a lower probability of
   having MetS. In addition, when stratifying by lifestyle factors
   (nutritional quality of the diet, smoking status, and physical
   activity), a significant negative association was detected in each
   subgroup (p values < 0.05), except among smokers.
   Our results showed that a higher organic food consumption was associated
   with a lower probability of having MetS. Additional prospective studies
   and randomised trials are required to ascertain the relationship between
   organic food consumption and metabolic disorders.}},

Volume = {{60}},
Pages = {{33-39}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Aims: The aim of this research was to determine the association between
   legalizing medical marijuana and workplace fatalities.
   Design: Repeated cross-sectional data on workplace fatalities at the
   state-year level were analyzed using a multivariate Poisson regression.
   Setting: To date, 29 states and the District of Columbia have legalized
   the use of marijuana for medicinal purposes. Although there is
   increasing concern that legalizing medical marijuana will make
   workplaces more dangerous, little is known about the relationship
   between medical marijuana laws (MMLs) and workplace fatalities.
   Participants: All 50 states and the District of Columbia for the period
   1992-2015.
   Measurements: Workplace fatalities by state and year were obtained from
   the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Regression models were adjusted for
   state demographics, the unemployment rate, state fixed effects, and year
   fixed effects.
   Findings: Legalizing medical marijuana was associated with a 19.5\%
   reduction in the expected number of workplace fatalities among workers
   aged 25-44 (incident rate ratio {[}IRR], 0.805; 95\% CI, .662.979). The
   association between legalizing medical marijuana and workplace
   fatalities among workers aged 16-24, although negative, was not
   statistically significant at conventional levels. The association
   between legalizing medical marijuana and workplace fatalities among
   workers aged 25-44 grew stronger over time. Five years after coming into
   effect, MMLs were associated with a 33.7\% reduction in the expected
   number of workplace fatalities (IRR, 0.663; 95\% CI, .482.912). MMLs
   that listed pain as a qualifying condition or allowed collective
   cultivation were associated with larger reductions in fatalities among
   workers aged 25-44 than those that did not.
   Conclusions: The results provide evidence that legalizing medical
   marijuana improved workplace safety for workers aged 25-44. Further
   investigation is required to determine whether this result is
   attributable to reductions in the consumption of alcohol and other
   substances that impair cognitive function, memory, and motor skills.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMPACT ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{120}},
Pages = {{138-149}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The deformation and impact energy absorption properties of ultrathin
   polymeric microlattices were investigated as a function of density, size
   and positional eccentricity of the trusses, which controlled the amount
   of bending in the microlattice deformations. We considered highly
   porous, 3-D microstructures with small lattice constants (<= 135 mu m),
   and studied their response to high strain rate (similar to 1000/s)
   tests, using high speed video capture, SEM imaging and quantitative
   modelling. The microlattices were found to have excellent impact
   absorption efficiencies that are 2 - 120 times better than carbon
   nanotube foams, polycarbonate and silicone rubber, despite being an
   order of magnitude slimmer than the thinnest commercial foams of similar
   densities. This high impact absorption efficiency is largely due to the
   sideways buckling of the microlattice trusses during the crushing stage,
   which prevented densification of the microlattices at small strains.
   Furthermore, we showed that varying the positional eccentricity of the
   trusses and the number of unit cells in the microlattices can modulate
   their stiffness, strength and energy absorption over an appreciable
   range, comparable to that obtained through modifications in relative
   density. Because the microlattices were mostly under stress equilibrium
   during the impact process, the insights derived from the present study
   are expected to be valid for quasistatic and low strain rate loadings as
   well.}},

   simultaneously obtained. The ranges and constraints of the geometrical
   parameters are revealed, and the relative densities are only about 2\%,
   indicating excellent lightweight character. Besides, analytical
   expressions for coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) and Poisson's
   ratio (PR) are theoretically established and numerically simulated.
   Parameter analysis confirms that the range of tailorable CTE can be
   enhanced through rationally selecting large values of CTE ratio, first
   geometrical angle and height ratio. By adjusting the second and third
   geometrical angles, Poisson's ratio also can be tuned to be large
   negative, near zero and positive values. Particularly, the metastructure
   can give paired negative CTE and negative PR. Different combinations of
   paired characteristics including positive CTE + negative PR, positive
   CTE + positive PR and negative CTE + positive PR are also flexibly
   available. Moreover, CTE and PR are found to be highly coupled. To
   simultaneously obtain specific CTE and PR, design parameters should be
   selected with consideration of the coupling effect. The results here are
   expected to contribute feasibility to structures with both temperature
   and mechanical sensitivities. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study is to explore a new type of structure design
   and injecting material selection of the composite sandwich bulletproof
   system. A reentrant hexagonal honeycomb with the negative Poisson's
   ratio effect was designed. Thermoplastic polyurethanes (TPU),
   polypropylene (PP) and polycarbonate (PC) were chosen to inject into the
   re-entrant honeycomb structure by injection molding to form the
   composite sandwich layers. The total bulletproof system was later
   constructed with the boron carbide ceramic plates and aluminum alloy
   plates. The mechanical behaviors and energy absorption characteristics
   of different composite sandwich layers were investigated by quasi-static
   and dynamic compression tests. The dynamic responses of different
   structured layers were analyzed via numerical simulations in
   ANSYS/LS-DYNA, which employed 7.62 mm projectiles. The results indicated
   that the injection-molded composite sandwich layer shows excellent
   compressive strength and energy absorption capacity. The bulletproof
   performance of the injection-molded system has been greatly improved
   comparing with the non-injected molded system. Compared with TPU and PP,
   the composite injected with PC presents optimal penetration resistance.}},

Abstract = {{Soil strength nonlinearity and dilatancy have significant impacts on the
   stability of a slope. In the present analysis, a seismic stability
   analysis of a three-dimensional two-stage slope considering the joined
   influences of soil strength nonlinearity and dilatancy is conducted.
   Based on the limit analysis method, the external work rates by soil
   weight and the seismic forces as well as the internal energy
   dissipations are calculated and thereafter the critical height of the
   slope is derived. In virtue of the nonlinear optimization procedure, the
   stability factor of a 3D slope subjected to seismic forces is captured.
   The effects of slope geometry, seismic forces, soil strength
   nonlinearity and dilatancy on the slope stability are investigated by
   parameter analysis. It is found from the results that, the depth
   coefficient alpha(1) and dilative parameter n have positive effects on
   the stability of a two-stage slope while the other factors such as the
   seismic coefficient k(h) and the nonlinear coefficient m have negative
   effects on it. In addition, the effect of soil nonlinearity on slope
   stability aggravates when the seismic force coefficient k(h) and the
   dilative parameter n increase.}},

Title = {{Mechanical Metamaterials Foams with Tunable Negative Poisson's Ratio for
   Enhanced Energy Absorption and Damage Resistance}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Systematic and deep understanding of mechanical properties of the
   negative Poisson's ratio convex-concave foams plays a very important
   role for their practical engineering applications. However, in the open
   literature, only a negative Poisson's ratio effect of the metamaterials
   convex-concave foams is simply mentioned. In this paper, through the
   experimental and finite element methods, effects of geometrical
   morphology on elastic moduli, energy absorption, and damage properties
   of the convex-concave foams are systematically studied. Results show
   that negative Poisson's ratio, energy absorption, and damage properties
   of the convex-concave foams could be tuned simultaneously through
   adjusting the chord height to span ratio of the sine-shaped cell edges.
   By the rational design of the negative Poisson's ratio, when compared to
   the conventional open-cell foams of equal mass, convex-concave foams
   could have the combined advantages of relative high stiffness and
   strength, enhanced energy absorption and damage resistance. The research
   of this paper provides theoretical foundations for optimization design
   of the mechanical properties of the convex-concave foams and thus could
   facilitate their practical applications in the engineering fields.}},

Abstract = {{The objectives of this work is i) to synthesize a metamaterial with
   three-dimensional (3D) micro-architecture for variable stiffness and
   multiple Poisson's ratios in different directions, using cylindrical
   holes and slits in the 3D structural material and ii) to analyze its
   structural behavior. For the materials design, we use a hybrid synthesis
   method with Compliant Porous Structures (CPSes), producing positive and
   negative Poisson's ratios in the 3D space. Internal contact of slit
   surface of CPS under both tensile and compressive loadings is used for
   the variable stiffness design. We build a constitutive model of the
   metamaterial with CPS, verifying it with finite element (FE) based
   simulations and experimental tests. We apply a hierarchical design
   approach for lattice structures to explore the effect of tessellation of
   CPS on the mechanical properties of metamaterials. The spatial
   arrangement of cylindrical holes and slits can be used for the
   intelligent design of metamaterials having engineered properties,
   together with an edge-based hierarchical design of lattice materials. We
   also provide a design guideline of a cubic lattice structure on its
   effective properties for varying dimensions of the hybrid CPS ribs.}},

Title = {{High-risk human papillomavirus status and prognosis in invasive cervical
   cancer: A nationwide cohort study}},
Journal = {{PLOS MEDICINE}},

Abstract = {{Background
   High-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) infection is established as the
   major cause of invasive cervical cancer (ICC). However, whether hrHPV
   status in the tumor is associated with subsequent prognosis of ICC is
   controversial. We aim to evaluate the association between tumor hrHPV
   status and ICC prognosis using national registers and comprehensive
   human papillomavirus (HPV) genotyping.
   Methods and findings
   In this nationwide population-based cohort study, we identified all ICC
   diagnosed in Sweden during the years 2002-2011 (4,254 confirmed cases),
   requested all archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded blocks, and
   performed HPV genotyping. Twenty out of 25 pathology bio-banks agreed to
   the study, yielding a total of 2,845 confirmed cases with valid HPV
   results. Cases were prospectively followed up from date of cancer
   diagnosis to 31 December 2015, migration from Sweden, or death,
   whichever occurred first. The main exposure was tumor hrHPV status
   classified as hrHPV-positive and hrHPV-negative. The primary outcome was
   all-cause mortality by 31 December 2015. Five-year relative survival
   ratios (RSRs) were calculated, and excess hazard ratios (EHRs) with 95\%
   confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using Poisson regression,
   adjusting for education, time since cancer diagnosis, and clinical
   factors including age at cancer diagnosis and International Federation
   of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage. Of the 2,845 included cases,
   hrHPV was detected in 2,293 (80.6\%), and we observed 1,131 (39.8\%)
   deaths during an average of 6.2 years follow-up. The majority of ICC
   cases were diagnosed at age 30-59 years (57.5\%) and classified as stage
   IB (40.7\%). hrHPV positivity was significantly associated with
   screen-detected tumors, young age, high education level, and early stage
   at diagnosis (p < 0.001). The 5-year RSR compared to the general female
   population was 0.74 (95\% CI 0.72-0.76) for hrHPV-positive cases and
   0.54 (95\% CI 0.50-0.59) for hrHPV-negative cases, yielding a crude EHR
   of 0.45 (95\% CI 0.38-0.52) and an adjusted EHR of 0.61 (95\% CI
   0.52-0.71). Risk of all-cause mortality as measured by EHR was
   consistently and statistically significantly lower for cases with
   hrHPV-positive tumors for each age group above 29 years and each FIGO
   stage above IA. The difference in prognosis by hrHPV status was highly
   robust, regardless of the clinical, histological, and educational
   characteristics of the cases. The main limitation was that, except for
   education, we were not able to adjust for lifestyle factors or other
   unmeasured confounders.
   Conclusions
   In this study, women with hrHPV-positive cervical tumors had a
   substantially better prognosis than women with hrHPV-negative tumors.
   hrHPV appears to be a biomarker for better prognosis in cervical cancer
   independent of age, FIGO stage, and histological type, extending
   information from already established prognostic factors. The underlying
   biological mechanisms relating lack of detectable tumor hrHPV to
   considerably worse prognosis are not known and should be further
   investigated.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a topology optimization method to design periodic
   unit cell in cellular materials with extreme properties using a moving
   iso-surface threshold method. The aim is to determine the optimal
   distribution of material within the periodic unit cell. The effective
   properties of cellular material are obtained by using a finite
   element-based homogenization method. The penalty function approach is
   introduced to construct the objective function for designing material
   with extreme properties under condition of square or isotropic symmetry.
   New characteristic response functions of moving iso-surface threshold
   are proposed for maximum shear or bulk modulus, maximum shear modulus or
   negative Poisson's ratio under isotropic symmetry. Several examples are
   presented and the results are compared to those obtained with the solid
   isotropic material with penalization method to demonstrate the validity
   of the method. A series of new and interesting microstructures with
   extreme properties are found and presented.}},

Abstract = {{A cylindrical negative Poisson's ratio (CNPR) structure based on
   two-dimensional double-arrow negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) structure
   was introduced in this paper. The CNPR structure has excellent
   stiffness, damping and energy absorption performances, and can be
   applied as spring, damper and energy absorbing components. In this
   study, the CNPR structure was used as a jounce bumper in vehicle
   suspension, and the load-displacement curve of NPR jounce bumper was
   discussed. Moreover, the influences of structural parameters and
   materials on the load-displacement curve of NPR jounce bumper were
   specifically researched. It came to the conclusion that only the numbers
   of cells and layers impact the hardening displacement of NPR jounce
   bumper. And all parameters significantly affect the structure stiffness
   at different displacement periods. On the other hand, the
   load-displacement curve of NPR jounce bumper should be in an ideal
   region which is difficult to be achieved applying mathematical
   optimization method. Therefore, a parametric design strategy of NPR
   jounce bumper was proposed according to the parametric analysis results.
   The design strategy had two main steps: design of hardening displacement
   and design of stiffness. The analysis results proved that the proposed
   method is reliable and is also meaningful for relevant structure design

Abstract = {{In order to enhance the explosion-proof performance of the door and
   reduce the injury to passengers caused by the explosion impact load,
   this paper introduces the negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) structure to
   the traditional door, and proposes a NPR explosion-proof door. It adopts
   the NPR functionally graded material to form the inner core part between
   the outer panel and inner panel, and sets different thicknesses to
   different gradient layers to meet the performance requirements of energy
   absorption and impact resistance. Because the relationships between the
   parameters and the performance indexes are unknown for this novel door,
   this work obtains the quantitative relationship between them by means of
   the response surface model (RSM). Based on this, the optimization
   mathematical models are established taking the inner panel acceleration,
   inner panel intrusion, energy absorption of NPR inner core structure and
   the mass of explosion-proof door as the optimization objectives. Then, a
   multi-objective optimization design is conducted for the novel
   explosion-proof door based on adaptive hybrid multi-objective particle
   swarm optimization (AHMOPSO) algorithm. Simulation results show that
   compared with the traditional door, the explosion-proof door optimized
   by AHMOPSO algorithm has better comprehensive explosion-proof
   performance. The results of this paper can provide some basis for the
   design and optimization of the explosion-proof door.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of the Poisson's ratio of the foam on the energy
   absorption of the foam-filled tube is investigated in this paper.
   Firstly, the relationship between the mechanical properties and the
   structural parameters of the 3D lattice structure is calculated by using
   the theory of material mechanics. The finite element analysis software
   ABAQUS is used to simulate the axial dynamic response of cylindrical
   tubes filled with conventional and negative Poisson's ratio foams. Based
   on this, the interaction between the tube wall and foam is analyzed in
   detail. Combining the structural properties of both the positive and
   negative Poisson's ratio foams, a new foam model with mixed Poisson's
   ratio (MPR) is proposed, and the crashworthiness of three different
   types of tubes, namely the sandwich double tubes filled with positive,
   negative and mixed Poisson's ratio foams, is analyzed. The results show
   that the interaction between the foam and the tube wall has a
   significant effect on the energy absorption performance. The sandwich
   double tube filled with MPR foam has better specific energy absorption
   (SEA) and stronger interaction than those filled with pure positive or
   negative Poisson's ratio foam. This study provides a new insight into
   crashworthiness design of foam-filled structures.}},

   Naturally Fractured Reservoir}},
Journal = {{ENERGIES}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Fracture aperture of a fractured reservoir can be affected by both
   matrix elasticity and fracture compressibility when the reservoir
   pressure decreases, namely stress sensitivity. An elasticity parameter
   coupling Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio was introduced to reflect
   this geomechanical behavior, and a new model incorporating geomechanics
   was developed to analyze the flow behavior of a horizontal well in a
   naturally fractured reservoir. Pressure solutions for two
   casesuniform-flux and infinite-conductivitywere derived, respectively.
   For the uniform-flux case, the effect of dimensionless elasticity
   parameter on the pressure-drop profile becomes stronger with continuing
   production, and the profile may be like a bow. Nine flow regimes can be
   observed on the transient response of the infinite-conductivity case.
   Stress sensitivity mainly affects the late-flow period and a larger
   dimensionless elasticity parameter causes a greater pressure drop. Due
   to stress sensitivity, the pressure derivative curve exhibits an upward
   tendency in the pseudo-radial flow regime, and the slope is greater than
   1 in the pseudo-steady flow regime. For KT-I formation in the North
   Truva field, its elasticity parameter decreases with the increase of
   Young's modulus or Poisson's ratio and ranges from 8 x 10(-8) Pa-1 to
   1.1 x 10(-7) Pa-1. Meanwhile, the transient response of H519 has a
   slight negative correlation with Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio in
   the pseudo-steady flow regime.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a group of auxetic-inspired material structures
   that can transform into various shapes upon compression. We developed
   four cellular-based material structure units composed of rigid plates
   and elastic/rotary hinges. Different compositions of these units lead to
   a variety of tunable shape changing possibilities, such as uniform
   scaling, shearing, bending and rotating. By tessellating those
   transformations together, we can create various higher level
   transformations for product design. In the paper, we first give a
   geometrical and numerical description of the units' configuration and
   their degrees of freedom. An interactive simulation tool is developed
   for users to input designed structures and preview the transformation.
   Finally we present three application prototypes that utilize our
   proposed structures. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{For the purpose of reconstructing a three-dimensional auxetic structure
   adopting spacer warp-knitting techniques, a simple mathematical model
   based on the structure of auxetic warp-knitted spacer hexagonal meshes
   was established and several samples were produced using an E22
   RD7/2-12EN warp-knitting machine. It is predicted from synthesizing the
   results of both mathematical modeling and experimental sampling that
   auxetic performance of this structure mainly depends on the contraction
   distortion before stretching in three directions, especially in the
   y-axis. When it comes to knitting parameters, yarn fineness, machine
   gauge, fabric density, movement of guide bars, and inclination angle of
   wales all matter for the auxetic performance, which is also affected by
   the stiffness of materials and the lodging of spacer yarns. It is also
   concluded that successive inlaying in the same direction of the spacer
   guide bar favors contraction distortion in the y-axis, which means
   auxetic performances can be more easily achieved in this way.}},

   negative in the viscoplastic region. The negative through-the-thickness
   Poisson's ratios of the {[}+/- 30 degrees] woven laminates were caused
   by the compressive stress with respect to the in-plane direction and the

Abstract = {{In this study, we investigate the effects of two scaling exponents on
   the biaxial deformation and mass transport of swollen elastomers. Two
   scaling exponents are included in an extended version of the Flory
   Rehner model (Okumura et al., J. Mech. Phys. Solids, 2016); two scaling
   exponents are used to adjust the swelling effects on the Young's modulus
   and osmotic pressure of swollen elastomers, resulting in the ability to
   predict swelling induced strain softening under uniaxial tensile
   loading. It is found that when biaxial tensile loading is given under
   stress control, strain softening is accelerated by increasing the
   biaxial stress ratio, while under strain control, the responses become
   more complicated, which can be interpreted by considering that Poisson's
   ratio at equilibrium free swelling can take negative values depending on
   the two scaling exponents. Further, the effect of the two scaling
   exponents on mass transport is discussed by analyzing the swelling
   kinetics of a gel layer constrained on a rigid substrate. (C) 2017

   joint areas}},
Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Developing new generation wearable electronics with skin-like
   stretchability and conformability has become the research hotspot in
   many areas, such as bio-sensoring, communication and robotics. In this
   study, a novel design and manufacturing method was proposed to develop
   wearable electronics, which could perform a similar deformation as the
   target skin surface during the rotation of joint. Considering the
   nonuniform auxetic deformation behaviour of the skin around joint areas,
   the designed electronics should also have the same Poisson's ratio (PR)
   distribution. Re-entrant honeycomb structure was chosen to obtain
   tuneable PR, by changing the interior angel of each unit cell. By
   mapping unit cells with different PR to the target surface, the obtained
   structure would have the same mechanical property and deformation
   behaviour as the covered skin. Consequently, there would be little sheer
   stress at the connection areas between wearable electronics and human
   skin, which would surely increase the attachment stability. Besides, the
   conformability of the device could also be generated. PloyJet process
   was introduced to fabricate the flexible substrate, and silver ink was
   printed directly on the substrate with directink-writing (DIW)
   technology. Conductive wire with `wavy' structure was manufactured by
   this PolyJet-DIW process, and it had shown a much better stretchability
   than the common straight-line structure. Furthermore, wearable
   electronics that suitable for a person-specific elbow was developed.
   Both the conformability and conductivity were tested, and all results
   had shown much better performance than traditional wearable electronics
   with uniform structures.}},

   Theoretical analysis and numerical simulation}},
Journal = {{THIN-WALLED STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{131}},
Pages = {{373-384}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{In order to comprehensively understand the dynamic response of auxetic
   honeycombs, theoretical analysis are conducted to predict the NPR effect
   and the crushing stress of the re-entrant hexagonal honeycomb. The
   honeycomb's crushing stress is a function of the cell's geometric
   parameters, crushing velocity and the mechanical property of the
   cell-wall material. Results show that the crushing stress enhances with
   the increasing crushing velocity. A dynamic sensitivity index is
   employed to quantitatively evaluate this enhancement. It is shown that
   small cell-wall angle, low relative density or high cell-wall length
   ratio of the honeycomb attribute high velocity-sensitivity to the
   crushing stress. The Poisson's ratio of the re-entrant honeycomb is also
   expressed as a function of the cell's geometric parameters. It is
   revealed that the NPR effect enhances with the increasing cell-wall
   angle and the decreasing cell-wall length ratio. All the theoretical
   predictions are verified by numerical simulations. Besides, an
   interesting phenomenon is noticed that the crushing velocity has
   significant influence on the honeycomb's NPR effect at the early stage
   of crushing. However, this influence almost vanishes when the overall
   strain is larger than about 0.2. This present work is supposed to shed
   light on the design of the auxetic honeycomb.}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Linear elastic Hookean solids can be strong but become brittle in
   general as their strength-to-modulus ratio is higher about 1/100 due to
   the well-known inverse strength-ductility relationship. Combined with
   the first-order reversible martensitc transformation, they can be
   functional but their mechanical and functional properties are sensitive
   to temperature, for example, superelasticity and zero/negative thermal
   expansion are limited in a narrow temperature range of about 100 Kelvin.
   Here we report a group of titanium alloys which are strong, ductile,
   flexible together with superelasticity and tunable thermal expansion
   from positive, via zero, to negative across a wide temperature range
   from below 4.2 K to 625 K. This is attributed to its nonlinear
   elasticity obeying a highorder Hooke's law due to a continuous and
   reversible atomic rearrangement at a large scale up to phase transition
   strain. Such novel mechanism distinguishes completely from the previous
   elastic and martensitic mechanisms ruled by Poisson ratio and sharp
   crystal structure change, respectively. We demonstrate that the
   atomic-level mechanism is organized adaptively by a nanoscale
   compositional modulation, which is created by a spinodal decomposition.
   These findings pave a way to design new solids through a nanoscale
   periodical distribution in chemistry.}},

Abstract = {{This study examines the association of the levels of different airborne
   pollutants on the incidence of osteoporotic hip fracture in a southern
   European region. Association was detected between SO2 and NO2 and
   hospital admissions due to hip fracture.IntroductionTo examine the
   short-term effects of outdoor air pollution on the incidence of
   osteoporotic hip fracture in a southern European region.MethodsThis is
   an ecological retrospective cohort study based on data obtained from
   three databases. In a time-series analysis, we examined the association
   between hip fracture incidence and different outdoor air pollutants
   (sulfur dioxide (SO2), monoxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone
   (O-3), and particulate matter in suspension <2.5 (PM2.5) and <10-m
   (PM10) conditions by using general additive models (Poisson
   distribution). The incidence rate ratio (IRR), crude and adjusted by
   season and different weather conditions, was estimated for all
   parameters. Hip incidence was later analyzed by sex and age (under or
   over age 75) subgroups. The main outcome measure was daily hospital
   admissions due to fracture.ResultsHip fracture incidence showed
   association with SO2 (IRR 1.11 (95\% CI 1.04-1.18)), NO (IRR 1.01 (95\%
   CI 1.01-1.02)), and NO2 (IRR 1.02 (95\% CI 1.01-1.04)). For O-3 levels,
   this association was negative (IRR 0.97 (95\% CI 0.95-0.99)). The
   association persisted for SO2 and NO2 when the models were adjusted by
   season. After adjusting by season and weather conditions, the
   association persisted for NO2. When participants were stratified by age
   and sex, associations persisted only in women older than
   75years.ConclusionsA short-term association was observed with several
   indicators of air pollution on hip fracture incidence. This is the first
   study that shows these associations.}},

Year = {{2018}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The highly symmetric hexachiral honeycomb with an isotropic Poisson's
   ratio of -1 is one of the earliest and most well-known examples of
   auxetic mechanical metamaterials and has been proposed for numerous
   applications ranging from satellite antennas to stents. In this work, we
   propose a novel, less symmetric generic form of the hexachiral honeycomb
   that is made up of three sets of unequally sized ligaments rather than
   six identical ones and has the potential to exhibit a wide range of
   negative Poisson's ratios. Using finite element analysis, we
   investigated the deformation behaviour of these generic hexachiral
   systems and derived an analytical model which may be used to predict the
   Poisson's ratio of these systems. The results obtained indicate that the
   hexachiral topology is extremely versatile with respect to its potential
   to exhibit diverse mechanical properties and it is hoped that this added
   tenability will enhance the functionality and applicability of this
   class of auxetic mechanical metamaterials.}},

Abstract = {{Study Objective: Pregnant and nonpregnant populations in the United
   States report marijuana as the most commonly used illicit drug. Patterns
   of marijuana use and psychosocial correlates are unclear among
   non-treatment-seeking teenage girls.
   Design, Setting, Participants, Interventions, and Main Outcome Measures:
   The objective of this study was to use cross-sectional data to examine
   the psychosocial correlates of recent marijuana use among a sample of
   646 pregnant and nonpregnant adolescent girls presenting to urban
   primary care clinics (mean age = 15.6 years, SD = 1.9 years; 65\%
   African American; 8.8\% pregnant).
   Results: In Poisson regression analysis, frequency of marijuana use was
   significantly associated with greater likelihood of pregnancy (incident
   rate ratio {[}IRR], 1.30; 95\% CI, 1.03-1.65), alcohol use (IRR, 1.11;
   95\% CI, 10.08-1.14), condomless sex (IRR, 1.95; 95\% CI, 1.61-2.37),
   parents' drug use (IRR, 1.04; 95\% CI, 1.02-1.05), and negative peer
   influences (IRR, 1.12; 95\% CI, 1.10-1.16).
   Conclusion: Marijuana use among adolescent girls in this sample was
   associated with a number of risk behaviors as well as parental and peer
   influences. Culturally sensitive screening and intervention approaches
   for marijuana use among adolescent girls should address multiple
   individual, relationship, and community factors, to prevent unwanted
   pregnancy as well as to reduce marijuana use during this vulnerable
   time.}},

Abstract = {{Focusing on planar isotropic petal-shaped auxetics, an isogeometric
   design framework is presented to achieve tunable effective properties.
   Specifically, the design framework includes (i) a NURBS-based parametric
   modelling scheme that characterizes petal-shaped auxetics with a small
   number of design variables; (ii) a systematic consideration of petal
   form, component widths and base material properties; (iii) a
   semi-analytical sensitivity analysis method based on material
   derivatives; and (iv) constraints for effective stiffness and target
   Poisson ratio. Three cases are considered: Case A with the same
   component width, Case B with different component widths, and Case C for
   composite designs with multiple base materials. For each case, a design
   limit curve is obtained for the effective Poisson ratio over a range of
   effective stiffness constraints, to give a quick overview on the
   properties attainable for each design setting. The optimization
   framework is next demonstrated for designing composite petal-shaped
   auxetics with target effective properties.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2018}},

Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 26}},
Abstract = {{Closed-form analytical expressions for the effective electrical
   (thermal) conductivity and elastic moduli of a wide class of
   three-dimensional isotropic particulate composites (dispersions) for all
   phase contrasts and volume fractions have been previously formulated.
   These property estimates were extracted from exact strong-contrast
   expansions that incorporate complete microstructural information. In
   this paper, we employ these analytical expressions to derive and apply
   ``cross-property maps{''} that connect combinations of pairs of the
   aforementioned effective transport and elastic properties to one another
   for a wide class of dispersions in which the inclusions can have
   different shapes and sizes and are spatially distributed in a matrix
   with varying degrees of order/disorder. We illustrate cross-property
   maps for a variety of cases (e.g., incompressible or compressible
   composites with conducting/insulating inclusions that may be rigid or
   compliant or auxetic) for high inclusion volume fractions. All of the
   cross-property maps that involve the effective conductivity translate
   immediately into equivalent results for the effective dielectric
   constant, magnetic permeability, or diffusion coefficient because they
   are mathematically analogous. We discuss an example that enables us to
   design a disordered dispersion with desired values of the effective
   dielectric constant and effective Young's modulus. Cross-property maps
   and their extensions will facilitate the rational design of particulate
   media with different desirable multifunctional characteristics.
   Moreover, our investigation has implications for the application of
   machine-learning and other data-driven approaches for multifunctional
   materials discovery.}},

Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},

Volume = {{200}},
Pages = {{886-909}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{Lightweight architected cellular cores have been introduced as an
   advanced alternative to improve the overall performance of sandwich
   structures. In this study, we implement semi-analytical and finite
   element approaches and conduct experimental impact tests to evaluate the
   performance of 3D printed lightweight sandwich panels with architected
   cellular cores of programmable six-sided cells. Changing the geometrical
   parameters of the cells leads to cellular cores of hexagonal,
   rectangular and auxetic topologies. A semi-analytical methodology is
   developed for conducing structural and low-velocity impact analyses
   based on a modified higher-order shear deformation theory. The standard
   mechanics homogenization is implemented through finite element modelling
   to accurately predict the effective mechanical properties of architected
   cellular cores. We apply explicit large deformation finite element
   analysis using ANSYS to analyze the elasto-plastic behavior of
   architected sandwich panels under a low-velocity impact. To
   experimentally corroborate the developed theoretical and computational
   models and to evaluate the manufacturability of the architected sandwich
   panels, we use the fused deposition modeling to 3D print samples of
   polylactic acid biopolymers. Uniaxial tensile test is first used to
   characterize the polymer. We then conduct low-velocity impact tests to
   investigate the energy absorption capability of architected sandwich
   panels. X-ray micro-tomography is finally employed to study the
   microstructural features of panels before and after the impact. The
   experimental and numerical results show that the auxetic sandwich panel
   is potentially an appropriate candidate for energy absorption
   applications due to its high-energy absorption capability and a minimum
   response force transferred from the 3D printed panel.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials, which possess a negative Poisson's ratio (NPR), have
   been a hot topic in materials science research. Through atomistic
   simulations, we theoretically rediscover a few novel two-dimensional
   (2D) V-A-nitride (V-A-N) binary compounds with delta-phosphorene-like
   structures. The structures in the delta-phase (except for delta-PN)
   exhibit better stability in terms of energy, thermodynamics, and
   mechanics with respect to their counterparts in the alpha- and
   beta-phases. The structures in the delta-phase show semiconducting
   behaviors with direct band gaps falling in the visible light region.
   Interestingly, most structures in the alpha- and delta-phases (except
   for delta-BiN) exhibit large in-plane NPRs and excellent mechanical
   properties. The maximum NPR occurs along the zigzag (x) direction for
   the delta-phases and along the diagonal direction for the alpha-phases.
   Particularly, for alpha- and delta-SbN, the NPRs are -0.628 and -0.296,
   respectively. delta-SbN can sustain tensile strains of up to 22\% and
   35\% with maximum stresses of 12.1 and 9.8 GPa in the zigzag and
   armchair directions, respectively. In addition, the transverse response
   can reach up to 6.6\% at a strain of similar to 18\% along the armchair
   (y) direction for delta-SbN, which is considerably higher than those of
   other 2D auxetic materials. Our results reveal that 2D V-A-N binary
   compounds have potential applications in designing 2D electromechanical
   and optoelectronic devices.}},

Abstract = {{In many biomedical applications, covariates are naturally grouped, with
   variables in the same group being systematically related or
   statistically correlated. Under such settings, variable selection must
   be conducted at both group and individual variable levels. Motivated by
   the widespread availability of zero-inflated count outcomes and grouped
   covariates in many practical applications, we consider group
   regularization for zero-inflated negative binomial regression models.
   Using a least squares approximation of the mixture likelihood and a
   variety of group-wise penalties on the coefficients, we propose a
   unified algorithm (Gooogle: Group Regularization for Zero-inflated Count
   Regression Models) to efficiently compute the entire regularization path
   of the estimators. We investigate the finite sample performance of these
   methods through extensive simulation experiments and the analysis of a
   German health care demand dataset. Finally, we derive theoretical
   properties of these methods under reasonable assumptions, which further
   provides deeper insight into the asymptotic behavior of these
   approaches. The open source software implementation of this method is
   publicly available at: .}},

Abstract = {{Protective armors are widespread in nature and often consist of periodic
   arrays of tile-like building blocks that articulate with each other

   consequences of these wavy tessellations, especially in instances where

   that integrates parametric modeling and finite element simulations with
   direct mechanical testing on their 3D-printed multi-material structural
   analogues is presented. Results from these studies demonstrate that
   these tiled arrays of largely isotropic star-like unit cells exhibit an
   unusual combination of mechanical properties including auxeticity and
   mutually amplified strength and toughness which can be systematically
   tuned by varying the waviness of the sutural tessellation.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, some new 2D auxetic metamaterials were investigated and
   called octagonal auxetic metamaterials. The structures were examined by
   numerical and experimental approaches and 3D printing additive
   manufacturing technique was employed to fabricate the structures from
   thermoplastic polyurethane elastomer (TPU) which is considered as a
   hyperelastic material. Auxetic behavior was caused by adding small
   triangles and squares to the vertices of the octagonal structure and
   applying high compressive strain. Although the octagonal structure
   showed negative Poisson's ratio at high compressive strain, the results
   suggested that adding triangles to the vertices of the octagonal
   structure as well as increasing the triangle edge length led to higher
   negative Poisson's ratio. In contrast, with small squares adding to the
   vertices of the octagonal structure, Poisson's ratio became slightly
   more negative. In addition, by increasing the square edge length,
   Poisson's ratio measured near zero or even positive values. Moreover, a
   parametric study was carried out by Python 3.6.5 programming language to
   find the best triangle and square edge length which caused the most
   auxeticity.}},

Title = {{An analytical model for star-shaped re-entrant lattice structures with
   the orthotropic symmetry and negative Poisson's ratios}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{145}},
Pages = {{158-170}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{A new analytical model is developed for three types of 2-D periodic
   star-shaped re-entrant lattice structures that possess the orthotropic
   symmetry and exhibit negative Poisson's ratios. Contributions from both
   the re-entrant and connection struts are considered using an energy
   method based on Castigliano's second theorem. Each re-entrant strut is
   treated as a Timoshenko beam, and stretching, transverse shearing and
   bending deformations are all incorporated in the formulation. Unlike
   existing studies, the overlapping of struts at joints is included in
   determining the relative density, which is analytically expressed for
   each lattice type. Closed-form formulas are derived for the effective
   Young's moduli and Poisson's ratios of each type of lattice structure,
   which contain three non-dimensional length ratios, two re-entrant
   angles, one shear correction factor, and Young's modulus and Poisson's
   ratio of the strut material. The new analytical model is validated
   against finite element simulations conducted in the current study and
   two existing analytical models for simpler square lattice structures
   without re-entrant struts. To illustrate the newly developed analytical
   model, a parametric study is conducted to quantitatively show the
   effects of the five geometrical parameters on the effective properties
   of each type of lattice structure. It is found that for the effective
   Poisson's ratios the key controlling parameters are the two re-entrant
   angles, while for the effective Young's moduli all of the geometrical
   parameters can have significant effects except for the external
   connection length ratio. It is demonstrated that through a proper
   selection of the geometrical parameters, vertex connections and strut
   material, it is possible to tailor the effective Poisson's ratios and
   Young's moduli of each type of lattice structure over wide ranges to
   satisfy different needs in various applications.}},

Abstract = {{The bumper system always directly causes the injury of the pedestrian
   leg in the car-pedestrian accidents. Therefore, it is of practical
   significance to optimize the bumper structure to enhance the protective
   effect of the pedestrian leg. Based on the original bumper system, this
   work proposes a novel negative Poisson's ratio energy-absorbing forepart
   with inner hexagonal cellular structure, which is designed at the lower
   leg impact zone between the bumper beam and the cover. The parametric
   model of the negative Poisson's ratio forepart, the lower legform
   impactor model, and the car-pedestrian collision model are firstly
   established. Then, through integrating the response surface method,
   second-order reliability method, and archive-based micro genetic
   algorithm, a reliability optimization design is further conducted for
   the negative Poisson's ratio forepart based on the deterministic

Abstract = {{Fabrics with zero or negative Poisson's ratio are referred as auxetic
   fabrics, which have the unusual property of lateral expansion or zero
   expansion upon stretch. The use of conventional materials and machinery
   to produce auxetic fabrics has gained the interest of researchers in
   recent years. However, this approach is limited to knitted fabrics only.
   The development of auxetic fabric using conventional yarns and weaving
   technology is a research area that is still unaddressed. This paper
   reports a study on the development of a novel class of stretchable
   auxetic woven fabrics by using conventional yarns and weaving machinery.
   The phenomenon of differential shrinkage was successfully employed to
   realize auxetic geometries capable of inducing auxetic behavior in woven
   fabrics, and a series of auxetic woven fabrics were fabricated with
   elastic and non-elastic yarns and a dobby machine. The uni-axial tensile
   tests showed that auxetic woven fabrics developed exhibited zero or
   negative Poisson's ratio over a wide range of longitudinal strain.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, three-dimensional auxetic structures have attracted
   great interest. Generally, three-dimensional auxetic structures are of
   complicate geometries which make them difficult to fabricate, benefiting
   from the development of additive manufacturing technologies, many
   three-dimensional auxetic structures can be made from metals or
   polymers. However, to the authors' knowledge, the additive manufacturing
   technology of fiber reinforced polymer is not fully developed, and none
   three-dimensional auxetic structure made from fiber reinforced polymer
   has been reported before. To integrate the high specific stiffness, high
   specific strength, and light weight merits of high-performance fiber
   reinforced polymer composites into three-dimensional auxetic structures
   with unique properties, research on composite three-dimensional auxetic
   structures made from fiber reinforced polymer should be conducted. This
   paper presents the composite three-dimensional re-entrant auxetic
   structures made from carbon fiber reinforced polymer laminates using an
   interlocking assembly method. The auxetic nature of the composite
   structure has been verified by experimental testing and finite element
   simulations. Based on the finite element models, the dependences of the
   Poisson's ratio and effective compression modulus of the composite
   auxetic three-dimensional re-entrant structure on the re-entrant angle
   have been studied and compared to metal three-dimensional re-entrant
   structure. A comparative study of the Poisson's ratio and specific
   stiffness of carbon fiber reinforced polymer composite auxetic structure
   with the three-dimensional printed polymer and metal auxetic structures
   in literature has also been conducted.}},

Title = {{Discovering structural complexity and its causes: Breeding aggregations
   in horseshoe crabs}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{143}},
Pages = {{177-191}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In some species, especially those that form breeding aggregations, males
   form groups around females vying for fertilizations. These mating groups
   are often highly variable in size even during a single breeding event.
   We examined this variation in the American horseshoe crab, Limulus
   polyphemus, a species in which some females (nesting in pairs) attract
   additional males (satellites) and spawn in groups whereas others spawn
   only with their attached male. The observed distribution of group sizes
   often consists of an overabundance of pairs with no satellite males and
   groups with large numbers of satellites. We characterized this variation
   using well-known models of count data, such as the Poisson and negative
   binomial distributions, and evaluated how operational sex ratio (OSR)
   and pair density contribute to the observed variation. We complemented
   this descriptive approach with spatially explicit simulations of the
   group formation process. By comparing our simulation results to the
   observed breeding aggregation data, we identified how simple behavioural
   rules might contribute to the variation we observe. Those rules amount
   to hypotheses about pair and satellite arrival at the beach and
   satellite sampling of and choice among pairs. We found that the observed
   variation could be explained by a consistent high frequency of females
   that attract satellites in combination with males that sample different
   fractions of the beach as pair density and OSR vary. Furthermore, our
   simulations suggested that males are not choosy in joining pairs on the
   beach, despite variation among pairs in the fertilization success
   satellites can achieve. This suggests that new insights might come from
   investigating the costs and benefits of male choice and the sensory
   mechanisms satellite males use to assess the breeding aggregation before
   coming ashore. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal

Volume = {{45}},

Abstract = {{In statistical modelling, it is often of interest to evaluate
   non-negative quantities that capture heterogeneity in the population
   such as variances, mixing proportions and dispersion parameters. In
   instances of covariate-dependent heterogeneity, the implied homogeneity
   hypotheses are nonstandard and existing inferential techniques are not
   applicable. In this paper, we develop a quasi-score test statistic to
   evaluate homogeneity against heterogeneity that varies with a covariate
   profile through a regression model. We establish the limiting null
   distribution of the proposed test as a functional of mixtures of
   chi-square processes. The methodology does not require the full
   distribution of the data to be entirely specified. Instead, a general
   estimating function for a finite dimensional component of the model,
   that is, of interest is assumed but other characteristics of the
   population are left completely unspecified. We apply the methodology to
   evaluate the excess zero proportion in zero-inflated models for count
   data. Our numerical simulations show that the proposed test can greatly
   improve efficiency over tests of homogeneity that neglect covariate
   information under the alternative hypothesis. An empirical application
   to dental caries indices demonstrates the importance and practical
   utility of the methodology in detecting excess zeros in the data.}},

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{27}},

Abstract = {{Cumulative sum control charts have been used for health surveillance due
   to its efficiency to detect soon small shifts in the monitored series.
   However, these charts may fail when data are autocorrelated. An
   alternative procedure is to build a control chart based on the residuals
   after fitting autoregressive moving average models, but these models
   usually assume Gaussian distribution for the residuals. In practical
   health surveillance, count series can be modeled by Poisson or Negative
   Binomial regression, this last to control overdispersion. To include
   serial correlations, generalized autoregressive moving average models
   are proposed. The main contribution of the current article is to measure
   the impact, in terms of average run length on the performance of
   cumulative sum charts when the serial correlation is neglected in the
   regression model. Different statistics based on transformations, the
   deviance residual, and the likelihood ratio are used to build cumulative
   sum control charts to monitor counts with time varying means, including
   trend and seasonal effects. The monitoring of the weekly number of
   hospital admissions due to respiratory diseases for people aged over 65
   years in the city SAo Paulo-Brazil is considered as an illustration of
   the current method.}},

Abstract = {{ObjectiveThe cognitive model (Hirsch \& Mathews, 2012) and attentional
   control theory (Eysenck \& Derakshan, 2011) postulate that compromised
   executive function (EF) and other cognitive constructs are negatively
   linked to increased excessive and uncontrollable worry, the core symptom
   of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). However, the prospective link
   between neuropsychological constructs and GAD are not well
   understood.MethodsA nationally representative sample of 2605
   community-dwelling adults whose average age was 55.20 (s.d. = 11.41,
   range 33-84; 56.31\% females) participated at baseline and 9-year
   follow-up. Baseline neuropsychological function and symptoms were
   measured using the Brief Test of Adult Cognition by Telephone and
   Composite International Diagnostic Interview - Short Form. Multivariate
   Poisson and negative binomial regression analyses were conducted with 11
   baseline covariates entered simultaneously: age, gender, years of formal
   education, perceived control, hypertension/diabetes, body mass index,
   exercise status, as well as GAD severity, panic disorder severity, and
   depression severity. Those with baseline GAD were also
   removed.ResultsLower Time 1 composite global cognition z-score
   independently predicted higher Time 2 GAD severity and diagnosis {[}odds
   ratio (OR) 0.60, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.40-0.89, p = 0.01].
   Poor inhibition, set-shifting, working memory (WM) updating, inductive
   reasoning, and global cognition sequentially forecasted heightened GAD.
   However, processing speed, verbal WM, verbal fluency, and episodic
   memory did not predict future GAD.ConclusionGlobal cognition, inductive
   reasoning, inhibition, set-shifting, and WM updating EF impairments may
   be distal risk factors for elevated GAD nearly a decade later.}},

   metamaterial properties can be obtained this way using a single base
   material.
   We demonstrate that two closely related simple parametric families based
   on the structure proposed by Sigmund in {[}26] attain good coverage of
   the space of isotropic properties satisfying Hashin-Shtrikman bounds. In
   particular, for positive Poisson's ratio, we demonstrate that
   Hashin-Shtrikman bound can be approximated arbitrarily well, within
   limits imposed by numerical approximation: a strong evidence that these
   bounds are achievable in this case. For negative Poisson's ratios, we
   numerically obtain a bound which we hypothesize to be close to optimal,
   at least for metamaterials with rotational symmetries of a regular
   triangle tiling. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on size effects in periodic mechanical metamaterials
   driven by reversible pattern transformations due to local elastic
   buckling instabilities in their microstructure. Two distinct loading
   cases are studied: compression and bending, in which the material
   exhibits pattern transformation in the whole structure or only
   partially. The ratio between the height of the specimen and the size of
   a unit cell is defined as the scale ratio. A family of shifted
   microstructures, corresponding to all possible arrangements of the
   microstructure relative to the external boundary, is considered in order
   to determine the ensemble averaged solution computed for each scale
   ratio. In the compression case, the top and the bottom edges of the
   specimens are fully constrained, which introduces boundary layers with
   restricted pattern transformation. In the bending case, the top and
   bottom edges are free boundaries resulting in compliant boundary layers,
   whereas additional size effects emerge from imposed strain gradient. For
   comparison, the classical homogenization solution is computed and shown
   to match well with the ensemble averaged numerical solution only for
   very large scale ratios. For smaller scale ratios, where a size effect
   dominates, the classical homogenization no longer applies.}},

Abstract = {{The pressure effects on the mechanical, optoelectronic and

   shifting from indirect to direct nature at the moderate pressure 15 GPa,
   due to which, phonon heating effects during the optical transitions can
   be avoided. Optical parameters such as dielectric constants, refraction
   etc., are discussed for the impinging energy range 0-30 eV. The external
   pressure dependent electrical and thermal conductivities, power factor,
   specific heat capacitance, Hall-coefficient etc. are also investigated
   for 0-800 K. The optoelectronic and thermoelectric natures demonstrate
   BaSiO3 suitability for the renewable energy device applications.}},

Abstract = {{Macro-architectured cellular (MAC) material is defined as a class of
   engineered materials having configurable cells of relatively large
   (i.e., visible) size that can be architecturally designed to achieve
   various desired material properties. Two types of novel MAC materials,
   negative Poisson's ratio material and biomimetic tendon reinforced
   material, were introduced in this study. To estimate the effective
   material properties for structural analyses and to optimally design such
   materials, a set of suitable homogenization methods was developed that
   provided an effective means for the multiscale modeling of MAC
   materials. First, a strain-based homogenization method was developed
   using an approach that separated the strain field into a homogenized
   strain field and a strain variation field in the local cellular domain
   superposed on the homogenized strain field. The principle of virtual
   displacements for the relationship between the strain variation field
   and the homogenized strain field was then used to condense the strain
   variation field onto the homogenized strain field. The new method was
   then extended to a stress-based homogenization process based on the
   principle of virtual forces and further applied to address the discrete
   systems represented by the beam or frame structures of the
   aforementioned MAC materials. The characteristic modes and the stress
   recovery process used to predict the stress distribution inside the
   cellular domain and thus determine the material strengths and failures
   at the local level are also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Solar steam generation, due to its capability of producing clean water
   directly by solar energy, is emerging as a promising eco-friendly and
   energy-efficient technology to address global challenges of water crisis
   and energy shortage. Although diverse materials and architectures have
   been explored to improve solar energy utilization, high efficiency in
   solar steam generation could be accomplished only with external optical
   and thermal management. For the first time, we report a deployable,
   three-dimensional (3D) origami-based solar steam generator capable of
   near full utilization of solar energy. This auxetic platform is designed
   based on Miura-ori tessellation and is able to efficiently recover
   radiative and convective heat loss as well as to trap solar energy via
   its periodic concavity pattern. The 3D solar steam generator device with
   a nanocarbon composite of graphene oxide and carbon nanotubes being
   photo thermal component in this work shows a very strong dependence
   between its solar energy efficiency and surface areal density. The
   device yields an extraordinary solar energy efficiency close to 100\%
   under 1 sun illumination at a highly folded configuration. The 3D
   origami device can withstand a great number of folding and unfolding
   cycles and shows unimpaired solar steam generation performances. The
   unique structural feature of the 3D origami structure offers a new
   insight into the future development of highly efficient and easily
   deployable solar steam generator.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon dioxide (CO2) normally exists in a gaseous molecular state under
   ambient conditions, while two-dimensional (2D) crystals of CO2 have not
   been reported yet. In this work, based on density functional theory and
   the particle swarm optimization method, we unveil two CO2 2D crystals
   with space groups of P4M2 and Amm2. Our results show that these
   structures have excellent thermal, dynamic, and mechanical stability.
   The new structures are insulators with an indirect or direct band gap,
   while the indirect band gap can be tuned to be direct with small
   uniaxial strains. More importantly, the P4M2 structure has an in-plane
   negative Poisson's ratio, which is due to the interaction of the lattice
   symmetry and the local CO4 tetrahedron symmetry. In addition, the Amm2
   sheet has a very large electronic band gap (>9 eV), which is the largest
   in all known 2D materials. Enthalpy curves indicate that these 2D
   structures may be obtained from the ambient phase of CO2 under high
   pressure. This work presents new structures of CO2, and because of their
   excellent performance in terms of stability, mechanical and electronic
   properties, they potentially have broad applications.}},

Abstract = {{After a general introduction on the main aspects of the mechanical
   properties of main-chain liquid-crystal elastomers (MCLCEs) and
   side-chain liquid-crystal elastomers (SCLCEs), new results will be
   presented dealing with several MCLCEs with a cross-linker density C =
   8\%, 6\% and 4\% and with a SCLCE with C = 10\%, all prepared by the
   two-step cross-linking process. A non-SCLCE with bulky side-groups
   similar in shape to the mesogens was also synthesized for comparison
   with the SCLCE. Most of the experiments were performed with a
   piezorheometer allowing the determination of the shear anisotropy of the
   samples by applying shear in a direction parallel (G'(parallel to)) or
   perpendicular (G'(perpendicular to)) thornto the director, and with a
   thermo-elastic device for the E measurements. The main results concern:
   (a) the influence of the supercritical nature of SCLCE and the
   subcritical nature of MCLCEs on the mechanical properties of these
   elastomers, as well as that of SmC domains present in MCLCEs; (b) the
   relationship between the degrees of elongation and of anisotropy deduced
   from the variations of G'(parallel to) and G'(perpendicular to) during
   the poly-domain to mono-domain transition of the 10\% SCLCE and the 8\%
   MCLCE; (c) the determination of the Poisson's ratio showing that it is
   isotropic for the non-SCLCE, with a crossover between 0.5 (classical
   value for rubbers) for small strains and 0.38 for high strains, and
   anisotropic for the 10\% SCLCE and 8\% MCLCE, with values <0.5. The
   particular behaviors of the Poisson's ratios can be explained by
   confinement effects occurring when stretching increases.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials, characterised by a negative Poisson's ratio, have
   properties that are different from most conventional materials. These
   are a result of the constraints on the kinematics of the material's
   basic structural components, and have important technological
   implications. Models of these materials have been studied extensively,
   but theoretical descriptions have remained largely limited to materials
   with an ordered microstructure. Here we investigate whether negative
   Poisson's ratios can arise spontaneously in disordered systems. To this
   end, we develop a quantitative description of the structure in systems
   of connected basic elements, which enables us to analyse the local and
   global responses to small external tensile forces. We find that the
   Poisson's ratios in these disordered systems are equally likely to be
   positive or negative on both the element and system scales. Separating
   the strain into translational, rotational and expansive components, we
   find that the translational strains of neighbouring basic structural
   elements are positively correlated, while their rotations are negatively
   correlated. There is no correlation in this type of system between the
   local auxeticity and local structural characteristics. Our results
   suggest that auxeticity is more common in disordered structures than the
   ubiquity of positive Poisson's ratios in macroscopic materials would
   suggest.}},

Title = {{Stiff auxetics: Hierarchy as a route to stiff, strong lattice based
   auxetic meta-materials}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 20}},
Abstract = {{Using a combination of analytic and computational methods, we examine
   the effect of adding hierarchical substructure to an auxetic lattice.
   Our novel methodology, involving a coarse grain approach, allows for the
   analysis of hierarchically sub-structured lattices where direct
   computation would prove intractable. We show that through hierarchy one
   can create ultra-lightweight auxetic meta-materials of high strength and
   stiffness. Through scaling law arguments, we show that the benefits of
   hierarchical design can also be obtained in the general class of
   bending-dominated lattices. Furthermore, we show that the hierarchical
   structures presented show a wide range of tailorability in their
   mechanical properties, and exhibit increased strength when optimised for
   buckling resistance. Auxetic materials have a broad range of potential
   applications, and thus the creation of ultra-light auxetic
   meta-materials with enhanced stiffness and strength is undoubtedly of
   practical importance.}},

Volume = {{164}},

Month = {{AUG 18}},
Abstract = {{In recent years, 3D structures with negative Poisson's ratio (auxetic)
   have attracted great interest. Many polymer and metal 3D auxetic
   structures have been manufactured using additive manufacturing
   technology, however composite 3D auxetic structures are rarely reported.
   Auxetic structures are normally of low stiffness which causes
   limitations on the structural applications of them. The specific
   stiffness and strength of auxetic structures can be significantly
   improved by making them from high-performance fibre reinforced polymer
   (FRP) composites. Consequently, research of composite 3D auxetic
   structures made from FRP should be conducted. This paper presents the
   composite 3D double-arrow-head (DAH) auxetic structure made from carbon
   fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) using an assembly method. Experimental,
   finite element and theoretical methods are adopted to study the
   mechanical properties of the composite 3D DAH auxetic structures.
   Results show that the Poisson's ratios and effective compression moduli
   of the composite 3D DAH auxetic structures vary depending on the
   compression strain amplitude, and the structures become more auxetic and
   stiffer with the increase of the compression strain. The specific
   stiffness of the composite 3D DAH structure is much higher than that of
   the metal structure. In addition, the dependences of the structures
   Poisson's ratio and effective compression modulus on the geometry
   parameters have also been given. Making auxetic structures from
   high-performance FRP composites can significantly improve their
   mechanical properties which will enable them to have a much wider
   variety of applications.}},

Abstract = {{Thermoplastic composite structures are being widely investigated due to
   their excellent properties such as recycling feasibility and high damage
   tolerance to meet the increasing demand for lightweight engineering
   components. A novel hierarchical thermoplastic composite honeycomb
   cylindrical structures (HTCHCS) with recyclability were designed and
   fabricated using interlocking assembly technique. The quasi-static axial
   compression tests were conducted to investigate the mechanical response
   and energy absorption of HTCHCS. The structural crushing force
   efficiency can be risen from 0.4 to 0.7 after optimizing the placement
   mode of axial ribs. The deformation of HTCHCS were experimentally
   studied and typical deformation modes were obtained. Different from the
   layer-by-layer collapse for HTCHCS with regular ribs, HTCHCS with
   staggered ribs showed negative Poisson' ratio deformation. After large
   imposed crushing displacement (at least 90\%), excellent deformation
   recovery over 80\% initial height was found and reloading carrying and
   energy absorption abilities can reach to 13\% and 12\% of initial ones
   respectively.}},

   electroconductive and auxetic graphene/carbon nanotube hybrid buckypaper}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},

Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{A combination of carbon nanotubes (CNT) and graphene in the form of
   macroscopic hybrid buckypaper (HBP), exhibits a unique set of properties
   that can be exploited for many emerging applications. Here, we present a
   simple, inexpensive and scalable approach for the synthesis of highly
   conductive auxetic graphene/CNT HBP via wet-filtration-zipping and
   demonstrate the electrical, electrochemical and mechanical performance
   (tensile, mode I and mode III fracture) of synthesized HBP. An overall
   increase in electrical conductivity of 247\% is observed for HBP (50
   wt.\% graphene and 50 wt.\% CNT) as compared to BP (100 wt.\% CNT) due
   to effective electronic percolation through the graphene and CNT. As a
   negative electrode for lithium-ion batteries, HBP shows 50\% higher
   gravimetric specific capacity and 89\% lower charge transfer resistance
   relative to BP. The graphene content in the HBP influences the
   mechanical performance providing an auxetic structure to HBP with large
   negative Poisson's ratio. The facile green-chemistry approach reported
   here can be readily applied to any other 1D and 2D materials and solves
   key challenges associated with existing buckypaper manufacturing
   methods. The potential of the synthesis method to integrate with current
   cellulose paper manufacturing technology and its scalability demonstrate
   the novelty of the work for industrial scale production.}},

Title = {{Low Fatigue Dynamic Auxetic Lattices With 3D Printable, Multistable, and
   Tuneable Unit Cells}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{AUG 9}},
Abstract = {{Stress distribution has led to the design of both tough and lightweight
   materials. Truss structures distribute stress well and are commonly used
   to design lightweight materials for applications experiencing low
   strains. In 3D lattices, however, few structures allow high elastic
   compression and tunable deformation. This is especially true for auxetic
   material designs, such as the prototypical re-entrant honeycomb with
   sharp corners, which are particularly susceptible to stress
   concentrations. There is a pressing need for lightweight lattice designs
   that are dynamic, as well as resistant to fatigue. Truss designs based
   on hinged structures exist in nature and delocalize stress rather than
   concentrating it in small areas. They have inspired us to develop
   s-hinge shaped elastic unit cell elements from which new classes of
   architected modular 2D and 3D lattices can be printed or assembled.
   These lattices feature locally tunable Poisson ratios (auxetic), large
   elastic deformations without fatigue, as well as mechanical switching
   between multistable states. We demonstrate 3D printed structures with
   stress delocalization that enables macroscopic 30\% cyclable elastic
   strains, far exceeding those intrinsic to the materials that constitute
   them(6\%). We also present a simple semi-analyticalmodel of the
   deformations which is able to predict the mechanical properties of the
   structures within <5\% error of experimental measurements from a few
   parameters such as dimensions and material properties. Using this model,
   we discovered and experimentally verified a critical angle of the
   s-hinge enabling bistable transformations between auxetic and
   normalmaterials. The dynamicmodeling tools developed here could be used
   for complex 3D designs from any 3D printable material (metals, ceramics,
   and polymers). Locally tunable deformation and much higher elastic
   strains than the parent material would enable the next generation of
   compact, foldable and expandable structures. Mixing unit cells with
   different hinge angles, we designed gradient Poisson's ratio materials,
   as well as ones with multiple stable states where elastic energy can be
   stored in latching structures, offering prospects for multi-functional
   designs. Much like the energy efficient Venus flytrap, such structures
   can store elastic energy and release it on demand when appropriate
   stimuli are present.}},

Abstract = {{Mechanical properties of phosphorene oxides are investigated by using
   density functional theory calculations. Intriguingly, as the oxygen
   coverage approaches 50\%, negative Poisson's ratios are found in the
   in-plane principal directions, originating from the asymmetric atomic
   structure upon oxygen adsorption. It is demonstrated that the structure
   of phosphorene oxide is largely weakened compared with that of pristine
   phosphorene. Our work indicates that certain unconventional mechanical
   properties, such as the negative Poisson's ratio, can be achieved by
   tuning the atomic structure through simple processes, which offers a new
   avenue to design specific properties at the nanoscale.}},

Title = {{Relative age effect and second-tiers: No second chance for later-born
   players}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 8}},
Abstract = {{The main objective of this research was to determine the existence of
   relative age effect (RAE) in five European soccer leagues and their
   second-tier competitions. Even though RAE is a well-known phenomenon in
   professional sports environments it seems that the effect does not
   decline over the years. Moreover, additional information is required,
   especially when taking into account second-tier leagues. Birthdates from
   1,332 first-tier domestic players from France, England, Spain, Germany
   and Italy and birthdates from 1,992 second-tier domestic players for the
   2014/2015 season were taken for statistical analysis. In addition to
   standard statistical tests, the data were analyzed using econometric
   techniques for count data using Poisson and negative binomial
   regressions. The results obtained confirmed a biased distribution of
   birthdates in favor of players born earlier in the calendar year. For
   all of the five first-tier soccer leagues there was an unequal
   distribution of birthdates (France chi(2) = 40.976, P<0.001; England
   chi(2) = 21.892, P = 0.025; Spain chi(2) = 24.690, P = 0.010; Germany
   chi(2) = 22.889, P = 0.018; Italy chi(2) = 28.583, P = 0.003). The
   results for second-tier leagues were similar (France chi(2) = 46.741,
   P<0.001; England chi(2) = 27.301, P = 0.004; Spain chi(2) = 49.745,
   P<0.001; Germany chi(2) = 30.633, P = 0.001; Italy chi(2) = 36.973,
   P<0.001). Econometric techniques achieved similar results: estimated
   effect of month of birth, i.e., long-term RAE on players'
   representativeness, is negative (statistically significant at the 1\%
   level). On average, one month closer to the end of the year reduces the
   logs of expected counts of players by 6.9\%. Assuming this effect as
   linear, being born in the month immediately before the cut-off date
   (i.e., December/August), reduces the logs of expected counts of players
   by approximately 75.9\%. Further, ID (index of discrimination, that is,
   the ratio between the expected counts of players born in the middle of
   the first and the twelfth month of the selection year) is 2.13 and 2.22
   for the first-and second-tier, respectively. In other words, in the top
   five European first-tier and second-tier leagues, one should expect the
   number of players born in the first month of the calendar year to be
   twice the number of those born in the last month. The RAE in the
   second-tiers is the same as in the first-tiers, so it appears that there
   is no second chance for later born players. This reduces the chances to
   recover talented players discarded in youth simply because of lower
   maturity.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{98}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{AUG 7}},
Abstract = {{We report first-principles calculations of electronic and mechanical
   properties of few-layer borophene with the inclusion of interlayer van
   der Waals (vdW) interaction. The anisotropic metallic behaviors are
   preserved from monolayer to few-layer structures. The energy splitting
   of bilayer borophene at Gamma point near the Fermi level is about 1.7
   eV, much larger than the values (0.5-1 eV) of other layered
   semiconductors, indicating much stronger vdW interactions in metallic
   layered borophene. In particular, the critical strains are enhanced by
   increasing the number of layers, leading to much more flexibility than
   that of monolayer structure. On the one hand, because of the buckled
   atomic structures, the out-of-plane negative Poisson's ratios are
   preserved as the layer number increases. On the other hand, we find that
   the in-plane negative Poisson's ratios disappear in layered borophene,
   which is very different from puckered black phosphorus. The negative
   Poisson's ratio will recover if we enlarge the interlayer distance to
   6.3 angstrom. The physical origin behind the change of Poisson's ratios
   is the strong interlayer vdW interaction in layered borophene.}},

Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON GRAPHICS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Deployable structures are physical mechanisms that can easily transition
   between two or more geometric configurations; such structures enable
   industrial, scientific, and consumer applications at a wide variety of
   scales. This paper develops novel deployable structures that can
   approximate a large class of doubly-curved surfaces and are easily
   actuated from a flat initial state via inflation or gravitational
   loading. The structures are based on two-dimensional rigid mechanical
   linkages that implicitly encode the curvature of the target shape via a
   user-programmable pattern that permits locally isotropic scaling under
   load. We explicitly characterize the shapes that can be realized by such
   structures-in particular, we show that they can approximate target
   surfaces of positive mean curvature and bounded scale distortion
   relative to a given reference domain. Based on this observation, we
   develop efficient computational design algorithms for approximating a
   given input geometry. The resulting designs can be rapidly manufactured
   via digital fabrication technologies such as laser cutting, CNC milling,
   or 3D printing. We validate our approach through a series of physical
   prototypes and present several application case studies, ranging from
   surgical implants to large-scale deployable architecture.}},

Abstract = {{Cross-shape piezoelectric patches were originally proposed to improve
   the band-gap properties of acoustic metamaterials with shunting
   circuits. The dispersion curves are characterized through the
   application of finite element method. Also, the theoretical band-gap
   predictions are verified by simulation results obtained from COMSOL. The
   investigation results show that the proposed scheme distinguishes itself
   from the conventional square patches by broader band gaps, whose
   bandwidth is almost doubled. The inherent capacitance of the
   piezoelectric patch is strongly related to the boundary conditions, so
   the local resonant band gap is strongly affected by the shape of
   piezoelectric patches as well. As a result, the band-gap width and
   location of metamaterials with different shape patches are rather
   different, even with the same size patches. Also, negative modulus (NM)
   and Poisson's ratio were observed around the resonant frequencies. The
   transmission properties of finite periods agree well with band-gap
   predictions. An obvious attenuation zone (AZ) is produced around the
   band-gap location, in which the wave propagation is decayed strongly.
   Similarly, the width of AZ of the proposed metamaterial is much larger
   than that of the conventional one. Hence, the proposed scheme
   demonstrates more advantages in the application to vibration isolation
   when compared with the conventional.}},

Abstract = {{Biodegradable stents offer the potential to reduce the in-stent

   polylactic acid (PLA) vascular stents with negative Poisson's ratio

   printing in this study. The effects of stent diameter, wall thickness
   and geometric parameters of arrowhead NPR structure on radial
   compressive property of 3D-printed PLA vascular stent were studied. The
   results showed that the decrease of stent diameter, the increase of wall
   thickness and the increase of the surface coverage could enhance the
   radial force (per unit length) of PLA stent. The radial and longitudinal
   size of PLA stent with NPR structure decreased simultaneously when the
   stent was crimped under deformation temperature. The PLA stent could
   expand in both radial and longitudinal direction under recovery
   temperature. When the deformation temperature and recovery temperature
   were both 65 degrees C, the diameter recovery ratio of stent was more
   than 95\% and the maximum could reach 98\%. The length recovery ratio
   was above 97\%. This indicated the feasibility of utilizing the shape

Title = {{Poisson's ratio of PDMS thin films}},
Journal = {{POLYMER TESTING}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{69}},
Pages = {{375-384}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Despite the fact that a small uncertainty in PDMS Poisson's ratio leads
   to significant errors in traction force microscopy, there is a clear
   lack of data for PDMS films at the scale of 100 mu m, a relevant size
   scale frequently employed in cell mechanics studies. Equally important
   is the need for consideration of the viscoelastic nature of PDMS, as no
   mechanical property - including Poisson's ratio - can be taken as a
   time-independent constant. The foremost challenge for addressing these
   issues is the difficulty of carrying out stress relaxation tests on
   miniature PDMS samples accompanied by non-contact strain measurement
   with a very high spatiotemporal resolution. This study introduces such a
   stress relaxation platform incorporating i) the proper means for the
   application of necessary boundary conditions, ii) a high-precision in
   load measurement, and iii) a non-contact, local strain measurement
   technique based on single particle tracking. During stretching, images
   were recorded at a rate of 18 Hz with a 40 mu m spatial resolution.
   Microsphere-embedded PDMS films as thin as 125 and 155 mu m were
   prepared to study the Poisson's ratio by a local strain microscope.
   After tracing the displacement of microspheres by a single particle
   tracking method and using a strain mapping, Poisson's ratio for 155-mu
   m-thick PDMS was found to decrease from 0.483 +/- 0.034 to 0.473 +/-
   0.040 over a period of 20 min. For 125-mu m-thick PDMS, this reduction
   took place from 0.482 +/- 0.041 to 0.468 +/- 0.038. Moreover, a
   non-monotonic reduction was observed in both cases. This negative
   correlation between Poisson's ratio and relaxation time was found to be
   statistically significant for both thicknesses with p < 0.001. The
   viscoelastic behavior was further characterized through the Burgers
   model. With a measurement field of 597 x 550 mu m(2), this study
   emphasizes the importance of the local investigation of mechanical
   properties. Furthermore, the dependence of transverse strain on a film
   thickness difference of 30 mu m was measured to determine the
   sensitivity of local strain tracking. The inherent high resolution of
   the proposed approach enables one to measure deformations more precisely
   and to observe the temporal evolution of the Poisson's ratio that has
   not been observed before. In addition to the high-precision
   determination of PDMS Poisson's ratio, this work also offers a promising
   pathway for the accurate and time dependent determination of the
   mechanical properties of other soft materials, where similar ambiguities
   exist regarding the mechanical behavior.}},

Abstract = {{By strengthening the pore with material different from that of matrix, a
   new type of negative thermal expansion materials with the re-entrant
   hexagonal honeycomb is designed in this paper. The equivalent Young's
   modulus, Poisson's ratio and the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE)
   are studied by using Timoshenko beam theory and the analytical formulas
   of these equivalent parameters are derived. The results of analytical
   formulas and numerical simulation indicate that the CTE of the material
   can be controlled from positive to negative by changing the geometry
   features and material properties of the structure. Meanwhile, the
   negative Poisson's ratio effect of the original re-entrant honeycomb can
   be preserved. Moreover, this method for designing new metamaterials has
   also been generalized to three-dimensional materials.}},

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{39}},

Pages = {{2747-2754}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Uniaxial compressive tests were carried out to investigate the
   dilatation behaviour of phyllite samples under different loading
   azimuths. There were four types of samples taken from the
   Chengdu-Lanzhou railway. The results showed that the samples generally
   expanded before the peak stress reached, and the dilatation behaviour
   was influenced by the loading azimuth and degree of anisotropy. The
   vertical strain rate was greater than the horizontal one before the
   dilatation occurred, and vice versa after expansion. When the volumetric
   strain of phyllite samples converted from a positive value to a negative
   one, three conditions existed: pre-peak stress, post-peak stress and
   not-converted. Besides, the probability of the conversion was related to
   the participation degree, the form, and the failure mode of the original
   cracks during the loading process. The maximum dilatation rate appeared
   at the moment when the axial strain reached its maximum value, and the
   high azimuth angle was more sensitive to the dilatation capacity. The
   initiation stress of the dilatation was usually low, and the difference
   between the loading azimuth and lithology was large. The deformation and
   failure process of phyllite under loading was significantly reflected by
   the elastic modulus and Poisson ratio which were greatly affected by the
   dilatancy.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives In the UK, people of black ethnicity experience a
   disproportionate burden of HIV and STI. We aimed to assess the
   association of ethnicity with sexual behaviour and sexual health among
   women and heterosexual men attending genitourinary medicine (GUM)
   clinics in England.
   Methods The Attitudes to and Understanding of Risk of Acquisition of HIV
   is a cross-sectional, self-administered questionnaire study of HIV
   negative people recruited from 20 GUM clinics in England, 2013-2014.
   Modified Poisson regression with robust SEs was used to calculate
   adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) for the association between ethnicity
   and various sexual risk behaviours, adjusted for age, study region,
   education and relationship status.
   Results Questionnaires were completed by 1146 individuals, 676 women and
   470 heterosexual men. Ethnicity was recorded for 1131 (98.8\%)
   participants: 550 (48.6\%) black/mixed African, 168 (14.9\%) black/
   mixed Caribbean, 308 (27.2\%) white ethnic groups, 105 (9.3\%) other
   ethnicity. Compared with women from white ethnic groups, black/mixed
   African women were less likely to report condomless sex with a
   non-regular partner (aPR (95\% CI) 0.67 (0.51 to 0.88)), black/mixed
   African and black/mixed Caribbean women were less likely to report two
   or more new partners (0.42 (0.32 to 0.55) and 0.44 (0.29 to 0.65),
   respectively), and black/mixed Caribbean women were more likely to
   report an STI diagnosis (1.56 (1.00 to 2.42)). Compared with men from
   white ethnic groups, black/mixed Caribbean men were more likely to
   report an STI diagnosis (1.91 (1.20 to 3.04)), but did not report risk
   behaviours more frequently. Men and women of black/mixed Caribbean
   ethnicity remained more likely to report STI history after adjustment
   for sexual risk behaviours.
   Discussion Risk behaviours were reported less frequently by women of
   black ethnicity; however, history of STI was more prevalent among
   black/mixed Caribbean women. In black/mixed Caribbean men, higher STI
   history was not explained by ethnic variation in reported risk
   behaviours. The association between STI and black/mixed Caribbean
   ethnicity remained after adjustment for risk behaviours.}},

Abstract = {{By possessing a good capacity for energy absorption and a lightweight
   structure, the negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) structure has very fine
   prospects for application in vehicle engineering. By combining the
   traditional side door impact beam and a NPR structure, a novel side door
   NPR impact beam is first proposed in this work to improve the side
   impact crashworthiness in automobiles. The performance of the side door
   NPR impact beam is first studied in detail by comparison with a
   traditional side door impact beam and aluminum-foam-filled impact beam.
   To make further improvement on the performance of the side door NPR
   impact beam, the multi-objective design optimization while considering
   reliability is also investigated in this work. The parametric model of
   the NPR structure is established to improve modeling efficiency when the
   shape and topology are changed. A Latin hypercube sampling technique,
   orthogonal design, and a response surface model are then combined to
   construct the surrogate models. A radial-based importance sampling
   technique (RBIS) and multi-objective particle swarm optimization
   algorithm (MOPSO) are applied in the inner and outer loop respectively
   to find the optimal multi-objective reliability solutions. The results
   indicate that the side impact crashworthiness is improved remarkably by
   the side door NPR impact beam and the structure is further improved by
   the multi-objective reliability optimization. The studies in this work
   also serve as a good example for other improvements in automobile
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the out-of-plane mechanism of a laminated open-cell
   structure that is exerted by a simple control of the geometric
   configuration. We propose two types of structural units that are
   assembled with beam and column members in a tetragonal system, and with
   the geometric difference between them being the presence of a reinforced
   beam. For the two unit cells, we develop finite element models according
   to a homogenization method and analyze the macroscopic linear and
   nonlinear elastic properties. The numerical results show that the
   cellular structure, which is bridged by additional beams, exhibits
   strong auxeticity with high negative values of Poisson's ratio in the
   lamination direction, while retaining the in-plane negative Poisson's
   ratios. We assess the sensitivity of the linear and nonlinear
   out-of-plane response to changes in the component geometry. Finally, we
   discuss the large deformation behaviors of the out-of-plane mechanisms
   to quantify the amounts of three-dimensional rotations of the internal
   components.}},

Title = {{Suspension mechanical performance and vehicle ride comfort applying a

Abstract = {{Comparing with traditional honeycomb structures, Negative Poisson's
   Ratio (NPR) structures had better mechanical performances in some
   certain respects, especially the shear modulus and fracture toughness.
   However, few publications focused on the cylinder-shape NPR structure,
   which influence the diversity and possibility of NPR structure
   applications. In this paper, a cylindrical NPR structure was introduced
   and applied as a suspension jounce bumper in order to solve the issue
   that the ideal uniaxial compression load-displacement curve sometimes
   cannot be realized by traditional Polyurethane (PU) jounce bumper. The
   load-displacement curve of NPR jounce bumper was proved to be smoother
   and more ideal than that of traditional jounce bumper. Nevertheless, the
   influences of NPR jounce bumper on the suspension mechanical performance
   and vehicle ride comfort were not comprehended yet. In this study, the
   traditional and NPR jounce bumpers were both assembled into virtual
   prototypes of Macpherson, double wishbone and multi-link suspensions to
   conduct single wheel travel virtual tests. The results indicated that
   NPR jounce bumper can achieve more ideal wheel force vs. jounce height
   curve without adjusting free travel, which is beneficial to spare
   precise suspension space. Furthermore, a jounce bumper evaluation method
   using pulse ride comfort was proposed in this paper. The virtual ride
   comfort tests of travelling through bump and pothole were conducted
   using established vehicle virtual prototype. The maximum vertical
   accelerations and weighted root mean square (RMS) of acceleration of
   vehicle centroid at most speeds were reduced applying NPR jounce bumper.
   Thus, the NPR jounce bumper can apparently improve vehicle ride comfort.}},

   Simulation}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS IN CIVIL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Previous research has proved that paraffin has a negative effect on the
   mechanical properties of asphalt binder; however, until now there are
   very few studies on the fundamental mechanisms on a microscale. To study
   the effect of paraffin on the microproperties of asphalt binder, three
   molecular asphalt binder models with different paraffin contents and two
   molecular models of SBS-modified asphalt binders are created in this
   paper. The glass transition temperature is then simulated by means of a
   molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, indicating a significant reduction
   of low-temperature stability due to paraffin. Simulations of density,
   Young's moduli, Poisson's ratio, bulk moduli, and shear moduli are also
   conducted. The results show that paraffin can influence the mechanical
   properties substantially, and reduces the high-temperature stability of
   asphalt binders. Simulation results on the self-healing behavior of
   asphalt binder with varying paraffin contents demonstrate that paraffin
   significantly slows the self-healing behavior rate. Based on the
   molecular simulation results, it is suggested that the paraffin content
   in asphalt binder should be maintained at a controlled minimum amount.

Title = {{Compressive deformation mechanism of honeycomb-like graphene aerogels}},
Journal = {{CARBON}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{134}},
Pages = {{398-410}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Graphene aerogels (GAs) are a kind of advanced graphene assemblies,
   which are quite elastic and can easily restore their original form after
   compression. The macroscale compression behavior of the GAs is the
   result of microstructural evolution of the graphene sheets. In this
   paper, the microstructural compression response of honeycomb-like GAs is
   investigated via coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) method. Based
   on the coarse-grained (CG) model of a single-layer graphene,
   honeycomb-like structures can be built and arranged layer-by-layer to
   form the complete GA model. CGMD simulations presented in this work are
   carried out with a TersoffCG potential, which was developed specifically
   for single-layer graphene. The effects of layer number, size of the
   graphene sheets and the interlaminar overlap pattern on the compressive
   behavior of the GAs are studied. Moreover, the stress distribution in
   graphene networks of the GAs during the compression process is analyzed.
   Different microscale strain concentrations and stress localizations are
   discovered in the GAs with different network patterns. Furthermore, a
   negative Poisson's ratio of the models within a certain range of
   compressive strain is found, which is related to both the
   microstructural arrangement and the deformation of graphene sheet. (C)

Title = {{Highly negative Poisson's ratio in a flexible two-dimensional tungsten
   carbide monolayer}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{28}},
Month = {{JUL 28}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic materials have numerous promising engineering applications such
   as fracture resistance and energy storage due to their negative
   Poisson's ratios (NPRs). However, compared to materials possessing
   positive Poisson's ratios (PPRs), auxetic materials are rare. In this
   paper, by employing first principles calculations, we found a high NPR
   two-dimensional (2D) material, tungsten carbide (W2C), in the transition
   metal carbides (MXenes). Our results of the relatively moderate Young's
   modulus and fracture strength as well as the critical strain showed that
   the 2D monolayer W2C is an extraordinary flexible material. Our DFT
   results also demonstrated that W2C possesses high NPRs while Hf2C and
   Ta2C have PPRs. Furthermore, the mechanically induced deformation
   mechanism and the NPR formation mechanism of W2C have been proposed.
   Such an intrinsic NPR in W2C is attributed to the strong coupling
   between the C-p and W-d orbitals in the pyramid structural unit. The
   mechanically induced deformation mechanism and the PPR formation
   mechanism of Hf2C have also been determined. The intrinsic NPR for W2C
   transforms to PPR upon the surface functionalization induced. The
   behavior occurs due to the W-C interaction weakening. The excellent NPR
   in the 2D MXene material combined with other outstanding properties such
   as the metallic state would bring about its promising engineering
   prospects, ranging from the metal-ion battery, to automobiles and
   aircraft.}},

Abstract = {{The paper is concerned with mechanical behaviour characterisation of
   auxetic cellular structures built from inverted tetrapods. The auxetic
   cellular structures were fabricated from the Ti-6Al-4 V alloy powder

   specimens were experimentally subjected to different loading conditions
   by varying the loading direction and velocity (strain rate). In
   addition, the influence of the porosity on the mechanical response and
   deformation behaviour was analysed based on experimental compression
   tests supported by infrared thermography. The experimental results show
   that the porosity and loading direction have a major influence on the
   mechanical response, while the strain rate influence is negligible at
   analysed strain rates. The experimental results were also used to
   validate the computational lattice model of analysed structures computed
   by the LS-DYNA finite element code. The experimental and computational
   results were in good agreement for most of analysed geometries and

Abstract = {{In this work we present a high-throughput first-principles study of
   elastic properties of bulk and monolayer materials mainly using the
   vdW-DF-optB88 functional. We discuss the trends on the elastic response
   with respect to changes in dimensionality. We identify a relation
   between exfoliation energy and elastic constants for layered materials
   that can help to guide the search for vdW bonding in materials. We also
   predicted a few novel materials with auxetic behavior. The uncertainty
   in structural and elastic properties due to the inclusion of vdW
   interactions is discussed. We investigated 11 067 bulk and 257 monolayer
   materials. Lastly, we found that the trends in elastic constants for
   bulk and their monolayer counterparts can be very different. All the
   computational results are made publicly available at easy-to-use
   websites: https://www.ctcms.nist.gov/similar to knc6/JVASP.html and
   https://jarvis.nist.gov/. Our dataset can be used to identify stiff and

Abstract = {{When over-expanded, the hexagonal honeycomb (HH) turns to bendable
   quadrilateral honeycomb. The ove-rexpanded honeycomb (OH) is
   anisotropic. In-plane crushing behaviors of the OH were revealed by
   experiments. Compressed along arm-chair direction, the OH has three
   deformation modes, turning from quadrilateral honeycomb, re-entrant
   hexagonal honeycomb to triangular honeycomb. The Poisson's ratio turns
   from zero, negative to positive. Compressed along the beeline direction,
   the OH is crushed at shear buckling band. The equivalent strength and
   modulus change with the compression direction and consistently predicted
   by structural models. Coated with carbon powder based absorbing
   material, the OH turns to a multifunctional material. The microwave
   absorbing behavior changes with the relative density and the thickness
   of the OH. Oblique incidence promotes the microwave absorption and it is
   suggested that the incident angle should not be larger than 45 degrees.
   Pasting GFRC skin, the OH-core sandwich panel still has excellent radar
   absorption but it will be decreased when the skin is thickening. Through
   the research, radar absorbing OH has the capabilities of load bearing
   and electromagnetic energy absorbing. Furthermore, the OH is bendable
   along arm-chair direction and convenient to make cylindrical sandwich
   shell.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials are a class of materials possessing a negative
   Poisson's ratio. Here, we established a novel method for preparing
   auxetic foam from closed-cell polymer foam based on the steam
   penetration and condensation (SPC) process. Using polyethylene (PE)
   closed-cell foam as an example, the foams treated by the SPC process
   presented a negative Poisson's ratio during stretching and compression
   testing. The effect of steam-treated temperature and time on the
   conversion efficiency of negativePoisson's ratio foam was investigated,
   and the mechanism of the SPC method for forming a reentrant structure
   was discussed. The results indicated that the presence of enough steam
   within the cells was a critical factor for the negative Poisson's ratio
   conversion in the SPC process. The pressure difference caused by steam
   condensation was the driving force for the conversion from conventional
   closed-cell foam to the negative-Poisson's ratio foam. Furthermore, the
   applicability of the SPC process for fabricating auxetic foam was
   studied by replacing PE foam by polyvinyl chloride foam with a
   closed-cell structure or replacing water steam by ethanol steam. The
   results verified the universality of the SPC process for fabricating
   auxetic foams from conventional foams with a closed-cell structure. In
   addition, we explored the potential application of the obtained auxetic
   foams by the SPC process in the fabrication of shape-memory polymer
   materials.}},

Journal = {{AEROSPACE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{78}},
Pages = {{471-479}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, buckling analysis of two-directionally porous beam is
   conducted. Based on the available results of Young's modulus and mass
   density via Gaussian random field theory, a new two-directionally porous
   beam model is developed. With the help of Euler-Bernoulli beam theory
   and minimum total potential energy principle, the equilibrium equations
   for nonlinear and linear buckling are derived. The numerical solutions
   of critical buckling loads for different porosity distribution patterns
   can be obtained by generalized differential quadrature method. The final
   numerical results exhibit that more porosities near the middle surface
   or the two edges of beam can lead to a larger critical buckling load
   when the same total volume fraction of porosity is in different porosity
   distribution patterns. The effect of porosity distribution in thickness
   direction is more dominated on the critical buckling load than that of
   the axial porosity distribution. Moreover, the critical buckling load
   becomes more sensitive to aspect ratio of beam and total volume fraction
   of the porosity when increasing mode number. The critical buckling load
   of two-directionally porous beam depends not only on bending coefficient
   (like the one-directionally porous beam), but also on first and second
   derivatives of the bending coefficient. (C) 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Abstract = {{A comprehensive experimental investigation was performed to study the
   dynamic compressive constitutive response of novel auxetic
   Kevlar((R))/epoxy laminated composites. Strain rate response was
   investigated using the split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) test setup.
   Laminated composites were fabricated using the vacuum infusion process.
   Short Nylon fibers were flocked between the laminates with different
   flock densities and flock length. For obtaining dynamic force
   equilibrium in SHPB experiments, a copper pulse shaper was used to
   increase the rising time of incident pulse. To have a comparison, woven
   Kevlar((R))/epoxy composites were also characterized at similar strain
   rates. In addition, quasi-static tests were also performed on both woven
   and auxetic laminated composites for completeness of the study. For
   quasi-static loading conditions, auxetic composites showed higher peak
   strain and lower peak stress compared to woven composites. For
   non-flocked composites, both auxetic and woven composites showed rate
   dependency. Woven composites provided 353\% increase in peak stress when
   the strain rate increased from 1200 s(-1) (low) to 3300 s(-1) (high).
   However, in the same conditions, auxetic composites showed only 155\%
   increase in peak stress. For different flocking conditions, woven
   composites showed rate dependency for all strain rates, but auxetic
   composites demonstrated rate dependency only from low to medium strain
   rates. Both auxetic and woven composites experienced shear failure under
   quasi-static compression, where auxetic composites failed at higher
   shear angle of 37(degrees), but woven composites had a failure angle of
   30(degrees). For impact loads, under no flocking condition, woven
   composites did undergo severe edge failure at all strain rates, but
   auxetic composites showed a sign of edge failure only at high strain
   rates. With the flocking condition, auxetic composites had through
   thickness shear failure and woven composites experienced splitting and
   fibrillation of Kevlar((R)) fibers.}},

Abstract = {{Soft network materials constructed with horseshoe microstructures
   represent a class of bio-inspired synthetic materials that can be
   tailored precisely to match the nonlinear, J-shaped, stress-strain
   curves of human skins. Under a large level of stretching, the nonlinear
   deformations associated with the drastic changes of microstructure
   geometries can lead to an evident mechanical anisotropy, even for
   honeycomb and triangular lattices with a sixfold rotational symmetry.
   Such anisotropic mechanical responses are essential for certain targeted
   applications of these synthetic materials. By introducing appropriate
   periodic boundary conditions that apply to large deformations, this work
   presents an efficient computational model of soft network materials
   based on the analyses of representative unit cells. This model is
   validated through comparison of predicted deformed configurations with
   full-scale finite element analyses (FEA) for different loading angles
   and loading strains. Based on this model, the anisotropic mechanical
   responses, including the nonlinear stress-strain curves and Poisson's
   ratios, are systematically analyzed for three representative lattice
   topologies (square, triangular and honeycomb). An analytic solution of
   the geometry-based critical strain was found to show a good
   correspondence to the critical transition point of the calculated
   J-shaped stress-strain curve for different network geometries and
   loading angles. Furthermore, the nonlinear Poisson's ratio, which can be
   either negative or positive, was shown to depend highly on both the
   loading angle and the loading strain.}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The weak stiffness and strength of materials with negative Poisson's
   ratio limits their application. In this paper, three types of novel
   lattices with negative Poisson's ratio are proposed to improve not only
   stiffness and strength but also energy absorption capacity by embedding
   different ribs into a classic re-entrant structure. Unit cell analyses
   show these novel lattices have significantly increased Young's modulus
   along the loading direction, and Type C can maintain sufficient negative
   Poisson's ratio performance compared with the base lattice. In addition,
   the novel lattices exhibit higher yield stress, plateau stress and

Abstract = {{BackgroundIncluding twins in randomised trials leads to non-independence
   or clustering in the data. Clustering has important implications for
   sample size calculations, yet few trials take this into account.
   Estimates of the intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC), or the
   correlation between outcomes of twins, are needed to assist with sample
   size planning. Our aims were to provide ICC estimates for infant
   outcomes, describe the information that must be specified in order to
   account for clustering due to twins in sample size calculations, and
   develop a simple tool for performing sample size calculations for trials
   including twins.
   MethodsICCs were estimated for infant outcomes collected in four
   randomised trials that included twins. The information required to
   account for clustering due to twins in sample size calculations is
   described. A tool that calculates the sample size based on this
   information was developed in Microsoft Excel and in R as a Shiny web
   app.
   ResultsICC estimates ranged between -0.12, indicating a weak negative
   relationship, and 0.98, indicating a strong positive relationship
   between outcomes of twins. Example calculations illustrate how the ICC
   estimates and sample size calculator can be used to determine the target
   sample size for trials including twins.
   ConclusionsClustering among outcomes measured on twins should be taken
   into account in sample size calculations to obtain the desired power.
   Our ICC estimates and sample size calculator will be useful for
   designing future trials that include twins. Publication of additional
   ICCs is needed to further assist with sample size planning for future
   trials.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To determine whether low levels of recall lead to increased
   interval cancers and the magnitude of this effect.
   Materials and Methods: The authors retrospectively analyzed
   prospectively collected data from the UK National Health Service Breast
   Screening Programme during a 36-month period (April 1, 2005 to March 31,
   2008), with 3-year follow-up in women aged 50-70 years. Data on recall,
   cancers detected at screening, and interval cancers were available for
   each of the 84 breast screening units and for each year (n= 252). The
   association between interval cancers and recalls was modeled by using
   Poisson regression on aggregated data and according to age (5-year
   intervals) and screening type (prevalent vs incident).
   Results: The authors analyzed 5 126 689 screening episodes,
   demonstrating an average recall to assessment rate (RAR) of 4.56\%
   (range, 1.64\%-8.42\%; standard deviation, 1.15\%), cancer detection
   rate of 8.1 per 1000 women screened, and interval cancer rate (ICR) of
   3.1 per 1000 women screened. Overall, a significant negative association
   was found between RAR and ICR (Poisson regression coefficient: 20.039
   {[}95\% confidence interval: 20.062, 20.017]; P=.001), with
   approximately one fewer interval cancer for every additional 80-84
   recalls. Subgroup analysis revealed similar negative correlations in
   women aged 50-54 years (P=.002), 60-64 years (P=.01), and 65-69 years
   (P=.008) as well as in incident screens (P=.001) and prevalent screens
   (P=.04). No significant relationship was found in women aged 55-59 years
   (P=.46).
   Conclusion: There was a statistically significant negative correlation
   between RAR and ICR, which suggests the merit of a minimum threshold for
   RAR. (c) RSNA, 2018}},

Abstract = {{Silicon (Si) electrodes possess a theoretical specific capacity nearly
   ten times that of current graphite electrodes used in lithium ion
   batteries. However, lithiation and delithiation induce large volume
   changes within the Si, resulting in cracking and eventual capacity loss
   with cycling. Recent experimental evidence indicates that the presence
   of nanoporosity may mitigate capacity fade. By implementing a scalable
   differential effective medium approach, we elucidate the effects of
   nanoporosity upon the mechanical properties of fully-lithiated
   amorpohous Si anode films. Our analytical findings suggest that
   increased pore volume fraction significantly alters the mechanical
   properties of nanofilms and enhances anode survivability. Meanwhile, the
   auxetic limit imposes an upper bound on porosity specific fracture
   toughening. Overall, the results of this paper provide design guidelines
   for multilayered nanoporous Si thin films with increased capacity
   retention.}},

Abstract = {{Optimal design of porous and periodic microstructures through topology
   identification of the associated periodic unit cell (PUC) constitutes
   the topic of this work. Here, the attention is confined to two-phase
   heterogeneous materials in which the topology identification of
   manufacturable 3D-PUC is conducted by means of a topology optimization
   technique. The associated objective function is coupled with 3D
   numerical homogenization approach that connects the elastic properties
   of the 3D-PUC to the target product. The topology optimization
   methodology that is adopted in this study is the combination of solid
   isotropic material with penalization (SIMP) method and optimality
   criteria algorithm (OCA), referred to as SIMP-OCA methodology. The
   fairly simple SIMP-OCA is then generalized to handle the topology design
   of 3D manufacturable microstructures of cubic and orthotropic symmetry.
   The performance of the presented methodology is experimentally validated
   by fabricating real prototypes of extremal elastic constants using
   additive manufacturing. Experimental evaluation is performed on two
   designed microstructures: an orthotropic sample with Young's moduli
   ratios E-2/E-1 = 2.5, E-3/E-1 = 2 and a cubic sample with negative
   Poisson's ratio of -0.19. In all practical examples studied, laboratory
   measurements are in reasonable agreement with the prescribed values;
   thus, corroborating the applicability of the proposed methodology.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, 2D hierarchical re-entrant cellular structures with
   Voronoi substructures were proposed. Their Poisson's ratios and energy
   absorption capacities (in-plane) were studied using the finite-element
   method. The effects of geometric parameters (Voronoi sub structure
   irregularity, k, concave angle, theta, ratio of cell wall thickness to
   cell height, omega) on the lattice mechanical properties were
   investigated. Results showed that Poisson's ratio first decreased and
   then increased with an increasing theta when k is less than 0.5. A
   minimum Poisson's ratio of approximately 0.315 was achieved when k = 0.5
   and theta = 60 degrees. The 2D hierarchical re-entrant lattice structure
   exhibited a maximum energy absorption capacity when k = 0.2 and omega =
   1/3, which is 3.9 times higher than that of the traditional re-entrant
   structure with solid ribs and of identical relative density. Copyright

Abstract = {{This work discusses the concept of allowing the control of the stiffness
   of a particular class of re-entrant auxetic magneto-mechanical
   metamaterials through the introduction of magnets to the system. It is
   shown, through experimental testing backed up by a theoretical model,
   that the appropriate insertion of magnets in such a system will alter
   its stiffness, possibly even making it exhibit `negative stiffness'.
   This leads to a completely different behaviour of the structure in terms
   of stability. It is also reported that the investigated mechanical
   metamaterials may exhibit both negative stiffness and negative Poisson's
   ratio at the same time. Moreover, it is shown that the effect which
   magnets have on the stiffness of the system may be fine-tuned upon
   replacing magnets with electromagnets. Such systems have the potential
   to be used in a wide range of practical applications such as vibration
   damping devices where achieving a negative stiffness is of fundamental
   importance.}},

Title = {{Mechanical properties of frozen rock mass with two diagonal intersected

Abstract = {{Based on previous research results, this paper investigated the
   influence of fracture morphology on mechanical properties and failure
   modes of rock mass with two diagonal intersected fractures. This study
   carried out a series of triaxial compression tests on rock-like
   specimens with two crossed fractures under negative temperature,
   concluded the following conclusions. The strength and failure modes of
   rock mass are significantly influenced by the dips of two crossed
   fractures. The strength of rock mass with two fractures cannot simply be
   estimated using the method that was developed for the rock mass with a
   single fracture. When the intersecting angle is less than 30 degrees,
   the failure plane initiates at the tip of ``artificial ruptures{''} and
   extends to the upper and lower ends of the specimen. In case of a higher
   dip and intersecting angle ranging from 30 degrees to 60 degrees, the
   failure plane propagates along one of these two fractures. The
   mechanical parameters of rock mass are not only related to the trace
   length, but also depend on the trace length ratio. One could roughly
   calculate the strength parameters using the approximation proposed in
   this paper. For the rock mass with a trace length ratio <0.3 (short
   trace length/long trace length), the failure mode is dependent on the
   fracture with a longer trace length. When the trace length becomes
   significant and the trace length ratio approximates to 1, the failure
   plane propagates along two fractures, where an X-shaped failure pattern
   is presented. For the rock mass with moderate fractures and a trace
   length ratio of approximately 1, the failure mode is independent on
   fractures, which is similar to the damage pattern of intact rock. The
   strength and elastic modulus of rock mass decrease with the increase of
   spacing between fractures, while Poisson's ratio is independent on the
   spacing. The failure mode can be determined by the area of triangle
   created by two fractures. Damage occurs at the smaller triangle area
   first, and propagates with the two sides of the larger triangle. (C)

Abstract = {{Men who have sex with men (MSM), who have heterogeneous HIV-acquisition

   initially HIV-negative MSM participants for more than 1378.5
   person-years, to develop an empiric risk score for targeting PrEP
   delivery. Independent predictors of incident HIV-1 infection in this
   cohort were an age of 18-24 years, having only male sex partners, having
   receptive anal intercourse, having any unprotected sex, and having group
   sex. Poisson model coefficients were used to assign a numeric score to
   each statistically significant predictor. A risk score of ae 1
   corresponded to an HIV-1 incidence of ae 2.2 {[}95\% confidence interval
   (CI) 1.2-4.1] and identified 81.3\% of the cohort participants as being
   at high risk for HIV-1 acquisition. The area under the receiver

Abstract = {{A single grain can contract or expand in the transverse direction when
   it is stretched. It becomes complex when the single grain is embedded in
   a stretched polycrystal, due to the grain neighborhood effect, which can
   outweigh the lateral contraction/expansion of that grain itself. Here,
   we performed numerical simulations to elucidate such grain-to-grain
   interaction effects on the lattice strain behavior. For individual
   grains in a polycrystal, pseudo Poisson's ratio is defined. Ratios of
   Poisson's ratio over pseudo Poisson's ratio were employed to indicate
   the difference between the cases of the grain deformation with and
   without the constraint imposed from the neighboring grains. The
   high-stress spots and the sense of the stress components can be
   identified with a high possibility according to the proposed ratios.
   Most of the identified high-stress spots feature tensile stresses in
   three directions, while some of them feature the compressive stress in
   one transverse direction and a negative Poisson's ratio. For the latter,
   a strong grain-to-grain interaction during the plastic stage of
   deformation is found. These grains induce the reversal of the lattice
   strain evolution curve for the measured < 002 >//TD, which is often
   found in the literature and in the data of neutron diffraction.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Mycoplasma genitalium can result in pelvic inflammatory
   disease and adverse pregnancy outcomes. We analyzed data collected from
   a prospective study of asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis (BV) to
   determine the natural history of M. genitalium.
   Methods. Women aged 15-25 years, with asymptomatic BV and >= 2 risk
   factors for sexually transmitted infection were recruited from 10 sites
   throughout the United States. Vaginal swab samples were collected at
   enrollment and through home-based testing every 2 months over 12 months.
   M. genitalium nucleic acid amplification testing was performed for M.
   genitalium using transcription- mediated assays (Hologic). The
   prevalence, incidence, and persistence of M. genitalium, defined as all
   positive specimens during follow-up, were estimated with 95\% confidence
   intervals (CIs). Adjusted odds ratios (AOR) were calculated using
   logistic and Poisson regression to evaluate participant characteristics
   associated with M. genitalium infection.
   Results. Among 1139 women, 233 were M. genitalium positive, for a
   prevalence of 20.5\% (95\% CI, 18.2\%-22.9\%); 42 of 204 had persistent
   M. genitalium (20.6\%). Among 801 M. genitalium-negative women at
   baseline, the M. genitalium incidence was 36.6 per 100 person-years
   (95\% CI, 32.4-41.3). Black race (AOR, 1.92; 95\% CI, 1.09-3.38), age <=
   21 years (1.40; 1.03-1.91), and prior pregnancy (1.36; 1.00-1.85) were
   associated with prevalent M. genitalium; only black race was associated
   with incident M. genitalium (P =.03).
   Conclusions. We identified high rates of prevalent, incident, and
   persistent M. genitalium infections among young, high-risk women with
   asymptomatic BV, supporting the need for clinical trials to evaluate the
   impact of M. genitalium screening on female reproductive health
   outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic scaffolds, that is, scaffolds that can display negative
   Poisson's ratio, have unique physical properties and can expand
   transversally when axially strained or contract under compression.
   Auxetic materials have been used for bioprostheses and artery stents due
   to the enhanced compressive strength and shear stiffness. In vascular
   tissue engineering, auxetic scaffolds allow the widening of blood
   vessels when blood flows through (creating compressive stress) to
   prevent the blockage. However, the influence of auxetic materials on the
   cellular fate decision in local environment is unclear. In this study,
   auxetic polyurethane foams were used to support vascular differentiation
   from pluripotent stem cells. The expression of alkaline phosphatase,
   Oct-4, and Nanog was lower after 4days of differentiation for the cells
   grown in auxetic scaffolds. Higher expression of vascular markers CD31
   and VE-cadherin was observed for the cells from auxetic scaffolds
   compared with those from the scaffolds before auxetic conversion. Little
   influence on the expression of cardiac marker -actinin was observed. The
   vascular cells secreted extracellular matrix proteins vitronectin and
   laminin and expressed membrane-bound matrix metalloproteinase 9. The
   examination of Yes-associated protein expression indicated more
   cytoplasmic retention in the cells from auxetic scaffolds compared with
   those from regular scaffolds, suggesting that the auxetic scaffolds may
   affect cellular contraction. This study demonstrates a novel 3-D culture
   based on auxetic scaffolds for vascular differentiation and provides a
   platform to study the influence of biophysical microenvironments on
   differentiation of pluripotent stem cells. The outcome of this study has
   implications for regenerative medicine and drug discovery.}},

   excellent energy absorption capability of auxetic structure, applying
   auxetic structure as sandwich panel core for blast protection purpose is
   a promising field. However, existing in-plane configuration of
   two-dimensional auxetic honeycomb core always represent anisotropic
   behaviour. In this paper, a novel sandwich panel with three-dimensional
   double-V Auxetic (DVA) structure core, which can produce isotropic
   mechanical behavior, was proposed for air blast protection purpose. Its
   primary structural parameters and their relations were discussed, and a
   parametric numerical model was established. In order to reduce both the
   dynamic response under air blast loading and mass, the design variables
   and objective function of the DVA core optimization problem were
   confirmed, then parametric optimization was conducted based on Latin
   Hypercube Sampling (LHD) method, Gaussian process metamodel (GPM) and
   multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm (MOPSO). Finally,
   it is proved that the applied optimization process is efficient and can
   obtain accurate optimum points. The proposed DAV core sandwich panel
   performed much better both in lightweight and protection than solid
   plate and has an apparent merit in lightweight aspect compared with
   square honeycomb core sandwich panel.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Little is known regarding barriers to hepatitis C virus
   (HCV) treatment among people who inject drugs (PWID) in low-resource
   settings, particularly in the era of direct-acting antiviral therapies.
   Methods: Between March, 2015 August, 2016, a cross-sectional survey was
   administered to community-based PWID in Chennai, India to examine the
   HCV care continuum and associated barriers. Adjusted prevalence ratios
   (APR) were estimated by multivariable Poisson regression with robust
   variance.
   Results: All participants were male (n = 541); 152 participants had HCV
   mono-infection and 61 participants had HIV/HCV co-infection. Only one
   HCV mono-infected and one HIV/HCV co-infected participant was linked to
   HCV care. Overall, there was moderate knowledge of HCV disease but poor
   knowledge of HCV treatment. Higher total knowledge scores were
   negatively associated with HIV/HCV co-infection (vs. HCV
   mono-infection), though this was not statistically significant in
   adjusted analysis (APR = 0.71 {[}95\%CI = 0.47-1.061). Participants >=
   45 years (APR = 0.73 {[}95\%CI = 0.58-0.92]) and participants with
   HIV/HCV co-infection (APR = 0.64 {[}95\%CI = 0.47-0.87]) were less
   willing to take weekly interferon injections for 12 weeks. Willingness
   to undergo HCV treatment improved with decreasing duration of therapy,
   higher perceived efficacy, and use of pills vs. interferon, though
   willingness to use interferon improved with decreasing duration of
   therapy. Most participants preferred daily visits to a clinic for HCV
   treatment versus receiving a month's supply. Participants >= 45 years
   (vs. < 45 years; APR = 0.70 {[}95\%CI = 0.56-0.88]) and participants
   with HIV/HCV co-infection (APR = 0.75 {[}95\%CI = 0.57-0.98]) were less
   likely to intend on seeking HCV care. Common reasons for not having
   already seen a provider for HCV treatment differed by HIV status, and
   included low perceived need for treatment (HCV-mono-infected), competing
   money/health priorities and costs/fears about treatment
   (HIV/HCV-co-infected).
   Conclusion: Residual gaps in HCV knowledge and continuing negative
   perceptions related to interferon-based therapy highlight the need to
   scale-up educational initiatives. Readiness for HCV treatment was
   particularly low among HIV/HCV co-infected and older PWID, emphasizing
   the importance of tailored treatment strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Taking doubly charged particles, positive-negative charge pair
   production and the effects of volume fluctuations into account, the
   Poisson baseline of the fluctuations of net-charge is studied. Within
   the Poisson baseline, the cumulants of net-charge are derived. Comparing
   to the Skellam baseline of net-charge, we infer that doubly charged
   particles broaden the distributions of net-charge, while
   positive-negative charge pairs narrow the distributions. Using the
   ratios of doubly charged particles and positive-negative charge pairs
   from neutral resonance decays to the total positive charges from
   THERMINATOR 2, the first four orders of moments and the corresponding
   moment products are calculated in the Poisson baseline for Au + Au
   collisions at root s(NN) = 200 GeV at RHIC/STAR. We find that the
   standard deviation is mainly influenced by the resonance decay, while
   the third and fourth order moments and corresponding moment products are
   mainly modified and fit the data of RHIC/STAR much better after
   including the effects of volume fluctuations.}},

Abstract = {{Knitted auxetic fabrics (AF) are in common practice but their stability
   and thickness are major problems in commercial applications. Therefore,
   a simple method of developing woven AF is proposed here. Differential
   shrinking property of different weaves is utilized to visualize auxetic
   honey comb geometry in fabric structure. Based on this fabric structure,
   auxeticity is induced in 2-D-woven fabric. AF is developed using
   conventional nonauxetic materials (i.e., cotton in warp and elastane
   {[}Lycra] yarn in the weft). Auxetic nature and auxetic structure in the
   fabric were characterized by microscope. Comfort properties (air
   permeability, thermal resistance, stiffness, and wicking) of AF were
   compared with conventional nonauxetic fabrics (NAF). Piezoresistive
   nature of conductive AF and NAF is also compared. AF showed superior
   comfort properties and higher sensitivity as compared to conventional
   NAF. Based on results, AF can be considered better replacement of
   conventional NAF in wearable and medical applications.}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Numerous studies proposed the possible use of auxetic periodic
   structures in engineering applications. The regular cellular structures
   with several nodes in a unit cell of the lattice are referred to as
   multilattices. In this work, a homogenization procedure was applied to
   three types of plane multilattices: conventional and re-entrant
   honeycombs (REH), double arrowheads, and semi REH constructed from
   elastic ribs. It was shown, that for all considered lattices the
   components of effective tensors of elasticity can be obtained in an
   explicit way in the frames of the same approach taking stretching,
   bending and shear of the ribs into account. As a result, equivalent
   elastic in-plane properties were found analytically as the functions of
   geometrical parameters of the lattices and the elastic parameters of the
   ribs. The estimation of the limits for the elastic properties was also
   performed. It was investigated how the condition of constant density
   changes the dependence of the elastic constants on the angles between
   the nodes. Also, different lattices were investigated at the same
   reference density taken equal to the density of the honeycomb lattice.
   The most typical cases from the practical point of view were considered
   and the corresponding elastic parameters were calculated for them.}},

   organic-inorganic composite material that makes up the inner layer of
   seashells. Nacre is observed for its impressive combination of
   stiffness, strength, and toughness which can be attributed to its
   waviness and the layering pattern of the brick and mortar structure of
   ceramic and protein that allows nacre to exhibit great mechanical energy
   and dissipate it over a large volume. In this study, the effect of this
   waviness on a model architected multilayered material system is analyzed
   numerically and experimentally in order to understand its effects on the
   stiffness, strength, and toughness of nacre. 3-D printed composites with
   auxetic and nacreous structure were created and tested in tensile
   boundary conditions. Finite element analysis was used to study the
   stress distribution and mechanical response of these composites. Results
   from the finite element models and the mechanical tests results show
   that increasing the tablet's waviness increases the stiffness, however,
   there is an optimum value of tablet waviness for the highest strength
   and tensile toughness. Increasing waviness level can improve the elastic
   modulus by about 23\%, strength by about 65\% and toughness by about
   42\%. Using the proposed modeling approach, more detailed studies can be
   done on the toughening mechanisms of composite multilayered materials.
   These results can be used as a guide to design super-tough composites
   with multilayered structures.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new bi-material microstructural design method for
   chiral auxetic metamaterials. Based on the independent point-wise
   density interpolation (iPDI) and a bi-material model, optimal design
   problem of periodic unit cells is formulated using nodal density
   variables. The design objective is to minimize the Poisson's ratio while
   satisfying the specified volume constraints of the hard and soft
   materials, and the effective elastic properties of the bi-material
   microstructure are computed by the asymptotic homogenization method
   under periodic boundary conditions. This topology optimization problem
   is solved with a gradient-based mathematical programming algorithm on
   the basis of the sensitivity analysis. Several numerical examples,
   regarding design of anisotropic, orthogonal anisotropic and isotropic
   bi-material microstructures of chiral auxetic metamaterials, are given
   to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method. It is shown that the
   proposed bi-material design optimization method can be used to improve
   the performance of chiral auxetic metamaterials through enlarging the
   design space.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a theoretical analysis of the auxetic plied yarn
   (APY) structure formed with two types of single yarns having different
   diameter and modulus. A model which can be used to predict its
   deformation behavior under axial extension is developed based on the

   predict the effects of different structural and material parameters on

   developed model can correctly predict the variation trend of the auxetic
   behavior of the APY, which first increases and then decrease with the
   increase of the axial strain. The calculation results also indicate that
   the auxetic behavior of the APY simultaneously depends on the diameter
   ratio of the soft yarn and stiff yarn as well as the ratio between the
   pitch length and stiff yarn diameter. The study provides a way to design
   and fabricate APYs with the same auxetic behavior by using different

Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MECHANICS A-SOLIDS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{70}},
Pages = {{8-14}},
Month = {{JUL-AUG}},
Abstract = {{Poisson's ratio is an important mechanical property that explains the
   deformation patterns of materials. A positive Poisson's ratio is a
   feature of the majority of materials. Some materials, however, display
   ``auxetic{''} behaviors (i.e. possess negative Poisson's ratios).
   Indeed, auxetic and non-auxetic materials display different deformation
   mechanisms. Explaining these differences and their effects on the
   mechanics of these materials is of a significant importance.
   In this study, effects of Poisson's ratio on the mechanics of auxetic
   and non-auxetic nanobeams are revealed. A parametric study is provided
   on effects of Poisson's ratio on the static bending and free vibration
   behaviors of auxetic nanobeams. The general nonlocal theory is employed
   to model the nonlocal effects. Unlike Eringen's nonlocal theory, the
   general nonlocal theory uses different attenuation functions for the
   longitudinal and lateral strains. This theory emphasizes the Poisson's
   ratio-nonlocal coupling effects on the mechanics of nanomaterials. The
   obtained results showed that Poisson's ratio is an essential parameter
   for determining mechanical behaviors of nanobeams. It is demonstrated
   that auxetic and non-auxetic nanobeams may reflect softening or
   hardening behaviors depending on the ratio of the nonlocal fields of the
   beam's longitudinal and lateral strains.}},

Abstract = {{An investigation of the mechanical behaviors on hierarchical re-entrant
   honeycomb structures was undertaken using finite element method. The
   hierarchical structure with a hierarchy order n (n >= 1) was constructed
   by replacing each vertex of a re-entrant hexagonal structure of
   hierarchy order n - 1 with a smaller re-entrant hexagon with identical
   geometry aspect ratio. The Poisson's ratio and energy absorption
   capacity of re-entrant structures of different hierarchy orders were
   studied under various compression velocities. The minimum Poisson's
   ratios of the first-order (n = 1) and second-order (n = 2) hierarchical
   re-entrant structures were - 1.581 and - 1.823, respectively; they were
   32.9 and 53.2\% lower than that of a zeroth-order hierarchical structure
   (i.e., conventional re-entrant hexagon). The second-order hierarchical
   structure exhibited the highest rate of increase in energy absorption
   capacity with an increasing compression velocity. The plateau stresses
   of the first- and second-order hierarchical structures were lower than
   that of the zeroth-order hierarchical structure; however, the
   second-order hierarchical structure exhibited the highest energy
   absorption capacity at high compression velocity rate (v > 40 m/s). The
   energy absorption capacities of the first- and second-order hierarchical
   structures proposed in the present study are 1.5 and 1.8 times,

Abstract = {{Graphene and fullerene, two types of C allotropes with very different
   structures and properties, have attracted considerable attention from
   the scientific community as new forms of carbon for several decades. It
   will be a great advantage to combine the geometrical features of the
   two. Herein, we report a series of novel two-dimensional carbon
   allotropes that possess fullerene-like hollow structures (bubbles)
   embedded in a graphene sheet. These carbon allotropes are both thermally
   and dynamically stable. Calculations using hybrid functionals show that
   these two-dimensional carbon allotropes could be metals or
   semiconductors depending on the size and the pattern of the bubbles. The
   band gap can be as large as 166 eV. Due to the unique atomic
   configuration, some bubble-wrap carbons have unusual negative Poisson's
   ratios. The combination of graphene and fullerenes provides an appealing
   approach to design carbon-based materials with dexterous properties. For
   example, the insertion of the metal atoms inside the bubbles may greatly
   enhance the functions of such materials in photovoltaics and catalysis.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the enormous amount of attention CH3NH3PbI3 has received, we are
   still lacking an in-depth understanding of its basic properties. In
   particular, the directional mechanical and structural characteristics of
   this material have remained elusive. Here, we investigate these
   properties by monitoring the propagation of longitudinal and shear
   phonons following the absorption of a femtosecond pulse along various
   crystalline directions of a CH3NH3PbI3 single crystal. We first extract
   the sound velocities of longitudinal and transverse phonons along these
   directions of the crystal. Our study then reveals the negative
   directional thermal expansion of CH3NH3PbI3, which is responsible for
   strong coherent shear phonon generation. Finally, from these
   observations, we perform elastic characterization of this material,
   revealing a large directional Poisson's ratio, which reaches 0.7 and
   that we associate with the weak mechanical stability of this material.
   Our results also provide guidelines to fabricate a transducer of
   high-frequency transverse phonons.}},

Abstract = {{The effective elastic properties 3-layered plates consisting of auxetic
   and nonauxetic cubic crystals are investigated based on stretching and
   bending modes. In many cases effective Young's modulus is higher than
   Young's modulus of the stiffest layer with sufficiently thick auxetic
   layers. In stretching, 3-layered nonauxetic-auxetic-nonauxetic plates
   exhibit positive out-of-plane Poisson's ratio. In-plane Poisson's ratios
   are negative in the case of relatively soft nonauxetic layers and
   positive for stiff nonauxetics. The effective Young's moduli can exceed
   the original Young's moduli of all three layers of the
   auxetic-nonauxetic-auxetic category. For this category, both effective
   Poisson's ratios are negative more often and in-plane Poisson's ratio
   increases with Young's moduli of the original nonauxetics.
   In addition to well-known Poisson's ratio under stretching, the concept
   of Poisson's ratio under pure bending is introduced. There is a large
   difference between them in the case of 3-layered plate. Effective
   in-plane Poisson's ratio for symmetrical 3-layered plates are different
   depending on the loading mode, i.e. the outer layers exert a greater
   influence under bending mode in comparison to stretching mode.
   Therefore, nonauxetic-auxetic-non-auxetic cubic plates exhibit an
   overall auxetic and nonauxetic behaviour under stretching and bending
   modes, respectively, while the reverse is true for
   auxetic-nonauxetic-auxetic cubic plates.}},

Abstract = {{Soft materials capable of transforming between three-dimensional (3D)
   shapes in response to stimuli such as light, heat, solvent, electric and
   magnetic fields have applications in diverse areas such as flexible
   electronics(1,2), soft robotics(3,4) and biomedicine(5-7). In
   particular, magnetic fields offer a safe and effective manipulation
   method for biomedical applications, which typically require remote
   actuation in enclosed and confined spaces(8-10). With advances in
   magnetic field control11, magnetically responsive soft materials have
   also evolved from embedding discrete magnets(12) or incorporating
   magnetic particles(13) into soft compounds to generating nonuniform
   magnetization profiles in polymeric sheets(14,15). Here we report 3D
   printing of programmed ferromagnetic domains in soft materials that
   enable fast transformations between complex 3D shapes via magnetic
   actuation. Our approach is based on direct ink writing(16) of an
   elastomer composite containing ferromagnetic microparticles. By applying
   a magnetic field to the dispensing nozzle while printing(17), we
   reorient particles along the applied field to impart patterned magnetic
   polarity to printed filaments. This method allows us to program
   ferromagnetic domains in complex 3D-printed soft materials, enabling a
   set of previously inaccessible modes of transformation, such as remotely
   controlled auxetic behaviours of mechanical metamaterials with negative
   Poisson's ratios. The actuation speed and power density of our printed
   soft materials with programmed ferromagnetic domains are orders of
   magnitude greater than existing 3D-printed active materials. We further
   demonstrate diverse functions derived from complex shape changes,
   including reconfigurable soft electronics, a mechanical metamaterial
   that can jump and a soft robot that crawls, rolls, catches fast-moving
   objects and transports a pharmaceutical dose.}},

Abstract = {{Negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) in auxetic materials is of great interest
   due to the typically enhanced toughness, shear resistance, and sound and
   vibration absorption, which enables plenty of novel applications such as
   aerospace and defense. Insight into the mechanism underlying NPR is
   significant to the design of auxetic nanomaterials and nanostructures.
   However, the analysis of NPR in previous studies mainly remains on the
   level of the evolution of geometry parameters, such as bond length and
   bond angle, while a thorough and fundamental understanding is lacking.
   In this paper, we report anisotropic differential NPR in graphene for
   uniaxial strains applied along both zigzag and armchair directions based
   on first-principles calculations. The mechanism underlying the emergence
   of NPR in graphene (evolution of bond length and bond angle) is found to
   be different from the conclusions from previous classical molecular
   dynamics simulations with empirical potential. We propose that the
   decentralized electron localization function (ELF) driven by strain
   leads to ELF coupling between different types of bonds, which results in
   the counter-intuitive anomalous increase of the bond angle and thus the
   emergence of NPR in graphene. Moreover, the NPR phenomenon can be
   anticipated to emerge in other nanomaterials or nanostructures with a
   similar honeycomb structure as that of graphene, where the ELF coupling
   would also be possible.}},

   Tailorable Negative Poisson's Ratios}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{JUN 14}},
Abstract = {{Nature has evolved with a recurring strategy to achieve unusual
   mechanical properties through coupling variable elastic moduli from a
   few GPa to below KPa within a single tissue. The ability to produce
   multi-material, three-dimensional (3D) micro-architectures with high
   fidelity incorporating dissimilar components has been a major challenge
   in man-made materials. Here we show multimodulus metamaterials whose
   architectural element is comprised of encoded elasticity ranging from
   rigid to soft. We found that, in contrast to ordinary architected
   materials whose negative Poisson's ratio is dictated by their geometry,
   these type of metamaterials are capable of displaying Poisson's ratios
   from extreme negative to zero, independent of their 3D
   micro-architecture. The resulting low density metamaterials is capable
   of achieving functionally graded, distributed strain amplification
   capabilities within the metamaterial with uniform micro-architectures.
   Simultaneous tuning of Poisson's ratio and moduli within the 3D
   multi-materials could open up a broad array of material by design
   applications ranging from flexible armor, artificial muscles, to
   actuators and bio-mimetic materials.}},

   Cd(CN)(2) on prolonged heating. Powder X-ray diffraction measurements
   allow us to determine the crystal structure of the previously-unreported

   interpenetrating PtS topology. We discuss the effect of partial
   oxidation on the Cd/Hg composition of this intermediate, as well as its
   implications for the reconstructive nature of the deammination process.
   Variable-temperature X-ray diffraction measurements allow us to
   characterise the anisotropic negative thermal expansion (NTE) behaviour
   of Cd(NH3)(2){[}Cd(CN)(4)] together with the effect of Cd/Hg

   properties not usually found in nature. Such unusual mechanical, mass

   basis of snap-through instability to design deployable meta-implants.
   Deployable meta-implants are compact in their retracted state, allowing
   them to be brought to the surgical site with minimum invasiveness. Once
   in place, they are deployed to take their full-size load-bearing shape.
   We designed five types of meta-implants by arranging bi-stable elements
   in such a way to obtain a radially-deployable structure, three types of
   auxetic structures, and an axially-deployable structure. The
   intermediate stable conditions (i.e. multi-stability features),

Abstract = {{The mechanical properties of a given rock volume are dependent on its
   geological composition. Being able to predict these mechanical
   properties based on mineralogical parameters could prove useful in
   engineering and construction settings. The aim of this study is to
   propose relationships between mineralogical parameters and mechanical
   properties of granitic rocks. Furthermore, relevant correlations
   proposed previously in literature were analyzed within the context of a
   larger dataset.
   An extensive literature search was performed to compile a database of
   laboratory compression testing data for granitic rock. Mineralogical
   parameters and mechanical properties of 58 distinct granitic rock types
   from 12 countries were analyzed in order to obtain a more complete view
   of their interrelationships. The following geological properties were
   compiled: grain sizes (overall and mineral-specific), modal percentages
   of minerals (quartz, alkali feldspar, plagioclase, and micas), density,
   and average Mohs Hardness. The following mechanical properties were
   assessed: Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS), Brazilian Tensile
   Strength (BTS), crack initiation stress (CI), crack damage stress (CD),
   Young's Modulus (E), Poisson's ratio (v), and the Hoek-Brown constant,
   m(i). The modal percentage of mica minerals was found to have a strong
   negative correlation with crack initiation stress, crack damage stress,
   and tensile strength. Additionally, minimum overall grain size is
   strongly correlated with the CD/CI ratio. A multivariate regression
   analysis utilized various combinations of five independent variables
   (minimum overall grain size, average overall grain size, standard
   deviation of overall grain size, quartz modal percentage, and mica modal
   percentage) to predict CI, CD, and tensile strength. Multivariate
   analysis showed that the use of two geological predictor variables
   typically improved models for CI, CD, and BTS; however, the addition of
   further predictor variables produced minimal additional improvement. The
   most important finding of this analysis was that joint consideration of
   mica modal percentage and grain size parameters allows for improved
   predictions of CI, CD, and tensile strength to be made for granitic
   rock.
   Additionally, it was found that correlations proposed previously in
   literature appear to be spurious when considered in the context of the
   larger data set compiled in this research. This occurrence is most
   likely a consequence of unknown additional variables (confounding
   variables) that is correlated to both the independent and dependent
   variables used in forming the original correlations.}},

Abstract = {{Graphene monolayers engineered to adopt a corrugated conformation are
   found to exhibit very pronounced lateral expansion characteristics upon
   uniaxial stretching in specific directions, i.e. giant negative
   Poisson's ratio (auxeticity). Such anomalous properties are manifested
   in-plane and may be controlled through the shape and amplitude of the
   wave-like pattern of the corrugation, which in the case of graphene may
   be controlled through the introduction of patterned defects'. This
   confirms that auxeticity via corrugation can be achieved even at the
   nanoscale, as demonstrated here for graphene with patterned defects',
   suggesting that this mechanism should be operational at different scales
   of structures, thus providing a new blueprint for the design or
   manufacture of auxetic materials and metamaterials which can have

Abstract = {{Objective To compare the 10-year outcome (disease activity, disability,
   mortality) of two cohorts of patients with inflammatory polyarthritis
   (IP) recruited 10 years apart.
   Methods Patients with IP were recruited to the Norfolk Arthritis
   Register from 1990 to 1994 (cohort 1 (C1)) and from 2000 to 2004 (cohort
   2 (C2)). Demographic and clinical data were collected at baseline and at
   years 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 10. Longitudinal disease activity
   (swollen/tender 51 joint counts (SJC51/TJC51)) and disability (Health
   Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ)) were compared between the cohorts using
   population-average negative binomial regression and generalised
   estimating equation analysis, respectively. Risk of 10-year mortality
   was compared between cohorts using Cox models. Risk of cardiovascular
   disease (CVD) mortality was compared between cohorts using competing
   risks analysis. Mortality rate ratios (MRR), adjusted for changes in
   mortality risk of the general population, were calculated using Poisson
   regression.
   Results In total 1653 patients were recruited (C1=1022, C2=631).
   Patients in C2 had 17\% lower SJC51 than C1 over 10 years (95\%CI -23\%
   to -10\%), whereas TJC51 and HAQ were comparable. C2 patients had
   reduced risk of all-cause and CVD mortality compared with C1 (all-cause:
   HR 0.72, 95\%CI 0.56 to 0.95; CVD: subhazard ratio 0.58, 95\%CI 0.37 to
   0.93). After accounting for changes in mortality risk in the general
   population, the difference in mortality was non-significant (all-cause:
   MRR 0.78, 95\%CI 0.56 to 1.10; CVD: MRR 0.77, 95\%CI 0.48 to 1.24).
   Conclusion Disease activity significantly improved in the new
   millennium, whereas disability and mortality were unchanged.}},

Abstract = {{Diffusion-induced stress is one of the critical challenges in developing
   lithium ion battery technologies, which may lead to the huge volume
   expansion, nucleation of cracks, electrode mechanical degradation and
   even pulverization. It has been testified nanostructured electrodes with
   the consideration of surface effect and property of negative Poisson's
   ratio can restrain volumetric expansion generation and relieve the
   hazard of stress-induced crack nucleation. In this paper, an analytical
   model of diffusion-induced stress for nanowire electrode under different
   operations is established and a relationship between stress and the
   nanowire radius is formed. Through changing the morphology of nanowire
   electrode, the stress equations for negative Poisson's ratio electrode
   can be obtained. By comparing surface effect influence on
   diffusion-induced stress between the nanowire and negative Poisson's
   ratio electrodes under different operations, it is found
   diffusion-induced stress, especially the tensile stress, can be
   decreased greatly and even converted to compressive one by the
   nanostructured electrode and the mechanism of negative Poisson's ratio,
   which may improve the mechanical property of battery and be in good
   agreement with experimental observations. Our work provides reference
   conditions for the improvement of battery to mitigate the mechanical
   degradation and prolong the cycle life as well as avoid failure.}},

Abstract = {{Jounce bumpers are indispensable components in vehicle suspension
   systems. It can attenuate impact energy and improve the ride comfort
   performances during transient pulse impacts from roads. However, the
   traditional jounce bumpers cannot achieve ideal mechanical performance
   and are difficult for parametric optimization due to its various shapes
   which are hard for parameterization. In this paper, a cylinder auxetic
   structure was introduced and applied as the suspension jounce bumper.
   Auxetic jounce bumper can be primarily defined by several variables.
   With tunable structure parameters, a large region of mechanical
   performances can be realized. In order to evaluate and optimize the
   performance of auxetic jounce bumpers, they were assembled into vehicle
   models to conduct virtual ride comfort tests under bump road. The
   maximum vertical acceleration of vehicle was defined as the objective
   function of the optimization problem of auxetic jounce bumper. On the
   purpose of improving optimization efficiency, Gaussian process
   regression method was employed to establish the metamodel of auxetic
   jounce bumper based on the sample set created by orthogonal design of
   experiments method. A series hybrid GA-SQP (Genetic algorithm-Sequential
   quadratic programming) algorithm, provided with both global and fast
   local searching abilities, was used for the optimization of auxetic
   jounce bumper. For comparison, GA algorithm was also applied for auxetic
   jounce bumper optimization alone. It is proved that the proposed
   optimization process is accurate and can improve optimization
   efficiency. Then the optimized design through hybrid algorithm was
   compared with original design. The maximum vertical acceleration of
   vehicle when travelling through bump was reduced with optimized design,
   and the vehicle ride comfort performance was improved.}},

Title = {{Experiments on ageing effect of gypsum rock induced by water}},
Journal = {{ROCK AND SOIL MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{2124+}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{To investigate the water-induced ageing effect on gypsum rock, different
   water environment conditions were simulated in the laboratory, including
   different air humidity conditions and saturated groundwater conditions
   which may exist in the gypsum mines. Mechanical parameters of gypsum
   rock specimens were obtained under the pre-set conditions for different
   times. Meanwhile, the variation of pore structure in gypsum rock
   specimens was measured by nuclear magnetic resonance equipment. Then,
   the water-induced ageing mechanism of the gypsum rock was revealed. The
   results showed that the effect of water on the ageing of gypsum rock was
   obvious. Firstly, the ageing extent of gypsum rock increased with time,
   whereas mechanical parameters including uniaxial compressive strength,
   Brazilian tensile strength and elastic modulus decreased with time in a
   negative exponential relation. However, the Poisson's ratio of gypsum
   rock had no clear relation with time. Secondly, the ageing extent and
   ageing rate of gypsum rock were closely related to the state of water.
   The higher the relative humidity was, the more pronounced the ageing
   extent was and the faster the ageing rate was. In particular, the ageing
   extent of gypsum rock was the most significant and its ageing rate was
   also the fastest when fully submerged in water. Generally, the
   water-induced ageing mechanism of gypsum rock was caused by the coupling
   of physical and chemical effects of water, and the chemical effect was
   the primary cause for the ageing effect. When the gypsum rock was
   exposed to water, the continuous dissolution and recrystallisation of
   the gypsum rock changed the mineral composition of the gypsum rock. As a
   result, the rock structure became loose, the porosity increased, and
   mechanical properties gradually weakened. The research results provide
   references for designing the gypsum mining and the evaluation of the

Abstract = {{Following high profile, life changing long term mental illnesses and
   fatalities in sports such as skiing, cricket and American
   football-sports injuries feature regularly in national and international
   news. A mismatch between equipment certification tests, user
   expectations and infield falls and collisions is thought to affect risk
   perception, increasing the prevalence and severity of injuries. Auxetic
   foams, structures and textiles have been suggested for application to
   sporting goods, particularly protective equipment, due to their unique
   form-fitting deformation and curvature, high energy absorption and high
   indentation resistance. The purpose of this critical review is to
   communicate how auxetics could be useful to sports equipment (with a
   focus on injury prevention), and clearly lay out the steps required to
   realise their expected benefits. Initial overviews of auxetic materials
   and sporting protective equipment are followed by a description of
   common auxetic materials and structures, and how to produce them in
   foams, textiles and Additively Manufactured structures. Beneficial
   characteristics, limitations and commercial prospects are discussed,
   leading to a consideration of possible further work required to realise
   potential uses (such as in personal protective equipment and highly
   conformable garments).}},

Title = {{Developing a Random Parameters Negative Binomial-Lindley Model to
   analyze highly over-dispersed crash count data}},
Journal = {{ANALYTIC METHODS IN ACCIDENT RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{18}},
Pages = {{33-44}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The existence of preponderant zero crash sites and/or sites with large
   crash counts can present challenges during the statistical analysis of
   crash count data. Additionally, unobserved heterogeneity in crash data
   due to the absence of important variables could negatively impact the
   estimated model parameters. The traditional negative binomial (NB) model
   with fixed parameters might not adequately handle highly over-dispersed
   data or unobserved heterogeneity. Many research efforts that have
   involved the negative binomial-Lindley (NB-L) model or the random
   parameters negative binomial (RPNB) model, for example, have attempted
   to improve the inference of estimated coefficients by explicitly
   accounting for extra variation in crash data. The NB-L is a mixed
   modeling approach which provides flexibility to account for additional
   dispersion in data. The RP modeling approach accommodates the effect of
   unobserved variables by allowing the model parameters to vary from one
   observation to another. The following study proposes a combination of
   these models - the random parameters NB-L (RPNB-L) generalized linear
   model (GLM) - to account for underlying heterogeneity and address excess
   over-dispersion. The results show that the RPNB-L model not only
   provides a superior goodness-of-fit (GOF) with the sample data, but also
   offers a better understanding about the effects of potential
   contributing factors. The paper uses the Bayesian framework to provide a
   strategy for eliminating the potential for poor mixing in the Markov
   Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) chains during the estimation of the RPNB-L
   model. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A specific periodic bar-and-joint framework with limited degrees of

   exploring the equilibrium paths then reveals a transition state of the
   structure at a critical value of the internal stiffness. A simplified

Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{We present a lattice structure defined by patterns of slits that follow
   a rotational symmetry (chiral) configuration. The chiral pattern of the
   slits creates a series of hinges that produce deformation mechanisms for
   the lattice due to bending of the ribs, leading to a marginal negative
   Poisson's ratio. The engineering constants are modeled using theoretical
   and numerical Finite Element simulations. The results are bench-marked
   with experimental data obtained from uniaxial and off-axis tensile
   tests, with an overall excellent agreement. The chiral hinge lattice is
   almost one order of magnitude more compliant than other configurations
   with patterned slits and - in contrast to other chiral micropolar media
   - exhibits an in-plane shear modulus that closely obeys the relation
   between Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio in homogeneous isotropic
   linear elastic materials. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The single-crystal elastic moduli of minerals and related materials with

   recorded are the composition of each material, its crystal structure,
   density, and the three independent nonzero adiabatic elastic moduli
   (C-11 , C-12, and C-44). From these, a variety of additional elastic and
   acoustic properties are calculated and compiled, including
   polycrystalline aggregate elastic properties, sound velocities, and
   anisotropy factors. The database is used to evaluate trends in cubic
   mineral elasticity through consideration of normalized elastic moduli
   (Blackman diagrams) and the Cauchy pressure. The elastic anisotropy and
   auxetic behavior of these materials are also examined. Compilations of
   single-crystal elastic moduli provide a useful tool for investigation

   triangular lattices by strain gradient elasticity models: Applications
   to sandwich beams and auxetics}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{127}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The present work is devoted to the modelling of strongly size-dependent
   bending, buckling and vibration phenomena of 2D triangular lattices with
   the aid of a simplified first strain gradient elasticity continuum
   theory. As a start, the corresponding generalized Bernoulli-Euler and
   Timoshenko sandwich beam models are derived. The effective elastic
   moduli corresponding to the classical theory of elasticity are defined
   by means of a computational homogenization technique. The two additional
   length scale parameters involved in the models, in turn, are validated
   by matching the lattice response in benchmark problems for static
   bending and free vibrations calibrating the strain energy and inertia
   gradient parameters, respectively. It is demonstrated as well that the
   higher-order material parameters do not depend on the problem type,
   boundary conditions or the specific beam formulation. From the
   application point of view, it is first shown that the bending rigidity,
   critical buckling load and eigenfrequencies strongly depend on the
   lattice microstructure and these dependencies are captured by the
   generalized Bernoulli-Euler beam model. The relevance of the Timoshenko
   beam model is then addressed in the context of thick beams and sandwich
   beams. Applications to auxetic strut lattices demonstrate a significant
   increase in the stiffness of the metamaterial combined with a clear
   decrease in mass. Furthermore, with the introduced generalized beam
   finite elements, essential savings in the computational costs in
   computational structural analysis can be achieved. For engineering
   applications of architectured materials or structures with a
   microstructure utilizing triangular lattices, generalized mechanical
   properties are finally provided in a form of a design table for a wide
   range of mass densities. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of the desorption of hydrogen on the mechanical
   characteristics and electronic structure of the armchair conformation of
   graphane is studied in the context of the nonorthogonal tight-binding
   model. It is shown that the mechanical stiffness and the Poisson ratio
   nonmonotonically depend on the hydrogen content and take minimum values
   at a hydrogen vacancy content of similar to 50\% and similar to 30\%,
   respectively. As hydrogen is desorbed, the characteristic peaks of the
   phonon density of states are rapidly reduced. In the initial stage of
   desorption, local energy levels are formed in the band gap. As the
   number of hydrogen vacancies is increased, these levels form an impurity
   band, in which the Fermi level is located.}},

Title = {{Controls of natural fractures on the texture of hydraulic fractures in

Volume = {{165}},
Pages = {{616-626}},

Abstract = {{Hydraulic fracturing plays an important role in the exploitation of oil,
   shale gas and coal seam gas resources-all of which contain natural
   fractures. We systematically explore the role of the pre-existing
   texture of such natural fractures on the form of the resulting
   stimulated reservoir volume (SRV). A blocky discrete element model (DEM)
   coupled with fluid flow is used to explore this response. Numerical
   predictions for the evolution of fluid pressure and fracture width at
   the well are compared with first-order analytical approximations of the
   zero-toughness solution (FMO). We then construct four typical joint
   system models separately comprising orthogonal, staggered, diagonal and
   randomly oriented joints and conduct the virtual hydraulic fracturing
   simulations via DEM. This defines the influence of structure on
   breakdown pressure and fracture propagation and allows the analysis of
   the main factors that influence behavior and resulting SRV. Results for
   the four forms of jointed rock mass show that: (1) the aggregate/mean
   extension direction of the fractures is always along the direction of
   the maximum principal stress but significant deviations may result from
   the pre-existing fractures; (2) there are negative correlations between
   the maximum fracture aperture with both Poisson ratio and elastic
   modulus, but the breakdown pressure is only weakly correlated with
   Poisson ratio and elastic modulus; (3) an increase in injection rate
   results in a broader fracture process zone extending orthogonal to the
   principal fracture, and the breakdown pressure and interior fracture
   aperture also increase; (4) an increase in fluid viscosity makes the
   fractures more difficult to extend, and the breakdown pressure and
   interior fracture aperture both increase accordingly.}},

Abstract = {{This study compares the tribological performance of
   polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) thin film coating reinforced with black
   phosphorus (BP) or ball-milled graphite (BMG) nanoparticles, so as to
   elucidate their mechanism of action under reciprocating sliding test
   conditions. PTFE coatings with 0.5 wt.\% BMG (BMG/PTFE) and 0.5 wt.\% BP
   (BP/PTFE) were prepared on GCr15 bearing steel disk by using a spin
   coater. The friction and wear tests were carried out by using the
   ball-on-disk tribometer under a normal load of 1 N (contact pressure:
   780 MPa), a frequency of 2 Hz, and 4.2 mm sliding displacement
   amplitude. The surface roughness, wear volume and surface morphology of
   the coatings were characterized by the three-dimensional white light,
   and Energy Dispersive X-ray Detector (EDX) analysis coupled with
   environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM). It is found that
   BP/PTFE coating has better anti-wear and anti-friction performances than
   those of pure PTFE or BMG/PTFE coating. The coating with BP
   nanoparticles shows excellent tribological properties with the wear
   volume decreased from 3.52 x 10(6) mu m(3) to 1.64 x 10(6) mu m(3) and
   the coefficient of friction (COF) decreased from 0.117 to 0.046. More
   importantly, the BP layer probably expands and absorbs much energy due
   to its negative Poisson's ratio phenomenon under reciprocating sliding,
   and effectively reducing furrow and adhesive wear. (C) 2018 Elsevier

Title = {{A novel category of 3D chiral material with negative Poisson's ratio}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITES SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{160}},
Pages = {{111-118}},
Month = {{MAY 26}},
Abstract = {{A new design thought for 3D auxetic material is proposed based on the
   rotaion mechanism of chiral honeycombs. Two kinds of cell shape of the
   3D auxetic material are studied as example, which are developed from the
   tetrachiral honeycombs with circular loops and square loops,
   respectively, with inclined rods connecting the neighbor layers. By
   replacing the tetrachiral honeycomb layers by other chiral honeycombs,
   such as trichiral, hexachiral honeycombs, other kinds of 3D chiral
   material with negative Poisson's ratio can be obtained. Moreover, since
   the cells' deformation of the 3D material is dominated by that of
   ligaments and rods under small deformation, the elastic properties of
   the 3D auxetic material are almost independent of the loops' shape.
   Thus, the loop can be designed to any shape instead of the traditional
   circular loop in order to obtain priory mechanical properties under
   large deformation. Based on beam theory and micromechanical method, the
   analytical formulas of both the elastic mudulus and Poisson's ratio are
   deduced for this category of 3D chiral material, which are verified by
   numerical simulations but also the experiment of 3D printed model. The
   verification results indicate that the formulas have higher precision
   and wider application scope. The influence of layer space on the
   equivalent parameters and the conditions for isotropic realization are
   discussed base on the analytical formulas. By changing the oblique
   direction of the inclined rods, another new 3D material can be obtained
   with positive Poisson's ratio in two directions and negative Poisson's
   ratio in the other one direction, for which the analytical formulas are
   still applicable. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

   Properties toward Treating Myocardial Infarction}},
Journal = {{ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{21}},
Month = {{MAY 24}},
Abstract = {{An auxetic conductive cardiac patch (AuxCP) for the treatment of
   myocardial infarction (MI) is introduced. The auxetic design gives the
   patch a negative Poisson's ratio, providing it with the ability to
   conform to the demanding mechanics of the heart. The conductivity allows
   the patch to interface with electroresponsive tissues such as the heart.
   Excimer laser microablation is used to micropattern a re-entrant
   honeycomb (bow-tie) design into a chitosan-polyaniline composite. It is
   shown that the bow-tie design can produce patches with a wide range in
   mechanical strength and anisotropy, which can be tuned to match native
   heart tissue. Further, the auxetic patches are conductive and
   cytocompatible with murine neonatal cardiomyocytes in vitro. Ex vivo
   studies demonstrate that the auxetic patches have no detrimental effect
   on the electrophysiology of both healthy and MI rat hearts and conform
   better to native heart movements than unpatterned patches of the same
   material. Finally, the AuxCP applied in a rat MI model results in no
   detrimental effect on cardiac function and negligible fibrotic response
   after two weeks in vivo. This approach represents a versatile and robust
   platform for cardiac biomaterial design and could therefore lead to a
   promising treatment for MI.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},

Month = {{MAY 23}},
Abstract = {{This paper develops a semi-nonparametric Poisson regression model to
   analyze motor vehicle crash frequency data collected from rural
   multilane highway segments in California, US. Motor vehicle crash
   frequency on rural highway is a topic of interest in the area of
   transportation safety due to higher driving speeds and the resultant
   severity level. Unlike the traditional Negative Binomial (NB) model, the
   semi-nonparametric Poisson regression model can accommodate an
   unobserved heterogeneity following a highly flexible semi-nonparametric
   (SNP) distribution. Simulation experiments are conducted to demonstrate
   that the SNP distribution can well mimic a large family of
   distributions, including normal distributions, log-gamma distributions,
   bimodal and trimodal distributions. Empirical estimation results show
   that such flexibility offered by the SNP distribution can greatly
   improve model precision and the overall goodness-of-fit. The
   semi-nonparametric distribution can provide a better understanding of
   crash data structure through its ability to capture potential
   multimodality in the distribution of unobserved heterogeneity. When
   estimated coefficients in empirical models are compared, SNP and NB
   models are found to have a substantially different coefficient for the
   dummy variable indicating the lane width. The SNP model with better
   statistical performance suggests that the NB model overestimates the
   effect of lane width on crash frequency reduction by 83.1\%.}},

Volume = {{192}},
Pages = {{310-316}},
Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{An auxetic tow or fiber bundle that will expand in diameter when
   extended axially would be very useful. It could be woven into a
   shape-changing cloth, perhaps used for ballistic protection, or as an
   easily cleaned filter. To explore this concept, spiral fiber bundle
   structures under tension were explored. Theory describing the geometry
   of spiral structures was developed. Several types of finite element
   models for these spiral structures using laminated plate elements, beam
   elements and solid elements with contact were then developed and
   compared at a range of angles. The beam and solid element models provide
   the best approximation and indicate that a 30 degrees/45 degrees fiber
   structure is a good angle combination to not only provide significant
   radial expansion but also show a relatively low stress. Several
   polymeric specimens were 3D-printed and tested under tension. Testing
   confirmed that the spiral fiber systems exhibited auxetic behavior. The
   polymeric specimens exhibited more radial expansion than the finite
   element predictions. Thus, spiral fiber bundles show promise and will be
   explored further.}},

Abstract = {{The term ``mechanical metamaterials{''} encompasses a wide range of
   systems whose anomalous mechanical properties arise primarily from their
   structure rather than composition. This unique characteristic gives the
   man edge over many conventional natural or readily available materials
   and makes them well-suited for a variety of applications where
   tailor-made mechanical properties are required. In this study, we
   present a new class of mechanical metamaterials featuring various
   star-shaped perforations, which have the potential to exhibit auxetic or
   zero Poisson's ratio (nu) properties. Using finite element modelling in
   conjunction with experimental measurements on 3D printed prototypes, we
   demonstrate that these star-shaped porous systems possess the potential
   to retain their unusual mechanical properties up to tensile strains
   exceeding 15\%. By virtue of these exceptional properties, the proposed
   concept could be applied for engineering numerous potential applications
   in a wide range of fields. (c) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Pages = {{632-635}},

Abstract = {{In nature, repeated base units produce handed structures that
   selectively bond to make rigid or compliant materials. Auxetic tilings
   are scale-independent frameworks made from repeated unit cells that
   expand under tension. We discovered how to produce handedness in auxetic
   unit cells that shear as they expand by changing the symmetries and
   alignments of auxetic tilings. Using the symmetry and alignment rules
   that we developed, we made handed shearing auxetics that tile planes,
   cylinders, and spheres. By compositing the handed shearing auxetics in a
   manner inspired by keratin and collagen, we produce both compliant
   structures that expand while twisting and deployable structures that can
   rigidly lock. This work opens up new possibilities in designing chemical
   frameworks, medical devices like stents, robotic systems, and deployable
   engineering structures.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon materials with full sp(2)-hybridized bonding, e.g.
   zero-dimensional (0D) fullerenes, 1D carbon nanotubes, and 2D graphene,
   possess outstanding and unparalleled properties, and have unique
   scientific and technological importance. The theoretical design and
   experimental exploration of other types of novel sp(2) carbon
   allotropes, especially with 3D architectures, is always a compelling
   scientific theme. Here we proposed a class of low-energy 3D sp(2)
   carbons with exceptional properties, not only possessing excellent
   mechanical properties such as high 3D strength, rubber-like
   ultra-stretchability, and negative Poisson's ratio, but also including
   the electronic properties of graphite-like metallicity and graphene-like
   Dirac cone, which are the desirable properties across a broad range of
   potential applications. Furthermore, a design route was suggested to
   access these 3D sp(2) carbons by the polymerization of
   edge-functionalized graphene nanoribbon arrays.}},

Abstract = {{In the design of sandwich panels with cellular cores for energy
   absorption, the geometrical effect of the cellular core design has not
   been investigated in details previously. In this work three cellular
   core designs, including re-entrant auxetic, octet-truss, and BCC
   lattice, were experimentally investigated for their performance under
   low-energy impact as sandwich structures. Samples with different
   cellular core designs were fabricated by laser sintering additive
   manufacturing process using Nylon 12 as material, and evaluated by drop
   weight testing under multiple strikes and at two levels of elevated
   temperatures (93 degrees C and 121 degrees C). It was found that beside
   relative densities, the geometrical design of the cellular cores could
   also significantly influence the impact energy absorption performance of
   the sandwich structures. It was also found that the impact energy
   absorption of the cellular structures investigated in this study does
   not have a significant correlation with either the quasi-static
   mechanical properties or the temperature. In addition, the auxetic
   cellular structure exhibits optimal overall energy absorption
   performance compared to both the octet-truss and the BCC lattice. (C)

Abstract = {{We constructed a new class of three-dimensional cellular metamaterials
   by connecting planar structure with anti-chiral topology. This was
   achieved by introducing a unique node design for connecting planar
   materials to enable constructing a three-dimensional architecture. This
   node design is based on linking the circular elements of the anti-chiral
   topology using oblique load-bearing ligaments. As the planar structure
   is subjected to loading, the circular elements rotate and the ligaments
   undergo bending, resulting in out-of-plane deformation of the
   three-dimensional cellularmetamaterials. The node design, and
   specifically the ligaments' revolution angle govern the behavior of
   cellular metamaterials. This was demonstrated by designing cellular
   metamaterials with a wide range of positive and negative Poisson's ratio
   in the out-of-plane direction. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The elastic properties of chiral cylindrically anisotropic
   nano/microtubes from hexagonal crystals are analyzed. The problems of
   longitudinal tension and torsion of such tubes demonstrate that there is
   a linear direct Poynting effect with an elongation (shortening) of a
   twisted tube and a linear inverse Poynting effect with the twisting of
   the stretch tube. It is shown that both effects disappear at zero chiral
   angle and at some other chiral angles. Many chiral tubes with negative
   Poisson ratios are revealed. It is shown that Poisson ratios do not
   depend on the sign of the chiral angle. It is found that the dependence
   of the torsional stiffness of the tubes on the chiral angle is stronger
   than the dependence on the thickness of the tube walls. At the same
   time, chiral tubes made of graphite are separated from other tubes from
   hexagonal crystals. Their Young's modulus varies rapidly from large to
   small with a change in the chiral angle. The value of the torsional
   stiffness is large and it varies rapidly with the change in the chiral
   angle and the thickness of the tube walls.}},

Title = {{Exploring the impact of house screening intervention on entomological

   A randomized control trial}},

Abstract = {{House is the major site for malaria infection where most human-vector
   contact takes place. Hence, improving housing might reduce the risk of
   malaria infection by limiting house entry of vectors. This study aimed
   to explore the impact of screening doors and windows with wire meshes on
   density and entomological inoculation rate (EIR) of malaria vector, and
   malaria incidence, and assess the acceptability, durability, and cost of
   the intervention. The susceptibility status of malaria vector was also
   assessed. A two-arm randomized trial was done in Arba Minch Town,
   southwest Ethiopia. 92 houses were randomly included in the trial. The
   baseline entomological and malaria prevalence data were collected. The
   mosquito sampling was done twice per household per month by Centers for
   Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC) light traps for six months. The
   baseline prevalence of malaria was assessed by testing 396 (83\% of the
   447 study participants) household members in all the eligible houses.
   The 92 houses were then randomized into control and intervention groups
   using mosquito and malaria prevalence baseline data to make the two
   groups comparable except the intervention. Then, we put wire-mesh on
   doors and windows of 46 houses. Post-screening mosquito collection was
   done in each household twice per month for three months. Each household
   member was visited twice per month for six months to assess malaria
   episodes. The frequency of damage to different structure of screening
   was measured twice. In-depth interview was conducted with 24 purposely
   selected household heads from intervention group. Speciation of
   Anopheles mosquito was done by morphological key, and the
   circum-sporozoite proteins (CSPs) analysis was done using enzyme-linked
   immunosorbent assay. A generalized estimating equation with a negative
   binomial distribution was used to assess the impact of the intervention
   on the indoor density of vectors. Clinical malaria case data were
   analyzed using Poisson regression with generalized linear model.
   Screening doors and windows reduced the indoor density of An. arabiensis
   by 48\% (mean ratio of intervention to control = 0.85/1.65; 0.52) (P =
   .001). Plasmodium falcipanon CSP rate was 1.6\% (3/190) in the
   intervention houses, while it was 2.7\% (10/ 372) in the control houses.
   The protective efficacy of screening intervention from CSP positive An.
   arabiensis was 41\% (mean ratio of intervention to control = 1.6/2.7;
   0.59), but was not statistically significant (P = .6). The EIR of An.
   arabiensis was 1.91 in the intervention group, whereas it was 6.45 in
   the control group. 477 participants were followed for clinical malaria
   (50.1\% from intervention and 49.9\% from the control group). Of 49 RDT
   positive cases, 45 were confirmed to be positive with microscopy. 80\%
   (n = 36) cases were due to P. falciparum and the rest 20\% (n = 9) were
   due to P. vivax. The incidence of P. falciparum in the intervention
   group was lower (IRR: 0.39, 95\% CI: 0.2-0.80; P = .01) than in the
   control group. Using incidence of P. falciporton infection, the
   protective efficacy of intervention was 61\% (95\% CI: 18-83; P = .007).
   97.9\% of screened windows and 63.8\% of screened doors were intact
   after eleven months of installation. Malaria mosquito was resistance
   (mortality rate of 75\%) to the insecticide used for bed nets treatment.
   Almost all participants of intervention arm were willing to continue
   using screened doors and windows. Screening doors and windows reduced
   the indoor exposure to malaria vectors. The intervention is effective,
   durable and well-accepted.
   Hence, the existing interventions can be supplemented with house
   screening intervention for further reduction and ultimately elimination
   of malaria by reducing insecticide pressure on malaria vectors. However,
   further research could be considered in broad setting on different
   housing improvement and in the way how to scale-up for wider community.}},

Abstract = {{This work features a multi-stiffness topology optimization of a zero
   Poisson's ratio cellular structure for morphing skin applications. The
   optimization is performed with stiffness constraints to minimize the

   minimize flatwise compressive and transverse shear moduli for
   aerodynamic pressures and shear forces. The multi-stiffness topology
   optimization is performed using a norm method with weighting
   coefficients. Both the single-stiffness and the multi-stiffness topology
   optimization have generated new honeycomb design by imposing symmetry
   conditions and geometric post-processing to avoid the presence of stress
   concentrations. The mechanical performances of the new honeycomb designs
   are validated using two approaches: one based on force boundary
   conditions (HyperWorks) and another with displacement BCs (ANSYS). The
   work shows some alternate potential topologies and configurations of
   cellular structures for lightweight zero Poisson's ratio honeycomb

Abstract = {{A new auxetic structure, re-entrant chiral auxetic (RCA) structure, is
   proposed for the first time in this paper. The RCA structure combines
   the topological features of hexagonal re-entrant and anti-tetrachiral
   honeycombs. Additive manufacturing technique, stereolithography (SLA),
   and traditional waterjet machining (WJM) were employed to fabricate six
   samples made from photopolymer (VisiJet SL Flex) and aluminum alloy
   (6061), respectively. Quasi-static uniaxial tensile tests were conducted
   in the X and Y directions, respectively. Numerical models were developed
   using ANSYS/LS-DYNA and verified by experimental data. Deformation
   modes, stress-strain curves, and Poisson's ratios were considered to
   examine the effects of loading directions and material types. A
   comparative study was conducted experimentally and numerically between
   the well-known hexagonal re-entrant honeycomb, and this newly developed
   RCA structure. The proposed RCA structure presented here was found to
   display lower density compared with re-entrant honeycomb. Moreover, it
   shows higher tensile properties and auxetic effect compared with
   re-entrant honeycomb when loaded in the X direction. The validated FEA
   models were employed to investigate the effect of friction on the
   deformation pattern and mechanical properties of the RCA structure when
   it is loaded in both directions.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Healthcare-associated infections in neonatal and paediatric
   populations are associated with poorer outcomes and healthcare costs,
   and surveillance is a necessary component of prevention programmes.
   Aim: To evaluate burden of illness, aetiology, and time-trends for
   central and peripheral line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI and
   PLABSI) in Australian neonatal and paediatric intensive care units
   (ICUs) between July 1st, 2008 and December 31st, 2016.
   Methods: Using National Healthcare Safety Network methods, surveillance
   in neonatal and paediatric units was performed by hospitals
   participating in the Victorian Healthcare Associated Infection
   Surveillance System. Mixed effects Poisson regression was used to model
   infections over time.
   Findings: Overall, 82 paediatric CLABSI events were reported during
   37,125 CVC-days (2.21 per 1000 CVC-days), 203 neonatal CLABSI events
   were reported during 92,169 CVC-days (2.20 per 1000 CVC-days), and 95
   neonatal PLABSI events were reported during 142,240 peripheral line-days
   (0.67 per 1000 peripheral line-days). Over time, a significant decrease
   in quarterly risk for neonatal CLABSI events was observed (risk ratio
   (RR): 0.98; 95\% confidence interval: 0.97-0.99; P - 0.023) and this
   reduction was significant for the 751-1000 g birth weight cohort (RR:
   0.97; P - 0.015). Most frequently, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus
   spp. (24.2\%) and Staphylococcus aureus (16.1\%) were responsible for
   CLABSI events. A significant reduction in Gram-negative neonatal
   infections was observed (annual RR: 0.85; P < 0.001).
   Conclusion: CLABSI rates in neonatal and paediatric ICUs in our region
   are low, and neonatal infections have significantly diminished over
   time. Evaluation of infection prevention programmes is required to
   determine whether specific strategies can be implemented to further

Abstract = {{A recent finite-element method (FEM)-based study from the present
   authors quantified the effect of elastic anisotropy of grains on stress
   intensification at potential intergranular stress corrosion cracking
   (IGSCC) initiation sites in austenitic stainless steels. In particular,
   it showed that the auxetic behavior of grains (negative Poisson's ratio)
   in some directions plays a very important role in IGSCC initiation,
   since it can induce local stress intensification factors of about 1.6. A
   similar effect is expected for other fcc alloys such as Ni-based alloys.
   The present article confirms those results and paves the way to the
   definition of an IGSCC susceptibility index by identifying grain
   configurations that are the most favorable for crack initiation. The
   index will rely on the probability to get those configurations on
   surface of specimens. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Animal studies suggest that the antibiotic and microglial
   activation inhibitor, minocycline, is likely to have a protective effect
   against the emergence of psychosis but evidence from human studies is
   lacking. The aim of this study is to examine the effects of exposure to
   minocycline during adolescence on the later incidence of severe mental
   illness (SMI).
   Methods: A historical cohort study using electronic primary care data
   was conducted to assess the association between exposure to minocycline
   during adolescence and incidence of SMI. The Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR)
   was measured using Poisson regression adjusted for age, gender, time of
   exposure, socioeconomic deprivation status, calendar year and
   co-medications.
   Results: Early minocycline prescription (n=13,248) did not affect the
   incidence of SMI compared with non-prescription of minocycline
   (n=14,393), regardless of gender or whether or not the data were
   filtered according to a minimum exposure period (minimum period: IRR
   0.96; 95\% CI 0.68-1.36; p=0.821; no minimum period: IRR 1.08; 95\% CI
   0.83-1.42; p=0.566).
   Conclusions: Exposure to minocycline for acne treatment during
   adolescence appears to have no effect on the incidence of SMI.}},

Abstract = {{The prediction of new materials with peculiar topological properties is
   always desirable to achieve new properties and applications. In this
   work, by means of density functional theory computations, we extend the
   rule-breaking chemical bonding of planar pentacoordinate silicon (ppSi)
   into a periodic system: a C-2v Ca4Si22- molecular building block
   containing a ppSi center is identified first, followed by the
   construction of an infinite CaSi monolayer, which is essentially a
   two-dimensional (2D) network of the Ca4Si2 motif. The moderate cohesive
   energy, absence of imaginary phonon modes, and good resistance to high
   temperature indicate that the CaSi monolayer is a thermodynamically and
   kinetically stable structure. In particular, a global minimum search
   reveals that the ppSi-containing CaSi monolayer is the lowest-energy
   structure in 2D space, indicating its great promise for experimental
   realization. The CaSi monolayer is a natural semiconductor with an
   indirect band gap of 0.5 eV, and it has rather strong optical absorption
   in the visible region of the solar spectrum. More interestingly, the
   unique atomic configuration endows the CaSi monolayer with an unusually
   negative Poisson's ratio. The rule-breaking geometric structure together
   with its exceptional properties makes the CaSi monolayer quite a
   promising candidate for applications in electronics, optoelectronics,
   and mechanics.}},

Abstract = {{There have been many studies on smart mechanical materials that sensibly
   deform in response to external stimuli. However, most of the previous
   studies have focused on structure changes but largely neglected
   stimuli-responsive and programmable mechanical properties. Here, we
   present a novel strategy of mechanical metamaterials, engineered
   materials with mechanical properties defined by their structure rather
   than their composition, to design smart materials that change their
   mechanical properties in response to external stimuli. The present work
   demonstrates mechanical metamaterials with thermoresponsive and
   reversible switching between positive and negative Poisson's ratios. In
   order to realize the thermoresponsive and reversible switching, a
   thermoresponsive rod with an extremely large thermal expansion
   coefficient is developed utilizing two-way shape memory effects. As an
   application of our metamaterials, we propose soundproofing materials
   that selectively block sound waves in a specific frequency range
   depending on temperature.}},

Abstract = {{The structural and mechanical properties of gallium oxide films grown on
   silicon crystallographic planes (001), (011), and (111) with a buffer
   layer of silicon carbide are investigated. Nanoindentation was used to

   determine the elastic recovery parameter of the films under study. The
   tensile strength, hardness, elasticity tensor, compliance tensor,
   Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, and other characteristics of gallium
   oxide were calculated using quantum chemistry methods. It was found that
   the gallium oxide crystal is auxetic because, for some stretching
   directions, the Poisson's ratio takes on negative values. The calculated
   values correspond quantitatively to the experimental data. It is
   concluded that the elastoplastic properties of gallium oxide films
   approximately correspond to the properties of bulk crystals and that a

Journal = {{PROGRESS IN MATERIALS SCIENCE}},

Volume = {{94}},
Pages = {{114-173}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Mechanical metamaterials are man-made structures with counterintuitive
   mechanical properties that originate in the geometry of their unit cell
   instead of the properties of each component. The typical mechanical
   metamaterials are generally associated with the four elastic constants,
   the Young's modulus E, shear modulus G, bulk modulus K and Poisson's
   ratio v, the former three of which correspond to the stiffness,
   rigidity, and compressibility of a material from an engineering point of
   view. Here we review the important advancements in structural topology
   optimisation of the underlying design principles, coupled with
   experimental fabrication, thereby to obtain various counterintuitive
   mechanical properties. Further, a clear classification of mechanical
   metamaterials have been established based on the fundamental material
   mechanics. Consequently, mechanical metamaterials can be divide into
   strong-lightweight (E/rho), pattern transformation with tunable
   stiffness, negative compressibility (-4G/3 < K < 0), Pentamode
   metamaterials (G << K) and auxetic metamaterials (G >> K),
   simultaneously using topology optimisation to share various fancy but
   feasible mechanical properties, ultralight, ultra-stiffness,

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials and microstructures are attracting the attention of a
   growing community of researchers due to their unusual properties and
   high mechanical performances, in both the static and dynamic regimes.
   The topological derivative is used in this contribution to determine
   microstructures having the most negative in-plane mean Poisson's ratio.
   The auxetic nature of the computed microstructures is demonstrated by
   both numerical and real experiments performed over samples fabricated by
   additive printing. The effective mechanical properties of these auxetic
   structures have been computed in the framework of couple stress
   elasticity, allowing to identify both in-plane and out-of plane
   effective properties. The calculated classical moduli are found
   independent of the size of the window of analysis and are consequently
   effective coefficients. In contrast to this, the calculated in-plane
   bending moduli show a clear dependency on the auxetic cell size, whereas
   the out-of-plane bending moduli appear to be size-independent.}},

Abstract = {{Soft network materials that incorporate wavy filamentary microstructures
   have appealing applications in bio-integrated devices and tissue
   engineering, in part due to their biomimetic mechanical properties, such
   as ``J-shaped{''} stress-strain curves and negative Poisson's ratios.
   The diversity of the microstructure geometry as well as the network
   topology provides access to a broad range of tunable mechanical
   properties, suggesting a high degree of design flexibility. The
   understanding of the underlying microstructure-property relationship
   requires the development of a general mechanics theory. Here, we
   introduce a theoretical model of infinitesimal deformations for the soft
   network materials constructed with periodic lattices of arbitrarily
   shaped microstructures. Taking three representative lattice topologies
   (triangular, honeycomb, and square) as examples, we obtain analytic
   solutions of Poisson's ratio and elastic modulus based on the mechanics
   model. These analytic solutions, as validated by systematic finite
   element analyses (FEA), elucidated different roles of lattice topology
   and microstructure geometry on Poisson's ratio of network materials with
   engineered zigzag microstructures. With the aid of the theoretical
   model, a crescent-shaped microstructure was devised to expand the
   accessible strain range of network materials with relative constant
   Poisson's ratio under large levels of stretching. This study provides
   theoretical guidelines for the soft network material designs to achieve
   desired Poisson's ratio and elastic modulus.}},

Journal = {{ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING}},
Year = {{2018}},

Abstract = {{This original work proposes to investigate the transposition of
   crystallography rules to cubic lattice architectured materials to
   generate new 3D porous structures. The application of symmetry
   operations provides a complete and convenient way to configure the
   lattice architecture with only two parameters. New lattice structures
   were created by slipping from the conventional Bravais lattice toward
   non-compact complex structures. The resulting stiffness of the porous
   materials was thoroughly evaluated for all the combinations of
   architecture parameters. This exhaustive study revealed attractive
   structures having high specific stiffness, up to twice as large as the
   usual octet-truss for a given relative density. It results in a
   relationship between effective Young modulus and relative density for
   any lattice structure. It also revealed the opportunity to generate
   auxetic structures at will, with a controlled Poisson ratio. The
   collection of the elastic properties for all the cubic structures into
   3D maps provides a convenient tool for lattice materials design, for
   research, and for mechanical engineering. The resulting mechanical
   properties are highly variable according to architecture, and can be
   easily tailored for specific applications using the simple yet powerful
   formalism developed in this work.}},

Year = {{2018}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{In the present paper, a novel cellular metamaterial that was based on a
   tensegrity pattern is presented. The material is constructed from
   supercells, each of which consists of eight 4-strut simplex modules. The
   proposed metamaterial exhibits some unusual properties, which are
   typical for smart structures. It is possible to control its mechanical
   characteristics by adjusting the level of self-stress or by changing the
   properties of structural members. A continuum model is used to identify
   the qualitative properties of the considered metamaterial, and to
   estimate how the applied self-stress and the characteristics of cables
   and struts affect the whole structure. The performed analyses proved
   that the proposed structure can be regarded as a smart metamaterial with
   orthotropic properties. One of its most important features are unique
   values of Poisson's ratio, which can be either positive or negative,
   depending on the applied control parameters. Moreover, all of the
   mechanical characteristics of the proposed metamaterial are prone to
   structural control.}},

Journal = {{MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2018}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic structures and materials expand laterally when stretched. It has
   been argued that this property could be applied in the design of smart
   filters with tunable sieving properties. This work analyses the
   filtration properties of a class of auxetic structures which achieve
   their auxeticity through a rotating rigid unit mechanism, an archetypal
   mechanism known to be responsible for this behavior in a number of
   crystalline materials. In particular, mathematical expressions are
   derived for the space coverage of networks constructed from a variety of
   quadrilaterals, as well as the pore radius. The latter is indicative of
   the particle size that can pass through when the particle dimension is
   comparable to the pore size, whereas the space coverage is indicative of
   the rate of flow when the particles are of a much smaller dimension than
   the pore size. The expressions suggest that these systems offer a wide
   range of pore sizes and space coverages, both of which can be controlled
   through the way that the units are connected to each other, their shape
   and the angle between them.}},

   current, transconductance, output conductance and I-on/I-off ratio have
   been obtained and it is demonstrated that by incorporating ferroelectric
   material as gate insulator with Ge-channel, subthreshold swing values
   less than 60 mV/dec can be achieved along with improved gate
   controllability and current drivability. Further, to critically analyze
   the advantages offered by NCGe-DG-pFET, a detailed comparison has been
   done with Germanium Double Gate p-type Field Effect Transistor
   (Ge-DG-pFET) and it is shown that NCGe-DG-pFET exhibits high gain,
   enhanced transport efficiency in channel, very less or negligible
   degradation in device characteristics due to interface trap charges as
   compared to Ge-DG-pFET. The analytical results so obtained show good
   agreement with simulated results obtained from Silvaco ATLAS TCAD tool.

Abstract = {{This paper presents a systematic approach for designing 3D auxetic
   lattice materials, which exhibit constant negative Poisson's ratios over
   large strain intervals. A unit cell model mimicking tensile tests is
   established and based on the proposed model, the secant Poisson's ratio
   is defined as the negative ratio between the lateral and the
   longitudinal engineering strains. The optimization problem for designing
   a material unit cell with a target Poisson's ratio is formulated to
   minimize the average lateral engineering stresses under the prescribed
   deformations. Numerical results demonstrate that 3D auxetic lattice
   materials with constant Poisson's ratios can be achieved by the proposed
   optimization formulation and that two sets of material architectures are
   obtained by imposing different symmetry on the unit cell. Moreover,
   inspired by the topology-optimized material architecture, a subsequent
   shape optimization is proposed by parametrizing material architectures
   using super-ellipsoids. By designing two geometrical parameters, simple
   optimized material microstructures with different target Poisson's
   ratios are obtained. By interpolating these two parameters as polynomial
   functions of Poisson's ratios, material architectures for any Poisson's
   ratio in the interval of nu is an element of {[} -0.78, 0.00] are
   explicitly presented. Numerical evaluations show that interpolated
   auxetic lattice materials exhibit constant Poisson's ratios in the
   target strain interval of {[}0.00, 0.20] and that 3D auxetic lattice
   material architectures with programmable Poisson's ratio are achievable.

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{140}},
Pages = {{537-546}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The mechanical properties of anti-trichial honeycombs under quasi-static
   compression with large deformation are studied by both experiments and
   theoretical analysis. It is shown that the cells' collapse of the
   anti-trichiral honeycombs dominated by both the ligaments' rotation
   around the plastic hinges and the rotation of cylinders. The theoretical
   analytical models are established to predict both the NPR and the
   crushing stress of the anti-trichiral honeycombs. The analytical
   predictions show good agreement with the experimental results. It is
   shown that the crushing stress of the honeycomb decreases with the
   ligament's length ratio L/r, but increases with the wall thickness. As
   for the honeycomb's Poisson's ratio, it increases with the ligaments'
   length ratio and decreases with the honeycomb's deformation, while the
   wall thickness has no influence on it. The anti-trichiral honeycomb
   exhibits NPR effect only when the ligament's length ratio less than 5.5.
   However, when the ligaments' length ratio is more than 10, the
   anti-trichiral honeycomb shows positive Poisson's ratio during the whole
   compression. When the ligaments' length ratio is in the range of 5.5
   through 10, the anti-trichiral honeycomb appears NPR under small
   deformation, but positive Poisson's ratio under large deformation. These
   light up a refer to the design of the anti-trichiral honeycombs.}},

Journal = {{AEROSPACE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{76}},

Abstract = {{Solids that exhibit negative Poisson's ratio are called auxetic
   materials. Static behavior of the auxetic-porous structures has not been
   investigated so far, especially for structures composed of multi
   directional heterogeneous materials. The two parameter elastic
   foundation (Pasternak type) is developed by taking into account the
   torsional interaction and horizontal friction force. The material
   properties of the plate except the Poisson's ratio are assumed to be
   graded in the thickness and radial directions according to exponential
   functions. The governing state equations are derived in terms of
   displacements based on 3D poroelasticity theory. These equations are
   semi-analytically solved using state-space based differential quadrature
   method. A detailed parametric study is carried out to highlight the
   influences of key parameters on the static response of non-uniform
   bi-directional functionally graded auxetic-porous material (FGAPM)
   circular plates to compound mechanical tractions. Finally, the static
   response of circular plates composed of various functionally graded
   materials to compound mechanical loads is compared. Results reveal that
   the auxeticity of the material, torsional couples on the plate and
   rotary interaction of the elastic foundation play important roles on the
   static behavior of the plate. (C) 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights

Abstract = {{Background: Dementia prevalence is rising, and it will double in the
   next 20 years. This study sought to understand the prevalence of
   dementia in hospitalized patients with ischemic stroke, and its impact
   on outcomes. Methods: Using the Canadian Institute of Health
   Information's (CIHI) Discharge Abstract Database (DAD), all acute
   ischemic stroke admissions from April 2003 to March 2015 in Canada
   (excluding Quebec) were analyzed. Concurrent dementia at the time of
   admission was assessed based on hospital diagnostic codes.
   Characteristics and in-hospital outcomes were compared in patients with
   and without dementia using chi(2) and negative binomial, as well as
   Poisson regression analysis. Results: During the observed period,
   313,138 people were admitted to a hospital in Canada for an ischemic
   stroke. Of those, 21,788 (7.0\%) had a concurrent diagnosis of dementia.
   People with dementia had older median age (84 vs. 76 years; p < 0.0001),
   were more often female (59.6\% vs. 48.4\%; p < 0.0001) and more often
   had Charlson-Deyo Comorbidity Index >= 2 (64.5\% vs. 43.5\%; p <
   0.0001). Patients with dementia were less likely to be discharged to a
   rehabilitation facility (adjusted risk ratio {[}RR] 3.089, 95\%
   confidence interval {[}CI] 2.992-3.188, p < 0.0001) or home
   independently (adjusted RR 0.756, 95\% CI 0.737-0.776, p < 0.0001).
   Interpretation: Approximately 1 in 13 hospitalized ischemic stroke
   patients has coded dementia. Patients with ischemic stroke and
   concurrent dementia have higher mortality, face significantly more
   dependence after stroke and utilize greater healthcare resources than
   stroke patients without dementia. Causative conclusions are limited by
   the administrative data source. Early care planning and coordination
   could potentially optimize outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Materials science has adopted the term of auxetic behavior for
   structural deformations where stretching in some direction entails
   lateral widening, rather than lateral shrinking. Most studies, in the
   last three decades, have explored repetitive or cellular structures and
   used the notion of negative Poisson's ratio as the hallmark of auxetic
   behavior. However, no general auxetic principle has been established
   from this perspective. In the present article, we show that a purely
   geometric approach to periodic auxetics is apt to identify essential
   characteristics of frameworks with auxetic deformations and can generate
   a systematic and endless series of periodic auxetic designs. The
   critical features refer to convexity properties expressed through
   families of homothetic ellipsoids.}},

Abstract = {{This paper aims to numerically study the equilibrium characteristics of
   the ionic inter-diffusion processes in ion exchange membrane systems
   under bi-ionic conditions as a function of the membrane fixed-charge
   concentration and the thickness of the diffusion boundary layers

   constituted by a membrane with negative fixed charge and two identical
   diffusion boundary layers on both sides of the membrane. The system is
   bathed by two solutions with a common co-ion but different counter ion.
   The ionic transport processes of a ternary electrolyte are described by
   the Nernst-Planck-Poisson equations not only in the membrane but also in
   the diffusion layers, including the electric double layers at the
   interfaces. The ionic concentrations and electric potential profiles
   have been numerically obtained using the network simulation method in a
   permeable membrane system where the co-ion flux is a significant
   fraction of the counter ionic fluxes. The effect of the diffusion
   boundary layers on the equilibrium membrane potential, the ionic fluxes
   and the ionic concentration profiles inside the membrane have been
   analysed and discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Freight transportation is an important factor in Turkish economic
   growth, and the high volume of truck traffic has increased traffic
   accidents on Turkish roads. However, to the best of our knowledge, no
   studies have investigated the factors that contribute to truck
   accidents. This study aims to reduce truck accident involvement and
   quantify the effect of variables on the occurrence of truck accidents on
   divided multilane interurban roads in Turkey. This study documents the
   performance of Poisson, Negative Binomial (NB), and Zero-inflated
   Negative Binomial Regression (ZINB) models to establish the relation
   between truck accidents and traffic and geometric road characteristics
   on a 282 km section of the Ankara-Aksaray-Eregli divided multilane
   interurban road. Model coefficients were estimated by the maximum
   likelihood method, and deviance and the Akaike information criterion
   were considered as goodness of fit statistics. The Vuong test was used
   to determine the appropriateness of using the ZINB model rather than the
   NB model. The results show that the NB model fitted the data very well.
   The proposed model for Turkish divided multilane interurban roads with a
   high percentage of truck traffic might be useful to detect critical
   factors and reduce truck accident involvement.}},

Abstract = {{The potential of several classes of mechanical metamaterials to induce
   their own overall rotational motion through the individual rotation of
   their subunits is examined. Using a theoretical approach, we confirm
   that for various rotating rigid unit systems, if by design the sum of
   angular momentum of subunits rotating in different directions is made to
   be unequal, then the system will experience an overall rotation, the
   extent of which may be controlled through careful choice of the
   geometric parameters defining these systems. This phenomenon of
   self-induced rotation is also confirmed experimentally. Furthermore, we
   discuss how these systems can be designed in a special way so as to
   permit extended rotations which allows them to overcome geometric
   lockage and the relevance of this concept in applications ranging from
   satellites to spacecraft and telescopes employed in space.}},

Abstract = {{Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) meshes are exposed to predominately tensile
   loading conditions in vivo that can lead to pore collapse by 70-90\%,
   decreasing overall porosity and providing a plausible mechanism for the
   contraction/shrinkage of mesh observed following implantation. To
   prevent pore collapse, we proposed to design synthetic meshes with a
   macrostructure that results in auxetic behavior, the pores expand
   laterally, instead of contracting when loaded. Such behavior can be
   achieved with a range of auxetic structures/geometries. This study
   utilized finite element analysis (FEA) to assess the behavior of mesh
   models with eight auxetic pore geometries subjected to uniaxial loading
   to evaluate their potential to allow for pore expansion while
   simultaneously providing resistance to tensile loading. Overall,
   substituting auxetic geometries for standard pore geometries yielded
   more pore expansion, but often at the expense of increased model
   elongation, with two of the eight auxetics not able to maintain pore
   expansion at higher levels of tension. Meshes with stable pore
   geometries that remain open with loading will afford the ingrowth of
   host tissue into the pores and improved integration of the mesh. Given
   the demonstrated ability of auxetic geometries to allow for pore size
   maintenance (and pore expansion), auxetically designed meshes have the
   potential to significantly impact surgical outcomes and decrease the
   likelihood of major mesh-related complications.}},

Title = {{Auxetic hexachiral structures with wavy ligaments for large
   elasto-plastic deformation}},
Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The hexachiral structure is in-plane isotropic in small deformation.
   When subjected to large elasto-plastic deformation, however, the
   hexachiral structure tends to lose its auxeticity and/or
   isotropy-properties which are desirable in many potential applications.
   The objective of this study is to improve these two mechanical
   properties, without significantly compromising the effective yield
   stress, in the regime with significant material and geometrical
   nonlinearity effects. It is found that the deformation mechanisms
   underlying the auxeticity and isotropy properties of a hexachiral
   structure are largely influenced by the extent of rotation of the
   central ring in a unit cell. To facilitate the development of this
   deformation mechanism, an improved design with wavy ligaments is
   proposed. The improved performance of the proposed hexachiral structure
   is demonstrated. An initial study on possible applications as a
   protective material is next carried out, where the improved hexachiral
   design is shown to exhibit higher specific energy absorption capacity
   compared to the original design, as well as standard honeycomb
   structures.}},

Abstract = {{This work studies the constitutive response of two- and

   a focus on the elastic stiffness moduli that can be directly measured
   through experimental tests. The elementary unit cell of the examined
   lattices is formed by an arbitrary number of junctions attached to a
   junction. Analytic formulae for the elastic stiffness coefficients of
   stretching-dominated lattices are provided. In addition, numerical
   results for the incremental elastic moduli of composite lattices
   equipped with hard and soft rods are presented. The given results
   highlight that isotropically pre-tensioned lattices may exhibit marked
   variations of the elastic stiffness moduli in the prestressed state,
   over the values competing to the stress-free configuration. This study
   also discloses that prestressed lattices may feature incremental auxetic
   response, when composite architectures suitably combining hard and soft
   materials are employed for their fabrication.}},

Title = {{Effect of alloying elements on mechanical, electronic and magnetic
   properties of Fe2B by first-principles investigations}},
Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{147}},
Pages = {{322-330}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{First-principles calculations using density functional theory (DFT) were
   performed to explore the effect of common 3d elements M (M = Ti, V, Cr,
   Mn, Co, Ni and Cu) on the mechanical, electronic and magnetic properties
   of Fe2B. A formula of (Fe-0.875,M-0.125)(2)B was used. Firstly, the
   negative cohesive energy and formation enthalpy suggest that all the
   compounds are thermodynamically stable. With the knowledge of calculated
   elastic constants, the moduli, the Pugh's modulus ratio G/B, the
   Poisson's ratio v and the hardness of Fe2B and (Fe-0.875,M-0.125)(2)B
   were further predicted. Overall, with increasing atomic number, the
   moduli and hardness of the borides initially increase and then decrease.
   (Fe-0.875,Cr-0.125)(2)B possesses the largest bulk, shear and Young's
   modulus simultaneously, while (Fe0.875,Mn0.125)(2)B has the largest
   hardness. The G/B and v values indicate that all the alloying elements
   are able to enhance the ductility of the Fe2B except Mn, but they do not
   change the nature of intrinsic brittleness of the Fe2B. Combined with
   the electronic structures, we revealed that the mechanical properties of
   the borides are mostly determined by Fe-B and M-B bonds. Fe-Fe bonds in
   < 2 2 0 > and < 1 1 3 > orientations are both covalent bonding. It can
   also be predicted that all the alloying elements reduce the magnetic
   moments (Ms) of the Fe2B mainly because the Ms of the substituted M atom
   is smaller than that of Fe atom. (C) 2018 Elsevier B. V. All rights

Abstract = {{Contact surface unevenness of the dry-stackable, interlocking blocks
   adversely affects the constructability of the drystack system. This
   paper presents the contact surface characteristics of these blocks and
   strategies for mitigating the unevenness through systematic experimental
   and numerical studies. First, the contact surface characteristics of the
   dry-stackable blocks have been examined experimentally using matrix
   based tactile surface sensors (MBTSS). High peak pressure locations on
   the contacting interfaces have been identified; these locations have
   remained unaffected by the level of the applied load in the experiment.
   A micro finite element modelling method incorporating the uneven contact
   surface has been formulated and the parameters calibrated using the
   experimental data. Two strategies for minimising the contact surface
   unevenness are then proposed (1) grinding of the surfaces of the blocks
   and (2) embedding a packing material between the surfaces. Both
   strategies have been analysed through the finite element model. The peak
   contact pressure is shown to have reduced considerably for the grinding
   strategy and when an auxetic fabric is used as an insert between the
   contacting surfaces of the blocks. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{With the development of three-dimensional printing technologies,
   so-called ``designer materials{''} including re-entrant, chiral, and
   rotating rigid structures have attracted much attention due to unusual
   properties. However, most studies ignore theoretical analysis and pay
   much attention to numerical simulation. In this article, a novel
   re-entrant cellular material is proposed and taken as an example to
   introduce the methods of theoretical study on relations between
   mechanical properties and geometric parameters of this ``designer
   material.{''} This work starts from developing theoretical models of
   relative density using two-dimensional unit cell in terms of three
   geometric parameters: edge length, reentrant distance, and cellular
   thickness. Then, linear-elastic mechanical properties including elastic
   modulus and shear modulus, and nonlinear mechanical properties are
   explored. Based on theoretical models, predominant compression failure
   mode of this material is plastic collapse. Finite element method is
   adopted to identify accuracy of static mechanical models. On this basis,
   dynamic mechanical model is put forward, the relationship of dynamic
   plateau stress and impact velocity, and structural parameters are
   established by empirical formula. Moreover, the relationship of unit
   volume energy absorption and geometric features, impact velocity are
   also established. Eventually, finite element method is utilized to prove
   that simulation results show a well coincidence to theoretical results.}},

Title = {{The epidemiology of hepatitis C in Switzerland: trends in notifications,

Month = {{APR 23}},
Abstract = {{With an estimated antibody prevalence of 0.7\% in the low-risk
   population, hepatitis C virus (HCV) endemicity in Switzerland is low. We
   reviewed data from mandatory hepatitis C surveillance for 1988-2015 in
   order to describe the evolution of acute HCV infections and newly
   reported non-acute cases, and their epidemiological features. Crude and
   stratified annual incidence and notification rates and rate ratios were
   calculated using Poisson regression. Acute HCV incidence peaked in 2002
   at 1.8 cases per 100,000 population, then declined sharply, levelling at
   around 0.7/100,000 from 2006. Notification rates for non-acute HCV cases
   peaked in 1999 (38.6/100,000), decreasing to 16.8/100,000 in 2015. Men
   constituted 65.5\% of acute cases and 60.4\% of non-acute cases. During
   the periods 1992-1995 and 2012-2015, the median age of acute cases
   increased from 28 to 37 and of non-acute cases from 32 to 48 years. The
   exposure leading to most acute (90.4\%) and non-acute (71.9\%) cases was
   presumably in Switzerland. Despite a sharp decrease since 2000,
   injecting drugs was the main reported exposure for both acute (63.8\%)
   and non-acute (66.6\%) cases, with a known exposure, followed by sexual
   contact with an infected person (18.9\% and 10.3\% respectively). Among
   all acute cases, the number of men who have sex with men increased
   sharply after the mid-2000s, totalling 41 during 2012-2015 (25.7\%).
   Although the HCV epidemic peaked in 2000 - probably as a result of
   measures to control iatrogenic and percutaneous transmission -
   Switzerland must maintain prevention and surveillance.}},

Title = {{Scalability assessment of Group-IV mono-chalcogenide based tunnel FET}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{APR 16}},
Abstract = {{Selection of appropriate channel material is the key to design high
   performance tunnel field effect transistor (TFET), which promises to
   outperform the conventional metal oxide semiconductor field effect
   transistor (MOSFET) in ultra-low energy switching applications. Recently
   discovered atomically thin GeSe, a group IV mono-chalcogenide, can be a
   potential candidate owing to its direct electronic band gap and low
   carrier effective mass. In this work we employ ballistic quantum
   transport model to assess the intrinsic performance limit of monolayer
   GeSe-TFET. We first study the electronic band structure by regular and
   hybrid density functional theory and develop two band k center dot p
   hamiltonian for the material. We find that the complex band wraps itself
   within the conduction band and valence band edges and thus signifies
   efficient band to band tunneling mechanism. We then use the k center dot
   p hamiltonian to calculate self-consistent solution of the transport
   equations within the non-equilibrium Green's function formalism and the
   Poisson's equation based electrostatic potential. Keeping the
   OFF-current fixed at 10 pA/mu m we investigate different static and
   dynamic performance metrics (ON current, energy and delay) under three
   different constant-field scaling rules: 40, 30 and 20 nm/V. Our study
   shows that monolayer GeSe-TFET is scalable till 8 nm while preserving
   ON/OFF current ratio higher than 10(4).}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we predicted three new two-dimensional (2D) Be2C
   structures, namely, alpha-Be2C, beta-Be2C, and gamma-Be2C, on the basis
   of density functional theory (DFT) computations and the particle-swarm
   optimization (PSO) method. In alpha-Be2C, a carbon atom binds to eight
   Be atoms, forming an octacoordinate carbon moiety. This is the first
   example of an octacoordinate carbon containing material. The other two
   structures, beta-Be2C and gamma-Be2C, are quasi planar hexacoordinate
   carbon (phC) containing 2D materials. Good stability with these three
   phases is revealed by their lower cohesive energy and positive phonon
   modes. More interestingly, these predicted new phases of Be2C are all
   semiconductors and have unusual negative Poisson's ratios (NPRs). If
   synthesized, 2D Be2C materials will have a broad range of applications
   in electronics and mechanics.}},

Abstract = {{Background and objectives Despite colistin's longstanding reported
   association with nephrotoxicity, the attributable risk and timing of
   toxicity onset are still unknown. Whether substantial toxicity occurs
   during the initial 72 hours of exposure has important implications for
   early treatment decisions. The objective of this study was to compare
   colistin-exposed patients with a matched control group given other broad
   spectrum antibiotics.
   Design, setting, participants, \& measurements We conducted a
   retrospective cohort study in patients treated for multidrug-resistant
   Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, or Acinetobacter spp. Colistin-exposed patients
   were matched to unexposed controls using propensity scores. AKI was
   defined according to the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes
   creatinine criteria. Incidence rate ratios and risk differences of AKI
   in the matched cohort were estimated with the generalized estimating
   equation Poisson regression model. Risk factors for AKI were tested for
   effect modification in the matched cohort.
   Results The study included 150 propensity-matched pairs with similar
   types of infection, similar delays to effective treatment, and similar
   baseline characteristics. Incidence of AKI was 77 of 150 (51\%) in the
   colistin group versus 33 of 150 (22\%) in matched controls (risk
   difference, 29\%; 95\% confidence interval, 19 to 39), corresponding to
   a number needed to harm of 3.5. Early toxicity was apparent, because AKI
   risk was higher in colistin-exposed patients at 72 hours of exposure
   (incidence rate ratio, 1.9; 95\% confidence interval, 1.1 to 3.5). In
   both groups, hospital mortality in patients who experienced AKI was
   lower if kidney function returned to baseline during hospitalization.
   The effect of colistin exposure on AKI risk varied inversely according
   to baseline hemoglobin concentration.
   Conclusions Colistin is associated with substantial excess AKI that is
   apparent within the first 72 hours of treatment. Colistin's toxicity
   varied according to baseline hemoglobin concentration.}},

   automobile. In this paper, a novel crash box based on the cylindrical
   cellular structure with negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) is proposed. The
   unit cell for the NPR structure is the double-V configuration. The
   structure can contract in the radial direction when compressed to
   enhance the stiffness. Then the parametric finite element (FE) model is
   constructed with MATLAB scripts to study the influence of the
   geometrical parameters on the crashworthiness. During the analysis, the
   Rescaled Range Analysis (RRA) is utilized. Then the specific energy
   absorption (SEA) and peak crushing force (PCF) are chosen as the
   optimization objective, and the Pareto fronts are attained by employing
   the multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithm. Also,
   the optimal results are compared with the initial model to verify the
   effectiveness of the approach. It is found that the SEA increases from
   4.33 M/Kg to 6.06 KJ/kg by 39.3\% and PCF decreases to 78.89 KN by
   10.3\% when the geometry parameters are optimized. Compared with the
   thin-walled circle structure, the cylindrical NPR structure has lower
   peak crushing force and higher energy absorption. Also, the crushing
   force is more stable under the impact loading. Therefore, the
   cylindrical NPR structure has a great prospect in the application of the
   energy absorber of the automobile. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In order to improve the crashworthiness and energy absorption
   performance, this paper introduces the structural bionics to the
   structural design of crash box and proposes a novel structure. Taking
   the human tibia as a bionic object, the novel crash box is composed of a
   concave structure shell and an inner core filled with negative Poisson's
   ratio (NPR) structure material. In view of the gradient characteristics
   of the cancellous bone structure of the tibia, the NPR inner core is
   designed as a functional gradient distribution structure along the
   longitudinal direction of the crash box. Based on this, by combining the
   optimal Latin hypercube design and response surface methodology, a
   multi-objective optimization design is conducted for the novel crash box
   based on archive-based micro genetic algorithm (AMGA) and improved
   non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II). Simulation results
   show that the novel crash box optimized by NSGA-II algorithm can improve
   the energy absorption characteristics and comprehensive crashworthiness
   more effectively, and make the collision process controllable and
   stable. The results of this paper can provide some reference for the
   design and optimization of the crash box. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This paper studies the optimization of converting process parameters of

   desired responses. A series of experiments were implemented based on the
   Taguchi orthogonal array design. In order to determine the optimum
   control factors level, three different multi-objective optimization
   methods i.e. grey relational analysis, fitness function and desirability
   function were employed. The optimum combinations achieved form all
   methods were verified through the confirmation tests. Although outcomes
   of all these methods, in the case of both Poisson's ratio and stiffness,
   were in a good agreement with the confirmation tests, however the result
   of grey relational analysis had the minimum mean error percentage. Also,
   all these methods reported the pressure, heat temperature and time as
   the first, second and third level of significance, respectively. This
   study allows manufacturer to select the optimization procedure
   appropriately and produce the auxetic foam with minimum waste material.}},

Abstract = {{Bending of an annular thick plate resting on a ring support is analyzed
   under the action of power-law axisymmetric loading. A single governing
   differential equation for the Mindlin plate theory is derived. By
   solving associated boundary value problem, the optimal support location
   is determined to achieve minimizing the maximum deflection of a
   moderately thick circular or annular plate. The minimum sag of a heavy
   solid circular plate with or without the center support under
   self-weight is also analyzed. In addition to applied loading and the
   restraint of plate's rims, the optimal location of the ring support is
   also related to Poisson's ratio and the ratio of inner-to-outer radius.
   Auxetic plates with negative Poisson's ratio require larger ring
   support's radius, and conventional plates require smaller ring support's
   radius. Usually, the optimal support location is closer to the outer rim
   and far to the inner rim for a plate of self-weight. The obtained
   results are useful in safety design of circular or annular plates under
   complicated loading.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel three-dimensional (3D) lattice honeycomb is
   developed based on a twodimensional (2D) accordion-like honeycomb. A
   combination of theoretical and numerical analysis is carried out to gain
   a deeper understanding of the elastic behavior of the new honeycomb and
   its dependence on the geometric parameters. The results show that the
   proposed new honeycomb can simultaneously achieve an in-plane negative
   Poisson's ratio (NPR) effect and an out-of-plane zero Poisson's ratio
   (ZPR) effect. This unique property may be very promising in some
   important fields, like aerospace, piezoelectric sensors and biomedicine
   engineering. The results also show that the geometric parameters, such
   as the slant angle, the strut thickness and the relative density, have a
   significant effect on the mechanical properties. Additionally, different
   dominant deformation models of the new honeycomb when compressed along
   the x (or y) and z directions are identified. This work provides a new

Abstract = {{In this paper, a series of triaxial compression experiments was
   performed to investigate the effects of fracture dip, trace length, gap
   width, confining pressure and temperature on mechanical properties of
   the single-fractured rock mass. Experimental results show that the
   mechanical parameters of rock mass exhibit the quadratic function with
   dips and the exponential distribution with trace length, respectively.
   Moreover, the fitting formula (3) is employed to calculate rock mass
   strength approximately. It is found that rock mass strength linearly
   increases with the confming pressure. However, Poisson ratio and elastic
   modulus under negative temperature are independent of the confming
   pressure. The strength of rock mass decreases with the increase of gap
   width when it is less than 0.1 mm or greater than 0.8 mm. However,
   mechanical parameters are irrelevant to the gap width when it locates
   between 0.1 mm and 0.8 mm. Water, existing in pores and fractures,
   freezes under negative temperature so that both the cohesion and
   friction angle between rock particles are increased. Hence, the change
   of water form is the reason why the rock mass strength increases with
   reducing temperature. Results also show that the fracture angle affects
   the initial position of failure surface, the trace length affects the
   expansion scale of failure surface, and the confming pressure influences
   the extension direction of failure surface. In addition, the crack dip
   is the most sensitive influencing parameter to the strength of rock
   mass, followed by trace length, with the least temperature.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives This study examines the prevalence of pregnancy in
   serodiscordant couples and identifies predictors associated with
   pregnancy in rural Rakai, Uganda.
   Study design A population-based cross-sectional study that used data
   from the Rakai Community Cohort Study (RCCS).
   Setting and participants We used data from the RCCS survey round 17
   (2015-2016), which included 488 women in serodiscordant relationships.
   This study was conducted in Rakai district, located in south-western
   Uganda.
   Primary outcomes Pregnancy status.
   Statistical analysis Multivariable modified Poisson regression using
   stepwise selection was used to determine characteristics and behaviours
   associated with pregnancy status.
   Results The prevalence of pregnancy was 12\% in women among
   serodiscordant couples. HIV-negative women in serodiscordant couples had
   a slightly higher pregnancy prevalence rate (13.6\%) compared with
   HIV-positive women in serodiscordant couples (11\%). Factors
   significantly associated with higher prevalence of pregnancy were;
   younger age 15-24 years (prevalence risk ratio (PRR)=4.04; 95\% CI 1.72
   to 9.50), middle age 25-34 years (PRR=2.49; 95\% CI 1.05 to 5.89),
   Christian religion (PRR=2.26; 95\% CI 1.41 to 3.63) and inconsistent
   condom use in the last 12 months (PRR=4.38, 95\% CI 1.09 to 17.53).
   Neither HIV status nor HIV status disclosure was significantly
   associated with risk of getting pregnant.
   Conclusion Nearly 12\% of women in serodiscordant relationships were
   pregnant, highlighting the need for integrated services to prevent
   unintended pregnancies and reduce conceptional related risks for those
   choosing to conceive. Association with younger age and inconsistent
   condom use suggests a role for early and continued couple-based
   conception counselling.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To compare daily exposure to tuberculosis (TB) patients
   between HIV-infected and non-HIVinfected health care workers (HCWs), and
   examine the uptake of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and isoniazid
   preventive therapy (IPT) among HIV-infected HCWs in Botswana.
   DESIGN: We conducted a cross-sectional study among HCWs in 30 hospitals
   and clinics. We determined self-reported exposure frequency to TB
   patients and HIV status through in-person interviews. HCWs with unknown
   or negative HIV status were offered rapid HIV testing. Multivariable
   Poisson regression modeling with robust variance was used to estimate
   the association between HIV status and daily exposure to TB patients.
   RESULTS: Of 1877 participants enrolled, 1388 (73.9\%) with complete data
   were included in this study. Among 277 (20.0\%) HIV-infected
   participants, 14.3\% were newly diagnosed, 57.8\% were on ART, and
   34.3\% reported previously receiving IPT. Daily exposure to TB patients
   was reported by respectively 48.4\% and 52.9\% of HIV-infected and
   non-infected participants. After adjusting for sex, age, occupation, and
   department, the rates of daily TB exposure remained similar between
   HIV-infected and non-HIV-infected participants (prevalence ratio 0.96,
   95\%CI 0.85-1.08).
   CONCLUSIONS: We found similar rates of exposure to TB patients between
   HIV-infected and non-HIV-infected HCWs. Improved efforts are needed to
   reduce nosocomial exposure to TB among HIV-infected HCWs.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a tunable planar auxetic metamaterial (PAM) for
   controlling and filtering acoustic waves and provides guidelines for
   bandgap design of the proposed PAMs. Numerical results for deformed and
   undeformed PAMs were obtained from several finite element analyses based
   on Bloch-Floquet theory. The acoustic band structures of the PAMs were
   calculated with periodic boundaries. Tunable bandgaps in certain
   frequency ranges were generated by various deformations applied to the
   PAMs. Wave attenuation in experimental transmission loss at specific
   frequencies was demonstrated, showing favorable agreement with the
   bandgaps obtained from numerical calculations. Both the numerical and
   experimental results indicate that the proposed structure demonstrates
   great tunability and offers significant advantages over the regular
   materials for controlling sound wave propagation and filtering sound
   waves within specific frequency ranges.}},

Abstract = {{Chiral metastructures consisting of ring (polygonal or cubic) nodes and
   elastic bending ligaments exhibit excellent design flexibility for

   and the kinematic geometrical relations of a three-dimensional (3D)
   isotropic anti-tetrachiral structure, an analytical expression for the
   modulus of the 3D isotropic anti-tetrachiral structure is derived from
   strain energy analysis. The nylon powder Selected Laser Sintering (SLS)
   additive manufacturing technique is employed for fabricating two types
   of 3D isotropic anti-tetrachiral specimens with different geometrical
   parameters; then comparison between experiments, finite element analysis
   (FEA), and theoretical studies is performed for verifying the analytical
   formula. The mechanical properties of 3D isotropic anti-tetrachiral
   structures can be tuned with two independent dimensionless geometrical
   parameters. The proposed 3D anti-tetrachiral structures can be employed
   for designing advanced structures against impact damages, realizing
   flexibility of industrial components, and optimizing the vibration

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{39}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The multisegment clot sign has been observed at
   the site of large-artery occlusion in patients with acute ischemic
   stroke. This study aimed to assess its occurrence rate and relationship
   with stroke etiologies in patients with acute intracranial large-artery
   occlusion.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: We included consecutive patients with acute
   ischemic stroke who had acute intracranial large-artery occlusion and
   underwent perfusion CT within 8 hours after stroke onset. The
   multisegment clot sign was assessed on dynamic CT angiography derived
   from perfusion CT. The stroke etiologies were defined by the
   international Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment criteria.
   Poisson regression analyses and diagnostic testing were used to
   investigate the relationship between the multisegment clot sign and
   stroke etiologies.
   RESULTS: Finally, 194 patients with intracranial large-artery occlusion
   were enrolled. According to the Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke
   Treatment criteria, 110 (56.7\%) patients were diagnosed with
   cardioembolism; 43 (22.2\%), with large-artery atherosclerosis; and 41
   (21.1\%), with undetermined etiology. The multisegment clot sign was
   found in 74 (38\%) patients. Poisson regression analysis showed that the
   presence of the multisegment clot sign was significantly higher in
   patients with cardioembolism than in those with large-artery
   atherosclerosis (52.7\% versus 9.3\%; prevalence ratio, 1.53; 95\%
   confidence interval, 1.03-2.90; P = .037). For determined etiologies,
   the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive
   values of the multisegment clot sign for predicting cardioembolism were
   52.7\%, 90.7\%, 93.5\%, and 42.9\%, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: The presence of the multisegment clot sign on dynamic CTA
   specifically indicates intracranial large-artery occlusion caused by an
   embolism from a cardiac source, which may be useful for acute management
   and secondary prevention of stroke.}},

Abstract = {{Inspired by the coupling geometrical relations of left-hand (LH) and
   right-hand (RH) climbing towel gourd tendrils within single branch,
   innovative chiral architected cylindrical tube is proposed, which can
   convert axial compression loads into angular rotation deformation.
   Firstly, two series of tetrachiral cylindrical tube samples with
   rotation disk on the mirror plane (middle cross-section) are designed,
   where the numbers of unit cells and tetrachiral nodes radius are
   different. Secondly, the cylindrical tetrachiral tubes are fabricated
   with Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) nylon sintering techniques, and
   in-situ compression tests are performed for studying the relation
   between axial compression strain and rotation angle of the spinning
   disk. It is found that the proposed innovative tetrachiral cylindrical
   tube is able to generate lateral rotation, and linear relation between
   rotation angle and compression force can be harvested. With the progress
   of micro-and nano-manufacturing techniques, the proposed tetrachiral
   cylindrical tube with compression-twist deformation mechanism
   demonstrates robust mechanical performances for future industrial
   applications, such as: shape memory morphing structures in aerospace
   engineering, smart actuators and propellers, smart flexible
   microelectronics and biomechanical devices. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Migration and risk of HIV acquisition in Rakai, Uganda: a

Abstract = {{Background In sub-Saharan Africa, migrants typically have higher HIV
   prevalence than non-migrants; however, whether HIV acquisition typically
   precedes or follows migration is unknown. We aimed to investigate the
   risk of HIV after migration in Rakai District, Uganda.
   Methods In a prospective population-based cohort of HIV-negative
   participants aged 15-49 years in Rakai, Uganda, between April 6, 1999,
   and Jan 30, 2015, we assessed the association between migration and HIV
   acquisition. Individuals were classified as recent in-migrants (<= 2
   years in community), non-recent in-migrants (>2 years in community), or
   permanent residents with no migration history. The primary outcome was
   incident HIV infection. We used Poisson regression to estimate incidence
   rate ratios (IRRs) of HIV associated with residence status with
   adjustment for demographics, sexual behaviours, and time. Data were also
   stratified and analysed within three periods (1999-2004, 2005-11, and
   2011-15) in relation to the introduction of combination HIV prevention
   (CHP; pre-CHP, early CHP, and late CHP).
   Findings Among 26 995 HIV-negative people who participated in the Rakai
   Community Cohort Study survey, 15 187 (56\%) contributed one or more
   follow-up visits (89 292 person-years of follow-up) and were included in
   our final analysis. 4451 (29\%) were ever in-migrants and 10 736 (71\%)
   were permanent residents. 841 incident HIV events occurred, including
   243 (29\%) among in-migrants. HIV incidence per 100 person-years was
   significantly increased among recent in-migrants compared with permanent
   residents, for both women (1.92, 95\% CI 1.52-2.43 vs 0.93, 0.84-1.04;
   IRR adjusted for demographics 1.75, 95\% CI 1.33-2.33) and men (1.52,
   0.99-2.33 vs 0.84, 0.74-0.94; 1.74, 1.12-2.71), but not among non-recent
   in-migrants (IRR adjusted for demographics 0.94, 95\% CI 0.74-1.19 for
   women and 1.28, 0.94-1.74 for men). Between the pre-CHP and late-CHP
   periods, HIV incidence declined among permanent resident men (p<0.0001)
   and women (p=0.002) and non-recent in-migrant men (p=0.031), but was
   unchanged among non-recent in-migrant women (p=0.13) and recent
   in-migrants (men p=0.76; women p=0.84)
   Interpretation The first 2 years after migration are associated with
   increased risk of HIV acquisition. Prevention programmes focused on
   migrants are needed to reduce HIV incidence in sub-Saharan Africa.}},

Abstract = {{ObjectiveThe aim of this study was to investigate the impact of the use
   of crack and other illicit drugson oral health-related quality of life
   (OHRQoL) in young adults.
   MethodsThis cross-sectional study evaluated 106 crack users at a public
   treatment center for drug addiction and 106 controls matched for gender,
   age, and use of tobacco. Clinical examinations were performed for dental
   caries and periodontal disease. The outcome was OHRQoL, which was
   determined using the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14). The
   association between OHRQoL and illicit drugswas modeled using
   conditional Poisson regression.
   ResultsUsers of crack and other illicit drugshad a poorer OHRQoL than
   the controls (p<.001). Among the crack users, the odds ratio to yield
   high OHIP-14 was 3.40 (95\% confidence interval, 1.91-6.08). Adjustment
   for sex, age, schooling, income, smoking, dental caries, and periodontal
   disease did not change such an estimate considerably. The functional
   limitation and psychological discomfort domains were associated with the
   use of illicit drugs.
   ConclusionUsers of crack and other illicit drugs exerted a negative
   impact on OHRQoL independently of socio-demographic characteristics and
   tobacco use, suggesting the need for special attention regarding the
   specific oral health needs of this population as well as drug prevention
   and treatment strategies.}},

   through the mechanism geometry. The framework relates load flow in the
   members of the microstructure to the global material properties, thereby
   enabling a novel synthesis technique for auxetic microstructures. This
   understanding is used to qualitatively classify auxetic materials into
   two classes, namely, high-shear and low-shear microstructures. The
   ability to achieve additional attributes such as isotropy is shown to be
   related to the qualitative class that the microstructure belongs.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTER METHODS IN APPLIED MECHANICS AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{331}},
Pages = {{585-622}},
Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{The paper presents a Bezier triangle based isogeometric shape
   optimization method. Bezier triangles are used to represent both the
   geometry and physical fields. For a given physical domain defined by
   B-spline boundary, a coarse Bezier triangular parameterization is
   automatically generated. This coarse mesh is used to maintain
   parameterization quality and move mesh by solving a pseudo linear
   elasticity problem. Then a fine mesh for isogeometric analysis is
   generated from the coarse mesh through degree elevation and refinement.
   As the fine mesh retains the same geometric map as the coarse mesh, we
   can guarantee mesh validity with the coarse mesh only. This bi-level
   mesh allows us to achieve high numerical accuracy of isogeometric
   analysis and lower computational cost on mesh validity control and mesh
   movement. Due to the use of B-spline boundary, the optimized shape can
   be compactly represented with a relatively small number of optimization
   variables. Due to the use Bezier triangles, this shape optimization
   method is applicable to structures of complex topology and allows for
   local refinement for analysis. By representing the squared distance
   between two Bezier curves as a Bezier form, a distance check scheme is
   also introduced to prevent intersections of design boundaries and
   control the thickness of structural connections. Numerical examples on
   minimal compliance design and design of negative Poisson ratios are
   presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{Adding programmable function to elastic metamaterials makes them
   versatile and intelligent. The objective of this study is to design and
   demonstrate thermomechanically tunable metamaterials with a compliant
   porous structure (CPS) and to analyze their thermomechanical behaviors.
   CPS, the unit cell of the metamaterial, is composed of rectangular
   holes, slits, and bimaterial hinges. By decomposing kinematic rotation
   of a linked arm and elastic deformation of a bimaterial hinge, a
   thermomechanical constitutive model of CPS is constructed, and the
   constitutive model is extended to a three-dimensional (3D) polyhedron
   structure for securing isotropic thermal properties.
   Temperature-dependent properties of base materials are implemented to
   the analytical model. The analytical model is verified with finite
   element (FE) based numerical simulations. A controllable range of
   temperature and strain is identified that is associated with a thermal
   deformation of the bimaterial hinge and contact on the slit surfaces of
   CPS. We also investigate the effect of geometry of CPS on the thermal
   expansion and effective stiffness of the metamaterial. The metamaterial
   with CPS has multiple transformation modes in response to temperature
   while keeping the same mechanical properties at room temperature, such
   as effective moduli and Poisson's ratios. This work will pave the road
   toward the design of programmable metamaterials with both mechanically
   and thermally tunable capability, providing unique thermomechanical
   properties with a programmable function.}},

Abstract = {{Barium chalcogenides are known for their high-technological importance
   and great scientific interest. Detailed studies of their elastic,
   mechanical, dynamical and thermodynamic properties were carried out
   using density functional theory and plane-wave pseudo potential method
   within the generalized gradient approximation. The optimized lattice
   constants were in good agreement when compared with experimental data.
   The independent elastic constants, calculated from a linear fit of the
   computed stress strain function, were used to determine the Young's
   modulus (E), bulk modulus (B), shear modulus (G), Poisson's ratio
   (sigma) and Zener's anisotropy factor (A). Also, the Debye temperature
   and sound velocities for barium chalcogenides were estimated from the
   three independent elastic constants. The calculations of phonon
   dispersion showed that there are no negative frequencies throughout the
   Brillouin zone. Hence barium chalcogenides have dynamically stable
   NaCl-type crystal structure. Finally, their thermodynamic properties
   were calculated in the temperature range of 0-1000 K and their
   constant-volume specific heat capacities at room-temperature were
   reported.}},

Title = {{Auxetic Mechanical Metamaterials to Enhance Sensitivity of Stretchable
   Strain Sensors}},
Journal = {{ADVANCED MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{MAR 22}},
Abstract = {{Stretchable strain sensors play a pivotal role in wearable devices, soft
   robotics, and Internet-of-Things, yet these viable applications, which
   require subtle strain detection under various strain, are often limited
   by low sensitivity. This inadequate sensitivity stems from the Poisson
   effect in conventional strain sensors, where stretched elastomer
   substrates expand in the longitudinal direction but compress
   transversely. In stretchable strain sensors, expansion separates the
   active materials and contributes to the sensitivity, while Poisson
   compression squeezes active materials together, and thus intrinsically
   limits the sensitivity. Alternatively, auxetic mechanical metamaterials
   undergo 2D expansion in both directions, due to their negative
   structural Poisson's ratio. Herein, it is demonstrated that such auxetic
   metamaterials can be incorporated into stretchable strain sensors to
   significantly enhance the sensitivity. Compared to conventional sensors,
   the sensitivity is greatly elevated with a 24-fold improvement. This
   sensitivity enhancement is due to the synergistic effect of reduced
   structural Poisson's ratio and strain concentration. Furthermore,
   microcracks are elongated as an underlying mechanism, verified by both
   experiments and numerical simulations. This strategy of employing
   auxetic metamaterials can be further applied to other stretchable strain
   sensors with different constituent materials. Moreover, it paves the way
   for utilizing mechanical metamaterials into a broader library of
   stretchable electronics.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials exhibiting a negative Poisson's ratio are shown to
   have better indentation resistance, impact shielding capability, and
   enhanced toughness. Here, we report a class of high-performance
   composites in which auxetic lattice structures are used as the
   reinforcements and the nearly incompressible soft material is employed
   as the matrix. This coupled geometry and material design concept is
   enabled by the state-of-the-art additive manufacturing technique. Guided
   by experimental tests and finite element analyses, we systematically
   study the compressive behavior of the 3D printed auxetics reinforced
   composites and achieve a significant enhancement of their stiffness and
   energy absorption. This improved mechanical performance is due to the
   negative Poisson's ratio effect of the auxetic reinforcements, which
   makes the matrix in a state of biaxial compression and hence provides
   additional support. This mechanism is further supported by the
   investigation of the effect of auxetic degree on the stiffness and
   energy absorption capability. The findings reported here pave the way
   for developing a new class of auxetic composites that significantly
   expand their design space and possible applications through a
   combination of rational design and 3D printing. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{Evolutionary design of nonuniform cellular structures with optimized
   Poisson's ratio distribution}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{141}},
Pages = {{384-394}},
Month = {{MAR 5}},
Abstract = {{For negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) cellular structures, most previous
   research focus on the design of unit cells, and then repeat the unit
   cell to construct uniform cellular structures. However, there is a
   disadvantage that these structures do not have much design freedom to
   achieve high-level functions, such as performing a desired deformation.
   As a solution, an evolutionary design method is proposed to develop
   nonuniform cellular structures. To conduct this method, the design
   domain is divided into finite unit cells with tunable Poisson's ratio
   (PR). With a given objective deformation, the value of each unit cell's
   PR is optimized using evolutionary algorithm (EA). In order to reduce
   the computational cost of the algorithm, discrete cosine transform (DCT)
   is applied to encode the structure for evolving. Considering the
   geometrical complexity of the optimized nonuniform cellular structures,
   additive manufacturing (AM) is chosen to build them physically. Both
   two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) design cases were
   developed and analyzed to validate the proposed method. The
   computational and experimental results showed good conformation with
   each other. Most importantly, this novel design method brings huge
   potential to NPR cellular structures with high-level functions and much
   wider applications. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To estimate the prevalence and severity of malocclusion and
   test a possible association with negative impacts on quality of life of
   schoolchildren in Tubarao, Brazil.
   Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on a
   representative sample (n = 389) of schoolchildren. Data on oral
   health-related quality of life were obtained through the Oral Impacts on
   Daily Performance (OIDP) scale. The malocclusion indicator was the
   Dental Aesthetic Index (DAI). Prevalence ratios were estimated using
   log-linear Poisson regression with a robust estimator.
   Results: The prevalence of class II, III, and IV malocclusion was
   57.3\%. The most common dental condition was overjet greater than 3 mm.
   Girls and older schoolchildren showed statistically significantly higher
   prevalence of all classes of malocclusion. There were no statistically
   significant associations between the most frequent malocclusions and
   dimensions of the impact indicator, except for the presence of overjet
   greater than 3 mm that was associated the `cleaning teeth' dimension.
   Conclusion: The prevalence of malocclusion was high, but was not
   statistically significantly associated with impact on oral
   health-related quality of life.}},

Abstract = {{Mechanical metamaterials are a sub-category of designer materials where
   the geometry of the material at the small-scale is rationally designed
   to give rise to unusual properties and functionalities. Here, we propose
   the concept of ``action-at-a-distance{''} metamaterials where a specific
   pattern of local deformation is programmed into the fabric of (cellular)
   materials. The desired pattern of local actuation could then be achieved
   simply through the application of one single global and far-field force.
   We proposed graded designs of auxetic and conventional unit cells with
   changing Poisson's ratios as a way of making ``action-at-a-distance{''}
   metamaterials. We explored five types of graded designs including
   linear, two types of radial gradients, checkered, and striped. Specimens
   were fabricated with indirect additive manufacturing and tested under
   compression, tension, and shear. Full-field strain maps measured with
   digital image correlation confirmed different patterns of local
   actuation under similar far-field strains. These materials have
   potential applications in soft (wearable) robotics and exosuits. (c)

Title = {{Comprehensive crustal structure and seismological evidence for lower
   crustal flow in the southeastern margin of Tibet revealed by receiver
   functions}},

Abstract = {{The lower crustal flow model has become an interesting proposal to
   describe the growth and expansion of eastern Tibet. To date, however,
   the geophysical results are not definitive due to the non-uniqueness of
   the solutions found through data inversion and the resolution
   limitations. In this study the polarity of P-to-S converted phases at
   intra-crustal interfaces are analyzed in order to reveal evidence for
   low seismic velocity and lower-crustal flow in southeastern Tibet. We
   are interested in a joint study that is both a mapping of the crustal
   structure (Moho topography and Poisson's ratio) and an attempt to
   constrain an ICLVZ. We have determined the crustal thickness and
   Poisson's ratio from P (PRFs) and S (SRFs) receiver functions acquired
   in 108 permanent seismic stations deployed in the Sichuan and Yunnan
   areas. Also, we have obtained 98 measurements of Pms-phase splitting
   parameters at the array stations. The crustal thickness provided by PREs
   is consistent with that given by SRFs. It varies from similar to 60 km
   in the Songpan-Ganzi (SG) fold system and the northern part of the
   Sichuan-Yunnan diamond shaped block (SYDSB), near the Eastern Himalayan
   Syntaxis, to similar to 33 km in southern Yunnan. The Poisson's ratio
   varies mostly from 0.24 to 0.32; the highest values 0.28-0.32 are found
   along the axis formed by the Longmenshan fault, the Lijiang-Jinhe fault
   and in the Tengchong volcano area. The value of similar to 0.28 observed
   in SYDSB and the SG fold system is attributed to the presence of a
   low-velocity zone in the lower crust, and partly to the great sediment
   thickness in Sichuan Basin. The crust is clearly anisotropic in the
   southeastern margin of Tibet: the fast-wave polarization direction
   exhibits a NW-SE regional bias, while the time delay varies between 0.07
   s and 1.27 s, being the average 0.54 s +/- 0.12 s, implying the
   existence a strong shear zone in the lower crust. Based on the negative
   polarity observed after the direct P-wave in teleseismic receiver
   functions, we have detected an intra-crustal low-velocity zone (ICLVZ)
   in a wide region including east and southeast of Tibet and southern
   Yunnan, so both the shear zone and ICLVZ suggest the existence of lower
   crustal flow. The reverberation PpPs and PsPs + PpSs phases at the Moho
   are clearly weaker in SYDSB and the SG fold system than in the Indochina
   Block and eastern Yunnan, implying that SYDSB has a structure and
   tectonic history different from Indochina on its west side and eastern
   Yunnan on its east side. The above results provide seismological
   evidence for a lower crustal flow spreading from the eastern Tibet and
   that in its advance southward has invaded SYDSB widely, crossed the
   Lijiang-Jinhe fault and reached southern Yunnan. (C) 2017 International

Abstract = {{We investigate the impact of large pre-deformations applied to
   repetitive 3D network materials on their acoustic properties, and
   especially the tuning of band gaps based on the applied state of
   deformation in the large strains regime. Based on an incremental scheme
   for the computation of the nonlinear mechanical response of periodic
   network materials, we develop a perturbation method of Linstedt-Poincare
   type to predict the evolution of the dispersion relation and phase
   velocity versus the applied deformation and effective density. We focus
   in this contribution on the transition to auxetic like microstructures
   showing negative Poisson's ratio, based on a deformation control. When
   Poisson's ratio becomes negative due to the varying imposed kinematic
   load, we show that some of the analyzed networks become unstable, since
   the strong ellipticity condition is not more satisfied. Such
   instabilities are shown to trigger band gaps associated to
   discontinuities in the phase velocity plots, the range of which
   increases with the slenderness ratio of the beams network. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{We consider a two-dimensional square lattice model extended by
   additional not closed neighboring interactions. We assume the elastic
   forces between the masses in the lattice to be nonlinearly dependent on
   the spring elongations. First, we use an analysis of the linearized
   discrete equations to reveal the influence of additional interactions on
   the properties of the dispersion relation for longitudinal and shear
   plane waves. Then we develop an asymptotic procedure to obtain continuum
   two-dimensional non-linear equations to study the transverse instability
   of weakly non-linear localized plane longitudinal and shear waves. We
   find that the additional interactions used in the model may affect the
   sign of the amplitude of the plane strain waves (existence of
   compression (minus sign) or tensile (plus sign) plane waves) and their
   transverse stability. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{3D auxetic textile composite is a special type of auxetic materials
   which has attracted more attention in recent years. Its deformation
   behaviour and mechanical properties under quasi-static compression have
   been investigated in the previous studies. In this paper, a further
   study on its mechanical properties under low-velocity impact is
   presented. Both single and repeating impact tests were conducted at
   different impact energy levels ranging from 12.7 to 25.5 J. Results show
   that the 3D auxetic textile composite has better impact protective
   performance than the 3D non-auxetic textile composite due to better
   transmitted force reduction and higher energy absorption capacity under
   single-time impact and higher structural stability under repeating
   impacts. The results also show that the difference in protective
   performance between the auxetic and non-auxetic textile composites get
   increased with the increase in impact energy.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanical parameters of shale are some of the most significant
   assessment indices for shale gas exploitation. The development of
   element logging offers an opportunity to study the correlations between
   the elemental concentrations and the mechanical characteristics of
   shale. Using the Lower Cambrian shale in the Cen'gong area, Guizhou
   Province, China, as an example, 490 data sets are extracted using
   formation element and mineralogy (FEM) and cross multipole array
   acoustic (XMAC) logging. Through Spearman correlation analysis, the
   correlations between the major elements (Si, Ca, Fe, S, Ti, Mn, Mg, Al,
   and K) and the mechanical parameters (Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio,
   shear strength, shear modulus, and brittleness index) are studied. The
   effects of the Si content on the mechanical parameters
   (positive/negative correlations, magnitude and significance of the
   correlations) are discussed based on X-ray diffraction analyses of the
   minerals in 146 samples. When 1.84\% < C-si (Si content) < 28.08\%,
   Young's modulus and the brittleness index decrease with increasing Si
   content, and Poisson's ratio increases. When 28.08\% < C-si < 31.32\%,
   there is no significant correlation between the Si content and the
   mechanical parameters. When 31.32\% < C-si < 44.24\%, Young's modulus
   and the brittleness index increase with increasing Si content, and
   Poisson's ratio decreases. Thus, it is not reasonable to determine the
   mechanical properties of shale based only on the elemental composition
   in different regions.}},

Abstract = {{This investigation explored the viability of using open cell
   polyurethane auxetic foams to augment the conformable layer in a sports
   helmet and improve its linear impact acceleration attenuation. Foam
   types were compared by examining the impact severity on an instrumented
   anthropomorphic headform within a helmet consisting of three layers: a
   rigid shell, a stiff closed cell foam, and an open cell foam as a
   conformable layer. Auxetic and conventional foams were interchanged to
   act as the helmet's conformable component. Attenuation of linear
   acceleration was examined by dropping the combined helmet and headform
   on the front and the side. The helmet with auxetic foam reduced peak
   linear accelerations (p < 0.05) relative to its conventional counterpart
   at the highest impact energy in both orientations. Gadd Severity Index
   reduced by 11\% for frontal impacts (38.9 J) and 44\% for side impacts
   (24.3 J). The conformable layer within a helmet can influence the
   overall impact attenuating properties. The helmet fitted with auxetic
   foam can attenuate impact severity more than when fitted with
   conventional foam, and warrants further investigation for its potential
   to reduce the risk of traumatic brain injuries in sport specific
   impacts.}},

Abstract = {{In materials science and engineering, auxetic behavior refers to
   deformations of flexible structures where stretching in some direction
   involves lateral widening, rather than lateral shrinking. We address the
   problem of detecting auxetic behavior for flexible periodic
   bar-and-joint frameworks. Currently, the only known algorithmic solution
   is based on the rather heavy machinery of fixed-dimension semi-definite
   programming. In this paper we present a new, simpler algorithmic
   approach which is applicable to a natural family of three-dimensional
   periodic bar-and-joint frameworks with three degrees of freedom. This
   class includes most zeolite structures, which are important for
   applications in computational materials science. We show that the
   existence of auxetic deformations is related to properties of an
   associated elliptic curve. A fast algorithm for recognizing auxetic
   capabilities is obtained via the classical Aronhold invariants of the
   cubic form defining the curve. Related algorithmic alternatives are also
   considered. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of high pressure on mechanical properties and electronic
   structures of Ni-Mo binary compounds (Ni4Mo, Ni3Mo(DOa), Ni3Mo(DO22),
   Ni2Mo) have been studied by first-principles calculation based on
   density functional theory. The results show that the values of V/Vo
   decrease with the pressure increasing and the rates of change decrease
   gradually. The formation enthalpy is negative, and it decreases with
   pressure increasing, indicating high pressure can enhance the ability of
   alloying. The calculated results of bulk modulus (B), shear modulus (G),
   Young's modulus (E), Lama constant (lambda) and hardness (H) illustrate
   that pressure can increase the resistance to deformation, compression
   resistance and hardness of four compounds. In addition, ratio of bulk
   modulus to shear modulus (B/G) and poisson's ratio (v) show that all the
   compounds are ductile and plastic. The state density was also analyzed
   to explain the physical origin of the pressure effect on four compounds.
   It is suggested that the increasing pressure can improve the stability
   and hardness of all compounds.}},

Title = {{Universal test and treat and the HIV epidemic in rural South Africa: a
   phase 4, open-label, community cluster randomised trial}},

Abstract = {{Background Universal antiretroviral therapy (ART), as per the 2015 WHO
   recommendations, might reduce population HIV incidence. We investigated
   the effect of universal test and treat on HIV acquisition at population
   level in a high prevalence rural region of South Africa.
   Methods We did a phase 4, open-label, cluster randomised trial of 22
   communities in rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. We included
   individuals residing in the communities who were aged 16 years or older.
   The clusters were composed of aggregated local areas (neighbourhoods)
   that had been identified in a previous study in the Hlabisa subdistrict.
   The study statisticians randomly assigned clusters (1:1) with MapInfo
   Pro (version 11.0) to either the control or intervention communities,
   stratified on the basis of antenatal HIV prevalence. We offered
   residents repeated rapid HIV testing during home-based visits every 6
   months for about 4 years in four clusters, 3 years in six clusters, and
   2 years in 12 clusters (58 cluster-years) and referred HIV-positive
   participants to trial clinics for ART (fixed-dose combination of
   tenofovir, emtricitabine, and efavirenz) regardless of CD4 cell count
   (intervention) or according to national guidelines (initially <= 350
   cells per mu L and <500 cells per mu L from January, 2015; control).
   Participants and investigators were not masked to treatment allocation.
   We used dried blood spots once every 6 months provided by participants
   who were HIV negative at baseline to estimate the primary outcome of HIV
   incidence with cluster-adjusted Poisson generalised estimated equations
   in the intention-to-treat population after 58 cluster-years of
   follow-up. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, number
   NCT01509508, and the South African National Clinical Trials Register,
   number DOH-27-0512-3974.
   Findings Between March 9, 2012, and June 30, 2016, we contacted 26 518
   (93\%) of 28 419 eligible individuals. Of 17 808 (67\%) individuals with
   a first negative dried blood spot test, 14 223 (80\%) had subsequent
   dried blood spot tests, of whom 503 seroconverted after follow-up of 22
   891 person-years. Estimated HIV incidence was 2.11 per 100 person-years
   (95\% CI 1.84-2.39) in the intervention group and 2.27 per 100
   person-years (2.00-2.54) in the control group (adjusted hazard ratio
   1.01, 95\% CI 0.87-1.17; p=0.89). We documented one case of suicidal
   attempt in a woman following HIV seroconversion. 128 patients on ART had
   189 life-threatening or grade 4 clinical events: 69 (4\%) of 1652 in the
   control group and 59 (4\%) of 1367 in the intervention group (p=0.83).
   Interpretation The absence of a lowering of HIV incidence in universal
   test and treat clusters most likely resulted from poor linkage to care.
   Policy change to HIV universal test and treat without innovation to
   improve health access is unlikely to reduce HIV incidence.}},

Abstract = {{There is evidence for negative associations between social isolation and
   loneliness and sleep quality in older adults. However, it is unclear to
   what extent these two factors independently affect sleep quality. This
   study examined the simultaneous associations of social isolation and
   loneliness with sleep quality in a longitudinal study of older adults.
   Data were analyzed from the Social Environment and Biomarkers of Aging
   Study in Taiwan collected in 2000 and 2006, involving a cohort of 639
   participants (mean age = 66.14, SD 7.26). Poisson regression models were
   conducted to examine the association of social isolation and/or
   loneliness with sleep quality at follow-up after adjusting for multiple
   confounding variables.
   Univariate analysis showed that sleep quality was inversely associated
   with both social isolation and loneliness. After demographic, health,
   cognitive factors, and depressive symptoms were controlled in
   multivariable analysis, social isolation at the baseline still predicted
   poor sleep quality 6 years later (incident rate ratio, IRR 1.14; 95\% CI
   1.04-1.24; p < 0.01), while the association between loneliness and sleep
   quality was no longer significant (IRR 1.08; 95\% CI 0.94-1.23; p =
   0.27). The results were unchanged when participants who had poor sleep
   quality at the baseline were excluded from the analysis.
   These findings confirm an adverse effect of social isolation on the
   sleep quality of older adults, but indicate that this effect is
   independent of loneliness. Social isolation and loneliness seem to have
   distinct pathways in affecting the sleep quality of older adults.}},

Abstract = {{A two-dimensional (2D) open cell topology with eight-sided star
   perforations is proposed. Its mechanical properties (including Poisson's
   ratio and energy absorption capacity) and deformation behaviors are
   studied using finite element method (FEM) as a function of the geometric
   parameters. Simulation results showed that the Poisson's ratio of the
   structure is tunable from positive to negative by varying the geometric
   parameters that define the shape of the perforation. A minimum Poisson's
   ratio of -0.68 is achieved when the geometric parameter , which
   determines the inner corner sharpness of the star perforation, is equal
   to 0.1. The highest energy absorption capacity is observed in the model
   which exhibits the minimum Poisson's ratio. The star perforation cells
   shrink when the lattice structure is being compressed due to the
   negative Poisson's ratio effect. Compressive samples are fabricated by
   3D printing from Tango Black Plus, and their Poisson's ratios are
   measured and compared with numerical results. Excellent agreement is

Abstract = {{Polycrystalline elastic moduli and stiffness tensor components of
   g-phase U - 8 wt\% Mo have been determined by resonant ultrasound
   spectroscopy in the temperature range of 25-650 degrees C. The ambient
   temperature elastic properties are compared to results measured via
   other experimental methods and show reasonable agreement, though there
   is considerable variation of these properties within the literature at
   both the U - 8 wt\% Mo composition and as a function of Mo
   concentration. The Young's modulus of U - 8 wt\% Mo measured in this
   study decreases steadily with temperature at a rate that is slower than
   trends previously observed at similar Mo concentrations, though the
   difference is not statistically significant. This first measurement of
   the temperature dependent elastic stiffness tensor of a polycrystalline
   U-Mo alloy clarifies that the behavior of the Young's modulus is due to
   a strongly weakening C-11 polycrystalline stiffness tensor component,
   along with milder decreases in C-12 and C-44. The unique partially
   auxetic properties recently predicted for single-crystalline U-Mo are
   discussed in regard to their possible impact on the polycrystalline
   behavior of the alloy. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the vibroacoustic behavior of sandwich panels with
   a novel core topology made from 2-dimensionally gradient auxetic
   hexagonal honeycombs. The 2D gradient core enables a tailoring of
   localized mechanical properties of the sandwich structure in different
   regions of the panel. A homogenized finite element modeling has been
   used to initially determine the mechanical properties of the structures.
   The natural frequencies and the radiated sound power level of the
   sandwich plate with the homogenized properties have been calculated and
   verified with those obtained from a full-scale detailed model of the
   sandwich structure. The geometry of the 2-dimensionally gradient auxetic
   core has been then optimized using two different techniques in order to
   minimize the radiated sound power level over the frequency range of 0 to
   200 Hz. The optimized design of the 2-D gradient core shows a remarkable
   reduction of the radiated sound power level for the sandwich structure
   when taking into account the mass of the panels. The results of this
   study provide new insights about the vibroacoustic behavior of hexagonal
   auxetic sandwich structures with complex core geometry.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, two new 2D re-entrant topologies with negative Poisson's
   ratio are presented and their mechanical properties (Poisson's ratio and
   energy absorption capacity) are studied using finite element method as a
   function of geometric parameters. The first topology (model 1) was
   constructed by adding two sinusoidal-shaped ribs into the classical
   re-entrant topology, while the second topology (model 2) was made by
   introducing extra vertical ribs to reinforce the sinusoidal-shaped ribs.
   Simulation results show that model 1 and model 2 topologies can reach a
   minimum value in Poisson's ratio of - 1.12 and - 0.58 with an
   appropriate geometric aspect ratio, respectively. The energy absorption
   capacities of model 1, model 2 and classical re-entrant model were
   studied at various compression velocities. Enhanced energy absorption
   capacities were observed in the two new re-entrant topologies compared
   with the classical re-entrant topology. Model 2 exhibited the highest
   energy absorption capacity and a highest plateau stress. The plateau
   stress of model 1 was about half that of model 2, and when the
   compression velocity is more than 20 m/s, the plateau stress of model 1
   became lower than that of the classical re-entrant model.}},

Title = {{Association of the client-provider ratio with the risk of maternal
   mortality in referral hospitals: a multi-site study in Nigeria}},
Journal = {{REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{FEB 22}},
Abstract = {{Background: The paucity of human resources for health buoyed by
   excessive workloads has been identified as being responsible for poor
   quality obstetric care, which leads to high maternal mortality in
   Nigeria. While there is anecdotal and qualitative research to support
   this observation, limited quantitative studies have been conducted to
   test the association between the number and density of human resources
   and risk of maternal mortality. This study aims to investigate the
   association between client-provider ratios for antenatal and delivery
   care and the risk of maternal mortality in 8 referral hospitals in
   Nigeria.
   Methods: Client-provider ratios were calculated for antenatal and
   delivery care attendees during a 3-year period (2011-2013). The maternal
   mortality ratio (MMR) was calculated per 100,000 live births for the
   hospitals, while unadjusted Poisson regression analysis was used to
   examine the association between the number of maternal deaths and
   density of healthcare providers.
   Results: A total of 334,425 antenatal care attendees and 26,479 births
   were recorded during this period. The client-provider ratio in the
   maternity department for antenatal care attendees was 1343: 1 for
   doctors and 222: 1 for midwives. The ratio of births to one doctor in
   the maternity department was 106: 1 and 18: 1 for midwives. On average,
   there were 441 births per specialist obstetrician. The results of the
   regression analysis showed a significant negative association between
   the number of maternal deaths and client-provider ratios in all
   categories.
   Conclusion: We conclude that the maternal mortality ratios in Nigeria's
   referral hospitals are worsened by high client-provider ratios, with few
   providers attending a large number of pregnant women. Efforts to improve
   the density and quality of maternal healthcare providers, especially at
   the first referral level, would be a critical intervention for reducing
   the currently high rate of maternal mortality in Nigeria.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the electromechanical properties of two-dimensional MoS2
   monolayers with 1H, 1T, and 1T' structures as a function of charge
   doping by using density functional theory. We find isotropic elastic
   moduli in the 1H and 1T structures, while the 1T' structure exhibits an
   anisotropic elastic modulus. Moreover, the 1T structure is shown to have
   a negative Poisson's ratio, while Poisson's ratios of the 1H and 1T' are
   positive. By charge doping, the monolayer MoS2 shows a reversible strain
   and work density per cycle ranging from -0.68\% to 2.67\% and from 4.4
   to 36.9 MJ m(-3), respectively, making them suitable for applications in
   electromechanical actuators. We also examine the stress generated in the
   MoS2 monolayers and we find that 1T and 1T' MoS2 monolayers have
   relatively better performance than 1H MoS2 monolayer. We argue that such
   excellent electromechanical performance originate from the electrical
   conductivity of the metallic 1T and semimetallic 1T' structures and also
   from their high Young's modulus of about 150-200 GPa.}},

   Effect of spin-orbit coupling}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{97}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{FEB 20}},
Abstract = {{Using first-principles calculations, we systematically study the elastic
   stiffness constants, mechanical properties, elastic wave velocities,
   Debye temperature, melting temperature, and specific heat of several
   thermodynamically stable crystal structures of BixSb1-x (0 < x < 1)
   binaries, which are of great interest due to their numerous inherent
   rich properties, such as thermoelectricity, thermomagnetic cooling,
   strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effects, and topological features in
   the electronic band structure. We analyze the bulk modulus (B), Young's
   modulus (E), shear modulus (G), B/G ratio, and Poisson's ratio (nu) as a
   function of the Bi concentration in BixSb1-x. The effect of SOC on the
   above-mentioned properties is further investigated. In general, we
   observe that the SOC effects cause elastic softening in most of the
   studied structures. Three monoclinic structures of Bi-Sb binaries are
   found to exhibit significantly large auxetic behavior due to the
   hingelike geometric structure of bonds. The Debye temperature and the
   magnitude of the elastic wave velocities monotonically increase with
   increasing Sb concentration. However, anomalies were observed at very
   low Sb concentration. We also discuss the specific-heat capacity versus
   temperature data for all studied binaries. Our theoretical results are
   in excellent agreement with the existing experimental and theoretical
   data. The comprehensive understanding of the material properties such as
   hardness, mechanical strength, melting temperature, propagation of the
   elastic waves, auxeticity, and heat capacity is vital for practical
   applications of the studied binaries.}},

Abstract = {{Designing new materials with reduced dimensionality and distinguished
   properties has continuously attracted intense interest for materials
   innovation. Here we report a novel two-dimensional (2D) Zn2C monolayer
   nanomaterial with exceptional structure and properties by means of
   first-principles calculations. This new Zn2C monolayer is composed of
   quasi-tetrahedral tetracoordinate carbon and quasi-linear bicoordinate
   zinc, featuring a peculiar zigzag-shaped buckling configuration. The
   unique coordinate topology endows this natural 2D semiconducting
   monolayer with strongly strain tunable band gap and unusual negative
   Poisson ratios. The monolayer has good dynamic and thermal stabilities
   and is also the lowest-energy structure of 2D space indicated by the
   particle-swarm optimization (PSO) method, implying its synthetic
   feasibility. With these intriguing properties the material may find
   applications in nanoelectronics and micromechanics.}},

Year = {{2018}},

Abstract = {{Borophene is an auxetic and ferroelectric material which can be combined
   with graphene and other 2D materials and also has application in
   batteries. All these features attracted researchers to study this 2D
   material. Recently, several experimental works have been done and long
   defects such as incompletely resolved edges (chain-like boundaries) were
   recognized in borophene sheets. Since chain-like boundaries increase the
   number of free atoms on the surface of 2D materials, this cause
   promotion of their properties. In this paper, effect of geometrical
   parameters of chain-like boundaries on mechanical properties of
   single-layer borophene sheets is studied. Length, angle and repetition
   of the pattern of chain-like boundaries are measured. In general,
   increasing the width of line defect, the fracture stress, fracture
   strain and modulus of elasticity decrease. It was observed that
   repetition of the patterns along the direction of chain-like boundaries
   has an insignificant effect on mechanical properties. As a key result,
   the self-healing phenomena was observed for some special conditions. It
   is concluded that elongation to a certain extent leads to self-healing
   of borophene sheets with chain-like boundaries. The obtained results by
   this study might be useful for rebuilding some especial configurations
   based on linearly defected borophene sheets. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Background. Rotavirus is a common cause of acute gastroenteritis and has
   also been associated with generalized tonic-clonic afebrile seizures.
   Since rotavirus vaccine introduction, hospitalizations for treatment of
   acute gastroenteritis have decreased. We assess whether there has been
   an associated decrease in seizure-associated hospitalizations.
   Methods. We used discharge codes to abstract data on seizure
   hospitalizations among children < 5 years old from the State Inpatient
   Databases of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project. We compared
   seizure hospitalization rates before and after vaccine introduction,
   using Poisson regression, stratifying by age and by month and year of
   admission. We performed a time-series analysis with negative binomial
   models, constructed using prevaccine data from 2000 to 2006 and
   controlling for admission month and year.
   Results. We examined 962 899 seizure hospitalizations among children < 5
   years old during 2000-2013. Seizure rates after vaccine introduction
   were lower than those before vaccine introduction by 1\%-8\%, and rate
   ratios decreased over time. Time-series analyses demonstrated a decrease
   in the number of seizure-coded hospitalizations in 2012 and 2013, with
   notable decreases in children 12-17 months and 18-23 months.
   Conclusions. Our analysis provides evidence for a decrease in seizure
   hospitalizations following rotavirus vaccine introduction in the United
   States, with the greatest impact in age groups with a high
   rotavirus-associated disease burden and during rotavirus infection
   season.}},

Abstract = {{Bistable Auxetic Metamaterials (BAMs) are a class of monolithic
   perforated periodic structures with negative Poisson's ratio. Under
   tension, a BAM can expand and reach a second state of equilibrium
   through a globally large shape transformation that is ensured by the
   flexibility of its elastomeric base material. However, if made from a
   rigid polymer, or metal, BAM ceases to function due to the inevitable
   rupture of its ligaments. The goal of this work is to extend the unique
   functionality of the original kirigami architecture of BAM to a rigid
   solid base material. We use experiments and numerical simulations to
   assess performance, bistability, and durability of rigid BAMs at 10,000
   cycles. Geometric maps are presented to elucidate the role of the main
   descriptors of the BAM architecture. The proposed design enables the
   realization of BAM from a large palette of materials, including
   elastic-perfectly plastic materials and potentially brittle materials.}},

Pages = {{330-342}},
Month = {{FEB 14}},
Abstract = {{Introducing architected cuts is an attractive and simple approach to
   tune mechanical behaviors of planar materials like thin films for
   desirable or enhanced mechanical performance. However, little has been
   studied on the effects of architected cuts on functional materials like
   piezoelectric materials. We investigated how architected cut patterns
   affect mechanical and piezoelectric properties of polyvinylidene
   fluoride thin films by numerical, experimental, and analytical studies.
   Our results show that thin films with architected cuts can provide
   desired mechanical features like enhanced compliance, stretchability,
   and controllable Poisson's ratio and resonance frequency, while
   maintaining piezoelectric performance under static loadings. Moreover,
   we could observe maximum; 30\% improvement in piezoelectric conversion
   efficiency under dynamic loadings and harvest energy from low frequency
   (<100 Hz) mechanical signals or low velocity (<5 m/s) winds, which are
   commonly existing in ambient environment. Using architected cuts doesn't
   require changing the material or overall dimensions, making it
   attractive for applications in self-powered devices with design
   constraints.}},

Abstract = {{Using molecular dynamics simulations, we find an in-plane negative
   Poisson's ratio intrinsically existing in the graphene-based
   three-dimensional (3D) carbon foams (CFs) when they are compressed
   uniaxially. Our study shows that the negative Poisson's ratio in the
   present CFs is attributed to their unique molecular structures and
   triggered by the buckling of the CF structures. This mechanism makes the
   negative Poisson's ratio of CFs strongly depend on their cell length,
   which offers us an efficient means to tune the negative Poisson's ratio
   in nanomaterials. Moreover, as the buckling modes of CFs are
   topographically different when they are compressed in different
   directions, their negative Poisson's ratio is found to be strongly
   anisotropic, which is in contrast to the isotropic positive Poisson's
   ratio observed in CFs prior to buckling. The discovery of the intrinsic
   negative Poisson's ratio in 3D CFs will significantly expand the family
   of auxetic nanomaterials. Meanwhile, the mechanism of nano-auxetics
   proposed here may open up a door to manufacture new auxetic materials on
   the nanoscale.}},

Abstract = {{Recent theoretical work suggests that systematic pruning of disordered
   networks consisting of nodes connected by springs can lead to materials
   that exhibit a host of unusual mechanical properties. In particular,
   global properties such as Poisson's ratio or local responses related to
   deformation can be precisely altered. Tunable mechanical responses would
   be useful in areas ranging from impact mitigation to robotics and, more
   generally, for creation of metamaterials with engineered properties.
   However, experimental attempts to create auxetic materials based on
   pruningbased theoretical ideas have not been successful. Here we
   introduce a more realistic model of the networks, which incorporates
   angle-bending forces and the appropriate experimental boundary
   conditions. A sequential pruning strategy of select bonds in this model
   is then devised and implemented that enables engineering of specific
   mechanical behaviors upon deformation, both in the linear and in the
   nonlinear regimes. In particular, it is shown that Poisson's ratio can
   be tuned to arbitrary values. The model and concepts discussed here are
   validated by preparing physical realizations of the networks designed in
   this manner, which are produced by laser cutting 2D sheets and are found
   to behave as predicted. Furthermore, by relying on optimization
   algorithms, we exploit the networks' susceptibility to tuning to design
   networks that possess a distribution of stiffer and more compliant bonds
   and whose auxetic behavior is even greater than that of homogeneous
   networks. Taken together, the findings reported here serve to establish
   that pruned networks represent a promising platform for the creation of
   unique mechanical metamaterials.}},

Abstract = {{Phosphorene, an emerging two-dimensional material, has received
   considerable attention due to its layer-controlled direct bandgap, high
   carrier mobility, negative Poisson's ratio and unique in-plane
   anisotropy. As cousins of phosphorene, 2D group-VA arsenene, antimonene
   and bismuthene have also garnered tremendous interest due to their
   intriguing structures and fascinating electronic properties. 2D group-VA
   family members are opening up brand-new opportunities for their
   multifunctional applications encompassing electronics, optoelectronics,
   topological spintronics, thermoelectrics, sensors, Li-or Na-batteries.
   In this review, we extensively explore the latest theoretical and
   experimental progress made in the fundamental properties, fabrications
   and applications of 2D group-VA materials, and offer perspectives and

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials with negative Poisson's ratios have important
   applications across a broad range of engineering areas, such as
   biomedical devices, aerospace engineering and automotive engineering. A
   variety of design strategies have been developed to achieve artificial
   auxetic materials with controllable responses in the Poisson's ratio.
   The development of designs that can offer isotropic negative Poisson's
   ratios over large strains can open up new opportunities in emerging
   biomedical applications, which, however, remains a challenge. Here, we
   introduce deterministic routes to soft architected materials that can be
   tailored precisely to yield the values of Poisson's ratio in the range
   from -1 to 1, in an isotropic manner, with a tunable strain range from
   0\% to similar to 90\%. The designs rely on a network construction in a
   periodic lattice topology, which incorporates zigzag microstructures as
   building blocks to connect lattice nodes. Combined experimental and
   theoretical studies on broad classes of network topologies illustrate
   the wide-ranging utility of these concepts. Quantitative mechanics
   modeling under both infinitesimal and finite deformations allows the
   development of a rigorous design algorithm that determines the necessary
   network geometries to yield target Poisson ratios over desired strain
   ranges. Demonstrative examples in artificial skin with both the negative
   Poisson's ratio and the nonlinear stress-strain curve precisely matching
   those of the cat's skin and in unusual cylindrical structures with
   engineered Poisson effect and shape memory effect suggest potential
   applications of these network materials.}},

Abstract = {{By combining rotating squares with auxetic properties, we developed a
   metamaterial transformer capable of realizing metamaterials with tunable
   functionalities. We investigated the use of a metamaterial
   transformer-based thermal cloak-concentrator that can change from a
   cloak to a concentrator when the device configuration is transformed. We
   established that the proposed dual-functional metamaterial can either
   thermally protect a region (cloak) or focus heat flux in a small region
   (concentrator). The dual functionality was verified by finite element
   simulations and validated by experiments with a specimen composed of
   copper, epoxy, and rotating squares. This work provides an effective and
   efficient method for controlling the gradient of heat, in addition to
   providing a reference for other thermal metamaterials to possess such

Abstract = {{Elastic instability has been increasingly used to design
   buckling-induced auxetic metamaterials. However, only limited patterns
   of existing three dimensional (3D) buckling-induced auxetic
   metamaterials exhibit a reliable 3D auxetic behaviour, i.e., the
   material will contract along two normal lateral directions under
   compression along the third direction. In this paper, we study a simple
   geometrical shape for achieving 3D auxetic behaviour. The unit cell of
   the proposed 3D design is composed of a solid sphere and three cuboids.
   Two representative models, one with slender connecting bars and the
   other with thick connecting bars, are investigated both numerically and
   experimentally. The results indicate that the designed material with
   thick connecting bars did not exhibit auxetic behaviour while the one
   with slender connecting bars did. However, the anticipated 3D auxetic
   behaviour degraded to a two dimensional (2D) auxetic behaviour, i.e.,
   the material would contract only in one lateral direction and maintain
   nearly the same dimension in the other lateral direction. This finding
   was further confirmed by experiments. This research has demonstrated
   challenges in designing and manufacturing of buckling-induced auxetic
   metamaterials with 3D auxetic behaviour and highlighted the importance
   of optimising and fine-tuning the auxetic unit cell using the pattern
   scale factor. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the mechanical properties of the
   three-dimensional(3D) double-V honeycomb intersected by a
   two-dimensional double-V structure with negative Poisson's ratio.
   Considering the effect of the adjacent unit cells, the Poisson's ratio
   and Young'smodulus of the honeycomb under axial loading are derived
   theoretically. The finite element (FE) model of the 3D double-V
   honeycomb (DVH) is conducted to verify the theoretical solutions. It is
   found that the constraint of the adjacent cells does not affect the
   negative Poisson's ratio but enhance Young'smodulus a lot, and the two
   properties are determined by the stuffer/tensor angles. Then, the
   prototypes of the 3D DVH is manufactured to carry out the quasi-static
   experiments. The stiffness and the collapse stress of the theoretical,
   numerical and experimental solutions are compared, and it is evident
   that these results agree very well which indicates the analyses of these
   solutions are convinced. And the quasi-static collapse stress increases
   with the increment of tensor angle theta(1) and the reduction of stuffer
   angle theta(2). (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},

Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{FEB 5}},
Abstract = {{By combining the two basic deformation mechanisms for auxetic open-cell
   metamaterials, re-entrant angle and chirality, new hybrid chiral
   mechanical metamaterials are designed and fabricated via a
   multi-material 3D printer. Results from mechanical experiments on the 3D
   printed prototypes and systematic Finite Element (FE) simulations show
   that the new designs can achieve subsequential cell-opening mechanism
   under a very large range of overall strains (2.91\%-52.6\%). Also, the
   effective stiffness, the Poisson's ratio and the cell-opening rate of
   the new designs can be tuned in a wide range by tailoring the two
   independent geometric parameters: the cell size ratio c(0)/b(0), and
   re-entrant angle theta. As an example application, a sequential particle
   release mechanism of the new designs was also systematically explored.
   This mechanism has potential application in drug delivery. The present
   new design concepts can be used to develop new multi-functional smart
   composites, sensors and/or actuators which are responsive to external
   load and/or environmental conditions.}},

Title = {{3D auxetic single material periodic structure with ultra-wide tunable
   bandgap}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{FEB 2}},
Abstract = {{The design and the combination of innovative metamaterials are
   attracting increasing interest in the scientific community because of
   their unique properties that go beyond the ones of natural materials. In
   particular, auxetic materials and phononic crystals are widely studied
   for their negative Poisson's ratio and their bandgap opening properties,
   respectively. In this work, auxeticity and phononic crystals bandgap
   properties are properly combined to obtain a single phase periodic
   structure with a tridimensional wide tunable bandgap. When an external
   tensile load is applied to the structure, the auxetic unit cells change
   their configurations by exploiting the negative Poisson's ratio and this
   results in the tuning, either hardening or softening, of the frequencies
   of the modes limiting the 3D bandgap. Moreover, the expansion of the
   unit cell in all the directions, due to the auxeticity property,
   guarantees a fully 3D bandgap tunability of the proposed structure.
   Numerical simulations and analytical models are proposed to prove the
   claimed properties. The first experimental evidence of the tunability of
   a wide 3D bandgap is then shown thanks to the fabrication of a prototype
   by means of additive manufacturing.}},

   medical records (MR), 79.6\% of mothers were submitted to rapid HIV test
   and, according to interviews (INT), 55.7\%. At the distal level, the
   lack of a partner (MR), having >= 6 residents at home (MR) and non-white
   skin color (INT) were associated with a higher prevalence of the
   outcome. At the intermediate level, not having a negative HIV serology
   from prenatal care (MR and INT) was associated with a higher prevalence
   of the outcome, as well as PHC prenatal care (MR) and lack of prenatal

   alloys from first-principles calculations}},
Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{142}},
Pages = {{215-226}},

Abstract = {{Titanium alloys are great implant materials due to their mechanical
   properties and biocompatibility. However, a large difference in Young's
   modulus between bone (similar to 10-40 GPa) and common implant materials
   (ie. Ti-6Al-4V alloy similar to 110 GPa) leads to stress shielding and
   possible implant failure. The present work predicts the single crystal
   elastic stiffness coefficients (c(ij)'s) for five binary systems with
   the body centered cubic lattice of Ti-X (X = Mo, Nb, Ta, Zr, Sn) using
   first-principles calculations based on Density Functional Theory. In
   addition, the polycrystalline aggregate properties of bulk modulus,
   shear modulus, Young's modulus, and Poisson ratio are calculated. It is
   shown that the lower Young's modulus of these Ti-alloys stems from the
   unstable bcc Ti with a negative value of (c(11)-c(12)). The data
   gathered from these efforts are compared with available experimental and
   other first-principles results in the literature, which set a foundation
   to design biocompatible Ti alloys for desired elastic properties. (C)

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES}},

Volume = {{136}},
Pages = {{143-154}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials possess the fascinating property of expanding
   laterally when stretched longitudinally. However, previous
   investigations into behavior under large deformation of such materials
   in tension have been very limited. This work systematically analyses the
   tensile behavior beyond yield of re-entrant hexagonal honeycombs in the
   two principal directions. Analytical modeling is performed by
   considering the plastic, nonlinear behavior of cell walls based on
   idealized mechanisms. The analytical results are compared with those of
   the corresponding finite element simulations. Two material models have
   been studied, a rigid-perfectly plastic material model and that with
   strain hardening. Plastic Poisson's ratio is calculated as the ratio of
   the incremental strains in the two perpendicular directions and this
   ratio changes significantly, from negative to positive, for the
   re-entrant honeycombs in tension. The elastic slope of stress-strain
   curves is also considered and initial yielding point is determined. The
   influences of various geometrical and material parameters on the
   response of re-entrant honeycombs are discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Materials and structures with negative Poisson's ratio exhibit a
   counter-intuitive behaviour. Under uniaxial compression (tension), these
   materials and structures contract (expand) transversely. The materials
   and structures that possess this feature are also termed as `auxetics'.
   Many desirable properties resulting from this uncommon behaviour are
   reported. These superior properties offer auxetics broad potential
   applications in the fields of smart filters, sensors, medical devices
   and protective equipment. However, there are still challenging problems
   which impede a wider application of auxetic materials. This review paper
   mainly focuses on the relationships among structures, materials,
   properties and applications of auxetic metamaterials and structures. The
   previous works of auxetics are extensively reviewed, including different
   auxetic cellular models, naturally observed auxetic behaviour, different
   desirable properties of auxetics, and potential applications. In
   particular, metallic auxetic materials and a methodology for generating
   3D metallic auxetic materials are reviewed in details. Although most of
   the literature mentions that auxetic materials possess superior
   properties, very few types of auxetic materials have been fabricated and
   implemented for practical applications. Here, the challenges and future
   work on the topic of auxetics are also presented to inspire prospective
   research work. This review article covers the most recent progress of
   auxetic metamaterials and auxetic structures. More importantly, several
   drawbacks of auxetics are also presented to caution researchers in the
   future study.}},

   and military personnel, and athletes. This paper reports an integrated
   theoretical, computational, and experimental investigation conducted for
   typical auxetic materials that exhibit NPR properties. Parametric 3D CAD
   models of auxetic structures such as re-entrant hexagonal cells and
   arrowheads were developed. Then, key structural characteristics of
   protection pads were evaluated through static analyses of FEA models.
   Finally, impact analyses were conducted through dynamic simulations of
   FEA models to validate the results obtained from the static analyses.
   Efforts were also made to relate the individual and/or combined effect
   of auxetic structures and materials to the overall stiffness and
   shock-absorption performance of the protection pads. An advanced
   additive manufacturing (3D printing) technique was used to build
   prototypes of the auxetic structures. Three different materials
   typically used for fused deposition modeling technology, namely
   polylactic acid (PLA) and thermoplastic polyurethane material (NinjaFlex
   (R) and SemiFlex (R)), were used for different stiffness and
   shock-absorption properties. The 3D printed prototypes were then tested
   and the results were compared to the computational predictions. The
   results showed that the auxetic material could be effective in reducing
   the shock forces. Each structure and material combination demonstrated
   unique structural properties such as stiffness, Poisson's ratio, and
   efficiency in shock absorption. Auxetic structures showed better shock
   absorption performance than non-auxetic ones. The mechanism for ideal
   input force distribution or shunting could be suggested for designing
   protectors using various shapes, thicknesses, and materials of auxetic
   materials to reduce the risk of injury.}},

Abstract = {{The over all regression function in a semi-parametric model involves a
   partly specified regression function in some primary covariates and a
   non-parametric function in some other secondary covariates. This type of
   semi-parametric models in a longitudinal setup has recently been
   discussed extensively both for repeated Poisson and negative binomial
   count data. However, when it is appropriate to interpret the
   longitudinal binary responses through a binary dynamic logits model, the
   inferences for semi-parametric Poisson and negative binomial models
   cannot be applied to such binary models as these models unlike the count
   data models produce recursive means and variances containing the dynamic
   dependence or correlation parameters. In this paper, we consider a
   general multinomial dynamic logits model in a semi-parametric setup
   first to analyze nominal categorical data in a semi-parametric
   longitudinal setup, and then modify this model to analyze ordinal
   categorical data. The ordinal responses are fitted by using a cumulative
   semi-parametric multinomial dynamic logits model. For the benefits of
   practitioners, a step by step estimation approach is developed for the
   non-parametric function, and for both regression and dynamic dependence
   parameters. In summary, a kernel-based semi-parametric weighted
   likelihood approach is used for the estimation of the non-parametric
   function. This weighted likelihood estimate for the non-parametric
   function is shown to be consistent. The regression and dynamic
   dependence parameters of the model are estimated by maximizing an
   approximate semi-parametric likelihood function for the parameters,
   which is constructed by replacing the non-parametric function with its
   consistent estimate. Asymptotic properties including the proofs for the
   consistency of the likelihood estimators of the regression and dynamic
   dependence parameters are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The synthesis of atomically thin boron sheets on a silver substrate
   opened a new area in the field of two-dimensional systems. Similar to
   hydrogenated and halogenated graphene, the uniform coating of borophene
   with fluorine atoms can lead to new derivatives of borophene with novel
   properties. In this respect, we explore the possible structures of
   fluorinated borophene for varying levels of coverage (BnF) by using
   first-principles methods. Following the structural optimizations, phonon
   spectrum analysis and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations are
   performed to reveal the stability of the obtained structures. Our
   results indicate that while fully fluorinated borophene (BF) cannot be
   obtained, stable configurations with lower coverage levels (B4F and B2F)
   can be attained. Unveiling the stable structures, we explore the
   mechanical, electronic, and thermal properties of (BnF). Fluorination
   significantly alters the mechanical properties of the system, and
   remarkable results, including direction-dependent variation of Young's
   modulus and a switch from a negative to positive Poisson's ratio, are
   obtained. However, the metallic character is preserved for low coverage
   levels, and metal to semiconductor transition is obtained for B2F. The
   heat capacity at a low temperature increases with an increasing F atom
   amount but converges to the same limiting value at high temperatures.
   The enhanced stability and unique properties of fluorinated borophene
   make it a promising material for various high-technology applications in
   reduced dimensions.}},

Journal = {{POLYMERS}},
Year = {{2018}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic plied yarns are specially constructed with two types of single
   yarns of different sizes and moduli. This paper investigates how to use
   these types of yarns to produce woven fabrics with auxetic effects.
   Four-ply auxetic yarns were first incorporated into a series of woven
   fabrics with different design parameters to study their auxetic behavior
   and percent open area during extension. Effects of auxetic plied yarn
   arrangement, single component yarn properties, weft yarn type, and weave
   structure were then evaluated. Additional double helical yarn (DHY) and
   6-ply auxetic yarn woven fabrics were also made for comparison. The
   results show that the alternative arrangement of S- and Z-twisted 4-ply
   auxetic yarns in a woven fabric can generate a higher negative Poisson's
   ratio (NPR) of the fabric. While the higher single stiff yarn modulus of
   auxetic yarn can result in greater NPR behavior, finer soft auxetic yarn
   does not necessarily generate such an effect. Weft yarns with low
   modulus and short float over the 4-ply auxetic yarns in fabric structure
   are favorable for producing high NPR behavior. The weft cover factor
   greatly affects the variation of the percent open area of the 4-ply
   auxetic yarn fabrics during extension. When different kinds of helical
   auxetic yarns (HAYs) are made into fabrics, the fabric made of DHY does
   not have the highest NPR effect but it has the highest percent open
   area, which increases with increasing tensile strain.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{While the rule of mixture is applicable for addressing the overall
   Poisson's ratio of a concentrically aligned bi-layered rod under
   longitudinal loading, the same cannot be said for this rod under
   torsional loading due to the higher extent of deformation in the rod
   material further away from the torsional axis. In addition, the use of
   adhesives for attaching the solid inner rod to the hollow outer rod
   introduces an intermediate layer, thereby resulting in a tri-layered
   concentric rod if the adhesive layer is uniformly distributed. This
   paper investigates the effect of the adhesive properties on the overall
   auxeticity of a rod consisting of two concentrically aligned cylindrical
   isotropic foams with Poisson's ratio of opposite signs under torsional
   loads. An indirect way for obtaining Poisson's ratio of a concentrically
   tri-layered rod was obtained using a mechanics of materials approach.
   Results show that the auxeticity of such rods is influenced by the
   adhesive's stiffness, Poisson's ratio, thickness, and radius from the

Abstract = {{Ab initio calculations were used to study the properties of a series of
   hexagonal (Fe2N-like) subcarbides M2C, where M = Tc, Ru, Rh, Pd, Re, Os,
   Ir, and Pt, and to calculate their equilibrium structural parameters,
   electronic properties, phase stability, elastic constants, compression
   modulus, shear modulus, Young's modulus, compressibility, Pugh's
   indicator, Poisson ratio, elastic anisotropy indices, and also hardness,
   Debye temperature, sound velocity, and low-temperature heat capacity. It
   is found based on these results that all the subcarbides are
   mechanically stable; however, their formation energies E (form) are
   positive with respect to a mixture of d-metal and graphite. In addition,
   the calculation of the phonon spectra of these subcarbides shows the
   existence of negative modes, which indicates their dynamical
   instability. Thus, a successful synthesis of these subcarbides at normal
   conditions is highly improbable.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, many structural motifs have been designed with the aim
   of creating auxetic metamaterials. One area of particular interest in
   this subject is the creation of auxetic material properties through
   elastic instability. Such metamaterials switch from conventional
   behaviour to an auxetic response for loads greater than some threshold
   value. This paper develops a novel methodology in the analysis of
   auxetic metamaterials which exhibit elastic instability through analogy
   with rigid link lattice systems. The results of our analytic approach
   are confirmed by finite-element simulations for both the onset of
   elastic instability and post-buckling behaviour including Poisson's
   ratio. The method gives insight into the relationships between
   mechanisms within lattices and their mechanical behaviour; as such, it
   has the potential to allow existing knowledge of rigid link lattices
   with auxetic paths to be used in the design of future buckling-induced
   auxetic metamaterials.}},

Title = {{Mechanical Properties of a Novel Zero Poisson's Ratio Honeycomb}},
Journal = {{ADVANCED ENGINEERING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel honeycomb is proposed by embedding a rib into
   every cell of the existing zero Poisson's ratio (ZPR) configuration,
   semi re-entrant honeycomb (SRH). Analytical model is developed to
   investigate the in-plane mechanical properties of the new honeycomb, and
   the resulting theoretical expressions are compared with the experimental
   tests and numerical results obtained from two different finite element
   (FE) models (3D beam model and 3D solid model), leading to a good
   correlation. FE analysis, analytical modeling, and experimental tests of
   the new honeycomb show that it can achieve ZPR effect in two principal
   directions. For further studies, parameters analyses are carried out to
   explore the dependence of the in-plane mechanical properties versus the
   geometric parameters. The results show that bending is the dominated
   deformation model when the new honeycomb is compressed along the x-
   direction, while stretch controlled in the y- directional compression.
   It is remarkable that the new proposed honeycomb features superior
   specific stiffness and more flexible in mechanical properties tailoring
   compared to the other ZPR honeycombs in the literature. Given these
   benefits, the new honeycomb may be promising in some practical
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{We have estimated P-wave velocities (V-P) and thicknesses from
   traveltimes data, and S-wave velocities (V-S) and densities (rho) from
   amplitudes versus offset (AVO) data by constraining the V-P for a set of
   seismic reflection data including a bottom simulating reflector or BSR
   (marker for gas hydrates) in the Mahanadi offshore. The elastic
   parameters (V-P, V-S and.) of the whole-layered model have been derived
   simultaneously using the genetic algorithm global optimization technique
   that converges into a global minimum. The result shows a low velocity
   (1506 m/s) free-gas zone below the BSR that lies at 241 m below the sea
   floor. The presence of underlying free-gas is further corroborated by
   the observation of increasing negative reflection coefficients with
   angles. The V-P and V-S for gas hydrates bearing sediments above the BSR
   are estimated to be 1655 and 468 m/s respectively, and match reasonably
   with the sonic log at site NGHP-01-08A passing through the seismic line.
   Gas-hydrates and free-gas have been qualitatively estimated as 7.0\% and
   0.9\% using three-phase weighted equation of Lee and Gassmann equation
   respectively. The combined usage of V-P and V-S corresponding to a
   Poisson ratio of 0.4565 provides a better estimation of gas hydrates,
   which shows comparable result that has been estimated using the
   Simandoux equation to the resistivity log data at site NGHP-01-08A.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel periodic auxetic cellular structure (PACS)
   whose cells were spanned as warp and woof. Warp and woof periodic
   auxetic cellular structure (WWPACS) is compressed in two transverse

   paper, among different available manufacturing processes of auxetic
   structures, interlocking assembly method was used to fabricate the
   periodic cellular structure. To this end, the effects of NPR and
   mechanical behavior of auxetic structure were investigated and results
   compared with 3D finite element simulation. Good agreements were found
   between the experimental and FE results. The total energy and specific
   energy absorbed for experimental works and FE simulation were
   calculated. Furthermore, the effect of re-entrant angle on NPR was also
   obtained. The results show that the NPR increases and reaches to maximum
   value and then, due to overlaying the cellular, decreases. FE
   simulations show that the effect of structural geometry on NPR is more
   important than that of the materials used in the structure. (C) 2018

Abstract = {{Metamaterials with re-entrant type lattice structure with cubic symmetry
   are studied. The main new result is that the continuum theory of porous
   media generalized to the case of media with cubic symmetry can
   adequately describe the effective properties of a wide class of lattice
   structures as continuum media. Identification of the micro-dilatational
   elastic constants for the cellular metamaterials with negative Poisson's
   ratio is carried out. Methods for identifying the parameters of the
   micro-dilatation theory of media through the structural and rigidity
   parameters of lattice structures are developed. It is shown that
   material constants of the micro-dilatation theory can be directly linked
   with the geometrical and elastic parameters of the unit cell of the
   metamaterial. In particular, ``void stiffness{''} modulus and voids
   diffusion parameter depend linearly on the stiffness of re-entrant
   structures in the unit cells and coupling modulus depends significantly
   only on the geometry of the unit cell. This result is obtained using
   micro dilatational analytical solution of the homogeneous elasticity
   problem and FE modeling of the uniaxial tension, hydrostatic compression
   and simple shear of the beam lattice metamaterial models. The problem of
   non-homogeneous uniaxial deformation of the rod and the problem of the
   pure bending of the beam were used to determine the voids diffusion
   parameter. It is shown, in particular, that the coupled and scale
   effects are equivalent for the studied continuum and lattice models of
   the metamaterials in the considered range of parameters. (C) 2017

   The full in-plane displacement fields and the eigenmodes of different

   The results showed strong agreement, validating the theoretical approach
   used and establishing a method for testing and quantitatively assessing

Title = {{Mediation analysis for count and zero-inflated count data without
   sequential ignorability and its application in dental studies}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{67}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{371-394}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Mediation analysis seeks to understand the mechanism by which a
   treatment affects an outcome. Count or zero-inflated count outcomes are
   common in many studies in which mediation analysis is of interest. For
   example, in dental studies, outcomes such as the number of decayed,
   missing and filled teeth are typically zero inflated. Existing mediation
   analysis approaches for count data often assume sequential ignorability
   of the mediator. This is often not plausible because the mediator is not
   randomized so unmeasured confounders are associated with the mediator
   and the outcome. We develop causal methods based on instrumental
   variable approaches for mediation analysis for count data possibly with
   many 0s that do not require the assumption of sequential ignorability.
   We first define the direct and indirect effect ratios for those data,
   and then we propose estimating equations and use empirical likelihood to
   estimate the direct and indirect effects consistently. A sensitivity
   analysis is proposed for violations of the instrumental variables
   exclusion restriction assumption. Simulation studies demonstrate that
   our method works well for different types of outcome under various
   settings. Our method is applied to a randomized dental caries prevention
   trial and a study of the effect of a massive flood in Bangladesh on
   children's diarrhoea.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: The aim of this study was to determine the incidence and
   predictive factors of catheter related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs)
   acquired through a central venous catheter for delivery of home
   parenteral nutrition (HPN) therapy among a patient population in
   Thailand.
   Methods: This retrospective review was conducted with adult patients
   with intestinal failure who received HPN from October 2002 to April
   2014, at Ramathibodi Home Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition Referral
   Center in Bangkok.
   Results: Seventy-two patients (45.8\% male, mean age 56.2 +/- 15.7 y)
   were included in the analysis. Incidence of CRBSIs was 1.47 per 1000
   catheter days. Over the 12-y period, there were 21 CRBSIs among 10
   patients. There were 26 pathogens isolated from these CRBSIs, mostly
   coagulase-negative staphylococci. Univariate Poisson regression analysis
   revealed that the incidence rate ratio of CRBSIs was significantly
   higher in patients who used an implanted port (compared with tunneled
   catheter), alcohol-based povidone-iodine solution as disinfectant
   (compared with 2\% chlorhexidine gluconate in 70\% isopropyl alcohol),
   cyclic HPN infusion (compared with continuous HPN), and hospital-based
   compound HPN formulations (compared with 3-in-1 commercial
   formulations). Furthermore, longer duration of HPN (>250 d) was
   associated with CRBSIs. Multivariate analysis revealed that longer
   duration of HPN, cyclic HPN, and hospital-based compound HPN were
   significantly associated with CRBSIs.
   Conclusions: CRBSI is a significant complication in patients receiving
   long-term HPN. Individualized therapy with a multidisciplinary team in
   centers with HPN management expertise is required. Careful selection of
   the catheter type and HPN formulation for each patient is necessary to
   best meet patient requirements and minimize HPN-related complications.
   Strict compliance by patients and caregivers with evidence-based
   instructions together with supervision by well-trained HPN providers is
   the most effective strategy to prevent CRBSIs. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{In this paper, an analytical multi-parameter model based on the
   classical lamination theory (CLT) is developed and the study of the
   stiffness response for unidirectional composite laminates with
   out-of-plane ply waviness is followed. A range of parameters associated
   with the waviness defect, including the waviness geometry, the fiber
   off-axis angle, the extent of wavy region and the waviness pattern, are
   incorporated into the analytical model. The fiber volume fraction and
   the type of reinforcement are also taken into account in the parametric
   analysis. The three-dimensional stiffness parameters of thick wavy
   laminates are investigated systematically for different cases. An
   observation of the negative in-plane Poisson's ratios for wavy laminated
   composites reinforced with carbon fibers is presented under the given
   assumptions of CLT. This phenomenon provides a possible, new technique
   to design the auxetic materials. The modeling approach provides an
   effective procedure to quantify the effects of ply waviness on the
   stiffness of composite laminates.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanical properties of artery stent are of key importance to the
   mechanical integrity and biomechanical performance reliability of
   stent-plaque-artery system. In this paper, making use of auxetic
   deformation features of chiral structures and mechanical benefits of
   structural hierarchy, two types of innovative chiral stents with auxetic
   properties are proposed: (a) anti-tetrachiral stent with circular and
   elliptical nodes; (b) hierarchical antitetrachiral stents with circular
   and elliptical nodes. Firstly, the in-plane mechanical properties of
   anti-tetrachiral structures are investigated theoretically, and uniaxial
   tensile experiments are performed for verification; Secondly, design
   procedures of anti-tetrachiral stent and hierarchical anti-tetrachiral
   stent with circular and elliptical nodes are elaborated. Effects of
   stent geometrical parameters on the tensile mechanical behaviors of
   these stents are studied with finite element analysis (FEA). It is found
   that the mechanical behaviors of antitetrachiral stent can be tailored
   through adjusting the levels of hierarchical structures and unit cell
   design parameters. Finally, the deformation of anti-tetrachiral and
   hierarchical anti-tetrachiral stents during stenting process are
   investigated with FEA. It is found that the proposed anti-tetrachiral
   and hierarchical anti-tetrachiral stents exhibit remarkable radial
   expanding abilities while maintaining axial stability, thus show
   promising performances for practical clinical applications.}},

Title = {{Contribution of industrial density and socioeconomic status to the
   spatial distribution of thyroid cancer risk in Hangzhou, China}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{613}},
Pages = {{679-686}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{Background: The thyroid cancer (TC) incidence in China has increased
   dramatically during the last three decades. Typical in this respect is
   the case of Hangzhou city (China), where 7147 new TC cases were
   diagnosed during the period 2008-2012. Hence, the assessment of the TC
   incidence risk increase due to environmental exposure is an important
   public health matter.
   Methods: Correlation analysis, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Poisson
   regression were first used to evaluate the statistical association
   between TC and key risk factors (industrial density and socioeconomic
   status). Then, the Bayesian maximum entropy (BME) theory and the
   integrative disease predictability (IDP) criterion were combined to
   quantitatively assess both the overall and the spatially distributed
   strength of the ``exposure-disease{''} association.
   Results: Overall, higher socioeconomic status was positively correlated
   with higher TC risk (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.687, P < 0.01).
   Compared to people of low socioeconomic status, people of median and
   high socioeconomic status showed higher TC risk: the Relative Risk (RR)
   and associated 95\% confidence interval (CI) were found to be,
   respectively, RR = 2.29 with 95\% CI = 1.99 to 2.63, and RR = 3.67 with
   95\% CI = 3.22 to 4.19. The ``industrial density-TC incidence{''}
   correlation, however, was non-significant. Spatially, the
   ``socioeconomic status-TC{''} association measured by the corresponding
   IDP coefficient was significant throughout the study area: the mean IDP
   value was -0.12 and the spatial IDP values were consistently negative at
   the township level. It was found that stronger associations were
   distributed among residents mainly on a stripe of land from northeast to
   southwest (consisting mainly of sub-district areas). The ``industrial
   density-TC{''} association measured by its IDP coefficient was spatially
   non-consistent.
   Conclusions: Socioeconomic status is an important indicator of TC risk

Abstract = {{The diverse forms of silicon carbides lead to versatile properties, but
   an auxetic allotrope at zero pressure has never been reported. Here,
   using first-principles calculations we propose a two-dimensional (2D)
   auxetic silicon carbide material, namely SiC6 siligraphene. The
   plausibility of the SiC6 siligraphene is verified by the low formation
   energy, positive phonon spectrum and high mechanical stability. The
   unique framework of sp(2) carbon and sp(3) silicon atoms leads to
   unusual in-plane negative Poisson's ratios and electronic properties
   superior to both graphene and silicene. SiC6 siligraphene possesses a
   natural band gap of 0.73 eV and a high carrier mobility. The theoretical
   mobility in the order of 104 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) for electrons along the
   {[}(1) over bar 10] direction is comparable to the hole mobility in
   black phosphorene, whereas the hole transport along the {[}110]
   direction is blocked. Both the electronic band structure and carrier
   mobility of the SiC6 siligraphene can be tuned by applying external
   strain. A possible synthetic route is also proposed. The exotic
   properties make SiC6 siligraphene a versatile and promising 2D material
   for applications in nanomechanics and nanoelectronics.}},

Abstract = {{The ground state of macroscopic samples of magnetically ordered
   materials is a domain state because of magnetostatic energy or entropy,
   yet we have limited experimental means for imaging the bulk domain
   structure and the magnetization process directly. The common methods
   available reveal the domains at the surface or in electron-or x-ray
   transparent lamellae, not those in the bulk. The magnetization curve
   just reflects the vector sum of the moments of all the domains in the
   sample, butmagnetostriction curves are more informative. They are
   strongly influenced by the domain structure in the unmagnetized state
   and its evolution during the magnetization process in an applied field.
   Here we report a method of determining the bulk domain structure in a
   cubic magnetostrictive material by combining magneto-optic Kerr
   microscopy with magnetostriction and magnetization measurements on
   single crystals as a function of applied field. We analyze the
   magnetostriction of Fe83Ga17 crystals in terms of a domain structure
   that is greatly influenced by sample shape and heat treatment.
   Saturation magnetostriction measurements are used to determine the
   fraction of domains orientated along the three  100  axes in the initial
   state. Domain wall motion and rotation process have characteristic
   signatures in the magnetostriction curves, including those associated
   with the Delta E effect and domain rotation through a  110  auxetic
   direction.}},

Journal = {{NANOSCALE}},

Pages = {{1265-1271}},

Abstract = {{Due to their compatibility in the well-developed Si-based semiconductor
   industry, exploring two-dimensional (2D) silicon crystals with both
   sizable band gaps and high carrier mobility is important to develop
   high-performance electronic and optoelectronic devices on the nanoscale.
   Here, eleven new 2D silicon crystals are reported based on the strategy
   of mixing 3-fold and 4-fold coordinated silicon atoms in 2D confined
   phases and first-principles calculations. We establish that these 2D
   silicon crystals can be obtained by functionalizing silicene with
   silicon atoms, dimers, or chains, which exhibit lower formation energy
   than that of silicene. Their dynamic stability and thermal stability are
   confirmed by phonon calculations and Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamic
   simulation at temperatures up to 700 K. Electronic structure
   calculations reveal that these 2D silicon crystals are semiconductors
   with sizable and tunable band gaps, ranging from 1.12 to 1.67 eV, and
   four of them are direct or quasi-direct band gap semiconductors with
   strong absorption in the visible-light frequency. The calculated Young's
   stiffness of 2D silicon crystals ranges from 31 to 88 N m(-1), which are
   comparable to phosphorene, but remarkably smaller than those of MoS2
   monolayer and graphene. Remarkably, C-z-P2/c-Si-12 possesses a negative
   Poisson's ratio with a maximum value of -0.055. In particular, 2D
   silicon crystals possess ultrahigh carrier mobility of up to 1.7 x 10(5)
   and 1.3 x 10(4) cm(2) V-1 s(-1) at room temperature for electrons and
   holes, respectively, suitable for high-speed electronic and
   optoelectronic applications on the nanoscale.}},

Abstract = {{Architectured materials with rationally designed geometries could be
   used to create mechanical metamaterials with unprecedented or rare
   properties and functionalities. Here, we introduce ``shape-matching{''}
   metamaterials where the geometry of cellular structures comprising
   auxetic and conventional unit cells is designed so as to achieve a
   pre-defined shape upon deformation. We used computational models to
   forward-map the space of planar shapes to the space of geometrical
   designs. The validity of the underlying computational models was first
   demonstrated by comparing their predictions with experimental
   observations on specimens fabricated with indirect additive
   manufacturing. The forward-maps were then used to devise the geometry of
   cellular structures that approximate the arbitrary shapes described by
   random Fourier's series. Finally, we show that the presented
   metamaterials could match the contours of three real objects including a
   scapula model, a pumpkin, and a Delft Blue pottery piece. Shape-matching
   materials have potential applications in soft robotics and wearable
   (medical) devices.}},

Abstract = {{Under uniaxial compression (tension), auxetic materials would shrink
   (expand) laterally. It has been speculated that the auxetic property
   could be used to design superior nails for easier push-in and harder
   pull-out. In this study, the first auxetic nails are designed,
   fabricated and experimentally investigated. Pine timber and
   mediumdensity fibreboard are selected as testing materials. The push-in
   and pull-out performance of auxetic and nonauxetic nails is compared by
   using two key parameters of the maximum compressive force and the
   maximum tensile force. It is found that the auxetic nails do not always
   exhibit superior mechanical performance to nonauxetic ones. Also, the
   small auxetic deformation of one typical designed auxetic nail is
   revealed by the experimentally validated finite element model. The
   experimental and numerical results illustrate the limitations of
   exploiting the auxetic property in the nail application. Some
   suggestions are provided for more effective designs of future auxetic

Abstract = {{We explore the range over which the elasticity of disordered spring
   networks can be manipulated by the removal of selected bonds. By taking
   into account the local response of a bond, we demonstrate that the
   effectiveness of pruning can be improved so that auxetic (i.e., negative
   Poisson's ratio) materials can be designed without the formation of
   cracks even while maintaining the global isotropy of the network. The
   bulk modulus and shear modulus scale with the number of bonds removed
   and we estimate the exponents characterizing these power laws. We also
   find that there are spatial correlation lengths in the change of bulk
   modulus and shear modulus upon removing different bonds that diverge as
   the network approaches the isostatic limit where the excess coordination
   number Delta Z -> 0.}},

Abstract = {{The Xing'an Mongolian Orogenic Belt (XMOB) and the northern margin of
   North China Craton (NCC) have undergone multistage tectonic
   superimposition and the tectonic evolution is extremely complicated. We
   collect the teleseismic data of 44 temporary broadband seismic stations
   deployed in the XMOB and the northern margin of NCC to calculate the P
   wave receiver functions. The crustal thickness and average crustal ratio
   as well as the Poisson's ratios beneath 33 stations are estimated using
   the H-kappa stacking method. The results show: (1) the crustal thickness
   of the study area ranges from 38.7 to 42.7 km, with an average thickness
   of 41.2 km. There is a great difference in crustal thickness on both
   sides of Solonker suture zone. The characteristics of crustal thickness
   support the geodynamic model that the Paleo-Asian Ocean subducted and
   closed at the Solonker suture zone. (2) The Poisson's ratios in the
   study area are low, ranging from 0.215 to 0.277, with an average value
   of 0.243, suggesting that the rock composition of the area is dominated
   by felsic-acid rocks. (3) There exists a negative correlation between
   the Poisson's ratio and the crustal thickness. Combined with the lower
   values of Poisson's ratio, we speculate that the delamination is the
   major mechanism in crustal extension and thinning in the study area.}},

Abstract = {{Negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) material attracts a lot of attentions for
   its unique mechanical properties. However, achieving NPR is at the
   expense of reducing Young's modulus. It has been observed that the
   composite stiffness can be enhanced when blending positive Poisson's
   ratio (PPR) material into NPR material. Based on the respective
   interpolation of Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio, two concurrent
   topology optimization problems with different types of constraints,
   called Problem A and B, are respectively discussed to explore the
   Poisson's ratio effect in porous microstructure. In Problem A, the
   volume constraints are respectively imposed on macro and micro
   structures; in Problem B, besides setting an upper bound on the total
   available base materials, the micro thermal insulation capability is
   considered as well. Besides considering the influence of micro thermal
   insulation capability on the optimized results in Problem B, the similar
   and dissimilar influences of Poisson's ratios, volume fractions in
   Problem A and B are also investigated through several 2D and 3D
   numerical examples. It is observed that the concurrent structural
   stiffness resulting from the mixture of PPR and NPR base materials can
   exceed the concurrent structural stiffness composed of any individual
   base material.}},

Abstract = {{Recent successes of researchers in the fabrication of new carbon
   structures of different morphologies and dimensions open up broad
   prospects for the development of carbon materials with qualitatively new
   properties. Such promising materials are cellular structures (or carbon
   aerogels) that have high deformability, good adsorption and conductivity
   characteristics. In this work, we consider a carbon structure consisting
   of re-entrant honeycomb cells, which allow the structure to be auxetic.
   The stability and deformation behaviour of re-entrant carbon honeycomb
   structures is studied by molecular dynamics simulation. The effect of
   structural parameters on the stability of carbon aerogel is discussed.
   It is shown that structural changes significantly depend on the strain
   rate and the loading direction. At a high strain rate in tension along
   the z-axis, all cells open slightly at the same time. On the contrary,
   at small strain rates, certain cells open, while others almost
   completely collapse, which is expected to result in changes in physical
   properties, for example, in conductivity. During tension along the
   x-axis, a transformation from a re-entrant honeycomb to a traditional
   honeycomb took place.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports the development of novel auxetic fibrous structures
   from high performance yarns using knitting technology for application as
   reinforcement in composites. Two types of high performance yarns,
   namely, para-aramid (p-AR) and polyamide 6.6 (PA), were used to produce
   three distinct auxetic structures: purl, re-entrant lozenge and
   re-entrant star structures. It was observed that all structures produced
   could achieve maximum negative Poisson's ratios (NPR) of -0.60, -0.54
   and -0.47 in the course direction of purl and lozenge and in wale
   direction of star structures, respectively. The auxetic textile
   structures also presented better tensile strength and energy absorption
   (except re-entrant lozenge structure) than plain knitted textiles
   produced by using the same type of fibres and parameters.}},

Title = {{Impact of malocclusion on oral health-related quality of life among
   schoolchildren}},
Journal = {{BRAZILIAN ORAL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{32}},
Abstract = {{The aim of the present study was to evaluate the prevalence and impact
   of malocclusion on oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) among
   schoolchildren aged 8 to 10 years and their parents in Diamantina, a
   town in the southeast of Brazil. A cross-sectional study was conducted
   with a sample of 390 randomly selected children who were subjected to a
   clinical oral examination. The Dental Aesthetic Index was used to
   diagnose malocclusion and the need for orthodontic treatment. The Child
   Perceptions Questionnaire (CPQ (8-10)) was used to evaluate the impact
   of malocclusion on OHRQoL. The children's parents answered the Brazilian
   Economic Criterion Questionnaire for the socioeconomic classification.
   Data analysis involved the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test and
   Spearman's correlation coefficients. The variables were grouped into a
   hierarchy of categories ranging from distal to proximal determinants.
   Poisson regression analysis with robust variance was performed at each
   level to correlate the total CPQ (8-10) score with the independent
   variables. The prevalence of malocclusion was 78.7\%. Crossbite remained
   significantly a ssociated with a negative impact on OHRQoL (PR = 1.28;
   95\%CI:1.17-1.39; p < 0.001). The prevalence of malocclusion was high in
   the sample investigated and exerted a negative impact on OHRQoL.}},

Journal = {{BRAZILIAN ORAL RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{32}},
Abstract = {{The oral health status of children with special health care needs (SHCN)
   can affect their quality of life wich domains of the Brazilian version
   of the Early Childohood Oral Health Impact Scale (B-ECOHIS). A
   cross-sectional study was conducted in children with SHCN (aged 1 to 9
   years), who underwent an oral examination for the assessment of dental
   caries severity. Parents/caregivers answered two questionnaires, one on
   oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) - B-ECOHIS, and one on
   socioeconomic characteristics. Statistical analyses were performed using
   the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, Mann-Whitney U-test, Poisson regression,
   Point-biserial correlation coefficient, and Cronbach's alpha. A total of
   128 children participated in the study and OHRQoL was affected in
   68.75\% of them. The function domain in the Child Impact Section (CIS)
   had a higher mean value. Caries severity was associated with worse
   quality of life (p=0.001). Severe dental caries was associated with a
   negative impact on the OHRQoL of disabled children and of their
   families. The impact of untreated dental caries and severity of dental
   caries was associated with the CIS domains (except for the
   self-image/social interaction domain).}},

Abstract = {{Stop bands in auxetic periodic structures including resonators are
   investigated in this paper. In aerospace field, sandwich panels like
   honeycombs are mainly used for their structural properties, and can
   present some advantages for vibroacoustics control. Auxetic structures
   seem to give enhanced properties for wave propagation control, and have
   been used here to perform the analysis. Resonators are included to open
   resonant band gaps in addition to the Bragg band gaps given by the
   periodicity of the core. Studies on the number of resonators inside the
   unit cell have been performed for a constant mass to identify the
   configuration which are able to open stop bands at low frequency range.
   Also, a parametric analysis on the resonator properties is done to
   compare the benefit concerning wave propagation while having a
   reasonable added mass for the core structure.}},
