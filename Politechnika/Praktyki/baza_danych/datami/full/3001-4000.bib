Abstract = {{Auxetic materials offer potential to be applied to sports safety
   equipment. This work reports quasi-static and impact testing of auxetic
   open-cell polyurethane foam - fabricated with a compression and heat
   treatment process - in comparison to its conventional counterpart. The
   foam was compressed to 70\% of its original dimension along each
   dimension during the conversion process. Quasi-static compression
   testing confirmed the converted foam to be auxetic, with a Poisson's
   ratio of -0.08. Impact testing was performed for energies up to 5.6 J
   with an instrumented drop rig and high-speed video. Peak accelerations
   were similar to 3 times lower for the auxetic foams, because they
   prevented bottoming. This work has shown further potential for auxetic
   foam to be applied to sports safety devices. Future work should look to
   optimise foam selection and the conversion process, while comparing
   auxetic foam with existing materials and products. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Abstract = {{The work presents a design study for an aeronautical flap capable of
   smooth and progressive shape variations. Optimal configurations for
   takeoff and landing are taken from literature to define a reference
   design case and the corresponding loading conditions. An extraction
   mechanism to set the flap in optimal position is identified. Then, a
   morphing composite structure is devised to smoothly and progressively
   change the shape of the high lift device to enhance the functions and
   the versatility of such aerodynamic surface. An internal structure based
   on chiral auxetic cellular topology and a skin system supported by a
   corrugated composite panel are proposed. The technological processes for
   manufacturing such components are presented and discussed. A
   parameterized finite element model of the morphing flap is developed and
   structural analyses are carried out to investigate the feasibility of

Abstract = {{Cellular materials have two important properties: structures and
   mechanisms. These properties have important applications in materials
   design; in particular, they're used to determine the modulus and yield
   strain. The objective of this study is to gain a better understanding of
   these two properties and to explore the synthesis of three-dimensional
   (3D) compliant cellular materials (CCMs) with compliant porous
   structures (CPSes) generated from modified hexagonal honeycombs. An
   orthotropic constitutive CCM model in the Cartesian coordinate system is
   constructed using the strain energy method, which uses the deformation
   of hinges around holes and the rotation of links. A finite element (FE)
   based simulation is conducted to validate the analytical model. The
   moduli and yield strains of the 3D CCMs with an aluminum alloy are about
   1.2GPa and 0.4\% in the longitudinal direction and about 0.08MPa and
   30\% in the lateral direction. The CCMs have extremely high positive and
   negative Poisson's ratios (43, 30) due to the large rotation of the link
   member in the transverse direction caused by an input displacement in
   the longitudinal direction. This paper demonstrates that compliant
   mesostructures can be used for next generation materials design in
   tailoring mechanical properties such as moduli, strength, strain, and
   Poisson's ratios.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate prediction of gas planar distribution is crucial to selection
   and development of new CBM exploration areas. Based on seismic
   attributes, well logging and testing data we found that seismic
   absorption attenuation, after eliminating the effects of burial depth,
   shows an evident correlation with CBM gas content; (positive) structure
   curvature has a negative correlation with gas content; and density has a
   negative correlation with gas content. It is feasible to use the
   hydrocarbon index (P{*}G) and pseudo-Poisson ratio attributes for
   detection of gas enrichment zones. Based on seismic multiple-attribute
   analyses, a multiple linear regression equation was established between
   the seismic attributes and gas content at the drilling wells.
   Application of this equation to the seismic attributes at locations
   other than the drilling wells yielded a quantitative prediction of
   planar gas distribution. Prediction calculations were performed for two
   different models, one using pre-stack inversion and the other one
   disregarding pre-stack inversion. A comparison of the results indicates
   that both models predicted a similar trend for gas content distribution,
   except that the model using pre-stack inversion yielded a prediction
   result with considerably higher precision than the other model.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of fiber arrangement on the negative through-the-thickness
   Poisson's ratios of angle-ply carbon fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP)
   laminates are investigated based on a homogenization theory. First,
   angle-ply CFRP laminates are modeled three-dimensionally with +theta-
   and -theta-laminae in which carbon fibers are distributed in a hexagonal
   arrangement. Then, a homogenization theory for nonlinear time-dependent
   composites is applied to the laminates. Using the present method, the
   elastic-viscoplastic Poisson's ratios of angle-ply carbon fiber/epoxy
   laminates are analyzed. The analysis results are then compared with
   those of the previous study, in which a square fiber arrangement in each
   lamina was assumed. It is shown that the fiber arrangement affects the
   negative through-the-thickness Poisson's ratios of the laminates in both
   elastic and viscoplastic regions, though they have little effect on the
   macroscopic stress-strain relationships of the laminates.}},

Abstract = {{We consider negative binomial (NB) regression models for RNA-Seq read
   counts and investigate an approach where such NB regression models are
   fitted to individual genes separately and, in particular, the NB
   dispersion parameter is estimated from each gene separately without
   assuming commonalities between genes. This single-gene approach
   contrasts with the more widely-used dispersion-modeling approach where
   the NB dispersion is modeled as a simple function of the mean or other
   measures of read abundance, and then estimated from a large number of
   genes combined. We show that through the use of higher-order asymptotic
   techniques, inferences with correct type I errors can be made about the
   regression coefficients in a single-gene NB regression model even when
   the dispersion is unknown and the sample size is small. The motivations
   for studying single-gene models include: 1) they provide a basis of
   reference for understanding and quantifying the power-robustness
   trade-offs of the dispersion-modeling approach; 2) they can also be
   potentially useful in practice if moderate sample sizes become available
   and diagnostic tools indicate potential problems with simple models of
   dispersion.}},

Title = {{Auxetic polymeric bone plate as internal fixator for long bone
   fractures: Design, fabrication and structural analysis}},
Journal = {{TECHNOLOGY AND HEALTH CARE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{819-833}},
Abstract = {{INTRODUCTION: Injuries cover about 11\% of World's Disease Burden
   depicting fractures to be the leading severe consequence of trauma.
   Fractures occur due to force impact or osteoporosis. Fracture healing is
   a complicated process. Fracture fixation techniques focus on imparting
   reduction to fractured fragments and induce healing. When considering
   possible fixation methods, the aspect of micro-movement is an important
   one, as this induces callus formation which tends to be a crucial step
   for fracture healing. Internal fixation of long bone fractures using
   metallic plates has been carried out since decades and recently
   advancements have been in synthesizing biodegradable plates as well. The
   purpose of this research was to fabricate an Auxetic Polymeric Bone
   Plate that can be used as an internal fixator for long bone fracture;
   this bone plate renders micro-movement due to its counter intuitive
   behavior, has the potential to reduce the effect of stress shielding and
   allow the same range of motion as that of natural bone.
   METHODS: Polyurethane was chosen as a material for the fabrication of
   the Auxetic device because of its biocompatibility and non-toxic
   effects. The plate was then tested for mechanical properties such as
   Tensile and Compression testing to determine the strength.
   RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The tensile testing of the Auxetic polyurethane
   specimens showed that the mean of the Poisson's ratio of the samples
   lies between -0.68 and -0.87 at different uni-axial tensile load values.
   The Auxetic structure of our device has the potential to allow for
   efficient fixation because its negative Poisson's ratio offers
   micro-movement, thereby causing fixation with relative stability rather
   than absolute stability. The Auxetic bone plate can be superior to
   contemporary plate fixation systems, as it demands meaningfully small
   contact points. The suitable mechanical properties might lessen stress
   shielding effects that are normally caused by rigid bone plates. The
   Auxetic nature of the bone will help align and sustain the bone
   fragments with small fracture gaps in order to impart appropriate
   assembly to accomplish bone healing.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED BIOMATERIALS \& FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS}},

Abstract = {{Background: Cardiovascular heart disease is one of the leading health
   issues in the present era and requires considerable health care
   resources to prevent it. The present study was focused on the
   development of a new coronary stent based on novel auxetic geometry
   which enables the stent to exhibit a negative Poisson's ratio.
   Commercially available coronary stents have isotropic properties,
   whereas the vascular system of the body shows anisotropic
   characteristics. This results in a mismatch between
   anisotropic-isotropic properties of the stent and arterial wall, and
   this in turn is not favorable for mechanical adhesion of the
   commercially available coronary stents with the arterial wall. It is
   believed that an auxetic coronary stent with inherent anisotropic
   mechanical properties and negative Poisson's ratio will have good
   mechanical adhesion with the arterial wall.
   Methods: The auxetic design was obtained via laser cutting, and surface
   treatment was performed with acid pickling and electropolishing,
   followed by an annealing process. In vitro mechanical analysis was
   performed to analyze the mechanical performance of the auxetic coronary
   stent. Scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) was used to determine the
   effects of fabrication processes on the topography of the auxetic stent.
   Results and Conclusions: The elastic recoil (3.3\%) of the in vitro
   mechanical analysis showed that the auxetic stent design effectively
   maintained the luminal patency of the coronary artery. Also, the auxetic
   coronary stent showed no foreshortening, therefore it avoids the problem
   of stent migration, by expanding in both the radial and longitudinal
   directions. By virtue of its synclastic behavior, the auxetic stent
   bulges outward when it is radially expanded through an inflated balloon.}},

Abstract = {{This paper utilizes the gravity model to analyse German exports. We have
   used a panel dataset which includes German exports to 176 countries and
   20 control variables, including institutional factors during the period
   of 1995-2011. We estimate the model by applying a Poisson regression
   with robust variances and estimate three models (a pooled Poisson
   regression as well as a Exed and random panel data Poisson regression).
   The results reveal that the core economic variables (partner GDP,
   distance) are the most relevant factors behind German exports. The
   distance coefficient is slightly below the average results from other
   studies and thus in comparison German exporters are less harmed by
   geographical distances than exporters in other countries. The real
   exchange rate has also been revealed as relevant: depreciation
   stimulates exports. Other economic significant variables were population
   (negative effect), recession (negative effect) and domestic GDP
   (positive effect). The results of institutional variables are not
   conclusive regarding their effects on exports.}},

Abstract = {{This chapter considers the damage properties of auxetic solids. In the
   study of stress concentration factors in auxetic solids and plates
   arising from cavities and rigid inclusions, most cases exhibit minimum
   stress concentration when the solids possess negative Poisson's ratio.
   In discussing the three modes of fracture in auxetic solids in
   dimensionless terms, most plots exhibit a clear demarcation between
   auxetic and conventional regions. The consideration of damage criteria
   based on thermodynamic analysis by Lemaitre and Baptiste (NSF workshop
   on mechanics of damage and fracture, 1982) shows that as an isotropic
   solid changes from conventional to auxetic, the damage criterion shifts
   from being highly dependent on the von Mises equivalent stress to being
   highly dependent on the hydrostatic stress. Progress on fatigue failure
   of auxetic materials is then given.}},

Abstract = {{This chapter considers auxetic solids in such a form that is best
   analyzed using polar or spherical coordinate system. Specifically, this
   chapter considers the effect of auxeticity on stresses in rotating disks
   both thin and thick as well as the stresses in thick-walled cylinders
   and thick-walled spheres arising from internal and external pressure.
   Plotted results suggest that auxetic materials are advantageous over
   conventional ones for use as internally pressurized thick-walled
   cylinders, but inferior in comparison to conventional ones for
   application as thick-walled cylinders under external pressure. In the
   case of rotating thin disks with Poisson's ratio of 1/3, the
   circumferential stress is independent of the radial distance, i.e.
   uniform throughout the entire disk, but not so for rotating disks with
   central hole. The maximum stress in a thin solid disk, as well as both
   the maximum radial and circumferential stresses in a thin disk with a
   central hole, decreases linearly as the Poisson's ratio becomes more
   negative. Similar to thin rotating disks, the circumferential stress in
   thick rotating disks is independent from the radial distance when the
   Poisson's ratio is 1/3; unlike thin disks, this circumferential stress
   is not uniform throughout the entire disk, as it varies along the disk
   thickness. In addition, the radial and circumferential stresses in a
   thick rotating disk is independent from the through thickness direction
   when the Poisson's ratio is either 0 or -1. In the case of thick-walled
   spheres, the radial displacement is inversely proportional to the square
   of the radial distance if the Poisson's ratio is 0.5, but varies
   linearly to the radial distance if the Poisson's ratio is -1.}},

Pages = {{231-292}},
Abstract = {{This chapter opens with a discussion on flexural rigidity of auxetic
   plates vis-a-vis conventional ones, followed by an analysis of circular
   auxetic plates. Bending moment result from uniform loading of circular
   plates suggests that the optimal Poisson's ratio is 1/3 if the plate is
   simply-supported at the edge. Based on bending and twisting moment
   minimization on a rectangular plate under sinusoidal load, the optimal
   Poisson's ratio for a square plate is 0, and this value reduces until 1
   for a rectangular plate with aspect ratio 1 + root 2. Auxetic materials
   are not suitable for uniformly loaded and simply supported square
   plates, as moment minimization study suggests an optimal Poisson's ratio
   of 0.115, but are highly suitable for central point loaded and simply
   supported square plates, as moment minimization study suggests an
   optimal Poisson's ratio of -1. In the study of auxetic plates on auxetic
   foundation, the plotted results suggest that, in addition to selecting
   materials of sufficient strength and mechanical designing of plate for
   reduced stressed concentration, the use of plate and/or foundation
   materials with negative Poisson's ratio is useful for designing against
   failure. The investigations on width-constrained plates under uniaxial
   in-plane pressure by Strek et al. (J Non-Cryst Solids
   354(35-39):4475-4480, 2008) and Pozniak et al. (Rev Adv Mat Sci
   23(2):169-174, 2010) exhibit a remarkable and surprising result at
   extreme negative Poisson's ratios the displacement vector has components
   which are anti-parallel to the direction of loading. In the study of
   spherical shells under uniform load, the use of auxetic material reduces
   the ratio of maximum bending stress to the membrane stress, thereby
   implying that if the shell material possesses a Poisson's ratio that is
   sufficiently negative, such as 1, and the boundary condition permits
   free rotation and lateral displacement, then the use of membrane theory
   of shell is sufficient even though the shell thickness is significant.
   Results also recommend the use of auxetic material for spherical shells
   with simple supports because the bending stress is significantly
   reduced. However the use of auxetic material as spherical shells, with
   built-in edge, is not recommended due to the sharp increase in the
   bending stress as the Poisson's ratio of the shell material becomes more
   negative.}},

Abstract = {{This chapter begins with some general considerations on the
   thermoelasticity of auxetic solids, followed by the thermal elasticity
   of 3D auxetic solids with geometrical constraints. Thereafter, the
   thermoelasticity of beams and plates arising from a given temperature
   profile is furnished. Based on a set of dimensionless thermal stresses
   for application in auxetic plates and shells, it was found that thermal
   stresses reduce as the material becomes more auxetic at constant Young's
   modulus (E), and constant shear modulus (G), but the thermal stresses
   increase as the material becomes more auxetic at constant bulk modulus
   (K). In the case of constant product of EGK, the thermal stress is
   maximum at Poisson's ratio of 0.303, but diminishes at Poisson's ratios
   of 1 and 0.5. In most cases of solids considered in this chapter, the
   thermal stresses are minimized in the auxetic region. Finally a summary
   of thermal conductivity study in multi-re-entrant honeycombs by
   Innocenti and Scarpa (J Compos Mater 43(21):2419-2439, 2009) is given,
   in which the results suggest that auxetic honeycomb configurations

   anisotropy, and the lowest peak temperatures during heat transfer

Pages = {{345-365}},
Abstract = {{Vibration study is of great practical importance, as vibration of
   continuous systems with constraints implies cyclic stresses and the
   inevitable fatigue damage. This chapter on vibration forms the first
   part of elastodynamics of auxetic solids, with special emphasis on
   plates (both circular and rectangular) as well as shells (both
   cylindrical and spherical). For circular plates with free and simply
   supported edges, the frequency parameter changes more rapidly in the
   auxetic region than in the conventional region; consequently the natural
   vibration frequencies of these plates can be effectively reduced by
   choosing auxetic materials. For rectangular plates, the effect of
   negative Poisson's ratio is evaluated for plates with all four sides and
   two sides being simply supported, as well as examples of rectangular
   plates with three sides being simply supported. In the case of
   cylindrical shells with simply supported edges, the results of frequency
   study imply that, when expressed in terms of flexural rigidity, the
   frequency is independent from the cylindrical shell radius at extreme
   auxetic behavior for isotropic case. In the case of spherical isotropic
   shells, the natural frequency diminishes as the Poisson's ratio of the
   shell material approaches 1 at constant flexural rigidity and at
   constant shear modulus. Finally, advanced topics on vibration damping,
   vibration transmissibility and acoustics of auxetic solids and

Pages = {{367-383}},
Abstract = {{This chapter on wave propagation forms the second part of the
   elasto-dynamics of auxetic solids. Special emphasis is placed on the
   effect of negative Poisson's ratio towards the velocity of longitudinal
   waves in prismatic bars c(0), the velocity of plane waves of dilatation
   cl, the velocities of plane waves of distortion and torsional waves c(2)
   and Rayleigh waves c(3). A set of dimensionless wave velocities is
   introduced to facilitate the plotting of non-dimensional wave velocity
   in both the auxetic and conventional regions. As an alternative way of
   non-dimensionalization, all wave velocities can be normalized against
   the wave velocity for plane wave of dilatation. It is herein shown that
   some of the velocities of different types of waves are equal at
   non-positive Poisson's ratio, i.e. c(0) = c(1) at v = 0, c(0) = c2 at v
   = -0.5 and c(0) = c3 at v = 0.733. In the case of solitary waves in
   plates, Kolat et al. (J Non-Cryst Solids 356:2001-2009, 2010) showed
   that the amplitudes and velocities are approximately related to the
   magnitude of the Poisson's ratio, while the width of the initial pulse

Abstract = {{This chapter explores the stress wave transmission and reflection from
   an incident stress wave, between isotropic solids of different Poisson's
   ratio, with special emphasis on systems in which at least one of the
   solids is auxetic. The dimensionless transmitted stress, in terms of the
   ratio of transmitted to incident stresses, were investigated for
   longitudinal stresses in prismatic bars (1D stress), longitudinal
   stresses in width-constrained plates (2D stress or 2D strain), plane
   waves of dilatation (1D strain), torsional waves (shear waves), and
   Rayleigh (surface) waves. Each of these wave transmission study was
   performed under three special cases, i.e. when the (i) product of
   density and Young's modulus for both solids are equal, (ii) product of
   density and shear modulus for both solids are equal, and (iii) product
   of density and bulk modulus for both solids are equal. Under these
   special conditions, results show that the stress transmission is
   effectively doubled or eliminated when the Poisson's ratio for the
   isotropic solids are at their limits.}},

Abstract = {{This chapter considers the effect of Poisson's ratio on lateral
   deformation in longitudinal waves in prismatic bars, and the consequent
   density change. A non-dimensionalization is adopted herein such that the
   dimensionless velocity of longitudinal wave is constant with Poisson's
   ratio. Based on this non-dimensionalization, incorporation of density
   correction and/or lateral inertia using the strength of materials
   approach gives a dimensionless velocity that decreases and increases
   with Poisson's ratio for tensile and compressive loads, respectively,
   such that the pivot conditions take place at v = 0.5 considering density
   correction only, at v = 0 considering lateral inertia only, and at v =
   0.25 considering both corrections. An analogy is then extended to the
   case of plane waves of dilatation, in which only density correction is
   required. Thereafter, a revisit to the lateral inertia of Love rods
   provides the combined effect of density, Young's modulus, Poisson's
   ratio, polar radius of gyration and wave number on the velocity of
   longitudinal waves in Love rods.}},

Abstract = {{This chapter establishes the effect of auxeticity on shear deformation
   in laterally-loaded thick beams, laterally-loaded thick circular,
   polygonal and rectangular plates, buckling of thick columns and plates,
   and vibration of thick plates. Results show that shear deformation
   reduces as the Poisson's ratio becomes more negative, thereby implying
   that geometrically thick beams and plates are mechanically thin beams
   and plates, respectively, if the Poisson's ratio is sufficiently
   negative. In other words, results of deflections in Timoshenko beam and
   Mindlin plate approximate those by Euler-Bernoulli beam and Kirchhoff
   plate, respectively, as the Poisson's ratio approaches -1. In the study
   of buckling of isotropic columns, it was found that auxeticity increases
   the buckling load such that the buckling loads of Timoshenko columns
   approximate those of Euler-Bernoulli columns as v -> -1 In the case of
   vibration of thick isotropic plates, it was shown that as a plate's
   Poisson's ratio becomes more negative, the Mindlin-to-Kirchhoff natural
   frequency ratio increases with diminishing rate. Furthermore,
   simplifying assumptions such as constant shear correction factor and
   exclusion of rotary inertia is valid for plates with positive Poisson's
   ratio, and that the assumptions of constant shear correction factor and
   no rotary inertia for auxetic plates give overestimated natural

Pages = {{533-580}},
Abstract = {{This chapter begins by establishing the effect of constituents with
   opposite Poisson's ratio signs on the effective moduli of composite
   properties. Results show that the effective Young's modulus of
   continuous unidirectional fiber composites in the fiber direction and
   that for laminates of isotropic laminas in the in-plane direction
   exceeds the rule of mixture prediction, especially when the difference
   between Young's moduli and Poisson's ratios between the constituents are
   small and large, respectively. For laminates of isotropic laminas with
   opposing Poisson's ratio signs, the effective Young's modulus in the
   out-of-plane direction not only exceeds the inverse rule of mixture but
   also the direct rule of mixture, and this is especially so when the
   difference between the Young's modulus of individual laminas is
   insignificant. The conditions that lead to further counter-intuitive
   properties whereby the in-plane laminate modulus exceeds the modulus of
   the stiffer phase is established, followed by an example in which the
   maximum point of the laminate modulus takes place when the volume
   fraction of the stiffer phase is lower than the volume fraction of the
   more compliant phase. Thereafter, investigation on laminates of
   isotropic laminas with alternating signs of Poisson's ratio and
   alternating signs of coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) gives
   results of extreme overall CTE. Finally, a review is done for
   investigation on conventional composites that lead to auxetic

Pages = {{433-442}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The aim of this study is to perform a comparative study on
   sandwich structures with several types of three-dimensional (3D)
   reticulate cellular structural core designs for their low-energy impact
   absorption abilities using powder bed additive manufacturing methods. 3D
   reticulate cellular structures possess promising potentials in various
   applications with sandwich structure designs. One of the properties
   critical to the sandwich structures in applications, such as aerospace
   and automobile components, is the low-energy impact performance.
   Design/methodology/approach - Sandwich samples of various designs,
   including re-entrant auxetic, rhombic, hexagonal and octahedral, were
   designed and fabricated via selective laser sintering (SLS) process
   using nylon 12 as material. Low-energy drop weight test was performed to
   evaluate the energy absorption of various designs. Tensile coupons were
   also produced using the same process to provide baseline material
   properties. The manufacturing issues such as geometrical accuracy and
   anisotropy effect as well as their effects on the performance of the
   structures were discussed.
   Findings - In general, 3D reticulate cellular structures made by SLS
   process exhibit significantly different characteristics under low-energy
   drop weight impact compared to the regular extruded honeycomb sandwich
   panels. A hexagonal sandwich panel exhibits the largest compliance with
   the smallest energy absorption ability, and an octahedral sandwich panel
   exhibits high stiffness as well as good impact protection ability.
   Through a proper geometrical design, the re-entrant auxetic sandwich
   panels could achieve a combination of high energy absorption and low
   response force, making it especially attractive for low-impact
   protection applications.
   Originality/value - There has been little work on the comparative study
   of the energy absorption of various 3D reticulate cellular structures to
   date. This work demonstrates the potential of 3D reticulate cellular
   structures as sandwich cores for different purposes. This work also
   demonstrates the possibility of controlling the performance of this type
   of sandwich structures via geometrical and process design of the
   cellular cores with powder bed additive manufacturing systems.}},

Abstract = {{A novel design for the geometric configuration of honeycombs using a
   seamless combination of auxetic and conventional cores- elements with
   negative and positive Possion ratios respectively, has been presented.
   The proposed design has been shown to generate a superior band gap
   property while retaining all major advantages of a purely conventional
   or purely auxetic honeycomb structure. Seamless combination ensures that
   joint cardinality is also retained. Several configurations involving
   different degree of auxeticity and different proportions auxetic and
   conventional elements have been analyzed. It has been shown that the
   preferred configurations open up wide and clean band gap at a
   significantly lower frequency ranges compared to their pure
   counterparts. In view of existence of band gaps being desired feature
   for the phononic applications, reported results might be appealing. Use
   of such design may enable superior vibration control as well. Proposed
   configurations can be made isovolumic and iso-weight giving designers a
   fairer ground of applying such configurations without significantly
   changing size and weight criteria.}},

Abstract = {{A photonic crystal (PhC) is a periodic structure with periodicity
   comparable with the wavelength of light, having a photonic band gap in
   the visible range. In this contribution we discuss the possible use of
   PhCs as strain sensors, based on the observation that a distortion in
   the crystal structure produces a change in the reflected bandwidth.
   First, we demonstrate the feasible fabrication of a PhC having
   sub-micrometric polystyrene colloidal spheres in a PDMS matrix on a
   rubber substrate, and we demonstrate that the photonic properties change
   with substrate elongation according to theoretical prediction. The
   crystal sensitivity to strain depends directly on interplanar spacing
   and on Poisson's ratio. To enhance the crystal strain resolution, we
   propose to fabricate inverse photonic crystals with FCC structure, which
   are known from the literature to exhibit a high negative Poisson's
   ratio. We carried out a theoretical investigation to predict the
   opto-mechanical response of inverse PhCs, and carried out preliminary
   tests to demonstrate their fabrication feasibility.}},

Abstract = {{The nonlinear compressive response and deformation of an auxetic
   cellular structure that has periodic negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) cell
   were studied through theoretical and numerical method. The in-plane
   deformation and process of absorbing energy of this NPR cellular
   structure were discussed. The relative density of NPR cell was
   determined by geometric parameters and a theoretical approach to the
   strength of NPR cell was carried out to analyze the failure process
   under in-plane compression. Thus, to prove the effective of unit cell
   mechanical model, the size effect of this NPR cellular structure was
   discussed. The simulations of two different NPR cellular structures
   under in-plane compression were generated and their effective
   properties, strain-stress curves, and absorbed energy were analyzed. It
   can be concluded that the NPR cell that has lower relative density may
   have better capability of absorbing energy with enhanced Young's
   modulus. Finally the parametric analyses related to relative density
   were presented with NPR unit cell model and a set of quasistatic
   compressive experiments was carried out, which can be used to reveal the

Abstract = {{To obtain a better understanding of the failure mechanism of lithium ion
   batteries during charging-discharging, we have systematically studied
   the mechanical properties of Li-Sn alloys based on density functional
   theory, including elastic constants such as the orientation-averaged
   bulk, shear and Young's moduli and Poisson's ratios, as well as the
   anisotropy and brittleness-ductility. It is shown that bulk, shear and
   Young's moduli of isotropic LixSn alloys decrease almost linearly with
   the increase of Li concentration. Further, based on the analysis of
   shear to bulk modulus and Poisson's ratios, it is inferred that Li-Sn
   alloys are brittle. The poor cycle performance and crushing failure of
   Sn anode materials during charging and discharging are mainly due to a
   transition of electrode material properties from ductile to brittle.}},

Abstract = {{We report a complete study of the lattice dynamics, dielectric, elastic
   and piezoelectric properties of hexagonal semiconducting chromium
   disilicide (CrSi2). From a combined experimental and theoretical study,
   we have revisited the phonon mode assignments at the zone-center, so
   that the contradictions met in previous experimental studies between 250
   and 300 cm(-1) are now explained and understood. We found that the
   temperature dependence of the Raman frequencies is mainly due to an
   implicit volume contribution and related to the large Gruneisen
   parameter. This explains why CrSi2 has a moderate thermal conductivity
   although its Debye temperature is quite large. Optic and static
   dielectric constants have also been analyzed and discussed. The elastic
   constants of CrSi2 are large, but this compound is quite brittle. In
   addition, the relatively low Poisson coefficient associated to the large
   negative Cauchy pressure of CrSi2 indicate the angular nature of its
   bonding. The calculation of its piezoelectric coefficient shows a
   sizable value with a magnitude similar to that reported for a-quartz.
   This prediction requires, however, experimental confirmation.}},

Journal = {{ADVANCES IN MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},

Volume = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic materials exhibit a unique characteristic due to the altered
   microstructure. Different structures have been used to model these
   materials. This paper treats a development of finite element model and
   theoretical formulation of 3D star honeycomb structure of these
   materials. Various shape parameters of the structural cell were
   evaluated with respect to the basic mechanical properties of the cell.
   Finite element and analytical approach for various geometrical
   parameters were numerically used to formulate the characteristics of the
   material. The study aims at quantifying mechanical properties for any
   domain in which auxetic material is of interest for variations in
   geometrical parameters. It is evident that mechanical properties of the
   material could be controlled by changing the base wall angle of the
   configuration. The primary outcome of the study is a design guideline
   for the use of 3D star honeycomb auxetic cellular structure in

Abstract = {{Auxetics are materials which have a negative Poisson's ratio, that is,
   upon uniaxial tensile loading, they also expand in a direction
   perpendicular to the applied force. Here, we analyze the elastic
   constants of stishovite, a high pressure silica polymorph which is known
   to be a significant constituent of the earth's mantle, and show that it
   exhibits a negative Poisson's ratio when stressed in a range of
   directions in the (100), (010) and (001) planes under specific ambient
   pressure ranges. We explain this behaviour through mechanisms involving
   rotations and distortions of the constituent octahedra. These findings
   have important practical implications since stishovite is one of the
   hardest known oxides, and has proven to be important to various fields

   calculated according sociodemographic, behavioral and health related
   variables. Crude and adjusted prevalence ratios were estimated using
   Poisson regression. Results: The prevalence of low cognitive performance
   was high, mainly among females, and indicated linear trends into
   categories of age, schooling, income, plasma fibrinogen and
   self-reported health status. In multivariate models, gender, diabetes,
   fibrinogen and self-reported health status presented positive

Abstract = {{The in-plane dynamic crushing behaviors and energy-absorbed
   characteristics of honeycombs with negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) have
   been studied by means of explicit dynamic finite element analysis (DFEA)
   using ANSYS/LS-DYNA. First, the honeycomb models filled with different
   reentrant cells by the variation of micro-cell configuration parameters
   (cell-wall angle and shape ratio) are established. The respective
   influences of micro-structure and impact velocities on the deformation
   behaviors, the dynamic plateau stresses and the absorbed energy of
   reentrant honeycombs are explored in detail. It is shown that owing to
   the variation of cell micro-structure, reentrant honeycombs display
   different macro-/micro- deformation properties during the crushing. For
   the given impact velocity, the dynamic plateau stresses are related to
   the shape ratio by a power law and to the cell-wall angle by
   least-square curves. And they are also proportional to the square of
   impact velocities for a high impact velocity. Based on the finite
   element simulated results and one-dimensional shock wave theory, an
   empirical formula for auxetic honeycomb to predict the dynamic plateau
   stress is derived in terms of relative density and impact velocity.}},

Abstract = {{The phase stability, electronic structure, elastic and metallic
   properties of manganese nitrides (Mn4N, Mn2N0.86, Mn3N2, and MnN) were
   extensively studied by first principles calculations. The negative
   values of cohesive energy and formation enthalpy show that these
   compounds are thermodynamically stable. The bonding of Manganese
   nitrides is the combinations of covalent and metallic bonds. In
   addition, a strong hybridization exists nearby the Fermi level, being
   characteristic of N-p and Mn-d states. The elastic properties of these
   nitrides (Mn4N, Mn2N0.86, and MnN) were calculated, which included bulk
   modulus, shear modulus, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, and hardness.
   The calculated results reveal that Mn2N0.86 and MnN are ductile while
   Mn4N is brittle, and the hardness values of these nitrides are 24.35
   GPa, 12.01 GPa, and 17.06 GPa, respectively. The MnN compound has the
   highest Debye temperature (632.1 K), while Mn2N0.86 has the lowest Debye
   temperature (390.5 K). The anisotropy of Young's modulus for Mn4N and
   MnN compounds is more prominent than Mn2N0.86 at the three crystalline
   planes. Moreover, the compound of Mn3N2 has an unstable structure in
   mechanical stability.}},

Abstract = {{The strategic replacement of the stiff core with compliant cellular
   materials in regions of a composite sandwich panel has the potential to
   integrate a shock absorbing functionality into an otherwise rigid
   structure. This work describes the development and preliminary analysis
   of 3D printed thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) energy absorbing cellular
   architectures.
   A parametric study was undertaken to assess the compressive behaviour
   and energy absorbing characteristics of potential cellular inclusions
   with both hexagonal and multi re-entrant, auxetic topologies. In our
   study, we investigate the effect of varying the size and internal angles
   of unit cells on the compressive response of the global arrays, up to
   strains of 75\%.
   Samples are loaded globally and locally in compression with flat plates
   and cylindrical indenters, respectively; the cell collapse behaviour for
   both cases are captured. The energy absorbing capability of the
   macroscopic cellular structures was analysed through the generation of a
   series of energy absorption diagrams derived directly from the
   stress-strain curves obtained.
   In our study, it was found that by varying the loading conditions on the
   3D printed polyurethane cellular arrays, the cell buckling modes could
   be controlled, with the promotion of different collapse behaviour
   leading to unique energy absorption profiles, at large elastic strains.
   This study has shown the potential for novel 3D printed architectures
   for energy absorption. The ongoing effective characterisation of
   material and structure will ultimately facilitate in the design of
   recoverable, hyperelastic cellular structures with energy absorption
   profiles tailored to specific impact events.}},

Abstract = {{Natural fibre composites e.g. wood can display enormous ductility. This
   ductility is achieved through judicious placement of fibril orientations
   in the cell walls of plants and also through combination with other
   polymers (other than cellulose). The primary cell wall of plants is
   typically a random fibrous network. This talk will discuss the
   interesting enhanced ductility effects that can be obtained from random
   nanofibrous networks. It will be shown that it might be possible to
   obtain double curvature using auxetic effects. In addition to this some
   recent work on nucleating crazing in amorphous polymers using cellulose
   nanofibers will be reviewed. The crazing effect is shown to enormously
   enhance ductility leading to pronounced air scattering and stress
   whitening of the polymer.}},

Abstract = {{Cellular honeycombs have been widely used for a variety of engineering
   applications, from advanced aircraft design, to modern wind turbines
   where there is need for lightweight structures with high stiffness and
   strength. Functionally graded cellular structures are characterized by a
   gradual variation of cell size, shape and wall thickness over a
   prescribed volume. The gradient topology leads to a continuous
   distribution of curvatures, stiffness and energy absorption capability.
   In this work we present a numerical methodology for design of gradient
   auxetic cellular structures with a wide range of different negative
   Poisson's ratios. The proposed methodology is based on a combination of
   finite element method and a genetic algorithm. The problem is formulated
   as an optimization problem of finding cell size, shape and wall
   thickness of cellular structures with prescribed behavioral
   requirements. Different cellular structures are generated and evolved
   using the genetic algorithm and the behavior of each cellular structure
   is analyzed using the finite element method to evaluate its fitness in
   competition with other generated structures. Numerical examples show
   that it is possible to design a large number of new auxetic materials,
   each with a different value of negative Poisson's ratio. The proposed
   methodology can be used as an effective method to tailor new materials
   with prescribed values of negative (or positive) Poisson's ratio. The
   methodology can also be used to optimize other material properties.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a multiscale analysis for the negative
   through-the-thickness Poisson's ratio of angle-ply CFRP laminates in the
   viscoplastic region is performed. First, an angle-ply CFRP laminate with
   the {[}+/-theta] laminate configuration is fully modeled as
   heterogeneous materials composed of fibers and a matrix. A multiscale
   elastic-viscoplastic analysis method for the laminate is then proposed
   based on the homogenization theory for nonlinear time-dependent
   composites with point-symmetric internal structures. The substructure
   method is used to enhance computational efficiency. The method proposed
   is then applied for the analysis of the elastic-viscoplastic Poisson's
   ratios of angle-ply carbon fiber/epoxy laminates subjected to
   macroscopic uniaxial tension. The analysis results obtained are used to
   demonstrate the negativity of through-the-thickness Poisson's ratios in
   the viscoplastic region and their variation with the degree of

Abstract = {{Auxetic means that the material or structure possesses negative
   Poisson's ratio. Auxetic materials own many fascinating properties due
   to the negative Poisson's ratio character, such as increased shear
   modulus, indentation resistance, fracture toughness, energy absorption,
   porosity/permeability variation with strain, synclastic curvature and so
   on. Recent years, 3D non-random auxetic cellular structures have
   attracted considerable interest and become a focus of auxetic material
   research. Though, due to the complexity of their configuration, to our
   knowledge, most 3D ordered auxetic cellular structures can only be
   manufactured by additive manufacturing method. However, additive
   manufacturing method will introduce some defects to the structures such
   as rough surface, irregular cross sections, and defects caused by stair
   stepping effect. Additionally, mass production and cost are also
   problems for additive manufacturing method, and the materials can be
   used are also limited by the additive manufacturing equipment.
   In this paper, a novel manufacturing method of one type of 3D auxetic
   structure will be briefly introduced. For this method, the structure was
   divided into 2D parts which can be easily manufactured by traditional
   fabricating methods with high-accuracy. The present manufacturing method
   will overcome the shortcomings introduced by additive manufacturing
   methods; in other words, the quality of the structures will be improved
   compared with additive manufacturing methods. At the same time, it will
   expand the range of materials that can be used to manufacture 3D auxetic
   structures. Additionally, this manufacturing method has the potential
   for mass production and automatic manufacturing while keeps the
   manufacturing costs at low level. Also, numerical simulation was
   conducted to simulate the structure's Poisson's ratio, and the negative
   Poisson's ratio character was successfully demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{Materials with a negative Poisson's ratio known also as auxetic
   materials {[}1] exhibit unusual property of getting thicker when
   stretched and thinner when compressed. The helical auxetic yarn (HAY) is
   a recently invented auxetic reinforcing structure for composites {[}2].
   A helical auxetic yarn (HAY) consists of two fibres: a low modulus
   elastomeric core and a high modulus wrap fibre in a double helix
   structure. When a tensile load is applied the core of the HAY becomes
   wider as the wrap straightens out, resulting in a lateral expansion of
   the core, and therefore a large negative Poisson' ratio behaviour. The
   auxetic behaviour of the HAY can be tailored by altering fibre
   properties, the initial geometry and also the applied strain to comply
   with specific applications, such as composites {[}3, 4], blast
   mitigation, and filtration {[}5]. This paper introduces a further
   development to the current HAY by addition of a third component (a
   sheath). The presence of the sheath is expected to overcome problems
   such as slippage of the wrap and inconsistency in the initial wrap angle
   previously encountered during the manufacture of the HAY. The auxetic
   performance of conventional and novel systems is investigated and
   Poisson's ratio data are presented.}},

Abstract = {{Background: polypharmacy is an important risk factor for falls, but
   recent studies suggest only when including medications associated with
   increasing the risk of falls.
   Design: a prospective, population-based cohort study.
   Subjects: 6,666 adults aged a parts per thousand yen50 years from The
   Irish Longitudinal study on Ageing.
   Methods: participants reported regular medication use at baseline. Any
   subsequent falls, any injurious falls and the number of falls were
   reported 2 years later. The association between polypharmacy (> 4
   medications) or fall risk-increasing medications and subsequent falls or
   injurious falls was assessed using modified Poisson regression. The
   association with the number of falls was assessed using negative
   binomial regression.
   Results: during follow-up, 231 falls per 1,000 person-years were
   reported. Polypharmacy including antidepressants was associated with a
   greater risk of any fall (adjusted relative risk (aRR) 1.28, 95\% CI
   1.06-1.54), of injurious falls (aRR 1.51, 95\% CI 1.10-2.07) and a
   greater number of falls (adjusted incident rate ratio (aIRR) 1.60, 95\%
   CI 1.19-2.15), but antidepressant use without polypharmacy and
   polypharmacy without antidepressants were not. The use of
   benzodiazepines was associated with injurious falls when coupled with
   polypharmacy (aRR 1.40, 95\% CI 1.04-1.87), but was associated with a
   greater number of falls (aIRR 1.32, 95\% CI 1.05-1.65), independent of
   polypharmacy. Other medications assessed, including antihypertensives,
   diuretics and antipsychotics, were not associated with outcomes.
   Conclusion: in middle-aged and older adults, polypharmacy, including
   antidepressant or benzodiazepine use, was associated with injurious
   falls and a greater number of falls.}},

Title = {{Increasing the value of health research in the WHO African Region beyond
   2015-reflecting on the past, celebrating the present and building the
   future: a bibliometric analysis}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To assess the profile and determinants of health research
   productivity in Africa since the onset of the new millennium.
   Design: Bibliometric analysis.
   Data collection and synthesis: In November 2014, we searched PubMed for
   articles published between 2000 and 2014 from the WHO African Region,
   and obtained country-level indicators from World Bank data. We used
   Poisson regression to examine time trends in research publications and
   negative binomial regression to explore determinants of research
   publications.
   Results: We identified 107 662 publications, with a median of 727 per
   country (range 25-31 757). Three countries (South Africa, Nigeria and
   Kenya) contributed 52\% of the publications. The number of publications
   increased from 3623 in 2000 to 12 709 in 2014 (relative growth 251\%).
   Similarly, the per cent share of worldwide research publications per
   year increased from 0.7\% in 2000 to 1.3\% in 2014. The trend analysis
   was also significant to confirm a continuous increase in health research
   publications from Africa, with productivity increasing by 10.3\% per
   year (95\% CIs +10.1\% to +10.5\%). The only independent predictor of
   publication outputs was national gross domestic product. For every one
   log US\$ billion increase in gross domestic product, research
   publications rose by 105\%: incidence rate ratio (IRR=2.05, 95\% CI 1.39
   to 3.04). The association of private health expenditure with
   publications was only marginally significant (IRR=1.86, 95\% CI 1.00 to
   3.47).
   Conclusions: There has been a significant improvement in health research
   in the WHO African Region since 2000, with some individual countries
   already having strong research profiles. Countries of the region should
   implement the WHO Strategy on Research for Health: reinforcing the
   research culture (organisation); focusing research on key health
   challenges (priorities); strengthening national health research systems
   (capacity); encouraging good research practice (standards); and
   consolidating linkages between health research and action (translation).}},

Abstract = {{This study examined Papanicolaou (Pap) test utilization, Pap test
   results, and cervical cancer incidence among First Nations (FN) women
   living in Manitoba, Canada taking into account age group, time period,
   and area of residence. Six population-based data sources were linked at
   an individual level. Negative binomial regression was used to compare
   Pap test utilization and results between FN and all other Manitoba (AOM)
   women. Poisson regression was used to compare cervical cancer incidence.
   Among women younger than 25 years, FN were more likely than AOM women to
   have had a Pap test {[}rate ratio (RR) = 1.37, 95\% confidence intervals
   (CI), 1.22-1.53, 18-19 year olds; RR = 1.17, 95\% CI, 1.05-1.31, 20-24
   year olds]. There was no difference in Pap test use for women 25 to 29
   or 30 to 39 years. FN 40 years and older were less likely to have a Pap
   test than AOM women (RR = 0.84, 95\% CI, 0.75-0.93, 40-49 years old; RR
   = 0.71, 95\% CI, 0.63-0.79, 50-59 years old; RR = 0.59, 95\% CI,

   a high (RR = 1.88, 95\% CI, 1.65-2.13) or low-grade Pap test result (RR
   = 1.60, 95\% CI, 1.48-1.73). The invasive cervical cancer incidence rate
   was double for FN women 25 to 39 years of age (21.9 per 100,000, FN;
   10.2 per 100,000, AOM, P = 0.006) and 40 to 69 years of age (24.3 per

   cancer screening among FN women over 40 years of age must be increased
   to address the higher cervical cancer incidence. (C) 2014 AACR.}},

Abstract = {{We use ab initio density functional theory (DFT) to elucidate the

   framework (ZIF) materials: ZIF-4 and ZIF-zni, both of which have the
   same chemical composition of Zn(Im)(2) {[}Im = C3H3N2-] and are
   constructed from an identical Zn-Im-Zn basic building block. The CRYSTAL
   code was used to compute the single-crystal elastic constants C-ij of
   the (orthorhombic) ZIF-4 and (tetragonal) ZIF-zni structures at the PBE
   level of theory. Through tensorial analysis of the C-ij, we reveal the
   three-dimensional representation surfaces of the Young's modulus, shear
   modulus, Poisson's ratio and linear compressibility, which enable us to
   describe the detailed elasticity behaviour and to pinpoint basic crystal
   structure-property correlations. Notably, we discover that ZIF-4 can
   potentially exhibit a negative Poisson's ratio, thereby representing the
   first example of an `auxetic-ZIF' to be identified to date. Furthermore,
   we show that our DFT predictions are consistent with recently reported
   experimental measurements of the Young's and bulk moduli of such complex
   ZIF structures.}},

Abstract = {{Stroke risk has been shown to display varying patterns of geographic
   distribution amongst countries but also between regions of the same
   country. Traditionally a disease of older persons, a global 25\%
   increase in incidence instead was noticed between 1990 and 2010 in
   persons aged 20-<= 64 years, particularly in low-and medium-income
   countries. Understanding spatial disparities in the association between
   socioeconomic factors and stroke is critical to target public health
   initiatives aiming to mitigate or prevent this disease, including in
   younger persons. We aimed to identify socioeconomic determinants of
   geographic disparities of stroke risk in people 65 years old, in
   municipalities of mainland Portugal, and the spatiotemporal variation of
   the association between these determinants and stroke risk during two
   study periods (1992-1996 and 2002-2006). Poisson and negative binomial
   global regression models were used to explore determinants of disease
   risk. Geographically weighted regression (GWR) represents a distinctive
   approach, allowing estimation of local regression coefficients. Models
   for both study periods were identified. Significant variables included
   education attainment, work hours per week and unemployment. Local
   Poisson GWR models achieved the best fit and evidenced spatially varying
   regression coefficients. Spatiotemporal inequalities were observed in
   significant variables, with dissimilarities between men and women. This
   study contributes to a better understanding of the relationship between
   stroke and socioeconomic factors in the population <65 years of age, one
   age group seldom analysed separately. It can thus help to improve the
   targeting of public health initiatives, even more in a context of
   economic crisis.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Under-five mortality is decreasing but with little change in
   neonatal mortality rates. We examined the effect of maternal HIV status
   on under-five mortality and cause of death since widespread availability
   of antiretroviral therapy in rural Malawi.
   Methods: Children born in 2006-2011 in the Karonga demographic
   surveillance area were included. Maternal HIV status was available from
   HIV serosurveys. Age-specific mortality rate ratios for children born to
   HIV-positive and HIV-negative mothers were obtained by fitting a Poisson
   model accounting for child clustering by mother and adjusting for
   potential confounders. Cause of death was ascertained by verbal autopsy.
   Findings: There were 352 deaths among 6913 under-five singleton children
   followed for 20,754 person-years (py), giving a mortality rate of
   17.0/1000 py overall, 218/1000 py (16.5/1000 live births) in neonates,
   20/1000 py (17.4/1000 live births) in postneonatal infants, and 8/1000
   py in 1-4 years old. Comparing those born to HIV-positive and
   HIV-negative mothers, the rate ratio adjusted for child age, sex,
   maternal age, parity, and drinking water source was 1.5 (95\% confidence
   interval {[}CI]: 0.6 to 3.7) in neonates, 11.5 (95\% CI: 7.2 to 18.5) in
   postneonatal infants, and 4.6 (95\% CI: 2.7 to 7.9) in 1-4 years old.
   Birth injury/asphyxia, neonatal sepsis, and prematurity contributed
   >70\% of neonatal deaths, whereas acute infections, malaria, diarrhea,
   and pneumonia accounted for most deaths in older children.
   Conclusions: Maternal HIV status had little effect on neonatal mortality
   but was associated with much higher mortality in the postneonatal period
   and among older children. Greater attention to HIV care in pregnant
   women and mothers should help improve child survival, but broader
   interventions are needed to reduce neonatal mortality.}},

Abstract = {{We have investigated the geometry, electronic structure and mechanical
   properties of halogenated silicene XSi (X = F, Cl, Br and I) in various
   conformers from first principles systematically. The energetics,
   structure, band structure, elastic constants and the corresponding
   modulus are given in detail. Our results indicate that halogenated
   silicene shows enhanced stability compared with silicene and presents a
   moderate and tunable direct gap with small carrier effective mass. The
   element- and conformer-dependence of the energy gap can be understood
   well by the variance of buckling and a bond energy perturbation theory
   based on orbital hybridization. Moreover, the direction-dependent
   mechanical properties are also calculated and discussed. Interestingly,
   a negative Poisson ratio is predicted in fluorinated silicene with boat2
   structure. The enhanced stability, moderate energy gap, small carrier
   effective masses and improved mechanical properties predicted here make
   halogenated silicene a promising candidate for future electronic
   devices.}},

   765-792 2008). In the hyperbolic scaling, a nontrivial average velocity
   can be observed even if the external forcing vanishes in average. More
   surprisingly, an average velocity in the direction opposite to the
   forcing may develop at the linear response level-a phenomenon called
   negative mobility. The diffusive limit of the non-equilibrium Langevin
   dynamics is also studied using the general methodology of central limit
   theorems for additive functionals of Markov processes. To apply this
   methodology, which is based on the study of appropriate Poisson
   equations, we extend recent results on pointwise estimates of the
   resolvent of the generator associated with the Langevin dynamics. Our
   theoretical results are illustrated by numerical simulations of a

   the importance of cross-pucker interactions for a negative Poisson's
   ratio and edge stress-induced bending}},
Journal = {{NANOSCALE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{7}},

Pages = {{6059-6068}},
Abstract = {{The distinguishing structural feature of single-layered black phosphorus
   is its puckered structure, which leads to many novel physical
   properties. In this work, we first present a new parameterization of the
   Stillinger-Weber potential for single-layered black phosphorus. In doing
   so, we reveal the importance of a cross-pucker interaction term in
   capturing its unique mechanical properties, such as a negative Poisson's
   ratio. In particular, we show that the cross-pucker interaction enables
   the pucker to act as a re-entrant hinge, which expands in the lateral
   direction when it is stretched in the longitudinal direction. As a
   consequence, single-layered black phosphorus has a negative Poisson's
   ratio in the direction perpendicular to the atomic plane. As an
   additional demonstration of the impact of the cross-pucker interaction,
   we show that it is also the key factor that enables capturing the edge
   stress-induced bending of single-layered black phosphorus that has been
   reported in ab initio calculations.}},

Abstract = {{Research activities in smart materials and structures represent a
   significant potential for technological innovation in mechanics and
   electronics. The necessity of controlling vibroacoustic behavior of
   industrial systems motivates a broad research effort for introducing
   active or passive technologies to control noise and vibrations. New
   processes are now available which allow active transducers and their
   driving electronics to be directly integrated into otherwise passive
   structures. This new approach could allow fine control of the material
   physical behavior for implementing new functional properties that do not
   exist in nature. In this sense, we can speak of ``'integrated
   distributed adaptive metacomposite{''}' that merges the notion of
   programmable materials with periodic structures and metamaterial. One of
   the main features associated to the periodic distribution of mechanical
   devices, the ability to design Bragg or resonant band gaps, is improved
   by using smart transducers and adaptive electronic circuits. Early
   developments of these technologies were based on analytical techniques;
   therefore many results are available for simple coupled systems (MDOF,
   beams, and plates). More recently, the combination of periodicity
   theories with the finite element method has allowed designers to handle
   complex geometries, smart materials and electronic components for
   optimizing waves diffusion in complex damped and coupled media. In this
   talk, after some reminders concerning historical aspects, the main
   methodologies for the design of periodic structures will be given,
   before showing two applications combining periodicity and smart
   structures (auxetic materials, semi-active and active strategies, waves
   in damped media) for vibroacoustic applications. All practical aspects
   will be discussed, from the numerical tools for design and optimization,
   to the practical implementation for experimental validation, together
   with robustness issues.}},

   triaxial servo-controlled seepage equipment for thermo-fluid-solid
   coupling of coal containing methane and selects cement as a binder. The
   triaxal compressive properties of cement bound coals with different
   binder ratios are compared with those of undisturbed coals. The
   characteristic values for the mechanical and permeability
   characteristics of the cement bound coals are evaluated quantitatively
   using Euclidean distance based similarity methods. The results show
   that: as binder ratios increase, the peak principal stress difference
   and the elastic modulus of the cement bound coal probably increase
   following a positive exponential function trend. Poisson's ratio
   decreases following a negative exponent function trend. As the binder
   ratio increases, the initial permeability and the minimum permeability
   of the cement bound coal have the decreasing trend of exponent function.
   The penetration rate of change is smaller and smaller. The
   permeability-axial strain curve is gentler. The mechanical and
   permeability characteristics of the cement bound coal with the cement
   binder ratio \# IV are the closest to those of undisturbed coal. This
   type of cement bound coal can be used as the similar material for
   simulating the undisturbed coal.}},

Abstract = {{As a main research object in underground engineering, rock has obvious
   rheological properties due to its material composition and complicated
   geological environment. Applying Burgers constitutive model (which is
   formed with a series of Kelvin model and Maxwell model) to particle flow
   code in three dimensions (PFC3D), this research analyzes the impact of
   different parameters (including elastic coefficients E-m and E-k,
   viscosity coefficients eta(m) and eta(k), and friction factor f) on the
   instantaneous and rheological properties. The controlling variable
   method is used. Conclusions can be drawn as follows. The instantaneous
   strength properties are mainly affected by Maxwell's elastic coefficient
   Em and friction factor f. The elastic modulus and uniaxial compression
   strength have positive correlation with E-m and f. However, Poisson's
   ratio is positively correlated with E-m and negatively correlated with
   f. Meanwhile negative correlations are observed among rheological
   properties and these parameters. Based on these conclusions, a staged
   increment loading creep experiment of red shale is simulated.
   Comparisons with results from laboratory experiments prove the
   feasibility of Burgers constitutive model in PFC3D for creep
   experiments. At the same time, this method is used in staged increment
   cyclic loading and unloading experiment and triaxial creep experiment.
   This research is also a new attempt to analyze creep properties of rock
   material with discrete element method.}},

Title = {{Do alternative methods for analysing count data produce similar
   estimates? Implications for meta-analyses}},
Journal = {{SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{4}},
Abstract = {{Background: Many randomised trials have count outcomes, such as the
   number of falls or the number of asthma exacerbations. These outcomes
   have been treated as counts, continuous outcomes or dichotomised and
   analysed using a variety of analytical methods. This study examines
   whether different methods of analysis yield estimates of intervention
   effect that are similar enough to be reasonably pooled in a
   meta-analysis.
   Methods: Data were simulated for 10,000 randomised trials under three
   different amounts of overdispersion, four different event rates and two
   effect sizes. Each simulated trial was analysed using nine different
   methods of analysis: rate ratio, Poisson regression, negative binomial
   regression, risk ratio from dichotomised data, survival to the first
   event, two methods of adjusting for multiple survival times, ratio of
   means and ratio of medians. Individual patient data was gathered from
   eight fall prevention trials, and similar analyses were undertaken.
   Results: All methods produced similar effect sizes when there was no
   difference between treatments. Results were similar when there was a
   moderate difference with two exceptions when the event became more
   common: (1) risk ratios computed from dichotomised count outcomes and
   hazard ratios from survival analysis of the time to the first event
   yielded intervention effects that differed from rate ratios estimated
   from the negative binomial model (reference model) and (2) the precision
   of the estimates differed depending on the method used, which may affect
   both the pooled intervention effect and the observed heterogeneity.
   The results of the case study of individual data from eight trials
   evaluating exercise programmes to prevent falls in older people
   supported the simulation study findings.
   Conclusions: Information about the differences in treatments is lost
   when event rates increase and the outcome is dichotomised or time to the
   first event is analysed otherwise similar results are obtained. Further
   research is needed to examine the effect of differing variances from the
   different methods on the confidence intervals of pooled estimates.}},

Abstract = {{The thermodynamic, elastic and electronic properties of AlSc2Si2 have
   been studied using first-principles calculations for the first time.
   Thermodynamically, AlSc2Si2 is more inclined to form than Al3Sc due to a
   more negative H-f value. In comparison with elastic properties of Al3Sc,
   AlSc2Si2 has the slightly higher values in elastic moduli, and the
   similar values in Poisson's ratio and B/G ratio. The biggest difference
   lies in the universal elastic anisotropy index (A(U)). Al3Sc has the
   small values of A(U) both theoretically and experimentally indicating
   its near isotropy, while AlSc2Si2 shows a much larger A(U) value of 0567
   indicating the considerable anisotropy. The calculated DOS spectra
   indicate that AlSc2Si2 has a metallic character. Further, the appearance
   of the pseudogap around the Fermi level in DOS should support the high
   stability of AlSc2Si2. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Cellular materials' two important properties-structure and mechanism-can
   be selectively used for materials design; in particular, they are used
   to determine the modulus and yield strain. The objective of this study
   is to gain a better understanding of these two properties and to explore
   the synthesis of compliant cellular materials (CCMs) with compliant
   porous structures (CPSs) generated from modified hexagonal honeycombs.
   An in-plane constitutive CCM model with CPSs of elliptical holes is
   constructed using the strain energy method, which uses the deformation
   of hinges around holes and the rotation of links. A finite element (FE)
   based simulation is conducted to validate the analytical model. The
   moduli and yield strains of the CCMs with an aluminum alloy are about
   4.42 GPa and 0.57\% in one direction and about 2.14 MPa and 20.9\% in
   the other direction. CCMs have extremely high positive and negative
   Poisson's ratios (NPRs) (nu(xy){*} similar to +/- 40) due to the large
   rotation of the link member in the transverse direction caused by an
   input displacement in the longitudinal direction. A parametric study of
   CCMs with varying flexure hinge geometries using different porous shapes
   shows that the hinge shape can control the yield strength and strain but
   does not affect Poisson's ratio which is mainly influenced by rotation
   of the link members. The synthesized CPSs can also be used to design a
   new CCM with a Poisson's ratio of zero using a puzzle-piece CPS
   assembly. This paper demonstrates that compliant mesostructures can be
   used for next generation materials design in tailoring mechanical
   properties such as moduli, strength, strain, and Poisson's ratios.}},

Abstract = {{Solids that possess negative Poisson's ratio are termed auxetic
   materials. This article considers the effect of auxeticity, i.e., the
   negative extent of Poisson's ratio on thermal stresses in plates,
   shells, and other solids. Results show that in cases where temperature
   gradient is in the through-thickness of a fully-clamped plate or when
   the temperature gradient is in the radial direction of fully-clamped
   shells, the thermal stresses can be significantly reduced by using
   auxetic materials. The same result applies to spheres and cylinders with
   radial temperature gradient. The maximum thermal stress is minimized if
   the selected material possesses Poisson's ratio of -1. However, the use
   of auxetic material is not always advantageous, nor does the use of
   materials with Poisson's ratio of -1 always minimize the maximum thermal
   stresses. It is herein suggested that, in addition to the use of
   materials with lower modulus and lower coefficient of thermal expansion,
   the use of auxetic materials offers an alternative route for lowering
   thermal stresses in some cases.}},

   shape of the plastic zone for auxetic material is the same with that of
   ordinary materials. However, its size is smaller due to the reduction in
   its Young's modulus from the solid material of which the auxetic
   material is made. Microscopically, an auxetic material has its plastic

Abstract = {{Objectives: We aim to describe rates and risk factors of Hepatitis C
   Virus (HCV) diagnoses, follow-up HCV testing and HCV seroconversion from
   2004-2011 in a cohort of HIV-positive persons in Spain.
   Methods: CoRIS is a multicentre, open and prospective cohort recruiting
   adult HIV-positive patients naive to antiretroviral therapy. We analysed
   patients with at least one negative and one follow-up HCV serology.
   Incidence Rates (IR) were calculated and multivariate Poisson regression
   was used to estimate adjusted Rates Ratios (aIRR).
   Results: Of 2112 subjects, 53 HCV diagnoses were observed, IR=0.93/100py
   (95\% CI: 0.7-1.2). IR increased from 0.88 in 2004-05 to 1.36 in 2010-11
   (aIRR=1.55; 95\% CI: 0.37-6.55). In men who have sex with men (MSM) from
   0.76 to 1.10 (aIRR=1.45; 95\% CI: 0.31-6.82); in heterosexual (HTX)
   subjects from 1.19 to 1.28 (aIRR=1.08; 95\% CI: 0.11-10.24). HCV
   seroconversion rates decreased from 1.77 to 0.65 (aIRR=0.37; 95\% CI:
   0.12-1.11); in MSM from 1.06 to 0.49 (aIRR=0.46; 95\% CI: 0.09-2.31); in
   HTX from 2.55 to 0.59 (aIRR=0.23; 95\% CI: 0.06-0.98). HCV infection
   risk was higher for injecting drug users (IDU) compared to HTX
   (aIRR=9.63; 95\% CI: 2.9-32.2); among MSM, for subjects aged 40-50
   compared to 30 or less (IRR=3.21; 95\% CI: 1.7-6.2); and among HTX, for
   female sex (aIRR=2.35; 95\% CI: 1.03-5.34) and <200 CD4-count
   (aIRR=2.39; 95\% CI: 0.83-6.89).
   Conclusion: We report increases in HCV diagnoses rates which seem
   secondary to intensification of HCV follow-up testing but not to rises
   in HCV infection rates. HCV IR is higher in IDU. In MSM, HCV IR
   increases with age. Among HTX, HCV IR is higher in women and in subjects
   with impaired immunological situation.}},

Abstract = {{Tunable electromagnetic band-gap structures for matching an intended
   band-gap range have more potential for various applications than
   ordinary electromagnetic band-gap structures with a fixed or
   non-linearly variable band-gap range. However, there has not been much
   progress on the study of the appropriate shape of the structure. To
   obtain a controllable and tunable electromagnetic bandgap, we propose a
   new design concept employing a unit-structure with a negative Poisson's
   ratio close to 1 to realize an approximately linear band-gap shift
   according to the variation of the shape of the structure. We used a
   structural optimization procedure based on the phase field method to
   obtain the design of the unit-structure. We investigated the relation
   between the auxetic unit-structure deformation and the change in the
   band-gap range through numerical simulations and also evaluated the
   possibility to realize the design experimentally in the radio frequency
   range. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Title = {{FLUCTUATION SPECTROSCOPY: A NEW PROBE OF OLD STELLAR POPULATIONS}},
Journal = {{ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{797}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{We introduce a new method to determine the relative contributions of
   different types of stars to the integrated light of nearby early-type
   galaxies. As is well known, the surface brightness of these galaxies
   shows pixel-to-pixel fluctuations due to Poisson variations in the
   number of giant stars. Differential spectroscopy of pixels as a function
   of fluctuation strength ({''}fluctuation spectroscopy{''}) effectively
   measures the spectral variation of stars as a function of their
   luminosity, information that is otherwise difficult to obtain for
   individual stars outside of the Local Group. We apply this technique to
   the elliptical galaxy NGC 4472, using Hubble Space Telescope/Advanced
   Camera for Surveys imaging in six narrow-band ramp filters tuned to
   spectral features in the range 0.8 mu m-1.0 mu m. Pixels with +/- 5\%
   broad-band variations show differential color variations of 0.1\%-1.0\%
   in the narrow-band filters. These variations are primarily due to the
   systematic increase in TiO absorption strength with increasing
   luminosity on the upper giant branch. The data are very well reproduced
   by the same Conroy \& van Dokkum stellar population synthesis model that
   is the best fit to the integrated light, with residuals in the range
   0.03\%-0.09\%. Models with ages or metallicities that are significantly
   different from the integrated-light values do not yield good fits. We
   can also rule out several modifications to the underlying model,
   including the presence of a significant (>3\% of the light) population
   of late M giants. The current observations constitute a powerful test of
   the expected luminosities and temperatures of metal-rich giants in
   massive early-type galaxies. Studies of pixels with much larger
   (negative) fluctuations will provide unique information on main sequence
   stars and the stellar initial mass function.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we propose various types of two-dimensional (2D) square
   zigzag lattice structures, and we study their bandgaps and directional
   propagation of elastic waves. The band structures and the transmission
   spectra of the systems are calculated by using the finite element
   method. The effects of the geometry parameters of the 2D-zigzag lattices
   on the bandgaps are investigated and discussed. The mechanism of the
   bandgap generation is analyzed by studying the vibration modes at the
   bandgap edges. Multiple wide complete bandgaps are found in a wide
   porosity range owing to the separation of the degeneracy by introducing
   bending arms. The bandgaps are sensitive to the geometry parameters of
   the systems. The deformed displacement fields of the transient response
   of finite structures subjected to time-harmonic loads are presented to
   show the directional wave propagation. The research in this paper is
   relevant to the practical design of cellular structures with enhanced
   vibro-acoustics performance.}},

Abstract = {{We theoretically investigated the variable mechanical properties such as
   Young's modulus, Poisson's ratios and compressibility in super-hard
   materials. Our tensorial analysis reveals that the mechanical properties
   of super-hard materials are strongly sensitive to the anisotropy index
   of materials. In sharp contrast to the traditional positive constant as
   thought before, the Poisson's ratio of super-hard materials could be
   unexpectedly negative, zero, or even positive with a value much larger
   than the isotropic upper limit of 0.5 along definite directions. Our
   results uncover a correlation between compressibility and hardness,
   which offer insights on the prediction of new super-hard materials. (C)

Abstract = {{In this paper we propose four kinds of two-dimensional square beam-like
   zigzag lattice structures and study their bandgaps and directional
   propagation of elastic waves. The band structures are calculated by
   using the finite element method. Both the in-plane and out-of-plane
   waves are investigated simultaneously via the three-dimensional Euler
   beam elements. The mechanism of the bandgap generation is analyzed by
   studying the vibration modes at the bandgap edges. The effects of the
   geometry parameters of the xy-and z-zigzag lattices on the bandgaps are
   investigated and discussed. Multiple complete bandgaps are found owing
   to the separation of the degeneracy by introducing bending arms. The
   bandgaps are sensitive to the geometry parameters of the periodic
   systems. The deformed displacement fields of the harmonic responses of a
   finite lattice structure subjected to harmonic loads at different
   positions are illustrated to show the directional wave propagation. An
   extension of the proposed concept to the hexagonal lattices is also
   presented. The research work in this paper is relevant to the practical
   design of cellular structures with enhanced vibro-acoustics performance.

Abstract = {{The crustal thickness (H) and Poisson's ratio (v) are important for
   understanding the plate motion and the interior earth structure. We
   collected teleseismic receiver functions of earthquakes, which occurred
   from 2001 to 2008, from 75 permanent seismic stations of Guangdong and
   Fujian networks. In total 74 estimations of H and v were obtained by
   making use of the H-kappa method. Combining with characteristics of the
   fault distribution, seismicity and topography, several conclusions were
   achieved below. (1) Crustal thickness ranges from 26 to 32 km, reducing
   from land to sea and from north to south. Poisson' s ratio is 0. 23
   similar to 0. 28, increasing from land to sea. Variations of H and v
   have positive and negative correlations with surface topography,
   respectively. (2) Fault activity correspond to the block-like and
   band-shaped distributions of H and v. Transitional variation zones of H
   and v spread in accordance with seismicity. Earthquake clusters and
   mantle upwelling are generally corresponding to the rapid increasing of
   v. (3) Crustal rocks in this area manly consist of intermediate and
   acidic minerals. Crustal thicknesses are positively and negatively
   related to Poisson's ratio under actions of extensional tectonics
   offshores and thrusting structure in folded regions, respectively,
   revealing the diversified evolution models in different eras and
   districts.}},

Abstract = {{Recent research has established the effectiveness of sandwich structures
   with metallic cellular cores for blast mitigation. The choice of core
   architecture can enhance sandwich performance, dissipating energy
   through plastic core compression and exploiting fluid-structure
   interaction effects to reduce the momentum imparted to the structure by
   the blast. In this paper we describe the first analysis of a novel
   sandwich core concept for blast mitigation: the stacked folded core. The
   core consists of an alternating stacked sequence of folded sheets in the
   Miura (double-corrugated) pattern, with the stack oriented such that the
   folding kinematics define the out-of plane compressive strength of the
   core. It offers a number of distinct characteristics compared to
   existing cellular cores. (i) The kinematics of collapse of the core by a
   distinctive folding mechanism give it unique mechanical properties,
   including strong anisotropy. (ii) The fold pattern and stacking
   arrangement is extremely versatile, offering exceptional freedom to
   tailor the mechanical properties of the core. This includes freedom to
   grade the core properties through progressive changes in the fold
   pattern. (iii) Continuous manufacturing processes have been established
   for the Miura folded sheets which make up the core. The design is
   therefore potentially more straightforward and economical to manufacture
   than other metallic cellular materials. In this first investigation of
   the stacked folded core, finite element analysis is used to investigate
   its characteristics under both quasi-static and dynamic loading. A
   dynamic analysis of an impulsively loaded sandwich beam with a stacked
   folded core reveals the versatility of the concept for blast mitigation.
   By altering the fold pattern alone, the durations of key phases of the
   dynamic sandwich response (core compression, beam bending) can be
   controlled. By altering both fold pattern and sheet thickness in the
   core, the same is achieved without altering the density of the core or
   the mass distribution of the sandwich beam. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Mediastinitis after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) gives a
   longstanding chronic inflammation and has a detrimental negative effect
   on long-term survival. For this reason, we aimed to study the effect of
   mediastinitis on graft patency after CABG. The epidemiologic design was
   of an exposed (mediastinitis, n = 41) versus non-exposed
   (non-mediastinitis, controls, n = 41) cohort with two endpoints: (i)
   obstruction of saphenous vein grafts (SVG) and (ii) obstruction of the
   internal mammary artery (IMA) grafts. The graft patency was evaluated
   with coronary CT-angiography examination at a median follow-up of 27
   years. The number of occluded SVG in the mediastinitis group was 189\%
   versus 155\% in the control group. Using generalized estimating
   equations model with exchangeable matrix, and confounding effect of
   ischaemic time and patients age, we found no significant association
   between presence of mediastinitis and SVG obstruction {[}rate ratio (RR)
   = 096, 95\% CI (052-267), P = 0697]. The number of occluded IMA grafts
   was 105\% in the mediastinitis group and 24\% in the control group.
   Using the Poisson regression model, we estimated RR = 548, 95\% CI
   (143-210) and P = 0013. There was a significant association between
   mediastinitis and IMA graft obstruction, when controlling for the
   confounding effect of ischaemic time, body mass index, presence of
   diabetes mellitus and the number of diseased vessels. Presence of
   mediastinitis increases the risk of IMA graft obstruction. This may
   confirm the importance of inflammation as a major contributor to the
   pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and explain the negative effect of
   mediastinitis on a long-term survival.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundGender appears to play a role in incidence and disease course
   of multiple sclerosis (MS).
   ObjectiveThe objective was to determine whether male and female patients
   with MS respond differently to interferon-beta treatment in terms of
   reduction in relapse rates.
   MethodsWe included all 2033 patients with relapsing-remitting MS who
   started treatment with interferon-beta from 1996 to 2003, identified
   from the Danish Multiple Sclerosis Treatment Register. We defined
   neutralizing antibody (NAb)-positive and NAb-negative periods in the
   single patient by the results of the NAb tests. Patients served as their
   own controls, and relapse rates were compared between NAb-negative and
   NAb-positive periods.
   ResultsNAbs significantly abrogated the interferon-beta treatment
   efficacy in both genders. The all-over women:men relapse rate ratio
   irrespective of NAb status was 1.47 (95\%CI; 1.28-1.68). In a
   generalized linear Poisson models analysis with relapse counts as
   response variable, the main effects NAbs, sex, age at treatment start
   and number of relapses in 2years before treatment start were strongly
   significant, but the effect of NAbs on relapse rates did not differ
   significantly between men and women.
   ConclusionAs NAbs influenced the on-treatment relapse rates strongly in
   both sexes but without statistical significant difference, there is no
   indication of different effects of interferon-beta in men or women.}},

Abstract = {{The thermal properties for the multi-re-entrant honeycomb are

   index was specified to characterize a good heat exchange medium that can
   transfer more heat at the expense of lower pressure loss. Numerical
   results reveal better thermal performances of multi-re-entrant
   honeycombs over hexagon and re-entrant topologies, attributed to the
   presence of added base walls. Auxetic effect introduced in
   multi-re-entrant honeycomb generally provides enhanced out-of-plane
   thermal conductivity and increased total heat transfer efficiency due to

Title = {{Association of Opioid Agonist Therapy With Lower Incidence of Hepatitis
   C Virus Infection in Young Adult Injection Drug Users}},

Abstract = {{IMPORTANCE Injection drug use is the primary mode of transmission for
   hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Prior studies suggest opioid agonist
   therapymay reduce the incidence of HCV infection among injection drug
   users; however, little is known about the effects of this therapy in
   younger users.
   OBJECTIVE To evaluate whether opioid agonist therapy was associated with
   a lower incidence of HCV infection in a cohort of young adult injection
   drug users.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Observational cohort study conducted
   from January 3, 2000, through August 21, 2013, with quarterly interviews
   and blood sampling. We recruited young adult (younger than 30 years)
   injection drug users who were negative for anti-HCV antibody and/or HCV
   RNA.
   EXPOSURES Substance use treatment within the past 3 months, including
   non-opioid agonist forms of treatment, opioid agonist (methadone
   hydrochloride or buprenorphine hydrochloride) detoxification or
   maintenance therapy, or no treatment.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Incident HCV infection documented with a new
   positive result for HCV RNA and/or HCV antibodies. Cumulative incidence
   rates (95\% CI) of HCV infection were calculated assuming a Poisson
   distribution. Cox proportional hazards regression models were fit
   adjusting for age, sex, race, years of injection drug use, homelessness,
   and incarceration.
   RESULTS Baseline characteristics of the sample (n = 552) included median
   age of 23 (interquartile range, 20-26) years; 31.9\% female; 73.1\%
   white; 39.7\% who did not graduate from high school; and 69.2\% who were
   homeless. During the observation period of 680 person-years, 171
   incident cases of HCV infection occurred (incidence rate, 25.1 {[}95\%
   CI, 21.6-29.2] per 100 person-years). The rate ratio was significantly
   lower for participants who reported recent maintenance opioid agonist
   therapy (0.31 {[}95\% CI, 0.14-0.65]; P = .001) but not for those who
   reported recent non-opioid agonist forms of treatment (0.63 {[}95\% CI,
   0.37-1.08]; P = .09) or opioid agonist detoxification (1.45 {[}95\% CI,
   0.80-2.69]; P = .23). After adjustment for other covariates, maintenance
   opioid agonist therapy was associated with lower relative hazards for
   acquiring HCV infection over time (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.39 {[}95\%
   CI, 0.18-0.87]; P = .02).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this cohort of young adult injection drug
   users, recent maintenance opioid agonist therapy was associated with a
   lower incidence of HCV infection. Maintenance treatment with methadone
   or buprenorphine for opioid use disorders may be an important strategy
   to prevent the spread of HCV infection among young injection drug users.}},

Abstract = {{Negative through-the-thickness Poisson's ratios are investigated
   macroscopically and microscopically in the elastic-viscoplastic behavior
   of angle-ply carbon fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP) laminates. For this
   purpose, an analysis method is proposed based on a homogenization theory
   for nonlinear time-dependent composites with point-symmetric internal
   structures. This method is able to efficiently analyze both the
   macroscopic and microscopic elastic-viscoplastic properties of angle-ply
   CFRP laminates fully modeled with microstructures consisting of fibers
   and a matrix. Using the proposed method, the elastic-viscoplastic
   analysis of angle-ply carbon fiber/epoxy laminates with various laminate
   configurations is performed to investigate their Poisson's ratios in the
   viscoplastic region. It is revealed that, for a range of laminate
   configurations, the through-the-thickness Poisson's ratios exhibit
   negative values which become increasingly negative as the viscoplastic
   deformation progresses in the laminates. The effect of strain rate on
   this increasing negativity is also demonstrated, and microscopic
   mechanisms are investigated to explain this trend. It is further shown
   that the increasing negativity significantly affects microscopic
   interlaminar stress distributions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{To assess trends in HIV-1 incidence and risk factors for seroconversion
   among men who have sex with men (MSM) resident in Rome, Italy, a
   retrospective longitudinal cohort study was conducted over 25 years.
   Incidence rates and trends were modelled using Poisson regression and
   risk factors were assessed by multivariate Cox models. Of 1,862
   HIV-1-negative individuals, 347 seroconverted during follow-up. HIV-1
   incidence rates increased from 5.2/100 persons/year (p/y) in 1986 (95\%
   confidence interval (CI): 2.3-11.5) to 9.2/00 p/y in 1992 (95\% CI:
   6.4-13.0), decreased to 1.3/100 p/y in 2001 and increased until 2009
   (11.7/100 p/y; 95\% CI: 7.4-18.6). The risk of HIV-1 seroconversion
   increased during the study period in younger MSM (incidence rate ratio
   (IRR) = 17.18; 95\% CI: 9.74-30.32 in 16-32 year-olds and IRR = 5.09;
   95\% CI: 2.92-8.87 in 33-41 year-olds) and in those who acquired
   syphilis (IRR = 7.71; 95\% CI: 5.00-11.88). In contrast, the risk of
   seroconversion decreased among highly educated MSM (IRR = 0.54; 95\% CI:
   0.35-0.82) and those without Italian citizenship (IRR = 0.45; 95\% CI:
   0.28-0.71). The HIV epidemic in MSM living in Rome continues to expand.

   of the Zr-based bulk metallic glasses (BMGs), the tilt-cast and

   studied. The results revealed that the tilt-cast specimens present much
   better fracture toughness than the suction-cast counterparts as a result
   of their lower degrees of residual porosity. In addition, the
   microalloying of Si to 0.75 at.\% in these BMGs would impose negative
   effects on their fracture toughness. The highest fracture toughness of
   120 MPa root m was achieved for the tilt-cast Zr53Cu30Ni9Al8. Moreover,
   the morphology of fracture surface, the calculated fracture energy, and
   the Poisson's ratio show the similar trend to prove that the tilt-cast

Number = {{45}},
Month = {{NOV 14}},
Abstract = {{The mechanical and electronic properties of both the monolayer and
   bilayer phosphorenes under either isotropic or uniaxial strain have been
   systematically investigated using first-principles calculations. It is
   interesting to find that: 1) Under a large enough isotropic tensile
   strain, the monolayer phosphorene would lose its pucker structure and
   transform into a flat hexagonal plane, while two inner sublayers of the
   bilayer phosphorene could be bonded due to its interlayer distance
   contraction. 2) Under the uniaxial tensile strain along a zigzag
   direction, the pucker distance of each layer in the bilayer phosphorene
   can exhibit a specific negative Poisson's ratio. 3) The electronic
   properties of both the monolayer and bilayer phosphorenes are sensitive
   to the magnitude and direction of the applied strains. Their band gaps
   decrease more rapidly under isotropic compressive strain than under
   uniaxial strain. Also, their direct-indirect band gap transitions happen
   at the larger isotropic tensile strains compared with that under
   uniaxial strain. 4) Under the isotropic compressive strain, the bilayer
   phosphorene exhibits a transition from a direct-gap semiconductor to a
   metal. In contrast, the monolayer phosphorene initially has the
   direct-indirect transition and then transitions to a metal. However,
   under isotropic tensile strain, both the bilayer and monolayer
   phosphorene show the direct-indirect transition and, finally, the
   transition to a metal. Our numerical results may open new potential
   applications of phosphorene in nanoelectronics and nanomechanical
   devices by external isotropic strain or uniaxial strain along different
   directions.}},

   be a potential medium-high temperature TE material. Such strain-induced
   enhancements of TE performance are often observed to occur at the
   boundary of the direct-indirect band gap transition, which can be
   attributed to the increase of degeneracy of energy valleys at the
   transition point. By comparing the structure of BP with SnSe, a family
   of potential TE materials with hinge-like structure are suggested. This
   study not only exposes various novel properties of BP under strain, but
   also proposes effective strategies to seek for better TE materials.}},

Abstract = {{We evaluated the relationship between breast cancer survival and
   deprivation using data from the Irish National Cancer Registry.
   Cause-specific survival was compared between five area-based
   socioeconomic deprivation strata using Cox regression. Patient and
   tumour characteristics and treatment were compared using modified
   Poisson regression with robust variance estimation. Based on 21356
   patients diagnosed 1999-2008, age-standardized five-year survival
   averaged 80\% in the least deprived and 75\% in the most deprived
   stratum. Age-adjusted mortality risk was 33\% higher in the most
   deprived group (hazard ratio 1.33, 95\% CI 1.21-1.45, P<0.001). The most
   deprived groups were more likely to present with advanced stage, high
   grade or hormone receptor-negative cancer, symptomatically, or with
   significant comorbidity, and to be smokers or unmarried, and less likely
   to have breast-conserving surgery. Cox modelling suggested that the
   available data on patient, tumour and treatment factors could account
   for only about half of the survival disparity (adjusted hazard ratio
   1.18, 95\% CI 0.97-1.43, P = 0.093). Survival disparity did not diminish
   over time, compared with the period 1994-1998. Persistent survival
   disparities among Irish breast cancer patients suggest unequal use of or
   access to services and highlight the need for further research to
   understand and remove the behavioural or other barriers involved.}},

Abstract = {{Iron-Gallium alloy (Galfenol) is a magnetostrictive material
   (lambda(sat) similar to 400 ppm) with potential for robust transduction.
   In addition, Galfenol is auxetic in the < 110 > direction with Poisson's
   ratio values of as low as -0.7. In recent years, this phenomenon has
   been examined with several experimental protocols. The negative
   Poisson's ratio of Fe-Ga (attributed to lattice softening under applied
   stresses) has been documented using tensile tests (with and without a dc
   magnetic bias) and resonant ultrasound spectroscopy. In addition,
   density functional theory has been used to produce simulations that
   explain atomic mechanisms for the observed highly auxetic behavior in
   this alloy. This paper examines the auxetic response of Galfenol to
   varying magnetic fields and zero applied stress. An energy based
   mathematical model of the coupled magnetoelastic properties of the alloy
   is derived and used to predict Poisson's ratio at magnetic saturation.
   The results from this approach with no mechanical excitation shows an
   increase in the Poisson's ratio with increase in the Ga content of the
   alloy. This is opposite to the trends observed with applied stresses
   where there is a decrease in the Poisson's ratio with increase in the Ga
   content. Experimental results for Galfenol of compositions between 15
   and 33 atomic percent Gallium will be presented and compared with values
   from the magnetoelastic model.}},

Abstract = {{Continuing from Part I (Christensen, 2014, ``Failure Mechanics-Part I:
   The Coordination Between Elasticity Theory and Failure Theory for all
   Isotropic Materials,{''} ASME J. Appl. Mech., 81(8), p. 081001), the
   relationship between elastic energy and failure specification is further
   developed. Part I established the coordination of failure theory with
   elasticity theory, but subject to one overriding assumption: that the
   values of the involved Poisson's ratios always be non-negative. The
   present work derives the physical proof that, contrary to fairly common
   belief, Poisson's ratio must always be non-negative. It can never be
   negative for homogeneous and isotropic materials. This is accomplished
   by first probing the reduced two-dimensional (2D) elasticity problem
   appropriate to graphene, then generalizing to three-dimensional (3D)
   conditions. The nanomechanics analysis of graphene provides the key to
   the entire development. Other aspects of failure theory are also
   examined and concluded positively. Failure theory as unified with
   elasticity theory is thus completed, finalized, and fundamentally

Title = {{Simulation and analysis of coal seam conditions on the stress
   disturbance effects of pulsating hydro-fracturing}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NATURAL GAS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{21}},
Pages = {{649-658}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Pulsating hydro-fracturing (PHF) of coal beds is a technology based on
   conventional hydraulic fracturing and pulsating injection that is
   currently under development and that has found new applications in
   China. However, few studies have considered the geological conditions
   applicable to PHF. Based on continuum mechanics, this paper presents a
   numerical stress-disturbance model to simulate the formation stress
   response during PHF by applying the staggered-grid finite-difference
   scheme. According to the maximum tensile stress criterion, ``the
   effective stress disturbance zone{''} was introduced as the measurement
   criterion of PHF effects. The variations of PHF effects under different
   coal seam conditions (Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio and horizontal in
   situ stress) were investigated, and several unique behaviors were found.
   First, the coal seam with a lower Young's modulus and higher Poisson's
   ratio will create a larger effective stress disturbance zone. Second,
   the influence of the lower Young's modulus and higher Poisson's ratio
   can be uniformly attributed to the better compressibility of coal rock,
   which will have greater shear stress to expand the disturbance zone.
   Third, a negative correlation exists between the effective stress
   disturbance zone and horizontal in situ stress, among which the minimum
   in situ stress plays a leading role. Finally, the minimum in situ stress
   has the most significant impact on these PHF effects, followed by the
   Poisson's ratio, Young's modulus, and maximum in situ stress. Therefore,
   the minimum in situ stress condition should be considered first during
   PHF, followed by the rock compressibility. These research results will
   provide guidance for the optimization of coal seams conditions for PHF.

Abstract = {{The anode region of the vacuum-arc discharge in an external magnetic
   field is studied with allowance for the dependence of the negative anode

   charge layer near the anode at various values of the electric field
   E(0), ion velocity v (i) (0), and parameter v (0)/v (T) at the
   layer-plasma boundary. It is shown that there exists a minimum velocity
   v (i) {*} (0)of ions incoming to the anode layer at which the electric
   field vanishes at a single point inside the layer. The velocity v (i)
   {*} (0) determines the boundary of the existence of the stationary anode
   layer and depends on the ratio v (0)/v (T) . As v (0)/v (T) -> 0, the
   value v (i) {*} (0) asymptotically tends to the ionsound speed, which
   agrees with the well-known Bohm criterion. The velocity v (i) {*}

Abstract = {{Integrated pest management programs for soybean (Glycine max (L.)

   brown stink bug Euschistus heros (Fabricius, 1794) found on soybean, it
   was possible to construct a sequential sampling plan for the survey of
   this insect found on soybean. The experiment was carried out during two
   growing seasons, 2010/2011 and 2011/2012, using the transgenic soybean
   cultivar M 7908 RR, in plots of 10,000 m(2) subdivided into 100 plots of
   100 m(2) (10 m x 10 m). Nymphs > 0.5 cm (4th and 5th instars) plus
   adults were counted weekly from five drop cloth technique samplings per
   plot. To evaluate insect dispersion in the area, the following indices
   were used: variance/mean ratio, Morisita's index, Green's coefficient,
   the k exponent of the negative binomial distribution, and estimation of
   the common exponent k (kc). To study probabilistic models to describe
   the spatial distribution of the insects, adjustments of the Poisson and
   negative binomial distributions were tested. Two sequential sampling
   plans for separate fields, one for grain production and the other for
   seed production, were prepared. The data fitted a negative binomial
   distribution and a sampling plan was drawn up using the sequential
   likelihood ratio test (SLRT). The maximum sampling unit number expected
   for control-related decision making was six in grain production fields,
   and nine in seed production fields.}},

Abstract = {{Quantifying the proportion of polymorphic mutations that are deleterious
   or neutral is of fundamental importance to our understanding of
   evolution, disease genetics and the maintenance of variation
   genome-wide. Here, we develop an approximation to the distribution of
   fitness effects (DFE) of segregating single-nucleotide mutations in
   humans. Unlike previous methods, we do not assume that synonymous
   mutations are neutral or not strongly selected, and we do not rely on
   fitting the DFE of all new nonsynonymous mutations to a single
   probability distribution, which is poorly motivated on a biological
   level. We rely on a previously developed method that utilizes a variety
   of published annotations (including conservation scores, protein
   deleteriousness estimates and regulatory data) to score all mutations in
   the human genome based on how likely they are to be affected by negative
   selection, controlling for mutation rate. We map this and other
   conservation scores to a scale of fitness coefficients via maximum
   likelihood using diffusion theory and a Poisson random field model on
   SNP data. Our method serves to approximate the deleterious DFE of
   mutations that are segregating, regardless of their genomic consequence.
   We can then compare the proportion of mutations that are negatively
   selected or neutral across various categories, including different types
   of regulatory sites. We observe that the distribution of intergenic
   polymorphisms is highly peaked at neutrality, while the distribution of
   nonsynonymous polymorphisms has a second peak at s approximate
   to-10(-4). Other types of polymorphisms have shapes that fall roughly in
   between these two. We find that transcriptional start sites, strong
   CTCF-enriched elements and enhancers are the regulatory categories with
   the largest proportion of deleterious polymorphisms.}},

   Reporting System and Discharge Abstract Database. Regression models
   based on spatial area incorporated human infection data with livestock
   and weather covariates. A variety of regression models were applied
   (i.e. least squares, spatial lag/error, Poisson, negative binomial) to
   test the most appropriate approach. Ratios for the total number of
   calves, bulls and beef cows to human population were highlighted as
   significant cattle density variables in all final best-fitting models.
   Weather variables were not significant in final regression models

Abstract = {{The number of patient-years needed to treat (NPYNT), also called the
   event-based number needed to treat, to avoid one additional exacerbation
   has been reported in recently published respiratory trials, but the
   confidence intervals are not routinely reported. The challenge of
   constructing confidence intervals for NPYNT is due to the fact that
   exacerbation data or count data in general are usually analyzed using
   Poisson-based models such as Poisson or negative binomial regression and
   the rate ratio is the natural metric for between-treatment comparison,
   while NPYNT is based on rate difference, which is not usually calculated
   for those models. Therefore, the variance estimates from these analysis
   models are directly related to the rate ratio rather than the rate
   difference. In this paper, we propose several methods to construct
   confidence intervals for the NPYNT, assuming that the event rates are
   estimated using Poisson or negative binomial regression models. The
   coverage property of the confidence intervals constructed with these
   methods is assessed by simulations. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{Using experimental data, it is shown that the Poisson's ratios of
   standard (untreated) open cell polyurethane foam vary when loading in
   different loading directions, since foam is inherently asymmetric and
   anisotropic. The loading direction which is in plane orthogonal to the
   rise direction of the foam constantly exhibited the most negative
   Poisson's ratio across foam samples of different types, even at moderate
   compressive strains. It was also shown that although the foam may become
   auxetic at very high values of compressive strain, it shows an
   incremental negative Poisson's ratio at moderate compressive strains.
   The results obtained are discussed in light of the deformation
   mechanisms, which have been proposed in literature to explain negative
   Poisson's ratios in foams. The effects of changing loading direction on
   the mechanical response of the foam are highlighted. (C) 2014 WILEY-VCH

Abstract = {{There exist several honeycomb networks exhibiting zero Poisson's ratio
   (ZPR). Applications of these networks can be found in different fields.
   The ZPR properties of these structures have been mechanically modeled
   and tested. However, the underlying mechanism driving the ZPR behavior
   has not been paid much attention. The present work focuses on the
   deformation mechanism of the ZPR networks. Through the discussion and
   comparison of the deformation process of the ZPR, auxetic and common
   honeycomb networks, the strain-isolation mechanism is proposed to
   explain the ZPR behavior. Then, according to this mechanism, the
   reversed semi-re-entrant (RSRE) honeycomb is created. With experimental
   measurements and finite-element analysis (FEA), the ZPR properties of
   the RSRE can be proven. The strain-isolation mechanism can not only
   explain the ZPR behavior but also be used in the design of new ZPR
   honeycomb networks. 3D ZPR structures are also derived from the 2D
   honeycomb networks. Their Poisson's ratios in 3D space are also
   discussed based on FEA results. (C) 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co.

Abstract = {{Cellular materials have two important properties: structures and
   mechanisms. These properties have important applications in materials
   design; in particular, they are used to determine the modulus and yield
   strain. The objective of this study is to gain a better understanding of
   these two properties and to explore the synthesis of compliant cellular
   materials (CCMs) with compliant porous structures (CPSes) generated from
   modified hexagonal honeycombs. An in-plane constitutive CCM model is
   constructed using the strain energy method, which uses the deformation
   of hinges around holes and the rotation of links. A finite element (FE)
   based simulation is conducted to validate the analytical model. The
   moduli and yield strains of the CCMs with an aluminum alloy are about
   5.8 GPa and 0.57\% in one direction and about 2.9 MPa and 20\% in the
   other direction. CCMs have extremely high positive and negative
   Poisson's ratios (v(xy){*}similar to +/- 40) due to the large rotation
   of the link member in the transverse direction caused by an input
   displacement in the longitudinal direction. CCMs also show higher moduli
   after contact of slit edges at the center region of the CPSes. The
   synthesized CPSes can also be used to design a new CCM with a Poisson's
   ratio of zero using a puzzle-piece CPS assembly. This paper demonstrates
   that compliant mesostructures can be used for next generation materials
   design in tailoring mechanical properties such as moduli, strength,
   strain, and Poisson's ratios. The proposed mesostructures can also be
   easily manufactured using a conventional cutting method. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Computational contact homogenization approach is applied to study
   friction anisotropy resulting from asperity interaction in elastic
   contacts. Contact of rough surfaces with anisotropic roughness is
   considered with asperity contact at the micro scale being governed by
   the isotropic Coulomb friction model. Application of a micro-to-macro
   scale transition scheme yields a macroscopic friction model with
   orientation- and pressure-dependent macroscopic friction coefficient.
   The macroscopic slip rule is found to exhibit a weak non-associativity
   in the tangential plane, although the slip rule at the microscale is
   associated in the tangential plane. Counterintuitive effects are
   observed for compressible materials, in particular, for auxetic
   materials. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The development of smart structures, aimed at optimizing the response of
   engineering systems, is a modern and very promising field. Such advanced
   structural element can be obtained, in some cases, by using the
   so-called auxetic materials, i.e. materials exhibiting negative
   Poisson's ratio. In the present paper a brief introduction on auxetic
   materials and on their use and potentiality is presented. In particular
   their application to obtain smart layered plates is discussed; it is
   shown as these materials allow, in certain conditions, to get a desired
   stiffness and a nearly linear behaviour (even under large displacement
   conditions) of bended plates, without changing the plate's geometry and
   materials. Such potentialities are presented and discussed based on
   numerical analyses, and a mechanical interpretation of the observed
   structural behaviour is proposed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Detection of outliers in longitudinal count data via overdispersion}},
Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS \& DATA ANALYSIS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{79}},
Pages = {{192-202}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Count data are usually modeled using the Poisson generalized linear
   model. The Poisson model requires that the variance be a deterministic
   function of the mean. This assumption may not be met for a particular
   data set, that is, the model may not adequately capture the variability
   in the data. The extra-variability in the data may be accommodated using
   overdispersion models, such as the negative binomial distribution. In
   addition to the overdispersion outliers may be present in the data as
   indicated by the model residuals or some functions of the model
   residuals. A variance shift outlier model (VSOM) for count data is
   introduced. The model is used to detect potential outliers in the data,
   and to down-weight them in the analysis if desired. In this model the
   overdispersion is modeled using an observation-specific random effect.
   The status of a given observation as an outlier is indicated by the size
   of the associated shift in variance for that observation. The model is
   then extended to longitudinal count data for the detection of outliers
   at the subject level. We illustrate the methodology using a real data
   set taken from the literature. Extensions of the VSOM for count data to
   other non-normal responses are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Exacerbation-associated uncontrolled asthma represents a
   major public health problem. The relationship of elevated blood
   eosinophils to this process needs study.
   OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a high blood eosinophil count is a risk
   factor for future asthma exacerbations in adult persistent asthma.
   METHODS: By using electronic pharmacy and health care data from Kaiser
   Permanente Southern California, 2392 patients, ages 18 to 64 years, were
   identified who met the Health Effectiveness Data and Information Set
   2-year criteria for persistent asthma, did not manifest chronic
   obstructive pulmonary disease and other major illnesses, and had a blood
   eosinophil determination in 2010. Exacerbations (primary outcome) were
   defined as asthma outpatient visits that required systemic
   corticosteroid dispensing within +/-7 days or asthma emergency
   department visits or hospitalizations. A period of >= 8 days defined a
   new exacerbation. Multivariate modelling used negative binomial and
   Poisson regression to examine the association between a blood eosinophil
   count determined in 2010 and risk of exacerbations, and >= 7
   short-acting beta(2)-agonist (SABA) canisters dispensed (secondary
   outcome) in 2011 by adjusting for demographics, comorbidities, and
   asthma burden.
   RESULTS: The rate of asthma exacerbations in 2011 was 0.41 events per
   person year (95\% CI, 0.37-0.45). Eosinophil count >= 400/mm(3) in 2010
   was a risk factor for asthma exacerbations in 2011 (adjusted rate ratio
   1.31 {[}95\% CI, 1.07-1.60]; P = .009) and >= 7 SABA dispensed (adjusted
   risk ratio 1.17 {[}95\% CI, 1.03-1.1.33]; P = .015).
   CONCLUSION: A high blood eosinophil count is a risk factor for increased
   future asthma exacerbations and excessive short-acting beta(2)-agonist
   use after adjustment of potential confounders in adults with persistent
   asthma, which suggests a higher disease burden in patients with asthma
   and with high blood eosinophil counts. (C) 2014 American Academy of

Title = {{Effect of annealing on the elastic moduli of amorphous zirconium
   tungstate}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NON-CRYSTALLINE SOLIDS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{403}},
Pages = {{102-106}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Amorphous zirconium tungstate (a-ZrW2O8), prepared at 7.7 GPa, was
   subjected to successive heat treatments at increasingly higher
   temperatures, up to 640 degrees C. Evidence of recrystallization into
   alpha-ZrW2O8 was found in the room temperature X-ray powder diffraction
   pattern of samples previously heated above 600 degrees C. Changes in
   elastic moduli and linear thermal expansion coefficient upon annealing
   of a-ZrW2O8 up to 600 degrees C cannot be accounted for by assuming a
   composite sample consisting of alpha-ZrW2O8 domains dispersed into an
   amorphous zirconium tungstate matrix. The irreversible relaxation of
   a-ZrW2O8 and recrystallization into alpha-ZrW2O8 is accompanied by an
   increase of bulk modulus (from 61.8(8) GPa to 74.4(9) GPa) and Poisson's
   ratio (from 0267(3) to 0302(3)) and diminution of density (from 6.54(1)
   g/cm(3) for a-ZrW2O8 to 5.18(1) g/cm(3) for alpha-ZrW2O8). Despite the
   greater density, a-ZrW2O8 (as well as gamma-ZrW2O8, a high pressure
   polymorph) is more compressible than alpha-ZrW2O8, possibly owing to the
   new degrees of freedom provided by lowering symmetry, which allow
   external stresses to be accommodated by polyhedral tilting. Furthermore,
   the observed increase of Poisson's ratio upon thermal treatments at
   increasingly higher temperatures indicates that annealing of a-ZrW2O8 is
   accompanied by the irreversible reduction in the average number of
   bridging oxygen atoms. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Using delta generalized additive models to produce distribution maps for
   spatially explicit ecosystem models}},
Journal = {{FISHERIES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{159}},
Pages = {{11-24}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Spatial ecosystem models, such as OSMOSE, have become integral tools in
   achieving ecosystem-based management for their ability to thoroughly
   describe predator-prey dynamics in a spatially explicit context.
   Distribution maps, which define the initial spatial allocation of
   functional groups abundance, can have a large effect on the
   predator-prey dynamics that spatially explicit ecosystem models
   simulate. Here, we introduce the delta GAM approach we developed to be
   able to produce distribution maps for an OSMOSE model of the West
   Florida Shelf (Gulf of Mexico), OSMOSE-WFS. This delta GAM approach
   predicts the spatial distribution of different life stages of the
   multiple functional groups represented in OSMOSE-WFS (life-stage
   groups') at different seasons, over the entire Gulf of Mexico (GOM)
   shelf including areas where abundance estimates do not exist, using
   different research survey datasets and regional environmental and
   habitat features. Our delta GAM approach consists of fitting two
   independent models, a binomial GAM and a quasi-Poisson GAM, whose
   predictions are then combined using the delta method to yield spatial
   abundance estimates. To validate delta GAMs, bootstraps are used and
   Spearman's correlation coefficients (Spearman's p's) between predicted
   and observed abundance values are estimated and tested to be
   significantly different from zero. We use pink shrimp (Farfantepenaeus
   duorarum) to demonstrate our delta GAM approach by predicting the summer
   distribution of this species over the GOM shelf and the West Florida
   Shelf. Predictions of the delta GAM reflect existing empirical research
   related to pink shrimp habitat preferences and predictions of a negative
   binomial GAM previously designed for the GOM. We find that using a delta
   rather than a negative binomial GAM saves significant computation time
   at the expense of a slight reduction in GAM performance. A positive and
   highly significant Spearman's p between observed and predicted abundance
   values indicates that our delta GAM can reliably be used to predict pink
   shrimp spatial distribution. Spearman's p was also positive and highly
   significant in every life-stage group represented in OSMOSE-WFS and
   season, though often low. Therefore, delta GAMs fitted for the different
   life-stage groups and seasons correctly predict qualitative differences
   between low- and high-abundance areas and are deemed appropriate for
   generating distribution maps for OSMOSE-WFS. The delta GAM approach we
   developed is a simple, convenient method to create distribution maps to
   be fed into spatially explicit ecosystem models, where wide spatial and
   taxonomic coverage is desired while benefits of high precision estimates
   are lost at run-time. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Title = {{Comparison of Regression Methods for Modeling Intensive Care Length of
   Stay}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 31}},
Abstract = {{Intensive care units (ICUs) are increasingly interested in assessing and
   improving their performance. ICU Length of Stay (LoS) could be seen as
   an indicator for efficiency of care. However, little consensus exists on
   which prognostic method should be used to adjust ICU LoS for case-mix
   factors. This study compared the performance of different regression
   models when predicting ICU LoS. We included data from 32,667 unplanned
   ICU admissions to ICUs participating in the Dutch National Intensive
   Care Evaluation (NICE) in the year 2011. We predicted ICU LoS using
   eight regression models: ordinary least squares regression on
   untransformed ICU LoS, LoS truncated at 30 days and log-transformed LoS;
   a generalized linear model with a Gaussian distribution and a
   logarithmic link function; Poisson regression; negative binomial
   regression; Gamma regression with a logarithmic link function; and the
   original and recalibrated APACHE IV model, for all patients together and
   for survivors and non-survivors separately. We assessed the predictive
   performance of the models using bootstrapping and the squared Pearson
   correlation coefficient (R-2), root mean squared prediction error
   (RMSPE), mean absolute prediction error (MAPE) and bias. The
   distribution of ICU LoS was skewed to the right with a median of 1.7
   days (interquartile range 0.8 to 4.0) and a mean of 4.2 days (standard
   deviation 7.9). The predictive performance of the models was between
   0.09 and 0.20 for R-2, between 7.28 and 8.74 days for RMSPE, between
   3.00 and 4.42 days for MAPE and between 22.99 and 1.64 days for bias.
   The predictive performance was slightly better for survivors than for
   non-survivors. We were disappointed in the predictive performance of the
   regression models and conclude that it is difficult to predict LoS of
   unplanned ICU admissions using patient characteristics at admission time
   only.}},

Title = {{Caregivers' Health Literacy and Gaps in Children's Medicaid Enrollment:
   Findings from the Carolina Oral Health Literacy Study}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 10}},
Abstract = {{Background and Objectives: Recent evidence supports a link between
   caregivers' health literacy and their children's health and use of
   health services. Disruptions in children's health insurance coverage
   have been linked to poor health care and outcomes. We examined young
   children's Medicaid enrollment patterns in a well-characterized cohort
   of child/caregivers dyads and investigated the association of
   caregivers' low health literacy with the incidence of enrollment gaps.
   Methods: We relied upon Medicaid enrollment data for 1208 children (mean
   age = 19 months) enrolled in the Carolina Oral Health Literacy project
   during 2008-09. The median follow-up was 25 months. Health literacy was
   measured using the Newest Vital Sign (NVS). Analyses relied on
   descriptive, bivariate, and multivariate methods based on Poisson
   modeling.
   Findings: One-third of children experienced one or more enrollment gaps;
   most were short in duration (median = 5 months). The risk of gaps was
   inversely associated with caregivers' age, with a 2\% relative risk
   decrease for each added year. Low health literacy was associated with a
   modestly elevated risk increase {[}Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR) = 1.17
   (95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.88-1.57)] for enrollment disruptions;
   however, this estimate was substantially elevated among caregivers with
   less than a high school education {[}IRR = 1.52 (95\% CI 0.99-2.35);
   homogeneity p<0.2].
   Conclusions: Our findings provide initial support for a possible role of
   caregivers' health literacy as a determinant of children's Medicaid
   enrollment gaps. Although the association between health literacy and
   enrollment gaps was not confirmed statistically, we found that it was
   markedly stronger among caregivers with low educational attainment. This
   population, as well as young caregivers, may be the most vulnerable to
   the negative effects of low health literacy.}},

Title = {{The variation in Poisson's ratio caused by interactions between core and
   wrap in helical composite auxetic yarns}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITES SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{102}},
Pages = {{87-93}},
Month = {{OCT 6}},
Abstract = {{Materials with a negative Poisson's ratio are referred to as auxetic.
   One recently invented example of this is the helical auxetic yarn (HAY).
   This has been proved to successfully exhibit auxetic behaviour both as a
   yarn and when incorporated into fabric. The HAY is based on a
   double-helix geometry where a relatively stiffer `wrap' is helically
   wound around a compliant core fibre. This paper studies the effect of
   the interaction between the core and the wrap fibre on the auxetic
   behaviour of the HAY, including the effect of their relative moduli.
   Assessment of the Poisson's ratio of the HAYs has revealed that an
   elevated difference in component moduli causes the wrap fibre embedding
   itself into the core fibre, thus decreasing the auxetic effect. Careful
   determination of an optimum core-wrap moduli ratio where the ratio is
   high enough to yield an auxetic effect and low enough to prevent the
   core-indentation effect can lead to the fabrication of a yarn with
   largest negative Poisson's ratio. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Folding of links-links knitted structures is based on the structural
   disequilibrium of face and reverse loops, which causes the fabric to
   form a 3-dimensional structure. Foldable structures shrink in both
   course and wale directions when relaxed. Under the applied strain in the
   horizontal or vertical direction, 3-dimensional structures smooth into a
   flat fabric, creases unfold and the structures expand in both
   directions. Fabric thickness increases with folding. Compressibility
   means a decrease in initial thickness due to the increase in compressive
   force at measuring time. It is affected by knitting parameters such as
   density, fabric thickness, texture etc. The aim of the research was to
   evaluate the compressibility of links-links weft knitted fabrics with a
   zigzag structure which could potentially be used as a packaging and
   mechanical damage protection material. The influence of the yarn
   material composition and repeat size on the compression properties of
   foldable links-links knitted structures was examined in order to
   evaluate their adequacy for compression resistant materials.}},

Abstract = {{A single primary user cognitive radio system with multiuser diversity at
   the secondary users (SUs) is considered, where there is an interference
   constraint between SUs and the primary receiver. The SU with the highest
   instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio is selected for communication from a
   set of active users, which also satisfies the interference constraint.
   The active number of SUs is shown to be binomial, negative binomial, or
   Poisson-binomial distributed depending on various modes of operation.
   The outage probability in the slow-fading scenario is also studied. This
   is then followed by a derivation of the scaling law of the ergodic
   capacity and bit error rate (BER) averaged across the fading and the
   user distribution for a large mean number of users. The ergodic capacity
   and average BER under the binomial user distribution are shown to
   outperform the negative binomial case with the same mean number of
   users. Moreover, the Poisson distribution is used to approximate the
   user distribution under the non-independent and identically distributed
   interference scenario and compared with binomial and negative binomial
   distributions in a stochastic ordering sense. Monte Carlo simulations
   are used to supplement our analytical results and compare the
   performances under different user distributions.}},

Title = {{Economically inactive, unemployed and employed suicides in Australia by
   age and sex over a 10-year period: what was the impact of the 2007
   economic recession?}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{Background: Suicide is higher among economically inactive and unemployed
   persons than employed persons. This paper investigates differences in
   this relationship by sex and age over the period 2001 to 2010 in
   Australia. It also examines changes in suicide among employed,
   unemployed and economically inactive persons during the recession of
   2007-09.
   Method: Suicide data from the National Coroners Information System were
   utilised for this retrospective study. Negative binomial and Poisson
   regression was used to estimate the association between suicide and
   employment status and to investigate differences in suicide rates over
   the period of the recession (2007-09) compared with the year before the
   recession (2006).
   Results: Results suggest that during 2001-10 economically
   inactive/unemployed males had a suicide rate ratio (RR) of 4.62 {[}95\%
   confidence interval (CI) 4.10, 5.19; P<0.001] compared with employed
   males (RR=1.00), whereas economically inactive/unemployed females had a
   suicide RR of 8.44 compared with employed females (95\% CI 7.38, 9.67;
   P<0.001). There was an increase in suicide among both employed (7\% rise
   in 2007, P=0.003) and economically inactive/unemployed males during the
   GFC (22\% in 2008, P<0.001). Suicide also increased among economically
   inactive/unemployed females (12\% in 2007, P=0.03; 19\% in 2008,
   P=0.001) but not among employed females.
   Conclusions: These results suggest the need for adequate policy and
   social welfare responses to ameliorate the effects of the economic
   recession on the working age population. Particularly, these should
   target unemployed and economically inactive men and women in Australia,
   who may be at higher risk of suicide than previously thought.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To analyze the association between negative self-rated health
   and indicators of health, wellbeing and sociodemographic variables in
   older adults.
   METHODS: Cross-sectional study that used data from a population-based
   health survey with a probability cluster sample that was carried out in
   Campinas, SP, Southeastern Brazil,, in 2008 and 2009. The participants
   were older adults (>= 60 years) and the dependent variable was
   self-rated health, categorized as: excellent, very good, good, bad and
   very bad. The adjusted prevalence ratios were estimated by means of
   Poisson multiple regression.
   RESULTS: The highest prevalences of bad/very bad self-rated health were
   observed in the individuals who never attended school, in those with
   lower level of schooling, with monthly per capita family income lower
   than one minimum salary. Individuals who scored five or more in the
   physical health indicator also had bad self-rated health, as well as
   those who scored five or more in the Self-Reporting Questionnaire 20 and
   those who did not refer feeling happiness all the time.
   CONCLUSIONS: The independent effects of material life conditions,
   physical and mental health and subjective wellbeing, observed in
   self-rated health, suggest that older adults can benefit by health
   policies supported by a global and integrative view of old age.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND \& AIMS: Infection increases mortality in patients with
   alcoholic hepatitis (AH). Little is known about the association between
   Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and AH. We examined the prevalence
   and effects of CDI in patients with AH, compared with those of other
   infections.
   METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional analysis using data collected
   from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, from 2008 through 2011.
   International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision, Clinical
   Modification codes were used to identify patients with AH. We used
   multivariable logistic regression to determine risk factors that affect
   mortality, negative binomial regression to evaluate the effects of CDI
   on predicted length of stay (LOS), and Poisson regression to determine
   the effects of CDI on predicted hospital charges. Chi-square and
   Wilcoxon rank-sum analyses were used to compare mortality, LOS, and
   hospital charges associated with CDI with those associated with urinary
   tract infection (UTI) and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).
   RESULTS: Of 10,939 patients with AH, 177 had CDI (1.62\%). Patients with
   AH and CDI had increased odds of inpatient mortality (adjusted odds
   ratio, 1.75; P=.04), a longer predicted LOS (10.63 vs 5.75 d; P<.001),
   and greater predicted hospital charges (\$36,924.30 vs \$29,136.58;
   P<.001), compared with those without CDI. Compared with UTI, CDI was
   associated with similar mortality but greater LOS (9 vs 6 d; P<.001) and
   hospital charges (\$45,607 vs \$32,087; P<.001). SBP was associated with
   higher mortality than CDI (17.3\% vs 10.1\%; P=.045), but similar LOS
   and hospital charges.
   CONCLUSIONS: In patients with AH, CDI is associated with greater
   mortality and health care use. These effects appear similar to those for
   UTI and SBP. We propose further studies to determine the cost
   effectiveness of screening for CDI among patients with AH.}},

Pages = {{60-66}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{This short communication investigates the effect of negative Poisson's
   ratio on the natural frequency of thick plates of arbitrary shape. Using
   the Mindlin plate theory, it was generally found that as the plate's
   Poisson's ratio becomes more negative, the Mindlin-to-Kirchhoff natural
   frequency ratio increases with decreasing rate. Upon comparing (a) the
   use of the simplified constant shear correction factor and the more
   accurate variable shear correction factor, (b) with and without rotary
   inertia, it was found that all the four combinations stated in (a) and
   (b) do not give appreciable difference when the Poisson's ratio of the
   plate is positive. However in the case of plates with negative Poisson's
   ratio, results reveal that when at least one of the simplifying
   assumptions is used, the Mindlin-to-Kirchhoff natural frequency ratio is
   overestimated, and that the overestimation further increases when both
   the simplifying assumptions are used. When benchmarked against Reddy
   plate theory, the use of variable shear correction factor has almost the
   same effect as the inclusion of rotary inertia. Hence the use of either
   variable shear correction factor or rotary inertia is proposed for
   modeling the vibrational frequencies of conventional and auxetic
   isotropic plates. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{90}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{SEP 29}},
Abstract = {{An effective medium theory for resonant and nonresonant metamaterials
   for flexural waves in thin plates is presented. The theory provides
   closed-form expressions for the effective mass density, rigidity, and
   Poisson's ratio of arrangements of isotropic scatterers in thin plates,
   valid for low frequencies and moderate filling fractions. It is found
   that the effective Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio are induced by a
   combination of the monopolar and quadrupolar scattering coefficient, as
   it happens for bulk elastic waves, while the effective mass density is
   induced by the monopolar coefficient, contrarily as it happens for bulk
   elastic waves, where the effective mass density is induced by the
   dipolar coefficient. It is shown that resonant positive or negative
   effective elastic parameters are possible, being therefore the monopolar
   resonance responsible for creating an effective medium with negative
   mass density. Several examples are given for both nonresonant and
   resonant effective parameters and the results are numerically verified
   by multiple scattering theory and finite element analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Young's modulus, fracture stress, and Poisson's ratio are important
   mechanical characteristics for micromechanical devices. The Poisson's
   ratio of a material is a good measure to elucidate its mechanical
   behavior and generally is the negative ratio of transverse to axial
   strain. A nanocrystalline (NCD) and an ultrananocrystalline (UNCD)
   diamond sample with grain boundaries of different chemical and
   structural constitutions have been investigated by an ultrasonic
   resonance method. For both samples, the elastic moduli are considerably
   reduced, compared with the elastic modulus of single crystal diamond
   (sc-diamond). Depending on the chemical and structural constitution of
   grain boundaries in nano-and ultrananocrystalline diamond different
   values for Poisson's ratio and for the fracture strength are observed.
   We found a Poisson's ratio of 0.201 +/- 0.041 for the
   ultrananocrystalline sample and 0.034 +/- 0.017 for the nanocrystalline
   sample. We discuss these results on the basis of a model for granular
   media. Higher disorder in the grain boundary leads to lower shear
   stiffness between the single grains and ultimately results in a decrease
   of Young's and shear modulus and possibly of the fracture strength of
   the material. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Background. We estimated the vaccine effectiveness (VE) of
   tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap) for preventing
   pertussis among adolescents during a statewide outbreak of pertussis in
   Wisconsin during 2012.
   Methods. We used the population-based Wisconsin Immunization Registry
   (WIR) to construct a cohort of Wisconsin residents born during 1998-2000
   and collect Tdap vaccination histories. Reports of laboratory-confirmed
   pertussis with onset during 2012 were matched to WIR clients. Incidence
   rate ratios (IRRs) of pertussis and Tdap VE estimates {[}(1 -
   IRR){*}100\%], by year of Tdap vaccine receipt and brand
   (Boostrix/Adacel), were estimated using Poisson regression.
   Results. Tdap VE decreased with increasing time since receipt, with VEs
   of 75.3\% (95\% confidence interval {[}CI], 55.2\%-86.5\%) for receipt
   during 2012, 68.2\% (95\% CI, 60.9\%-74.1\%) for receipt during 2011,
   34.5\% (95\% CI, 19.9\%-46.4\%) for receipt during 2010, and 11.9\%
   (95\% CI, -11.1\% to 30.1\%) for receipt during 2009/2008; point
   estimates were higher among Boostrix recipients than among Adacel
   recipients. Among Tdap recipients, increasing time since receipt was
   associated with increased risk, and receipt of Boostrix (vs Adacel) was
   associated with decreased risk of pertussis (adjusted IRR, 0.62 {[}95\%
   CI, .52-.74]).
   Conclusions. Our results demonstrate waning immunity following
   vaccination with either Tdap brand. Boostrix was more effective than
   Adacel in preventing pertussis in our cohort, but these findings may not
   be generalizable to adolescent cohorts that received different
   diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis vaccines (DTaP) during childhood
   and should be further examined in studies that include childhood DTaP
   history.}},

Abstract = {{We examine solid cellular structures within the theoretical framework of
   finite elasticity, whereby we assume that the cell wall material is
   nonlinear elastic. This enables us to identify new mechanical effects
   that appear in cellular materials when elastically deformed, and to
   explore the physical properties that influence them. We find that, when
   a honeycomb structure of hyperelastic material and standard geometry,
   such as rectangular-, hexagonal- or diamond-shaped cells, contains walls
   which are inclined relative to an applied uniaxial tensile load, these
   walls tend to expand both in the direction of the load and in the
   perpendicular direction, producing an apparent negative Poisson's ratio
   at local cell level. Moreover, we show that this (negative) Poisson
   ratio decreases as the magnitude of the tensile load increases. For
   these structures, Poisson's ratios greater than 0.5 are obtained in
   uniaxial compression. Similar effects in structures with linearly
   elastic cell walls do not occur.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY INTERFACE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{11}},

Month = {{SEP 6}},
Abstract = {{The seed capsule of Delosperma nakurense is a remarkable example of a
   natural hygromorph, which unfolds its protecting valves upon wetting to
   expose its seeds. The beautiful mechanism responsible for this motion is
   generated by a specialized organ based on an anisotropic cellular tissue
   filled with a highly swelling material. Inspired by this system, we
   study the mechanics of a diamond honeycomb internally pressurized by a
   fluid phase. Numerical homogenization by means of iterative
   finite-element (FE) simulations is adapted to the case of cellular
   materials filled with a variable pressure fluid phase. Like its
   biological counterpart, it is shown that the material architecture
   controls and guides the otherwise unspecific isotropic expansion of the
   fluid. Deformations up to twice the original dimensions can be achieved
   by simply setting the value of input pressure. In turn, these
   deformations cause a marked change of the honeycomb geometry and hence
   promote a stiffening of the material along the weak direction. To
   understand the mechanism further, we also developed a micromechanical
   model based on the Born model for crystal elasticity to find an explicit
   relation between honeycomb geometry, swelling eigenstrains and elastic
   properties. The micromechanical model is in good qualitative agreement
   with the FE simulations. Moreover, we also provide the force-stroke
   characteristics of a soft actuator based on the pressurized anisotropic
   honeycomb and show how the internal pressure has a nonlinear effect
   which can result in negative values of the in-plane Poisson's ratio. As
   nature shows in the case of the D. nakurense seed capsule, cellular
   materials can be used not only as low-weight structural materials, but
   also as simple but convenient actuating materials.}},

Abstract = {{Materials and microstructures with specific configurations are able to
   have negative Poisson's ratio. This paper proposes a topology
   optimization methodology of frame structures to design a planar periodic
   structure that exhibits negative Poisson's ratio. Provided that beam
   section of each existing member is chosen from a set of some given
   candidates, we can reduce the topology optimization problem to a
   mixed-integer linear programming problem. Since the proposed approach
   treats frame structures and stress constraints are rigorously addressed,
   the optimal solution contains no hinge region. A heuristic method with
   local search is used to solve large-scale problems. Numerical examples
   and fabrication test demonstrate that planar periodic frame structures
   exhibiting negative Poisson's ratio can be successfully obtained by the
   proposed method.}},

   spiral wire structure}},
Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{New kinds of entangled materials with an auxetic effect were
   investigated in terms of fabrication, structural characterization, the
   measurement of their negative Poisson's ratio and the auxetic mechanism.
   The maximum negative Poisson's ratio of -1.5 was obtained at about 5\%
   of the engineering strain for the entangled materials with 45\%
   porosity. The auxetic behavior originated from the rotation of the
   `slanted coil-springs' structure. A model to formulate the negative
   Poisson's ratio was proposed based on the slanted coil-spring structure.
   The initial slanted angle affected the auxetic behavior significantly.
   As the slanted angle decreased, the negative Poisson's ratio increased.
   Entangled materials with such an auxetic effect have potential for
   engineering applications.}},

Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{116}},
Pages = {{461-476}},
Month = {{SEP-OCT}},
Abstract = {{The homogenization of periodic hexachiral and tetrachiral honeycombs is
   dealt with two different techniques. The first is based on a micropolar
   homogenization. The second approach, developed to analyse
   two-dimensional periodic cells consisting of deformable portions such as
   the ring, the ligaments and possibly a filling material, is based on a
   second gradient homogenization developed by the authors. The obtained
   elastic moduli depend on the parameter of chirality, namely the angle of
   inclination of the ligaments with respect to the grid of lines
   connecting the centers of the rings. For hexachiral cells the auxetic
   property of the lattice together with the elastic coupling modulus
   between the normal and the asymmetric strains is obtained; a property
   that has been confirmed here for the tetrachiral lattice. Unlike the
   hexagonal lattice, the classical constitutive equations of the
   tetragonal lattice turns out to be characterized by the coupling between
   the normal and shear strains through an elastic modulus that is an odd
   function of the parameter of chirality. Moreover, this lattice is found
   to exhibit a remarkable variability of the Young's modulus and of the
   Poisson's ratio with the direction of the applied uniaxial stress.
   Finally, a simulation of experimental results is carried out. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Aim. To evaluate the impact of traumatic dental injury (TDI) among
   Brazilian adolescents on their families' quality of life (QoL).
   Design. A cross-sectional study was carried out with a population-based
   sample of 1122 schoolchildren aged 11-14 years selected using a
   multistage sampling procedure. Parents/caregivers answered the Brazilian
   version of the 14-item Family Impact Scale (B-FIS) to assess the impact
   on family's QoL. The main independent variable was TDI, which was
   diagnosed using the Andreasen classification. Malocclusion, dental
   caries, gender and socio-economic classification were the other
   independent variables. Poisson regression analyses were carried out (P <
   0.05).
   Results. The prevalence of TDI was 14.8\%. The multivariate model
   demonstrated that families of adolescents diagnosed with fracture
   involving the dentine or dentine/pulp were more likely to report a
   negative impact on the overall B-FIS score {[}rate ratio (RR) = 1.44;
   95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.10-1.88] as well on the Parental/
   Family Activity (RR = 1.45; 95\% CI: 1.09-1.94), Parental Emotions (RR =
   1.45; 95\% CI: 1.03-2.04) and Family Conflict (RR = 1.46; 95\% CI:
   1.012.11) subscales in comparison with those who had no signs of TDI.
   Conclusions. Families of adolescents with more severe TDI were more
   likely to report a negative impact on QoL, affecting family activities
   and emotions, which can result in family conflicts.}},

Abstract = {{Background and objectives Depressive symptoms and pain are common in
   patients receiving chronic hemodialysis, yet their effect on dialysis
   adherence, health resource utilization, and mortality is not fully
   understood. This study sought to characterize the longitudinal
   associations of these symptoms with dialysis adherence, emergency
   department (ED) visits, hospitalizations, and mortality.
   Design, setting, participants, \& measurements As part of a trial
   comparing symptom management strategies in patients receiving chronic
   hemodialysis, this study prospectively assessed depressive symptoms
   using the Patient Health Questionnaire 9, and pain using the Short-Form
   McGill Pain Questionnaire, monthly between 2009 and 2011. This study
   used negative binomial, Poisson, and proportional hazards regression to
   analyze the longitudinal associations of depressive symptoms and pain,
   scaled based on 5-point increments in symptom scores, with missed and
   abbreviated hemodialysis treatments, ED visits, hospitalizations, and
   mortality, respectively.
   Results Among 286 patients, moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms were
   identified on 788 of 4452 (18\%) assessments and pain was reported on
   3537 of 4459 (79\%) assessments. Depressive symptoms were independently
   associated with missed (incident rate ratio {[}IRR], 1.21; 95\%
   confidence interval {[}95\% CI], 1.10 to 1.33) and abbreviated (IRR,
   1.08; 95\% CI, 1.03 to 1.14) hemodialysis treatments, ED visits (IRR,
   1.24; 95\% CI, 1.12 to 1.37), hospitalizations (IRR, 1.19; 95\% CI, 1.10
   to 1.30), and mortality (IRR, 1.40; 95\% CI, 1.11 to 1.77). Pain was
   independently associated with abbreviated hemodialysis treatments (IRR,
   1.03; 95\% CI, 1.01 to 1.06) and hospitalizations (IRR, 1.05; 95\% CI,
   1.00 to 1.10). Severe pain was independently associated with abbreviated
   hemodialysis treatments (IRR, 1.16; 95\% CI, 1.06 to 1.28), ED visits
   (IRR, 1.58; 95\% CI, 1.28 to 1.94), and hospitalizations (IRR, 1.22;
   95\% CI, 1.03 to 1.45), but not mortality (hazard ratio, 1.71; 95\% CI,
   0.81 to 2.96).
   Conclusions Depressive symptoms and pain are independently associated
   with dialysis nonadherence and health services utilization. Depressive
   symptoms are also associated with mortality. Interventions to alleviate
   these symptoms have the potential to reduce costs and improve
   patient-centered outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{We systematically design materials using topology optimization to
   achieve prescribed nonlinear properties under finite deformation.
   Instead of a formal homogenization procedure, a numerical experiment is
   proposed to evaluate the material performance in longitudinal and
   transverse tensile tests under finite deformation, i.e. stress-strain
   relations and Poisson's ratio. By minimizing errors between actual and
   prescribed properties, materials are tailored to achieve the target.
   Both two dimensional (20) truss-based and continuum materials are
   designed with various prescribed nonlinear properties. The numerical
   examples illustrate optimized materials with rubber-like behavior and
   also optimized materials with extreme strain-independent Poisson's ratio

Abstract = {{We consider a parameter-driven regression model for binary time series,
   where serial dependence is introduced by an autocorrelated latent
   process incorporated into the logit link function. Unlike in the case of
   parameter-driven Poisson log-linear or negative binomial logit
   regression model studied in the literature for time series of counts,
   generalized linear model (GLM) estimation of the regression coefficient
   vector, which suppresses the latent process and maximizes the
   corresponding pseudo-likelihood, cannot produce a consistent estimator.
   As a remedial measure, in this article, we propose a modified GLM
   estimation procedure and show that the resulting estimator is consistent
   and asymptotically normal. Moreover, we develop two procedures for
   estimating the asymptotic covariance matrix of the estimator and
   establish their consistency property. Simulation studies are conducted
   to evaluate the finite-sample performance of the proposed procedures. An
   empirical example is also presented.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic materials are a class of materials that expand transversely when
   stretched longitudinally. Recently, auxetic materials are gaining
   special interest in the technical sectors mainly due to their attractive
   mechanical behavior. This paper reports, for the first time, the
   development of auxetic structures from composite materials and the
   characterization of their auxetic as well as mechanical properties. Five
   different auxetic structures were developed varying their structural
   angle using core reinforced braided composite rods, containing glass
   fibers for axial reinforcement, polyester filaments for braided
   structure and epoxy resin as the matrix. Auxetic behavior of these
   structures was studied in a tensile testing machine using an image-based
   tracking method. Additionally, an analytical model was used to calculate
   Poisson's ratio of these structures. According to experimental and
   analytical results, auxetic behavior and tensile characteristics of
   these structures were strongly dependant on their initial geometric
   configuration (i.e. structural angle). These novel auxetic structures
   exhibited Poisson's ratio in the range of -0.30 to -5.20. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Newcastle disease virus (NDV) causes a fast-spreading, highly contagious
   infectious disease in several bird species. Commercial poultry farms in
   Brazil were considered free of virulent NDV. Data on NDV infection
   levels in backyard poultry flocks and the epidemiology of the disease
   are limited. The aim of this study was to perform a NDV survey in
   backyard poultry from households flocks located around one of the main
   wintering sites for migratory wild birds in Brazil, and to identify
   potential risk factors associated with NDV. Backyard poultry may be
   sentinels and a source of infection for commercial poultry, since they
   may have as much contact with these birds as with migratory wild birds.
   Data were collected from 48 randomly selected households using an
   epidemiological questionnaire. Serum samples from poultry were tested
   for NDV antibodies using an ELISA, and tracheal and cloacal swabs were
   collected for NDV molecular detection. The risk factors were assessed
   using a multivariate Poisson regression with robust variance. The ELISA
   showed that 33.8\% of the serum samples were positive for anti-NDV
   antibodies and in 42 households (87.5\%) at least one NDV-positive bird
   was found. Tracheal and cloacal swabs were negative for NDV by real time
   RT-PCR, possible because within this region there might flow a low
   pathogenicity NDV strain, which can induce seroconversion with
   innaparent clinical findings. The prevalence ratio (PR) increased when
   farmers used their own replacement poultry to restock their flock (PR =
   1.64; 95\% CI: 1.11-2.42). Furthermore, the increasing distance of the
   household flock from the ``Laguna do Peixe{''} estuary was associated
   with decreasing NDV seropositivity (PR = 0.94; 95\% CI: 0.90-0.99). This
   is the first study in Brazil evaluating the presence of NDV and the
   associated risk factors in households with backyard poultry flocks. The
   great number of farms with seropositive birds indicates that the virus
   circulates in backyard flocks, and this breeding system may be a source
   of NDV. These data can be used to establish appropriate biosecurity and
   husbandry measures for this type of breeding system to prevent NDV
   spread in Brazil. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Recently, pathogen ecology has been recognized as an
   important epidemiological determinant of healthcare-associated
   infections (HAIs). Acinetobacter baumannii is one of the most important
   agents known to cause HAIs. It is widespread in healthcare settings and
   exhibits seasonal variations in incidence. Little is known about the
   impact of competition with other hospital pathogens on the incidence of
   A. baumannii infection. Methods: We conducted an ecological study,
   enrolling patients who presented with healthcare-associated bloodstream
   infections (HA-BSIs) from 2005 to 2010 at a 450-bed teaching hospital in
   Brazil. HA-BSIs were said to be present when bacteria or fungi were
   recovered from blood cultures collected at least three days after
   admission. Monthly incidence rates were calculated for all HA-BSIs
   (overall or caused by specific pathogens or groups of pathogens).
   Multivariate Poisson regression models were used to identify the impacts
   of the incidence of several pathogens on the incidence of A. baumannii.
   Results: The overall incidence rate of HA-BSI caused by A. baumannii was
   2.5 per 10,000 patient-days. In the multivariate analysis, the incidence
   of HA-BSI caused by A. baumannii was negatively associated with the
   incidence rates of HA-BSI due to Staphylococcus aureus (rate ratio
   {[}RR]=0.88; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI]=0.80-0.97), Enterobacter
   spp. (RR=0.84; 95\% CI=0.74-0.94) and a pool of less common
   gram-negative pathogens. Conclusions: Our results suggest that
   competition between pathogens influences the etiology of HA-BSIs. It
   would be beneficial to take these findings into account in infection
   control policies.}},

Abstract = {{The proportion of Pap smears containing an endocervical component (ECC)
   has been declining in Australia. Given that ECC negative (ECC-) smears
   may be associated with reduced sensitivity, we undertook a retrospective
   cohort study to estimate rates of histologically confirmed high-grade
   cervical abnormality (HGA) and cancer in women with negative Pap smears
   with and without an ECC. Women 18-69 years with at least two Pap smears
   between 1 January 2001 and 31 December 2010 with the first smear in that
   period (index smear) showing no abnormality were eligible. Follow-up
   ended at date of the first abnormal smear, date of histological
   diagnosis, date of hysterectomy, date of death, or 31 December 2010,
   whichever came first. ECC status was treated as a time varying exposure.
   Follow-up was split at each smear after the index smear. Poisson
   regression was used to estimate adjusted incidence rates and incidence
   rate ratios (IRR) by ECC status. The incidence rate of histologically
   confirmed HGA was significantly lower following ECC- smears than after
   ECC+ smears (adjusted IRR: 0.69, 95\% Confidence Interval (CI)
   0.62-0.77), particularly at older ages (interaction between ECC status
   and age, p = 0.001). In contrast, the overall rate of invasive cancer
   was not significantly different after ECC- than after ECC+ smears (IRR:
   1.27, 95\% CI 0.90-1.77). In conclusion, women had a lower rate of
   confirmed HGA and no significant increase in the rate of invasive
   cervical cancer following ECC- smears. This study does not support
   differential (accelerated) follow-up in women with a negative smear
   without an endocervical component.}},

   retrospective cohort analysis}},
Journal = {{BMC PUBLIC HEALTH}},

Abstract = {{Background: Tuberculosis (TB) is an occupational hazard for health care
   workers (HCWs) who are at greater risk of developing TB than the general
   population. The objective of this study was to compare the difference in
   TB incidence among HCWs with versus without a history of working in TB
   wards, to estimate the incidence of TB among HCWs, and to identify risk
   factors for TB disease in HCWs.
   Methods: A retrospective cohort study (January 2006 to December 2010)
   was conducted in three district hospitals in KwaZulu-Natal, South
   Africa. Data were abstracted via chart review from occupational health
   medical records. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed
   using a Poisson multilevel mixed model.
   Results: Of 1,313 (92\%) medical charts reviewed with data on location
   of work documented, 112 (9\%) cases of TB were identified. Among HCWs
   with TB 14 (13\%) had multidrug-resistant TB. Thirty-six (32\%) were
   cured, 33 (29\%) completed treatment, and 13 (12\%) died. An increased
   incidence of TB was reported for HCWs with a history of working in TB
   wards (incidence rate ratio {[}IRR] 2.03, 95\% CI 1.11-3.71), pediatric
   wards (IRR 1.82 95\% CI 1.07-3.10), outpatient departments (IRR 2.08
   95\% CI 1.23-3.52), and stores/workshop (IRR 2.38 95\% CI 1.06-5.34)
   compared with those without such a history. HCWs living with HIV had a
   greater incidence of TB (IRR 3.2, 95\% CI 1.54-6.66) than HIV-negative
   HCWs. TB incidence among HCWs was approximately two-fold greater than
   that of the general population over the study period.
   Conclusions: HCWs working in a TB ward had an increased incidence of TB.
   However, a greater incidence of TB was also found in HCWs working in
   other wards including pediatric wards, outpatient departments and
   stores. We also identified a greater incidence of TB among HCWs than the
   general population. These findings further support the need for improved
   infection control measures not only in TB or drug-resistant TB wards or
   areas perceived to be at high-risk but also throughout hospitals to
   protect HCWs. Additionally, it is recommended for occupational health
   services to routinely screen HCWs for TB and provide HCWs with access to
   care for TB and HIV.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To determine the association of HIV infection and
   immunodeficiency with incidence of ischemic stroke.
   Design: Cohort study of HIV-positive and matched HIV-negative adult
   Kaiser Permanente Northern and Southern California (KPNC and KPSC,
   respectively) members during 1996-2011 (KPNC) or 2000-2011 (KPSC).
   Methods: We used Poisson models to obtain rate ratios for incident
   ischemic stroke associated with HIV infection, both overall and
   stratified by CD4(+) cell counts (cells/mu l) and HIV RNA copies
   (copies/mu l), with HIV-negative individuals as the reference group. We
   also obtained rate ratios for risk factors in the HIV-positive subset.
   Results: Among 24 768 HIV-positive and 257 600 HIV-negative individuals,
   the ischemic stroke rate per 100 000 person-years was 125 (n = 151
   events) for HIV-positive and 74 (n 1128 events) for HIV-negative
   individuals, with an adjusted rate ratio of 1.4 {[}95\% confidence
   interval (CI) 1.2-1.7). Compared with HIV-negative individuals,
   HIV-positive individuals with recent CD4(+) cell counts of 500 cells/ml
   at least (rate ratio 1.0, 95\% CI 0.8-1.4) or recent HIV RNA less than
   500 copies/ml (rate ratio 1.1, 95\% CI 0.9-1.4) had no excess risk of
   ischemic stroke, with similar results for HIV-positive individuals with
   nadir CD4(+) cell counts of 500 cells/ml at least (rate ratio 1.4, 95\%
   CI 0.8-2.2) or 200-499 cells/mu l (rate ratio 1.2, 95\% CI 0.9-1.5).
   Among HIV-positive individuals only, recent CD4(+) cell count less than
   200 cells/ml (rate ratio 2.5, 95\% CI 1.3-4.6) was associated with an
   increased risk of ischemic stroke after adjustment for recent HIV RNA
   and nadir CD4(+) cell count, whereas recent HIV RNA and nadir CD4(+)
   were not independent risk factors.
   Conclusion: Ischemic stroke incidence in HIV-positive individuals with
   high CD4(+) cell count or low HIV RNA is similar to that of HIV-negative
   individuals. (C) 2014 Wolters Kluwer Health vertical bar Lippincott

Abstract = {{Background: We investigated whether the reported lower incidence of
   prostate cancer in HIV-positive men is a result of confounding factors
   or reduced screening.
   Methods: We conducted a cohort study of 17,424 HIV-positive and 182,799
   HIV-negative men enrolled in Kaiser Permanente (KP). Subjects were
   followed from the first KP enrollment after January 01, 1996 for KP
   Northern California (KPNC) and January 01, 2000 for KP Southern
   California until the earliest of prostate cancer diagnosis, loss to
   follow-up, or December 31, 2007. Poisson regression was used to compare
   cancer rates by HIV status adjusting for age, race, smoking,
   alcohol/drug abuse, overweight/obesity, and diabetes. For the KPNC
   subset, we analyzed additional available data by HIV status on
   testosterone deficiency, and on prostate-specific antigen (PSA) tests as
   a proxy for cancer screening.
   Results: The prostate cancer incidence rate was 102/100,000 person-years
   in HIV-positive men (n = 74 cases) and 131/100,000 person-years in
   HIV-negative men (n = 1195 cases), with an adjusted rate ratio of 0.73
   (95\% confidence interval: 0.57 to 0.92; P = 0.008). The reduced risk
   among HIV-positive men was greater for higher-stage cancers, which are
   less likely to be biased by screening differences than lower-stage
   cancers. In the KPNC subset, more HIV-positive (90.8\%) than
   HIV-negative men (86.2\%) received a PSA test by age 55 (P < 0.001).
   Decreased risk for HIV-positive men remained when examined only among
   those with a previous PSA test, and with adjustment for testosterone
   deficiency (rate ratio = 0.55; 95\% confidence interval: 0.39 to 0.80; P
   = 0.001).
   Conclusions: Prostate cancer incidence rates are lower in HIV-positive
   compared with HIV-negative men, which is not explained by screening
   differences or the risk factors evaluated.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The study aimed to compare the socio-demographic, host and
   clinical characteristics, seasonality and antimicrobial susceptibility
   of Typhoidal Salmonella (Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi and
   Paratyphi) (TS) with diarrhea between urban and rural Bangladesh.
   Methods: Relevant information of 77/25,767 (0.30\%) and 290/17,622
   (1.65\%) patients positive with TS (in stool) were extracted from the
   data archive of Diarrheal Disease Surveillance System of icddr,b (urban
   Dhaka and rural Matlab Hospitals respectively) during 2000-2012.
   Comparison group (diarrhea patients negative for TS) was randomly
   selected from the database (1:3 ratio). Two poisson regression models
   were investigated for modelling seasonal effects on the number of cases.
   Results: Salmonella Typhi was more frequently isolated in Dhaka than
   Matlab (57\% vs. 5\%, p < 0.001); while Salmonella Paratyphi was more
   frequent in Matlab than Dhaka (96\% vs. 43\%; p < 0.001). Fever {[}adj.
   OR-5.86 (95\% CI: 2.16, 15.94)], antimicrobial use at home {[}5.08
   (2.60, 9.90)], and fecal red blood cells {[}2.53 (1.38, 4.64)] were
   significantly associated with detection of TS in stool of patient from
   Dhaka. For Matlab, the correlates were, vomiting {[}1.88 (1.35, 2.64)],
   fecal macrophage {[}1.89 (1.29, 2.74)] in addition to fever and duration
   of diarrhea and antimicrobial use. At Dhaka, all Salmonella Typhi
   isolates were susceptible to ceftriaxone; while in Dhaka and Matlab
   however, for ciprofloxacin it was 45\% and 91\%, respectively.
   Susceptibility to chloramphenicol, ampicillin,
   trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole and nalidixic acid ranged from 12\%-58\%.
   Salmonella Paratyphi were susceptible to ceftriaxone (99\%). A
   significant seasonal trend and year difference (before and after 2007)
   for Matlab was observed (p < 0.001 for all effects). Dhaka does not show
   significant year or seasonal effects (p = 0.07 for years and p = 0.81
   and p = 0.18 for the cos and sin components, respectively). While not
   significant, two seasonal peaks were observed in Dhaka (January-February
   and September-November); while a single peak (August-November) was
   observed in Matlab.
   Conclusions: Proportion of serovar distribution of TS and their clinical
   characteristics, antimicrobial susceptibility and seasonal pattern were
   different among diarrhea patients in urban Dhaka and rural Matlab of
   Bangladesh.}},

Abstract = {{We describe mechanical metamaterials created by folding flat sheets in
   the tradition of origami, the art of paper folding, and study them in
   terms of their basic geometric and stiffness properties, as well as load
   bearing capability. A periodic Miura-ori pattern and a non-periodic Ron
   Resch pattern were studied. Unexceptional coexistence of positive and
   negative Poisson's ratio was reported for Miura-ori pattern, which are
   consistent with the interesting shear behavior and infinity bulk modulus
   of the same pattern. Unusually strong load bearing capability of the Ron
   Resch pattern was found and attributed to the unique way of folding.
   This work paves the way to the study of intriguing properties of origami
   structures as mechanical metamaterials.}},

Title = {{Temporal evolution and spatial distribution of maternal death}},
Journal = {{REVISTA DE SAUDE PUBLICA}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{48}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{662-670}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To analyze the temporal evolution of maternal mortality and
   its spatial distribution.
   METHODS: Ecological study with a sample made up of 845 maternal deaths
   in women between 10 and 49 years, registered from 1999 to 2008 in the
   state of Rio Grande do Sul, Southern Brazil. Data were obtained from
   Information System on Mortality of Ministry of Health. The maternal
   mortality ratio and the specific maternal mortality ratio were
   calculated from records, and analyzed by the Poisson regression model.
   In the spatial distribution, three maps of the state were built with the
   rates in the geographical macro-regions, in 1999, 2003, and 2008.
   RESULTS: There was an increase of 2.0\% in the period of ten years (95\%
   CI 1.00; 1.04; p = 0.01), with no significant change in the magnitude of
   the maternal mortality ratio. The Serra macro-region presented the
   highest maternal mortality ratio (1.15, 95\% CI 1.08; 1.21; p < 0.001).
   Most deaths in Rio Grande do Sul were of white women over 40 years, with
   a lower level of education. The time of delivery/abortion and postpartum
   are times of increased maternal risk, with a greater negative impact of
   direct causes such as hypertension and bleeding.
   CONCLUSIONS: The lack of improvement in maternal mortality ratio
   indicates that public policies had no impact on women's reproductive and
   maternal health. It is needed to qualify the attention to women's
   health, especially in the prenatal period, seeking to identify and
   prevent risk factors, as a strategy of reducing maternal death.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials (or metamaterials) are those with a negative Poisson
   ratio (NPR) and that display the unexpected property of lateral
   expansion when stretched, as well as an equal and opposing densification
   when compressed. Such geometries are being progressively employed in the
   development of novel products, especially in the fields of intelligent
   expandable actuators, shape morphing structures and minimally invasive
   implantable devices. Although several micromanufacturing technologies
   have already been applied to the development of auxetic geometries and
   devices, additional precision is needed to take full advantage of their
   special mechanical properties. In this study we present a very promising
   approach for the development of auxetic metamaterials and devices based
   on the use of direct laser writing. The process stands out for its
   precision and complex three-dimensional (3D) geometries attainable
   without the need of supporting structures. To our knowledge it
   represents one of the first examples of the application of this
   technology to the manufacture of auxetic geometries and mechanical
   metamaterials, with details even more remarkable than those shown in
   very recent studies, almost reaching the current limit of this additive
   manufacturing technology. We have used some special 3D auxetic designs

Abstract = {{Purpose Suspected diabetogenic effects or drug indication may increase
   testing for diabetes mellitus (DM), resulting in measurement bias when
   evaluating diabetogenic drug effects. We sought to evaluate the validity
   of electronic health record data in determining DM risk.
   Methods We used time-dependent Cox proportional hazard models within a
   retrospective cohort design to assess associations between use of
   antihypertensives, statins, atypical antipsychotics, and
   antidepressants, and two endpoints: (i) DM onset defined as fasting
   blood glucose (BG) >= 126 mg/dl, random BG >= 200 mg/dl, HbA1c >= 7.0\%,
   or antidiabetic drug initiation; and (ii) first negative DM test. We
   used Poisson regression to assess the influence of these drugs on DM
   testing rates. Patients aged 35-64 years enrolled in Kaiser Permanente
   Northwest between 1997 and 2010 entered the cohort at the first negative
   BG test after >= 6 months without manifest DM.
   Results All drug classes showed significant associations not only with
   DM onset but also with first negative BG test and with DM testing rates.
   Antipsychotics had the greatest diabetogenic risk (adjusted hazard ratio
   {[}HR] = 1.73 {[}1.44-2.08]), the greatest propensity for a first
   negative test (adjusted HR = 1.87 {[}1.74-2.01]), and the highest
   testing rate (adjusted rate ratio = 1.76 {[}1.72-1.81]. Although
   renin-angiotensin system blockers and calcium channel blockers have
   shown no diabetogenic risk in clinical trials, both were associated with
   DM (HR= 1.19 {[}1.12-1.26] and 1.27 {[}1.17-1.38]), a negative glucose
   test (1.38 {[}1.35-1.41] and 1.24 {[}1.20-1.28]), and increased testing
   rates (rate ratio = 1.26 {[}1.24-1.27] and 1.27 {[}1.25-1.28]).
   Conclusion Caution should be used when diabetogenic risk is evaluated
   using data that rely on DM testing in general practice. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{Auxetic spacer fabrics are a novel kind of three-dimensional (3D) fabric
   structure with a negative Poisson's ratio. They have found a number of
   applications in functional garments, protective pads and sportive shoes
   due to their unusual properties. In this paper, a study on deformation
   behaviors of 3D spacer fabrics that could be fabricated on a large scale
   is reported. Through experimental observations of deformation of a basic
   hexagonal unit at different tensile strains, two different geometrical
   models are proposed for the fabric structure when extended in the course
   direction and wale direction, respectively. Based on the geometrical
   models, two semi-empirical equations between the Poisson's ratio and
   tensile strain are established for both tensile directions. The study
   shows that the established semi-empirical equations fit well with
   experimental results. Therefore, they could be used in the design and
   prediction of 3D auxetic spacer fabrics with different values of
   geometrical parameters.}},

Abstract = {{To identify events that could predict province-level frequency of
   foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) outbreaks in Iran, 5707 outbreaks reported
   from April 1995 to March 2002 were studied. A zero-inflated negative
   binomial model was used to estimate the probability of a `no-outbreak'
   status and the number of outbreaks in a province, using the number of
   previous occurrences of FMD for the same or adjacent provinces and
   season as covariates. For each province, the probability of observing no
   outbreak was negatively associated with the number of outbreaks in the
   same province in the previous month (odds ratio {[}OR] = 0.06, 95\%
   confidence interval {[}CI]: 0.01, 0.30) and in `the second previous
   month' (OR = 0.10, 95\% CI: 0.02, 0.51), the total number of outbreaks
   in the second previous month in adjacent provinces (OR = 0.57, 95\% CI:
   0.36, 0.91) and the season (winter {[}OR = 0.18, 95\% CI: 0.06, 0.55]
   and spring {[}OR = 0.27, 95\% CI: 0.09, 0.81], compared with summer).
   The expected number of outbreaks in a province was positively associated
   with number of outbreaks in the same province in previous month
   (coefficient {[}coef] = 0.74, 95\% CI: 0.66, 0.82) and in the second
   previous month (coef = 0.23,95\% CI: 0.16, 0.31), total number of
   outbreaks in adjacent provinces in the previous month (coef = 0.32, 95\%
   CI: 0.22, 0.41) and season (fall {[}coef = 0.20, 95\% CI: 0.07, 0.33]
   and spring {[}coef = 0.18, 95\% CI: 0.05, 0.31], compared to summer);
   however, number of outbreaks was negatively associated with the total
   number of outbreaks in adjacent provinces in the second previous month
   (coef = -0.19, 95\% CI: -0.28, -0.09). The findings indicate that the
   probability of an outbreak (and the expected number of outbreaks if any)
   may be predicted based on previous province information, which could
   help decision-makers allocate resources more efficiently for
   province-level disease control measures. Further, the study illustrates
   use of zero inflated negative binomial model to study diseases
   occurrence where disease is infrequently observed. (C) 2014 Elsevier

   distributions were suitable to describe pathogen distribution at the
   high and medium levels, coefficient of variation modified (CV{*})

Title = {{Negative poisson's ratio in single-layer black phosphorus}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The Poisson's ratio is a fundamental mechanical property that relates
   the resulting lateral strain to applied axial strain. Although this
   value can theoretically be negative, it is positive for nearly all
   materials, though negative values have been observed in so-called
   auxetic structures. However, nearly all auxetic materials are bulk
   materials whose microstructure has been specifically engineered to
   generate a negative Poisson's ratio. Here we report using
   first-principles calculations the existence of a negative Poisson's
   ratio in a single-layer, two-dimensional material, black phosphorus. In
   contrast to engineered bulk auxetics, this behaviour is intrinsic for
   single-layer black phosphorus, and originates from its puckered
   structure, where the pucker can be regarded as a re-entrant structure
   that is comprised of two coupled orthogonal hinges. As a result of this
   atomic structure, a negative Poisson's ratio is observed in the
   out-of-plane direction under uniaxial deformation in the direction
   parallel to the pucker.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the diversity of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), polymers, and the
   preparation processes of the composites, CNT-filled polymeric composites
   present various piezoresistive properties. One puzzling issue is the
   concurrence of a negative piezoresistive effect and a positive
   piezoresistive effect in composites with different polymer matrixes. In
   this paper, we present a microscopic view of the nature of the positive
   piezoresistive effect and its dependence on the polymer matrix types
   based on the model in our previous study, in which the piezoresistive
   behavior was tailored by a parameter-the average junction gap variation
   (AJGV)-describing the statistical property of the CNT conductive
   network. The microscopic movement process of CNTs embedded in a polymer
   matrix was analyzed and then the Poisson's ratio of the polymer matrix
   was determined as a key factor that is in charge of negative or positive
   piezoresistive properties. The obstacle effect of polymer chains on the
   movement of CNTs was also found to be responsible for the positive
   piezoresistive effect as it affects the AJGV in compressive strain.
   Based on numerical simulations of CNT network deformation with different
   Poisson's ratios and minimum junction gaps caused by the obstacle
   effect, the positive piezoresistive effect was found resulted from the
   obstacle effect on CNT junction gap variations that exceeds the initial
   value of the AJGV caused by the CNT network deformation, and only occur
   under the precondition of the polymer matrixes with a large Poisson's
   ratio close to 0.5. The conclusions were then verified experimentally
   using composites with two kinds of polymer matrixes with significantly
   different Poisson's ratios.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of the present study is to investigate the influences of
   changes in the microstructure of the re-entrant auxetic foam during the
   conversion-based fabrication on its elastic and plastic behaviors. The
   20 re-entrant honeycomb is used for the finite element (FE) study. The
   FE method is firstly validated with theoretical calculations. Then, for
   the first time, the irregularity of the re-entrant honeycomb is
   considered in the study of irregularity mechanical relationship.
   Compared to the regular re-entrant honeycomb, the irregular structures
   tend to have lower magnitudes of the effective elastic modulus, yield
   strength and Poisson's ratio. It is also highlighted that the
   irregularity has indirect effects on the effective mechanical properties
   of the re-entrant honeycomb by changing its relative density. Moreover,
   the residual convex units (the uncompressed convex corners of the
   conventional foams during the conversion-based fabrication) make the
   Poisson's ratio of the re-entrant honeycomb less negative. Therefore,
   the superior abilities brought by the negative Poisson's ratio such as
   the shear modulus and indentation hardness can be impaired by the
   residual convex units. Besides, the role of the residual stress is also
   explored with FE methods. The present study is helpful to the
   understanding of the structure mechanical relationship in the auxetic
   foams. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Measurement of the impedance of aqueous solutions of KCl: An analysis
   using an extension of the Poisson-Nernst-Planck model}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the frequency dependence of the real and imaginary parts
   of the electric impedance of a cell with titanium electrodes, filled
   with aqueous solution of KCl in different concentrations. Our
   experimental data are interpreted by means of an extension of the
   Poisson-Nernst-Planck model, assuming that the electrodes are not
   blocking and well described by Ohmic boundary conditions, and that two
   groups of ions are responsible for the electric conduction. One group is
   due to the dissociation of KCl in water (majority carriers), the other
   to the impurities dissolved in water or present in KCl (minority
   carriers), whose bulk density is very small with respect to first group.
   The agreement between the experimental data and the theoretical
   predictions is good, taking into account the small number of free
   parameters entering in the model. In particular, the diffusion
   coefficient for the potassium and chloride ions well comparer with those
   reported in literature. According to our analysis, the role of the
   carriers related to the impurities present in the solution play a
   fundamental role in the fit of the experimental data in the low
   frequency region. The presented model where two groups of ions are
   present, with the assumption of equal mobilities for positive and
   negative charges in a group, is motivated by the experimental evidence
   that in aqueous solution of KCl, K+, and Cl- have approximately the same
   mobilities. Since the PNP model for an electrolytic solution of the case
   considered by us predicts an electric response similar to that of an
   electrolytic solution where the positive and negative ions have
   different mobility, a comparison with the results reported recently by
   Macdonald is presented {[}J. R. Macdonald, Electrochim. Acta, 123, 535
   (2014)]. Alternative interpretation of our experimental results related
   to the assumption of non-blocking electrodes is also discussed. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Polarisation orientation effects in piezo-active composites based on
   relaxor-ferroelectric single crystals of
   (1-x)Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O-3-xPbTiO(3) open up new possibilities to vary the
   effective electromechanical properties and related parameters. In the
   present paper the hydrostatic performance of 2-2 parallel-connected
   single crystal / auxetic polymer composites is studied for x = 0.28 -
   0.33 and two poling directions of the single-crystal component, {[}001]
   (4mm symmetry) and {[}011] (mm2 symmetry) in the perovskite unit cell.
   The effect of the orientation of the main crystallographic axes in the
   single-crystal component on the hydrostatic piezoelectric coefficients
   d{*}(h), e(h){*} and squared figure of merit d{*}(h)g(h){*} is analysed
   for three rotation modes in single crystals and at various anisotropy of
   their piezoelectric and elastic properties. The role of the auxetic
   polymer component is emphasised in the context of the large hydrostatic
   parameters and anisotropy of squared figures of merit d{*}(3j)g(3j){*}
   (j = 1, 2 and 3). The largest maximum values of d{*}(h) and e{*}(h)
   (1990 pC/N and 42.5 C/m(2), respectively) are achieved in the composite
   based on {[}011]-poled 0.71Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O-3-0.29PbTiO(3).}},

Abstract = {{This study presents a visual model for analyzing the vibration modes of
   piano soundboards by combining the tools of finite element analysis and
   computer-aided design. Based on the predicted results from the model,
   changes of natural frequency and maximum displacement of the soundboard
   as a function of wood properties, structure, and rib size were
   discussed. Wood grain direction affected the mode shape of the
   soundboard. Among the 10 property factors investigated, density
   presented the greatest impact to the vibration mode of the soundboard
   followed by Young's modulus, shear modulus, and Poisson's ratio.
   Increasing the thickness of the resonance board and the use of ribs had
   positive impacts on the natural frequency of the soundboard. However,
   the amount of natural frequency was decreased for those that were lower
   than 100 Hz. Natural frequency increased as the intensity, density, and
   size of ribs increased. Rib height had a greater effect on the variation
   of natural frequency than the intensity, density, and rib width. In
   general, increases in rib intensity, density of wood species, and rib
   width presented negative effects on the maximum displacement.}},

Abstract = {{Non-Hodgkin lymphoma arising in the context of immunosuppression is an
   important adverse outcome after solid organ transplantation. Diffuse
   large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most commonly diagnosed subtype of
   post-transplantation non-Hodgkin lymphoma, but few studies of transplant
   recipients have examined subtype-specific risks. Therefore, we examined
   DLBCL risk in the Transplant Cancer Match Study, including
   registry-based cancer ascertainment among 96,615 solid organ transplants
   performed from 2000 to 2008. We determined standardized incidence ratios
   (SIRs) and 95\% confidence intervals comparing DLBCL risk in transplant
   recipients with that in the general population, and used multivariable
   Poisson regression models to assess the impact of potential risk
   factors. We identified 321 incident cases of DLBCL, over 12 times more
   than expected based on general population rates (SIR = 12.6, 95\%
   confidence interval = 11.2-14.0). SIRs were highest in young recipients
   and those receiving a lung or pancreas/kidney-pancreas transplant, and
   were greatly elevated for extranodal DLBCLs at the site of the
   transplantation compared with other sites. DLBCL risk was highest in the
   first year following transplantation, and SIRs for early-onset DLBCL
   risk were elevated in association with Epstein-Barr virus-negative
   serostatus and use of polyclonal antibody induction therapy. In
   conclusion, associations between recipient and transplant factors and
   post-transplantation DLBCL risk suggest a complicated interrelationship
   among multiple risk factors and timing of disease. (C) 2014 Wiley

Abstract = {{Solids that exhibit negative Poisson's ratio are called auxetic
   materials. This paper examines the extent of transverse shear
   deformation with reference to bending deformation in simply supported
   auxetic plates as a ratio of Mindlin-to-Kirchhoff plate deflection for
   polygonal plates in general, with special emphasis on rectangular
   plates. Results for square plates show that the Mindlin plate deflection
   approximates the Kirchhoff plate deflection not only when the plate
   thickness is negligible, as is obviously known, but also when (a) the
   Poisson's ratio of the plate is very negative under all load
   distributions, as well as (b) at the central portion of the plate when
   the load is uniformly distributed. Hence geometrically thick plates are
   mechanically equivalent to thin plates if the plate Poisson's ratio is
   sufficiently negative. The high suppression of shear deformation in
   favor of bending deformation in auxetic plates suggests its usefulness
   for bending-based plate sensors that require larger difference in the
   in-plane strains between the opposing plate surfaces with minimal
   transverse deflection.}},

Pages = {{354-361}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Scientific investigations of structures characterised by auxetic
   properties conducted so far have led to analyses on a molecular and
   macroscopic scale and few studies have been concerned with descriptions
   of auxetic models which could find application in objects of everyday
   use. The aim of this paper was to carry out numerical modelling and
   physical verification of furniture seat quality made up of auxetic
   pressure springs. The authors decided to determine system stiffness and
   distribution of contact pressure on their surface. The performed
   detailed numerical analysis made it possible to evaluate the comfort of
   seat utilisation as well as to assess the impact of seat modification
   with NHE35 foam on changes of this comfort. In addition, it was
   demonstrated that numerical modelling may provide a useful tool for
   rapid prototyping of complex, multilayer systems manufactured from
   materials with non-linear characteristics. Results of numerical
   calculations were verified in the laboratory determining the scale of
   errors with which these results should be interpreted. (c) 2014 Elsevier

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The behavior of Rayleigh surface waves and the first mode of the Love
   waves in isotropic media with positive and negative Poisson's ratio is
   compared. It is shown that the Rayleigh wave velocity increases with
   decreasing Poisson's ratio, and it increases especially rapidly for
   negative Poisson's ratios less than -0.75. It is demonstrated that, for
   positive Poisson's ratios, the vertical component of the Rayleigh wave
   displacements decays with depth after some initial increase, while for
   negative Poisson's ratios, there is a monotone decrease. The Rayleigh
   waves are characterized by elliptic trajectories of the particle motion
   with the change of the rotation direction at critical depths and by the
   linear vertical polarization at these depths. It is found that the
   elliptic orbits are less elongated and the critical depths are greater
   for negative Poisson's ratios. It is shown that the stress distribution
   in the Rayleigh waves varies nonmonotonically with the dimensionless
   depth as (positive or negative) Poisson's ratio varies. The stresses
   increase strongly only as Poisson's ratio tends to -1. It is shown that,
   in the case of an incompressible thin covering layer, the velocity of
   the first mode of the Love waves strongly increases for negative
   Poisson's ratios of the half-space material. If the thickness of the
   incompressible layer is large, then the wave very weakly penetrates into
   the half-space for any value of its Poisson's ratio. For negative
   Poisson's ratios, the Love wave in a layer and a half-space is mainly
   localized in the covering layer for any values of its thickness and
   weakly penetrates into the half-space. For the first mode of the Love
   waves, it was discovered that there is a strong increase in the maximum
   of one of the shear stresses on the interface between the covering layer
   and the half-space as Poisson's ratios of both materials decrease. For
   the other shear stress, there is a stress jump on the interface and a
   more complicated dependence of the stress on Poisson's ratio on both
   sides of the interface.}},

Abstract = {{One of the methods in understanding the real microstructure of auxetic
   material is by separating it into several simplified structures that
   have distinct mechanisms. Among those simplified structures are chiral
   and re-entrant structures. This paper adapts a 2D re-entrant structure

   fundamental characteristics underlying the main characteristics of
   auxetic materials. The energy methods of solid mechanics along with
   numerical methods are used to study the fundamental concept of auxetic
   materials. Understanding the characteristics of the re-entrant structure
   will lead to the better comprehension of other structures of auxetic
   materials, which will eventually contribute to the advance of research
   in this new class of materials. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Silica or SiO2, the main constituent of Earth's rocks has several 3D
   complex crystalline and amorphous phases, but it does not have a
   graphitelike layered structure in 3D. Our theoretical analysis and
   numerical calculations from the first principles predict a single-layer
   honeycomblike allotrope, ha silica, which can be viewed to be derived
   from the oxidation of silicene and it has intriguing atomic structure
   with reentrant bond angles in hexagons. It is a wide band gap
   semiconductor, which attains remarkable electromechanical properties
   showing geometrical changes under an external electric field. In
   particular, it is an auxetic metamaterial with a negative Poisson's
   ratio and has a high piezoelectric coefficient. While it can form stable
   bilayer and multilayer structures, its nanoribbons can show metallic or
   semiconducting behavior depending on their chirality. Coverage of
   dangling Si orbitals by foreign adatoms can attribute new
   functionalities to ha silica. In particular, Si2O5, where Si atoms are
   saturated by oxygen atoms from top and bottom sides alternatingly can
   undergo a structural transformation to make silicatene, another stable,
   single layer structure of silica.}},

Abstract = {{It is known that modes in axially uniform waveguides exhibit
   backward-propagation characteristics for which group and phase
   velocities have opposite signs. For elastic plates, group velocities of
   backward Lamb waves depend only on Poisson's ratio. This paper explores
   ways to achieve a large group velocity of a backward mode in hollow
   cylinders by changing the outer to inner radius ratio, in order that
   such a mode with strong backward-propagation characteristics may be used
   in acoustic logging tools. Dispersion spectra of guided waves in hollow
   cylinders of varying radii are numerically simulated to explore the
   existence of backward modes and to choose the clearly visible backward
   modes with high group velocities. Analyses of group velocity
   characteristics show that only a small number of low order backward
   modes are suitable for practical use, and the radius ratio to reach the
   highest group velocity corresponds to the accidental degeneracy of
   neighboring pure transverse and compressional modes at the wavenumber k
   = 0. It is also shown that large group velocities of backward waves are
   achievable in hollow cylinders made of commonly encountered materials,
   which may bring cost benefits when using acoustic devices which take

Abstract = {{The number of lymph nodes retrieved from the specimen may be a surrogate
   measure of the adequacy of extensive colon cancer surgery, but many
   variables may influence the total lymph node yield of any specimen. We
   examined which variables would be influential both for negative and
   positive node sampling.The combined results from 428 patients from three
   hospitals A to C treated in 2007-2009 with single colon cancers having
   R0 segmental resections were analysed. The surgical technique and
   pathology staining methods were slightly different between the
   hospitals.The mean number of lymph nodes was 15.8 (range 1-60). Twelve
   or more lymph nodes were harvested in 78\% of the specimens. In the
   multivariate Poisson regression analysis of all TNM stages, the factors
   associated with the total lymph node harvest were age, pathology
   handling, tumour location and size (p<0.001), whereas for TNM stage III
   alone the pathology handling (p<0.001) and a radical operating technique
   (p=0.003) were highly significant. The total number of lymph nodes was
   the only significant factor for the number of positive lymph nodes
   (Posln) according to the multivariate negative regression analysis
   (p=0.02) but the analysis of the lymph node ratio (LNR) detected no
   statistically significant variable.Several factors, and especially the
   specimen processing technique, were important for the total number of
   harvested lymph nodes. The number of Posln varied between segments and
   increased with the total number of harvested lymph nodes, but for LNR no
   variable was important. LNR seemed to abolish the combined effect of
   tumour location and the total lymph node yield in prognosis assessment.}},

Abstract = {{Biological materials exhibiting non-self-similar hierarchical structures
   possess desirable mechanical properties. Motivated by their penetration
   resistance and fracture toughness, the mechanical performance of model
   materials with non-self-similar hierarchical structures was explored and
   the distinct advantages were identified. A numerical model was
   developed, based on microscopic observation of enamel prisms.
   Computational simulations showed that the systems with non-self-similar
   hierarchy displayed lateral expansion when subjected to longitudinal
   tensile loading, which reflected negative Poisson's ratio and potential
   for greater volume strain energies when compared with conventional
   materials with positive Poisson's ratio. Employing the non-self-similar
   hierarchical design, the capability of resilience can be improved.
   Additionally, the non-self-similar hierarchical structure exhibited
   larger toughness, resulting from the large pull-out work of the
   reinforcements. The findings of this study not only elucidate the
   deformation mechanisms of biological materials with non-self-similar
   hierarchical structure, but also provide a new path for bio-inspired
   materials design. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Estimating overall exposure effects for zero-inflated regression models

Journal = {{STATISTICAL METHODS IN MEDICAL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{257-278}},

Abstract = {{Zero-inflated (ZI) models, which may be derived as a mixture involving a
   degenerate distribution at value zero and a distribution such as
   negative binomial (ZINB), have proved useful in dental and other areas
   of research by accommodating extra' zeroes in the data. Used in
   conjunction with generalised linear models, they allow
   covariate-adjusted inference of an exposure effect on the mixing
   probability and on the mean for the non-degenerate distribution.
   However, these models do not directly provide covariate-adjusted
   inference for the overall exposure effect. Focusing on the ZINB and ZI
   beta binomial models, we propose an approach that uses model-predicted
   values for each person under each exposure state. This average predicted
   value' method allows covariate-adjusted estimation of flexible functions
   of exposure group means such as the difference or ratio. A second
   approach considers a log link for both components of the ZINB to allow a
   direct approach to estimation. We apply these new methods to a study of
   dental caries in very low birth weight adolescents. Simulation studies
   show good bias and robustness properties for both approaches under
   various scenarios. Robustness diminishes when there is exposure group
   imbalance for a covariate with a large effect.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the present study was to assess the impact of malocclusion on
   oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) among preschool children
   and their families. This study involved 732 preschoolers.
   Parents/caregivers filled out the Brazilian version of the Early
   Childhood Oral Health Impact Scale (B-ECOHIS) and a questionnaire
   addressing sociodemographic data. Overbite, overjet, and crossbite were
   recorded during the clinical examination. Bivariate and multiple Poisson
   regression analyses were performed and prevalence ratio (PR) were
   calculated (alpha=5\%). The prevalence of negative impact from
   malocclusion on OHRQoL was 27.6\% among the children and 22.3\% among
   the families. Mother's schooling (PR=1.37; 95\% CI: 1.10-1.70),
   parent's/caregiver's assessment of child's oral health (PR=2.07; 95\%
   CI: 1.60-2.58), history of toothache (PR=3.84; 95\% CI: 2.34-6.30), and
   visits to the dentist (PR=0.59; 95\% CI: 0.37-0.94) remained
   significantly associated with OHRQoL in the final model for the
   children, whereas parent's/caregiver's assessment of child's oral health
   (PR=2.32; 95\% CI: 1.71-3.14) and history of toothache (PR=2.28; 95\%
   CI: 1.69-3.09) remained significantly associated with OHRQoL for the
   families. Malocclusion was not associated with a negative impact on
   OHRQoL. In contrast, parents'/caregivers' perceptions regarding the oral
   health of their children and a history of toothache were predictors of a
   negative impact on the OHRQoL.}},

Title = {{Assessing remedies for missing weekly individual exposure in sport
   injury studies}},
Journal = {{INJURY PREVENTION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{177-182}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Background In sport injury epidemiology research, the injury incidence
   rate (IR) is defined as the number of injuries over a given length of
   participation time (exposure, eg, game hours). However, it is common
   that individual weekly exposure is missing due to requirements of
   personnel at every game to record exposure information. Ignoring this
   issue will lead to an inflated injury rate because the total exposure
   serves as the denominator of IR, where the number of injury cases were
   captured accurately.
   Purpose This paper used data collected from a large community cohort
   study in youth ice hockey as an example, and compared six methods to
   handle missing weekly exposure of individual players.
   Methods The six methods to handle missing weekly exposures include
   available case analysis, last observation carried forward, mean
   imputation, multiple imputation, bootstrapping and best/worst case
   analysis. To estimate injury rate ratios (IRRs) between Alberta and
   Quebec, as in the original study, three statistical models were applied
   to the imputed datasets: Poisson, zeroinflated Poisson and negative
   binomial regression models.
   Results The final sample for imputation included 2098 players for whom
   12.5\% of weekly game hours were missing. Estimated IRs and IRRs with
   CIs from different imputation methods were similar when the proportion
   of missing was small. Simulations showed that mean and multiple
   imputations provide the least biased estimates of IRR when the
   proportion of missing was large.
   Conclusions Complicated methods, like multiple imputation or bootstrap,
   are not superior over the mean imputation, a much simpler method, in
   handling missing weekly exposure of injury data where exposures were
   missing at random.}},

Title = {{Effect of Rosuvastatin on Repeat Heart Failure Hospitalizations The

Abstract = {{Objectives This study sought to examine the effect of statin therapy
   hospitalizations for heart failure (HFH) in patients in the CORONA
   (Controlled Rosuvastatin Multinational Trial in Heart Failure) trial.
   Background HFH is an important, frequently recurrent event. Conventional
   time-to-first event analyses do not take account repeat events. We used
   a number of statistical approaches to examine the effect of treatment on
   first and repeat HFH in the CORONA trial.
   Methods In the CORONA trial, 5,011 patients >= 60 years of age with
   chronic New York Heart Association functional classes II to IV systolic
   heart failure resulting from ischemia were randomized to receive
   rosuvastatin or placebo. Poisson, Andersen-Gill, and negative binomial
   methods (NB) were used to analyze the effect of rosuvastatin on HFH, and
   the NB and a parametric joint frailty model (JF) were used to examine
   this effect while accounting for the competing risk of cardiovascular
   (CV) death. Rosuvastatin/ placebo rate ratios were calculated, both
   unadjusted and adjusted.
   Results A total of 1,291 patients had 1 or more HFH (750 of these had a
   single HFH only), and there were a total of 2,408 HFHs. The hazard ratio
   for the conventional time-to-first event analysis for HFH was 0.91 (95\%
   confidence interval {[} CI]: 0.82 to 1.02, p = 0.105). In contrast, the
   NB on repeat hospitalizations gave an unadjusted RR (RR) for HFH of 0.86
   (95\% CI: 0.75 to 0.99, p = 0.030), adjusted 0.82 (95\% CI: 0.72 to
   0.92, p = 0.001), and after including CV death as the last event,
   adjusted RR of 0.85 (95\% CI: 0.77 to 0.94, p = 0.001). The JF gave an
   adjusted RR of 0.82 (95\% CI: 0.73 to 0.92, p = 0.001). Similar results
   were found in analyses of all CV hospitalizations and all-cause
   hospitalizations.
   Conclusions When repeat events were included, rosuvastatin was shown to
   reduce the risk of HFH by approximately 15\% to 20\%, equating to
   approximately 76 fewer admissions per 1,000 patients treated over a
   median 33 months of follow-up. Including repeat events could increase
   the ability to detect treatment effects in heart failure trials. (J Am

Title = {{HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis in men who have sex with men and
   transgender women: a secondary analysis of a phase 3 randomised
   controlled efficacy trial}},
Journal = {{LANCET INFECTIOUS DISEASES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{468-475}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Background For maximum effect pre-exposure prophylaxis should be
   targeted to the subpopulations that account for the largest proportion
   of infections (population-attributable fraction {[}PAF]) and for whom
   the number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent infection is lowest. We
   aimed to estimate the PAF and NNT of participants in the iPrEx
   (Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis Initiative) trial.
   Methods The iPrEx study was a randomised controlled efficacy trial of
   pre-exposure prophylaxis with coformulated tenofovir disoproxil fumarate
   and emtricitabine in 2499 men who have sex with men (MSM) and
   transgender women. Participants aged 18 years or older who were male at
   birth were enrolled from 11 trial sites in Brazil, Ecuador, Peru, South
   Africa, Thailand, and the USA. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1)
   to receive either a pill with active pre-exposure prophylaxis or
   placebo, taken daily. We calculated the association between demographic
   and risk behaviour during screening and subsequent seroconversion among
   placebo recipients using a Poisson model, and we calculated the PAF and
   NNT for risk behaviour subgroups. The iPrEx trial is registered with
   ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00458393.
   Findings Patients were enrolled between July 10,2007, and Dec 17,2009,
   and were followed up until Nov 21,2010. Of the 2499 MSM and transgender
   women in the iPrEx trial, 1251 were assigned to pre-exposure prophylaxis
   and 1248 to placebo. 83 of 1248 patients in the placebo group became
   infected with HIV during follow-up. Participants reporting receptive
   anal intercourse without a condom seroconverted significantly more often
   than those reporting no anal sex without a condom (adjusted hazard ratio
   {[}AHR] 5-11,95\% CI 1.55-16.79). The overall PAF for MSM and
   transgender women reporting receptive anal intercourse without a condom
   was 64\% (prevalence 60\%). Most of this risk came from receptive anal
   intercourse without a condom with partners with unknown serostatus (PAF
   53\%, prevalence 54\%, AHR 4.76,95\% CI 1.44-15.71); by contrast, the
   PAF for receptive anal intercourse without a condom with an HIV-positive
   partner was 1\% (prevalence 1\%, AHR 7.11,95\% CI 0.70-72.75). The
   overall NNT per year for the cohort was 62 (95\% CI 44-147). NNTs were
   lowest for MSM and transgender women self-reporting receptive anal
   intercourse without a condom (NNT 36), cocaine use (12), or a sexually
   transmitted infection (41). Having one partner and insertive anal sex
   without a condom had the highest NNTs (100 and 77, respectively).
   Interpretation Pre-exposure prophylaxis may be most effective at a
   population level if targeted toward MSM and transgender women who report
   receptive anal intercourse without a condom, even if they perceive their
   partners to be HIV negative. Substance use history and testing for STIs
   should also inform individual decisions to start pre-exposure
   prophylaxis. Consideration of the PAF and NNT can aid in discussion of
   the benefits and risks of pre-exposure prophylaxis with MSM and
   transgender women.}},

Journal = {{MECHANICS OF MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{73}},
Pages = {{58-75}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{A micromechanics model and a computational homogenization method were
   developed to examine the macroscopic elastoplasticity and yield behavior
   of closed-cell porous materials with varied inner gas pressures. For the
   uniaxial stress-strain relation of the porous material, the
   micromechanics model coincides well with the numerical homogenization,
   especially for the case of relatively low porosity and gas pressures.
   The effects of the combination of the different gas pressures on the
   uniaxial stress-strain curve, the nominal Poisson's ratio, yield surface
   and initial yield strength of the material are systematically
   investigated. The multiple gas pressures can induce the
   tension-compression asymmetry of the uniaxial stress-strain curves and
   the nominal Poisson's ratio of nonlinear deformation. In particular it
   is shown that when the multiple gas pressures coincide, the yield
   surface of the porous material with inner gas pressures can be simply
   obtained from that of the porous material without inner pressures by a
   shift along the negative direction of the hydrostatic stress axis.
   However, when the multiple pressures are different, in addition to a
   translation along the hydrostatic axis, the yield surface undergoes a
   change in shape and size, and the maximal equivalent stress is lowered
   by a difference in gas pressures. Furthermore, the multiple gas
   pressures have a significant effect to reduce the yield strength of the
   closed cell porous materials. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) self-renew in a state of naive pluripotency
   in which they are competent to generate all somatic cells. It has been
   hypothesized that, before irreversibly committing, ESCs pass through at
   least one metastable transition state. This transition would represent a
   gateway for differentiation and reprogramming of somatic cells. Here, we
   show that during the transition, the nuclei of ESCs are auxetic: they
   exhibit a cross-sectional expansion when stretched and a cross-sectional
   contraction when compressed, and their stiffness increases under
   compression. We also show that the auxetic phenotype of transition ESC
   nuclei is driven at least in part by global chromatin decondensation.
   Through the regulation of molecular turnover in the differentiating
   nucleus by external forces, auxeticity could be a key element in
   mechanotransduction. Our findings highlight the importance of nuclear
   structure in the regulation of differentiation and reprogramming.}},

Title = {{Impact of Rapid Molecular Screening at Hospital Admission on Nosocomial
   Transmission of Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus: Cluster
   Randomised Trial}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 16}},
Abstract = {{Design: Cluster randomised crossover trial with seven wards randomly
   allocated to intervention or control arm.
   Setting: Medical and surgical wards of a university hospital with active
   MRSA control programme.
   Participants: All patients hospitalized >48 h in study wards and
   screened for MRSA on admission and discharge Intervention: Rapid
   PCR-based screening test for MRSA compared with control screening test
   by enrichment culture using chromogenic agar.
   Objective: We determined the benefit of PCR-detection versus
   culture-based detection of MRSA colonisation upon patient admission on
   early implementation of isolation precautions and reduction of hospital
   transmission of MRSA.
   Main outcome: Cumulative rate of MRSA hospital acquisition of in
   patients screened negative on admission.
   Randomization: The sequential order of inclusion of study wards in each
   arm was randomised by assigning a number to each ward and using a
   computer generated list of random numbers.
   Findings: Of 3704 eligible patients, 67.8\% were evaluable for the
   study. Compared with culture, PCR-screening reduced the median test
   reporting time from admission from 88 to 11 hours (p < 0.001) and the
   median time from admission to isolation from 96 to 25 hours (p < 0.001).
   MRSA acquisition was detected in 36 patients (3.2\%) in the control arm
   and 34 (3.2\%) in the intervention arm. The incidence density rate of
   hospital acquired MRSA was 2.82 and 2.57/1,000 exposed patient-days in
   the control and intervention arm, respectively (risk ratio 0.91 (95\%
   confidence interval, 0.60-1.39). Poisson regression model adjusted for
   colonisation pressure, compliance with hand hygiene and antibiotic use
   indicated a RR 0.99 (95\% CI, 0.69 to 1.44).
   Interpretation: Universal PCR screening for MRSA on admission to medical
   and surgical wards in an endemic setting shortened the time to implement
   isolation precautions but did not reduce nosocomial acquisition of MRSA.

Abstract = {{To determine if HIV primary care engagement (PCE) is associated with
   Emergency Department (ED) utilization, a retrospective cohort study
   using the South Carolina HIV surveillance data from January 1986 to
   December 2006 linked to the hospital discharge data-set was used to
   assess utilization at statewide EDs during January 2007-December 2010.
   Suboptimal PCE was defined as <2 reports of a CD4 + T-cell count or
   viral load value to surveillance in each calendar year from January 2007
   to December 2010. Multivariable logistic regression explored
   associations of HIV PCE with ED utilization after accounting for
   sociodemographic characteristics and disease stage. Poisson and negative
   binominal regression examined PCE, sociodemographic characteristics, and
   disease stage on the frequency of ED utilization. Suboptimal PCE was
   associated with increased odds of ED utilization for NIR/NRR (no
   identified risk/no risk reported; aOR {[}adjusted odds ratio] = 2.25; CI
   = 1.69-2.99), self-payers (aOR = 1.81; CI = 1.38-2.39), and those
   diagnosed with an AIDS-defining illness (ADI; aOR = 1.51; CI =
   1.14-2.00), who also had the most median ED visits (six). More ED visits
   were associated with young age, female (incidence rate ratio {[}IRR] =
   1.16; CI = 1.06-1.27), ADI (IRR = 2.17; CI = 1.93-2.45), Medicaid
   recipients (IRR = 1.34; CI = 1.21-1.49), indigent/charity recipients
   (IRR = 1.86; CI = 1.57-2.21), or AIDS > 1 year (IRR = 1.23; CI =
   1.13-1.35). Fewer visits to the ED were associated with MSM (males
   having sex with males IRR = 0.81; CI = 0.72-0.90), NIR/NRR (IRR = 0.86;
   CI = 0.78-0.95), self-payers (IRR = 0.56; CI = 0.50-0.62), or Medicare
   recipients (IRR = 0.85; CI = 0.77-0.95). Disease stage and insurance
   type were differentially associated with primary care and ED
   utilization. There is a need to evaluate HIV primary care systems to
   increase access and develop interventions to reduce preventable ED
   visits.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{127}},
Pages = {{72-87}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{This paper proposes a new model named as the multivariate generalized
   Poisson logt geometric process (MGPLTGP) model to study multivariate
   time-series of counts with overdispersion or underdispersion,
   non-monotone trends within each time-series and positive or negative
   correlation between pairs of time-series: This model assumes that the
   multivariate counts follow independent generalized Poisson distributions
   with an additional parameter to adjust for different degrees of
   dispersion including overdispersion and underdispersion. Their means
   after discounting the trend effect geometrically by ratio functions form
   latent stochastic processes and follow a multivariate log-t distribution
   with a flexible correlation structure to capture both positive
   correlation and negative correlation. By expressing the multivariate
   Student's t-distribution in scale mixtures of normals, the model can be
   implemented through Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms via the
   user-friendly WinBUGS software. The applicability of the MGPLTGP model
   is illustrated through an analysis of the possession and/or use of two
   illicit drugs, amphetamines and narcotics in New South Wales, Australia.

Abstract = {{Over/underdispersed count data arise in many biostatistical practices in
   which a number of different treatment groups are compared in an
   experiment. In the analysis of several treatment groups of such count
   data, a very common statistical inference problem is to test whether
   these data come from the same population. The usual practice for testing
   homogeneity of several treatment groups in terms of means and
   dispersions is first to test the equality of dispersions and then to
   test the equality of the means based on the result of the test for
   equality of dispersions. Previous studies reported test procedures for
   testing the homogeneity of the means of several treatment groups with an
   assumption of equal or unequal dispersions. This article develops test
   procedures for testing the validity of the equal or unequal dispersions
   assumption of several treatment groups in the analysis of
   over/underdispersed count data. We consider the C() test based on the
   maximum likelihood (ML) method using the negative binomial model as well
   as the three other C() tests based on the method of moments, extended
   quasi-likelihood, and double extended quasi-likelihood using the models
   specified by the first two moments of counts. Monte Carlo simulations
   are then used to study the comparative behavior of these C() tests along
   with the likelihood ratio test in terms of size and power. The
   simulation results demonstrate that all four statistics hold the nominal
   level reasonably well in most of the data situations studied here, and
   the C() test based on ML shows some edge in power over the other three
   C() tests. Finally, applications to biostatistical practices are
   analyzed.}},

Abstract = {{The Vaccine Safety Datalink project captures electronic health record
   data including vaccinations and medically attended adverse events on 8.8
   million enrollees annually from participating managed care organizations
   in the United States. While the automated vaccination data are generally
   of high quality, a presumptive adverse event based on diagnosis codes in
   automated health care data may not be true (misclassification).
   Consequently, analyses using automated health care data can generate
   false positive results, where an association between the vaccine and
   outcome is incorrectly identified, as well as false negative findings,
   where a true association or signal is missed. We developed novel
   conditional Poisson regression models and fixed effects models that
   accommodate misclassification of adverse event outcome for
   self-controlled case series design. We conducted simulation studies to
   evaluate their performance in signal detection in vaccine safety
   hypotheses generating (screening) studies. We also reanalyzed four
   previously identified signals in a recent vaccine safety study using the
   newly proposed models. Our simulation studies demonstrated that (i)
   outcome misclassification resulted in both false positive and false
   negative signals in screening studies; (ii) the newly proposed models
   reduced both the rates of false positive and false negative signals. In
   reanalyses of four previously identified signals using the novel
   statistical models, the incidence rate ratio estimates and statistical
   significances were similar to those using conventional models and
   including only medical record review confirmed cases.}},

   the W1-xTax and W1-xRex alloys also exhibit energy favorable asymmetry

   alloys decrease gradually with the increase of the Ta concentration,
   while those of the W1-xRex alloys increase gradually with the increase
   of the Re concentration. Consequently, the bulk modulus of W metal can
   be improved by doping with Re, implying that the resistance to
   deformation is enhanced. Based on the mechanical characteristic G/B and

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Metamaterials usually refer to artificial composite materials consisting
   of an array of periodically arranged microstructures, engineered to
   provide unusual material properties that may not be easily found in
   nature. This paper proposes a new topological shape optimization method
   for systematic computational design of a type of mechanical
   metamaterials with negative Poisson's ratios (auxetic materials), which
   integrates the numerical homogenization approach into a powerful
   parametric level set method (PLSM). The homogenization method is used to
   obtain the effective properties of the periodic microstructure, while
   the PLSM is applied to achieve shape evolutions and topological changes
   of the microstructure, until the desired material properties are
   achieved. The key concept of the PLSM is the interpolation of the
   implicit level set surface by using a given set of compactly supported
   radial basis functions (CSRBF), which are positioned at a number of
   given and fixed knots inside the design domain. Several typical
   numerical examples are used to demonstrate the favorable characteristics
   of the proposed method in the design of micro-structured metamaterials.

Abstract = {{The development of new materials based on industrial wastes has been the
   focus of much research for a sustainable world. The growing demand for
   tyres has been every year exacerbating environmental problems due to
   indiscriminate disposal in the nature, making a potentially harmful
   waste to public health. The incorporation of rubber particles from scrap
   tyres into polymeric composites has achieved high toughness and moderate
   mechanical properties. This work investigates the geometric effects
   (thickness, width and internal cell angle) of auxetic structures made of
   recycled rubber composites based on experimental and numerical data. The
   response surface models integrated with the swarm intelligence and
   finite element analysis were proposed in order to obtain a range of
   solutions that provides useful information to the user during the
   selection of geometric parameters for reentrant cells. The results
   revealed the cell thickness ranges from 39-40 mm and 5.98-6 mm, and the
   cell angle range from -0.01 to -0.06 degrees maximize the ultimate
   strength. The same parameters were able to optimize the modulus of
   elasticity of rubber auxetic structures, excepting for the angle factor
   which must be set between -30 and 27.7 degrees. The optimal Poisson's
   ratio was found when the cell angle ranged from -30 to -28.5 degrees,
   cell width ranged from 5-5.6 mm and 2 mm in thickness.}},

Volume = {{14}},

Abstract = {{Background: To investigate whether factors can be identified that
   significantly affect hospital length of stay from those available in an
   electronic patient record system, using primary total knee replacements
   as an example. To investigate whether a model can be produced to predict
   the length of stay based on these factors to help resource planning and
   patient expectations on their length of stay.
   Methods: Data were extracted from the electronic patient record system
   for discharges from primary total knee operations from January 2007 to
   December 2011 (n = 2,130) at one UK hospital and analysed for their
   effect on length of stay using Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests for
   discrete data and Spearman's correlation coefficient for continuous
   data. Models for predicting length of stay for primary total knee
   replacements were tested using the Poisson regression and the negative
   binomial modelling techniques.
   Results: Factors found to have a significant effect on length of stay
   were age, gender, consultant, discharge destination, deprivation and
   ethnicity. Applying a negative binomial model to these variables was
   successful. The model predicted the length of stay of those patients who
   stayed 4-6 days (similar to 50\% of admissions) with 75\% accuracy
   within 2 days (model data). Overall, the model predicted the total days
   stayed over 5 years to be only 88 days more than actual, a 6.9\% uplift
   (test data).
   Conclusions: Valuable information can be found about length of stay from
   the analysis of variables easily extracted from an electronic patient
   record system. Models can be successfully created to help improve
   resource planning and from which a simple decision support system can be
   produced to help patient expectation on their length of stay.}},

Title = {{Changes in HIV Incidence among People Who Inject Drugs in Taiwan
   following Introduction of a Harm Reduction Program: A Study of Two
   Cohorts}},
Journal = {{PLOS MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Editors' Summary
   Background
   About 35 million people worldwide are currently infected with HIV, the
   virus that causes AIDS, and about 2.3 million people become newly
   infected every year. HIV is mainly transmitted through unprotected sex
   with an infected partner. However, people who inject drugs (PWID) have a
   particularly high risk of HIV infection because blood transfer through
   needle and syringe sharing can transmit the virus. It is estimated that
   5\%-10\% of all people living with HIV are PWID. Indeed, in some regions
   of the world the primary route of HIV transmission is through shared
   drug injection equipment and the prevalence (the proportion of a
   population that has a specific disease) of HIV infection among PWID is
   very high. In Asia, for example, more than a quarter of PWID are HIV
   positive. Because the high prevalence of HIV among PWID poses a global
   health challenge, bodies such as the Joint United Nations Programme on
   HIV/AIDS endorse harm reduction strategies to prevent risky injection
   behaviors among PWID. These strategies include the provision of clean
   needles and syringes, opioid substitution therapy such as methadone
   maintenance treatment, and antiretroviral treatment for HIV-positive
   PWID.
   Why Was This Study Done? ?
   Although harm reduction strategies for combating HIV epidemics among
   PWID have been implemented in several countries, few large-scale studies
   have examined the association between HIV incidence (the proportion of
   new cases of HIV in a population per year) and exposure to harm
   reduction programs among PWID. In this cohort study (an investigation
   that determines the characteristics of a group of people and then
   follows them over time), the researchers determine the association
   between harm reduction programs and HIV incidence among PWID in Taiwan.
   HIV infections used to be rare among the 60,000 PWID living in Taiwan,
   but after the introduction of a new HIV strain into the country in 2003,
   an HIV epidemic spread rapidly. In response, the Taiwanese government
   introduced a pilot program of harm reduction that included the provision
   of clean needles and syringes and health education in July 2005. The
   program was expanded to include methadone maintenance treatment in early
   2006 and implemented nationwide in June 2006.
   What Did the Researchers Do and Find? ?
   The researchers enrolled two study populations. The first cohort
   comprised 3,851 PWID who were incarcerated for illicit drug use between
   2004 and 2010 and who tested positive for HIV upon admission into
   prison. By using the BED assay, which indicates whether an HIV infection
   is recent, the researchers were able to determine the HIV incidence
   among the prisoners. In 2004, the estimated HIV incidence among
   prisoners with a history of drug injection was 6.44\%. The incidence
   peaked in 2005 at 18.2\%, but fell to 0.3\% in 2010.
   The second study population comprised 2,473 individuals who were HIV
   negative on January 1, 2006, and who had been incarcerated for drug use
   crimes but were released on July 16, 2007, during an amnesty. The
   researchers regularly interviewed these participants between their
   release and 2010 about their use of harm reduction interventions, and
   obtained other data about them (for example, diagnosis of HIV infection)
   from official databases. Analysis of all these data indicated that, in
   this cohort, attendance at methadone maintenance treatment clinics and
   frequent use of needle and syringe services were both associated with a
   significantly lower HIV incidence.
   What Do These Findings Mean? ?
   These findings suggest that the introduction of a comprehensive harm
   reduction program in Taiwan was associated with a significant reduction
   in the HIV incidence rate among PWID. These findings must be interpreted
   with caution, however. First, because the participants in the study were
   selected from PWID with histories of incarceration, the findings may not
   be representative of all PWID in Taiwan or of PWID in other countries.
   Second, PWID who chose to use needle and syringe services or methadone
   maintenance treatment clinics might have shared other unknown
   characteristics that affected their risk of HIV infection. Finally, some
   of the reduction in HIV incidence seen during the study is likely to be
   associated with the availability of free treatment, which has been
   offered to all HIV-positive individuals in Taiwan since 1997. Despite
   these limitations, these findings suggest that countries with a high
   prevalence and incidence of HIV among PWID should provide comprehensive
   harm reduction services to their populations to reduce risky drug
   injection behaviors.

   Background
   Harm reduction strategies for combating HIV epidemics among people who
   inject drugs (PWID) have been implemented in several countries. However,
   large-scale studies using sensitive measurements of HIV incidence and
   intervention exposures in defined cohorts are rare. The aim of this
   study was to determine the association between harm reduction programs
   and HIV incidence among PWID.
   Methods and Findings
   The study included two populations. For 3,851 PWID who entered prison
   between 2004 and 2010 and tested HIV positive upon incarceration, we
   tested their sera using a BED HIV-1 capture enzyme immunoassay to
   estimate HIV incidence. Also, we enrolled in a prospective study a
   cohort of 4,357 individuals who were released from prison via an amnesty
   on July 16, 2007. We followed them with interviews at intervals of 6-12
   mo and by linking several databases. A total of 2,473 participants who
   were HIV negative in January 2006 had interviews between then and 2010
   to evaluate the association between use of harm reduction programs and
   HIV incidence. We used survival methods with attendance at methadone
   clinics as a time-varying covariate to measure the association with HIV
   incidence. We used a Poisson regression model and calculated the HIV
   incidence rate to evaluate the association between needle/syringe
   program use and HIV incidence. Among the population of PWID who were
   imprisoned, the implementation of comprehensive harm reduction programs
   and a lower mean community HIV viral load were associated with a reduced
   HIV incidence among PWID. The HIV incidence in this population of PWID
   decreased from 18.2\% in 2005 to 0.3\% in 2010. In an individual-level
   analysis of the amnesty cohort, attendance at methadone clinics was
   associated with a significantly lower HIV incidence (adjusted hazard
   ratio: 0.20, 95\% CI: 0.06-0.67), and frequent users of needle/syringe
   program services had lower HIV incidence (0\% in high NSP users, 0.5\%
   in non NSP users). In addition, no HIV seroconversions were detected
   among prison inmates.
   Conclusions
   Although our data are affected by participation bias, they strongly
   suggest that comprehensive harm- reduction services and free treatment
   were associated with reversal of a rapidly emerging epidemic of HIV
   among PWID.

Abstract = {{There is much recent interest in finding rare genetic variants
   associated with various diseases. Owing to the scarcity of rare
   mutations, single-variant analyses often lack power. To enable pooling
   of information across variants, we use a random effect formulation
   within a retrospective modeling framework that respects the
   retrospective data collecting mechanism of casecontrol studies. More
   concretely, we model the control allele frequencies of the variants as
   random effects, and the systematic differences between the case and
   control frequencies as fixed effects, resulting in a mixed model. The
   use of Poisson approximation and gamma-distributed random effects
   results in a generalized negative binomial distribution for the joint
   distribution of the control and case frequencies. Variants are selected
   by conducting stepwise likelihood ratio tests. The superiority of the
   proposed method over two existing variant selection methods is
   demonstrated in a simulation study. The effects of non-gamma random
   effects and correlated variants are also found to be not too detrimental
   in the simulation study. When the proposed procedure is applied to
   identify rare variants associated with obesity, it identifies one
   additional variant not picked up by existing methods.}},

Abstract = {{The work describes the design, manufacturing, and parametric modeling of

   produced using Kirigami techniques from polyetheretherketone films. The
   large deformation behavior of the cellular structure is evaluated using
   full-scale finite element methods and experimental tests performed on
   the cellular samples. Good agreement is observed between the mechanical
   behavior predicted by the finite element modeling and the three-point
   bending compression tests. Finite element simulations have also been
   used to perform a parametric analysis of the stiffness against the
   geometry of the cellular structures, showing a high degree of tailoring
   that these cellular structures could offer in terms of minimum relative
   density and maximum stiffness. The experimental results also show high
   levels of strain-dependent loss factors and low residual deformations

Journal = {{PLASMA PHYSICS REPORTS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{40}},

Pages = {{312-321}},

Abstract = {{The structure of the anode space charge sheath of a vacuum arc is
   studied with allowance for the dependence of the negative anode fall on
   the ratio of the directed electron velocity v (0) to the electron
   thermal velocity v (T) for different values of the flux density of atoms
   evaporated from the anode. Poisson's equation for the sheath potential
   is solved taking into account the electron space charge, fast cathode
   ions, and slow ions produced due to the ionization of atoms evaporated
   from the anode. The kinetic equation for atoms and slow anode ions is
   solved with allowance for ionization in the collision integral. Analytic
   solutions for the velocity distribution functions of atoms and slow ions
   and the density of slow ions are obtained. It is shown that the flux of
   slow ions substantially affects the spatial distribution of the electric
   field E(z) in the sheath. As the flux density increases, the
   nonmonotonic dependence E(z) transforms into a monotonic one and the
   sheath narrows. For a given flux of evaporated atoms I a, the increase
   in the ratio of the directed electron velocity to the electron thermal
   velocity leads again to a nonmonotonic dependence E(z). As z increases,
   the electric field first increases, passes through the maximum,
   decreases, passes through the minimum E (min), and then again increases
   toward the anode. There is a limiting value of the ratio (v (0)/v (T)
   ){*} at which E (min)(z) vanishes. At v (0)/v (T) > (v (0)/V (T) ){*},
   the condition for the existence of a steady-state sheath is violated and
   the profiles of the field and potential in the sheath become
   oscillating. The dependence of (v (0)/v (T) ){*} on the flux density of
   evaporated atoms I (a) is obtained. It is shown that the domain of
   existence of steady-state solutions in the sheath broadens with
   increasing Pi (a) .}},

Title = {{Interaction of protamine with gram-negative bacteria membranes: possible

Volume = {{20}},

Abstract = {{This study was concerned with the interaction between the cationic
   antimicrobial peptide, protamine (Ptm) and the cytoplasmic membranes of
   the gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium and
   Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The objective of the study was to explain the
   observed paradox of internalization without permanent disruption of the
   cell envelope. We carried out Monte Carlo computer simulation of Ptm in
   an aqueous environment in the presence of similar to 100mM NaCl and
   model membranes consisting of either (65:35) or (75:25) PE:PG molar
   ratios. The (75:25) model, representative of the gram-negative
   cytoplasmic membrane, showed that the Ptm center of mass remained at
   least 7nm from the membrane surface leading to the prediction that Ptm
   would not internalize via disruption of the inner membrane.
   By using immunoelectron microscopy of Ptm-treated cells, we showed that
   Ptm internalization to the cytoplasm took place rapidly in the presence
   or absence of the outer envelope. Ultrastructural examination revealed
   no obvious morphological changes to cells that were treated with
   subinhibitory or bactericidal levels of Ptm. Reconstituted phospholipid
   bilayers were constructed and were unperturbed by Ptm treatment over a
   wide range of concentrations and applied transmembrane voltages. We
   conclude that in the cases of the cell envelopes of E.coli,
   S.typhimurium and P.aeruginosa, Ptm internalized by means independent of
   the phospholipid bilayer, most likely mediated by one or more membrane
   proteins such as cation-selective barrel-like proteins. Work is
   currently underway to test this hypothesis. (c) 2014 The Authors.

Title = {{FLEXURAL RIGIDITY OF THIN AUXETIC PLATES}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The influence of auxeticity on the mechanical behavior of isotropic
   plates is considered herein by evaluating the plate flexural rigidity as
   the Poisson's ratio changes from 0.5 to -1. Since the change in plate's
   Poisson's ratio is followed by a change in at least one of the three
   moduli, any resulting change to the plate flexural rigidity is only
   meaningful when at least one of the moduli is held constant. This was
   performed by normalizing the plate flexural rigidity by a single
   modulus, a square root of two moduli product, or a cube root of three
   moduli product to give a dimensionless plate flexural rigidity. It was
   found that the plate flexural rigidity decreases to a minimum as the
   plate Poisson's ratio decreases from 0.5 to 0 when only the Young's
   modulus is held constant. Thereafter the plate flexural rigidity
   increases with the plate auxeticity. Results also reveal that when only
   the shear modulus or when the bulk modulus is held constant, the plate
   flexural rigidity decreases or increases, respectively, with the plate
   auxeticity. Intermediate trend in the plate flexural rigidity is
   observed when the product of two moduli is held constant. When the
   product of all three moduli is held constant, the plate flexural
   rigidity increases with the plate auxeticity, and the change is
   especially drastic when the plate Poisson's ratio is near to the upper
   and lower limits of Poisson's ratio for isotropic solids. Results from
   this work are useful for structural designers to control the flexural
   rigidity of plate made from auxetic materials.}},

Abstract = {{The theory of selfadjoint extensions of symmetric operators, and more
   generally the theory of extensions of dual pairs, was implemented some
   years ago for boundary value problems for elliptic operators on smooth
   bounded domains. Recently, the questions have been taken up again for
   nonsmooth domains. In the present work we show that pseudodifferential
   methods can be used to obtain a full characterization, including Krein
   resolvent formulas, of the realizations of nonselfadjoint second-order
   operators on C3/2+epsilon domains; more precisely, we treat domains with
   B-p,2(3/2)-smoothness and operators with H-q(1)-coefficients, for
   suitable p > 2(n - 1) and q > n. The advantage of the pseudodifferential
   boundary operator calculus is that the operators are represented by a
   principal part and a lower-order remainder, leading to regularity
   results; in particular we analyze resolvents, Poisson solution operators
   and Dirichlet-to-Neumann operators in this way, also in Sobolev spaces
   of negative order. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic materials and structures exhibit a negative Poisson's ratio
   while thick plates encounter shear deformation, which is not accounted
   for in classical plate theory. This paper investigates the effect of a
   negative Poisson's ratio on thick plates that are subjected to buckling
   loads, taking into consideration the shear deformation using Mindlin
   plate theory. Using a highly accurate shear correction factor that
   allows for the effect of Poisson's ratio, the elastic stability of
   circular and square plates are evaluated in terms of dimensionless
   parameters, namely the Mindlin-to-Kirchhoff critical buckling load ratio
   and Mindlin critical buckling load factors. Results for thick square
   plates reveal that both parameters increase as the Poisson's ratio
   becomes more negative. In the case of thick circular plates, the
   Mindlin-to-Kirchhoff critical buckling load ratios and the Mindlin
   critical buckling load factors increase and decrease, respectively, as
   the Poisson's ratio becomes more negative. The results obtained herein
   show that thick auxetic plates behave as thin conventional plates, and
   therefore suggest that the classical plate theory can be used to
   evaluate the elastic stability of thick plates if the Poisson's ratio of
   the plate material is sufficiently negative. The results also suggest
   that materials with highly negative Poisson's ratios are recommended for
   square plates, but not circular plates, that are subjected to buckling
   loads.}},

Abstract = {{Although distinct categories of male genital malformations share some
   common risk factors, few studies have systematically compared
   epidemiologic features across phenotypes. We evaluated the relationship
   between several maternal and infant characteristics and five categories
   of male genital malformations: second- or third-degree hypospadias,
   hypospadias (regardless of degree), small penis, cryptorchidism, and any
   male genital malformation. Data for 16,813 cases with isolated male
   genital malformations and 1,945,841 male live births delivered from 1999
   to 2008 were obtained from the Texas Birth Defects Registry. For each
   phenotype category, 13 maternal and infant variables were assessed, and
   adjusted prevalence ratios were estimated based on the same
   multivariable Poisson regression model. A significant negative
   association was observed between previous live births versus no previous
   live births and four phenotypes (e.g., adjusted prevalence ratio {[}aPR]
   for any male genital malformation: 0.78, 95\% confidence interval
   {[}CI]: 0.75-0.81). The prevalence of 4 of the phenotypes was
   significantly higher among multiple versus singleton pregnancies (e.g.,
   aPR for any male genital malformation: 1.35, 95\% CI: 1.25-1.47). We
   also observed significant associations between multiple phenotypes and
   residential region at delivery, delivery year, month of conception, and
   maternal age, race/ethnicity, education, and birthplace, including
   significant associations for trends (maternal age, maternal education,
   and birth year modeled ordinally). Our results allow for comparison of
   characteristics across phenotypes and suggest that there may be some
   common risk factors for multiple male genital malformations (e.g.,
   characteristics related to maternal estrogen levels), while other risk
   factors may be unique to specific defects. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals,

   achieved at specific orientations of the main crystallographic axes due
   to the significant anisotropy of the elastic and piezoelectric

Journal = {{PHYSICA B-CONDENSED MATTER}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{438}},

Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{Advances in low power design open the possibility to harvest ambient
   energies to power directly the electronics or recharge a secondary
   battery. The key parameter of an energy harvesting (EH) device is its
   efficiency, which strongly depends on the conversion medium. To address
   this issue, metamaterials, artificial materials and structures with
   exotic properties, have been introduced for EH in recent years. They
   possess unique properties not easily achieved using naturally occurring
   materials, such as negative stiffness, mass, Poisson's ratio, and
   refractive index. The goal of this paper is to review the fundamentals,
   recent progresses and future directions in the held of
   metamaterials-based enhanced energy harvesting. An introduction on EH
   followed by the classification of potential metamaterials for EH is
   presented. A number of theoretical and experimental studies on
   metamaterials-based EH are outlined, including phononic crystals,
   acoustic metamaterials, and electromagnetic metamaterials. Finally, we
   give an outlook on future directions of metamaterials-based energy
   harvesting research including but not limited to active
   metamaterials-based EH, metamaterials-based thermal EH, and
   metamaterials-based multifunctional EH capabilities. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The paper systemizes numerous cubic crystals which can have both
   positive and negative Poisson's ratios (the so-called partial auxetics)
   depending on the specimen orientation in tension. Several complete cubic
   auxetics whose Poisson's ratio is always negative are indicated. The
   partial cubic auxetics are classified with the use of two dimensionless
   elastic parameters. For one of the parameters, a critical value is found
   at which the orientation behavior of the crystals changes qualitatively.
   The behavior of mesotubes obtained by rolling up plates of cubic
   crystals (crystals with rectilinear anisotropy) is considered in detail.
   Such mesotubes with curvilinear cubic anisotropy can have micron and
   nanometer lateral dimensions. It is shown that uniform tension of
   nano/microtubes of cubic crystals is possible only in the particular
   case of zero chirality angle (the angle between the crystallographic
   axis and the axis of a stretched tube). It is demonstrated by the
   semi-inverse Saint-Venant method that solution of the axial tension
   problem for cylindrically anisotropic nano/microtubes of cubic crystals
   with a non-zero chirality angle is possible with radially inhomogeneous
   fields of three normal stresses and one shear stress. In the examples
   considered, the cylindrically anisotropic nano/microtubes of cubic
   crystals are auxetics even if they are initially non-auxetics with
   rectilinear anisotropy.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Planar auxetic structures have the potential to impact on a wide range
   of applications from deployable and morphing structures to space-filling
   composite and medical treatments. The ability to fabricate auxetics from
   smart materials greatly enhances this facility by building in
   controllable actuation and deployment. A smart auxetic device can be
   compressed and fixed into a storage state. When deployment is required
   the device can be appropriately stimulated and the stored elastic energy
   is released, resulting in a marked structural expansion. Instead of
   using a conventional external actuator to drive deployment the material
   is made to undergo phase transition where one stimulus (e.g. heat)
   initiates a mechanical response. Here we show how smart material
   auxetics can be realized using a thermally responsive shape memory
   polymer composites. We show how a shape memory polymer auxetic
   hexachiral structure can be tailored to provide a tunable stiffness
   response in its fully deployed state by varying the angle of inter-hub
   connections, and yet is still able to undergo thermally stimulated

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING MATERIALS AND TECHNOLOGY-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{136}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{This paper evaluates the elastic stability and vibration characteristics
   of circular plates made from auxetic materials. By solving the general
   solutions for buckling and vibration of circular plates under various
   boundary conditions, the critical buckling load factors and fundamental
   frequencies of circular plates, within the scope of the first
   axisymmetric modes, were obtained for the entire range of Poisson's
   ratio for isotropic solids, i.e., from -1 to 0.5. Results for elastic
   stability reveal that as the Poisson's ratio of the plate becomes more
   negative, the critical bucking load gradually reduces. In the case of
   vibration, the decrease in Poisson's ratio not only decreases the
   fundamental frequency, but the decrease becomes very rapid as the
   Poisson's ratio approaches its lower limit. For both buckling and
   vibration, the plate's Poisson's ratio has no effect if the edge is
   fully clamped. The results obtained herein suggest that auxetic
   materials can be employed for attaining static and dynamic properties
   which are not common in plates made from conventional materials. Based
   on the exact results, empirical models were generated for design
   purposes so that both the critical buckling load factors and the
   frequency parameters can be conveniently obtained without calculating
   the Bessel functions.}},

Abstract = {{Cristobalite and tridymite are the main SiO2 phases in silica bricks, a
   widespread refractory product. The elastic properties of cristobalite at
   room temperature have been extensively studied, because it is known for
   auxetic behavior, i.e. negative Poisson ratios, whereas the elastic
   properties of tridymite are essentially unknown. Here we show that
   silica brick materials, consisting almost entirely of tridymite and
   cristobalite, exhibit remarkable anomalies in the temperature dependence
   of the Young modulus: in the intermediate temperature range between
   approximately 50 and 250 degrees C these materials become very
   compliant, with stiffness minima of around 60\% of the room temperature
   values, with a broad transition region at the low-temperature end, a
   sharp transition at the high-temperature end and a precisely
   reproducible hysteresis during heating and cooling. Furthermore, it is
   shown that Young's moduli at around 800 degrees C can be more than three
   times as high as the room temperature values. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd and

Abstract = {{Dilational materials are stable, three-dimensional isotropic auxetics
   with an ultimate Poisson's ratio of -1. Inspired by previous theoretical
   work, we design a feasible blueprint for an artificial material, a
   metamaterial, which approaches the ideal of a dilational material. The
   main novelty of our work is that we also fabricate and characterize
   corresponding metamaterial samples. To reveal all modes in the design,
   we calculate the phonon band structures. On this basis, using cubic
   symmetry we can unambiguously retrieve all different non-zero elements
   of the rank-four effective metamaterial elasticity tensor from which all
   effective elastic metamaterial properties follow. While the elastic
   properties and the phase velocity remain anisotropic, the effective
   Poisson's ratio indeed becomes isotropic and approaches -1 in the limit
   of small internal connections. This finding is also supported by
   independent, static continuum-mechanics calculations. In static
   experiments on macroscopic polymer structures fabricated by
   three-dimensional printing, we measure Poisson's ratios as low as -0.8
   in good agreement with the theory. Microscopic samples are also
   presented.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL AIDS SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{MAR 19}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Adolescents having unprotected heterosexual intercourse
   are at risk of HIV infection and unwanted pregnancy. However, there is
   little evidence to indicate whether pregnancy in early adolescence
   increases the risk of subsequent HIV infection. In this paper, we tested
   the hypothesis that adolescent pregnancy (aged 15 or younger) increases
   the risk of incident HIV infection in young South African women.
   Methods: We assessed 1099 HIV-negative women, aged 15-26 years, who were
   volunteer participants in a cluster-randomized, controlled HIV
   prevention trial in the predominantly rural Eastern Cape province of
   South Africa. All of these young women had at least one additional HIV
   test over two years of follow-up. Outcomes were HIV incidence rates per
   100 person years and HIV incidence rate ratios (IRRs) estimated by
   Poisson multivariate models. Three pregnancy categories were created for
   the Poisson model: early adolescent pregnancy (a first pregnancy at age
   15 years or younger); later adolescent pregnancy (a first pregnancy at
   age 16 to 19 years); and women who did not report an adolescent
   pregnancy. Models were adjusted for study design, age, education, time
   since first sexual experience, socio-economic status, childhood trauma
   and herpes simplex virus type 2 infection.
   Results: HIV incidence rates were 6.0 per 100 person years over two
   years of follow-up. The adjusted IRR was 3.02 (95\% CI 1.50-6.09) for a
   pregnancy occurring at age 15 or younger. Women with pregnancies
   occurring between 16 and 19 years of age did not have a higher incidence
   of HIV (IRR 1.08; 95\% CI 0.64 1.84). Early adolescent pregnancies were
   associated with higher partner numbers and a greater age difference with
   partners.
   Conclusions: Early adolescent pregnancies increase the incidence of HIV
   among South African women. The higher risk is associated with sexual
   risk behaviours such as higher partner numbers and a greater age
   difference with partners rather than a biological explanation of
   hormonal changes during pregnancy.}},

Abstract = {{Transformation acoustics opens a new avenue towards the architecture,
   modeling and simulation of a new class of sonic composites with
   scatterers made of various materials and having various shapes embedded
   in an epoxy matrix. The design of acoustic scatterers is based on the
   property of Helmholtz equations to be invariant under a coordinate
   transformation, i.e., a specific spatial compression is equivalent to a
   new material in a new space. In this paper, the noise suppression for a
   wide full band-gap of frequencies is discussed for spherical shell
   scatterers made of auxetic materials (materials with negative Poisson's
   ratio). The original domain consists of spheres made from conventional
   foams with positive Poisson's ratio. The spatial compression is
   controlled by the coordinate transformation, and leads to an equivalent
   domain filled with an auxetic material. The coordinate transformation is
   strongly supported by the manufacturing of auxetics which is based on
   the pore size reduction through radial compression molds. (C) 2014 AIP

Abstract = {{Molecular Dynamics simulations are used to investigate the structure and
   dynamics of an aqueous electrolyte (NaCl) confined within a
   nanomembrane, which consists of a nanopore with a diameter 3 nm having a
   negatively charged surface. Both nanomembranes with a diffuse charge and
   with local charges are considered (in both cases, two surface charge
   densities are considered, -0.9 e/nm(2) and -1.8 e/nm(2)). For all
   nanomembranes, significant layering of water and ions in the vicinity of
   the nanomembrane surface is observed. While the distribution of water
   and chloride ions is nearly insensitive to the nanomembrane charge and
   type, the arrangement of sodium cations within the nanomembrane depends
   on the system being considered. The water and ion density profiles in
   the nanomembranes are compared with the predictions of a modified
   Poisson-Boltzmann equation in which charge image, solvation effects, and
   dispersion interactions with the surface are taken into account {[}Huang
   et al. Langmuir, 2008, 24, 1442]. The self-diffusion coefficient for a
   given species is smaller than its bulk counterpart and is at most 75\%
   of the bulk value. While the self-diffusion coefficients for water and
   sodium cations decrease with decreasing the overall negative charge of
   the nanomembrane, the self-diffusion coefficient for the chloride anions
   is nearly independent of the nanomembrane type and charge. We also
   estimate the dynamics of the confined aqueous electrolyte by calculating
   time correlation functions which allow estimating solvation, ion
   pairing, and residence times.}},

Title = {{Models for Count Data With an Application to Healthy Days Measures: Are
   You Driving in Screws With a Hammer?}},
Journal = {{PREVENTING CHRONIC DISEASE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Introduction
   Count data are often collected in chronic disease research, and
   sometimes these data have a skewed distribution. The number of unhealthy
   days reported in the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)
   is an example of such data: most respondents report zero days. Studies
   have either categorized the Healthy Days measure or used linear
   regression models. We used alternative regression models for these count
   data and examined the effect on statistical inference.
   Methods
   Using responses from participants aged 35 years or older from 12 states
   that included a homeownership question in their 2009 BRFSS, we compared
   5 multivariate regression models logistic, linear, Poisson, negative
   binomial, and zero-inflated negative binomial with respect to 1) how
   well the modeled data fit the observed data and 2) how model selections
   affect inferences.
   Results
   Most respondents (66.8\%) reported zero mentally unhealthy days. The
   distribution was highly skewed (variance = 58.7, mean = 3.3 d).
   Zero-inflated negative binomial regression provided the best-fitting
   model, followed by negative binomial regression. A significant
   independent association between homeownership and number of mentally
   unhealthy days was not found in the logistic, linear, or Poisson
   regression model but was found in the negative binomial model. The
   zero-inflated negative binomial model showed that homeowners were 24\%
   more likely than nonhomeowners to have excess zero mentally unhealthy
   days (adjusted odds ratio, 1.24; 95\% confidence interval, 1.08 - 1.43),
   but it did not show an association between homeownership and the number
   of unhealthy days.
   Conclusion
   Our comparison of regression models indicates the importance of
   examining data distribution and selecting models with appropriate
   assumptions. Otherwise, statistical inferences might be misleading.}},

Title = {{Income inequality and schizophrenia: Increased schizophrenia incidence
   in countries with high levels of income inequality}},

Abstract = {{Background: Income inequality is associated with numerous negative
   health outcomes. There is evidence that ecological-level
   socio-environmental factors may increase risk for schizophrenia.
   Aims: The aim was to investigate whether measures of income inequality
   are associated with incidence of schizophrenia at the country level.
   Method: We conducted a systematic review of incidence rates for
   schizophrenia, reported between 1975 and 2011. For each country,
   national measures of income inequality (Gini coefficient) along with
   covariate risk factors for schizophrenia were obtained. Multi-level
   mixed-effects Poisson regression was performed to investigate the
   relationship between Gini coefficients and incidence rates of
   schizophrenia controlling for covariates.
   Results: One hundred and seven incidence rates (from 26 countries) were
   included. Mean incidence of schizophrenia was 18.50 per 100,000 (SD =
   11.9; range = 1.7-67). There was a significant positive relationship
   between incidence rate of schizophrenia and Gini coefficient ( = 1.02; Z
   = 2.28; p = .02; 95\% CI = 1.00, 1.03).
   Conclusions: Countries characterized by a large rich-poor gap may be at
   increased risk of schizophrenia. We suggest that income inequality
   impacts negatively on social cohesion, eroding social capital, and that
   chronic stress associated with living in highly disparate societies
   places individuals at risk of schizophrenia.}},

Abstract = {{Background: We investigated the prevalence and protective value of
   serosorting {[}ie, establishing HIV concordance in advance to practice
   unprotected anal intercourse (UAI)] with casual partners (CP) among
   HIV-negative men who have sex with men (MSM) using longitudinal data
   from 2007 to 2011. Methods: Men of the Amsterdam Cohort Studies were
   tested biannually for HIV-1 antibodies and filled in questionnaires
   about sexual behavior in the preceding 6 months. HIV incidence was
   examined among men who practiced UAI, UAI with serosorting, or
   consistent condom use, using Poisson regression. Results: Of 445 MSM
   with CPs, 31 seroconverted for HIV during a total follow-up of 1107
   person-years. Overall observed HIV incidence rate was 2.8/100
   person-years. Consistent condom use was reported in 64\%, UAI in 25\%,
   and UAI with serosorting in 11\% of the 2137 follow-up visits. MSM who
   practiced serosorting were less likely to seroconvert {[}adjusted
   incidence rate ratio (aIRR) = 0.46; 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.13
   to 1.59] than MSM who had UAI, but more likely to seroconvert than MSM
   who consistently used condoms (aIRR = 1.32; 95\% CI: 0.37 to 4.62),
   although differences in both directions were not statistically
   significant. MSM who consistently used condoms were less likely to
   seroconvert than MSM who had UAI (aIRR = 0.37; 95\% CI: 0.18 to 0.77).
   Discussion: The protective effect for serosorting we found was not
   statistically significant. Consistent condom use was found to be most
   protective against HIV infection. Larger studies are needed to
   demonstrate whether serosorting with CPs offers sufficient protection
   against HIV infection, and if not, why it fails to do so.}},

Abstract = {{By introducing a periodic array of pores in an elastic matrix,
   instabilities with wavelengths that are of the order of the size of the
   microstructure can be triggered. Interestingly, these instabilities can
   be utilized to design a novel class of responsive materials. Possible
   applications include materials with unusual properties such as negative
   Poisson's ratio, phononic and photonic switches and colorful and
   reconfigurable displays.
   Although shape plays an important role in the design and performance of
   periodic materials, so far only the non-linear response of structures
   with circular and elliptical pores has been investigated and the effect
   of the pore shape on the structural response has not yet been explored.
   Here, we numerically explore the effect of pore shape on the non-linear
   response of a square array of pores in an elastomeric matrix. Our
   results show that pore shape can be used effectively to design material
   with desired properties and to control attractive features of soft
   porous systems, such as their stiffness, critical strain and negative
   Poisson's ratio. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background Active tuberculosis (TB) risk increases during anti-tumor
   necrosis factor (TNF) therapy; therefore, latent TB infection (LTBI)
   screening is recommended in potential TNF inhibitor users. It is unclear
   whether anti-TNF therapy increases the risk of active TB infection even
   after standard LTBI treatment.
   Objective The objective of this study was to compare the risk of active
   TB development in LTBI-positive versus LBTI-negative TNF inhibitor users
   following the current national LTBI treatment guidelines for LTBI.
   Methods We retrospectively studied 949 TNF inhibitor users with
   immune-mediated inflammatory diseases from 2005 to 2012 at the Yonsei
   University Health System. We compared the incidence of active TB among
   LTBI-positive TNF inhibitor users treated according to national
   guidelines (n = 256) and LTBI-negative TNF inhibitor users (n = 521),
   using Poisson regression.
   Results The active TB incidence was 1107 per 100,000 patient-years in
   LTBI-positive TNF inhibitor users who received standard LTBI treatment
   and 490 per 100,000 patient-years in LTBI-negative TNF inhibitor users.
   Analysis showed that despite this numerical trend active TB risk was not
   statistically significantly elevated in LTBI-positive versus
   LTBI-negative TNF inhibitor users (incidence risk ratio, 2.15; P = 0.24;
   95\% confidence interval, 0.6-7.7).
   Conclusions This study demonstrated no statistically significantly
   increased risk of active TB in LTBI-positive TNF inhibitor users who
   received standard LTBI treatment compared with LTBI-negative TNF
   inhibitor users.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: The prevalence of waterpipe tobacco smoking (WPTS) is
   increasing worldwide. The aims of this study were (a) to evaluate the
   psychometric properties of the Lebanon Waterpipe Dependence Scale
   (LWDS-11), and (b) to assess, estimate, and identify factors associated
   with waterpipe tobacco dependence symptoms among U.K. male adult
   resident waterpipe tobacco smokers.
   A total of 180 waterpipe tobacco smokers were recruited during random
   visits to 7 outlets serving waterpipe tobacco. Data were collected via
   face-to-face interviews using the WPTS module of the Global Adult
   Tobacco Survey and the LWDS-11. Descriptive statistics, exploratory
   psychometric, univariate, and Poisson regression analysis were employed.
   Participants M/SD age was 29.46/9.41 years, Arabic ethnicity accounted
   for 58.3\%, and 53.9\% had completed more than secondary education.
   Psychometric analyses for the LWDS-10, after removing 1 item from the
   generic scale, revealed Cronbachs alpha coefficient 0.74. About 47\% of
   the sample demonstrated waterpipe tobacco dependence. Being Arab (p
   .040, OR 2.63, 95\% CI 1.056.62), smoking waterpipe daily in the past (p
   .003, OR 2.13, 95\% CI 1.303.49), and an increase in length in the last
   session of WPTS (p .044, OR 1.15, 95\% CI 1.001.32) were identified as
   risk factors for waterpipe tobacco dependence.
   This study demonstrated the potential of LWDS-11 and revealed 2 domains:
   positive and negative reinforcement and physiological dependence.
   Results indicated that waterpipe tobacco smokers in the United Kingdom
   demonstrated tobacco dependence symptoms, which were associated with
   socio-behavioral factors. Generalizability of these findings and their
   implications in public health are yet to be investigated.}},

Abstract = {{Layered perovskite SrO(SrTiO3)(n) (n=1,2) and SrTiO3 were analyzed using
   the density functional theory within a generalized gradient
   approximation. The elastic properties of SrTiO3, Sr2TiO4, and Sr3Ti2O7,
   including the bulk modulus, shear modulus. Young's modulus, Poisson's
   ratio, and elastic anisotropy ratios, were investigated. Results show
   that hardness decreases with decreasing SrTiO3/SrO ratio. Except for

Abstract = {{Objective Previous randomised trial data have demonstrated that male
   circumcision reduces Mycoplasma genitalium prevalence in men. We
   assessed whether male circumcision also reduces M genitalium infection
   in female partners of circumcised men.
   Methods HIV-negative men were enrolled and randomised to either male
   circumcision or control. Female partners of male trial participants from
   the intervention (n=437) and control (n=394) arms provided interview
   information and self-collected vaginal swabs that were tested for M
   genitalium by APTIMA transcription-mediated amplification-based assay.
   Prevalence risk ratios (PRR) and 95\% CI of M genitalium prevalence in
   intervention versus control group were estimated using Poisson
   regression. Analysis was by intention-to-treat. An as-treated analysis
   was conducted to account for study-group crossovers.
   Results Male and female partner enrolment sociodemographic
   characteristics, sexual behaviours, and symptoms of sexually transmitted
   infections were similar between study arms. Female M genitalium
   prevalence at year 2 was 3.2\% (14/437) in the intervention arm and
   3.6\% (14/394) in the control arm (PRR=0.90, 95\% CI 0.43 to 1.89,
   p=0.78). In an as-treated analysis, the prevalence of M genitalium was
   3.4\% in female partners of circumcised men and 3.3\% in female partners
   of uncircumcised men (PRR=1.01, 95\% CI 0.48 to 2.12, p=0.97).
   Conclusions Contrary to findings in men, male circumcision did not
   affect M genitalium infection in female partners.}},

Title = {{Characterization and deformation response of orthotropic fibre networks

Journal = {{ACTA MATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{66}},
Pages = {{326-339}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{In the present paper, highly porous fibre networks made of 316L fibres,
   with different fibre volume fractions, are characterized in terms of
   network architecture, elastic constants and fracture energies. Elastic
   constants are measured using quasi-static mechanical and modal vibration
   testing, yielding local and globally averaged properties, respectively.
   Differences between quasi-static and dynamic elastic constants are
   attributed to through-thickness shear effects. Regardless of the method
   employed, networks show signs of material inhomogeneity at high fibre
   densities, in agreement with X-ray nanotomography results. Strong
   auxetic (or negative Poisson's ratio) behaviour is observed in the
   through-thickness direction, which is attributed to fibre kinking
   induced during processing. Measured fracture energies are compared with
   model predictions incorporating information about in-plane fibre
   orientation distribution, fibre volume fraction and single fibre work of
   fracture. Experimental values are broadly consistent with model
   predictions, based on the assumption that this energy is primarily
   associated with plastic deformation of individual fibres within a
   process zone of the same order as the inter-joint spacing. (C) 2013 Acta

Abstract = {{In this paper, we constructed a new honeycomb by replacing the

   fracture strength and stress intensity factor. Interestingly, with
   respect to the conventional regular hexagonal honeycomb, its Young's
   modulus and fracture strength are improved by 76\% and 303\%,
   respectively; whereas, for its stress intensity factor, two
   possibilities exist for the maximal improvements which are dependent of
   its relative density, and the two improvements are 366\% for low-density
   case and 195\% for high-density case, respectively. Moreover, a minimal
   Poisson's ratio exists. The present structure and theory could be used
   to design new honeycomb materials. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The work describes the manufacturing and testing of graded
   conventional/auxetic honeycomb cores. The graded honeycombs are
   manufactured using Kevlar woven fabric/914 epoxy prepreg using Kirigami
   techniques, which consist in a combination of Origami and ply-cut
   processes. The cores are used to manufacture sandwich panels for
   flatwise compression and edgewise loading. The compressive modulus and
   compressive strength of stabilized (sandwich) honeycombs are found to be
   higher than those of bare honeycombs, and with density-averaged
   properties enhanced compared to other sandwich panels offered in the
   market place. The modulus and strength of graded sandwich panel under
   quasi-static edgewise loading vary with different failure mode
   mechanisms, and offer also improvements towards available panels from
   open literature. Edgewise impact loading shows a strong directionality
   of the mechanical response. When the indenter impacts the auxetic
   portion of the graded core, the strong localization of the damage due to
   the negative Poisson's ratio effect contains significantly the maximum
   dynamic displacement of the sandwich panel. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{A novel composite structure with isotropic negative Poisson's ratio has
   been presented in our previous paper {[}1]. However, the previous study
   has only focused on the effects of random inclusions. In this work, an
   extended numerical study on the effects of materials properties and
   geometry features of inclusions is conducted in order to better
   understand the deformation mechanism and mechanical properties of this
   kind of composites. Using finite element method, the overall negative
   Poisson's ratio effects and mechanical properties of the composites are
   analyzed in terms of different factors including thickness and stiffness
   of inclusions with uniform and non-uniform struts. The structure
   optimization of the composites with better negative Poisson's ratio
   effect and mechanical performance are discussed based on the numerical
   calculated results. The study shows that the Poisson's ratio effects and
   mechanical properties of the composites are significantly affected by
   geometrical features, stiffness and boundary conditions of inclusions.

Abstract = {{Purpose: To present mixture regression analysis as an alternative to
   more standard regression analysis for predicting adolescent delinquency.
   We demonstrate how mixture regression analysis allows for the
   identification of population subgroups defined by the salience of
   multiple risk factors.
   Methods: We identified population subgroups (i.e., latent classes) of
   individuals based on their coefficients in a regression model predicting
   adolescent delinquency from eight previously established risk indices
   drawn from the community, school, family, peer, and individual levels.
   The study included N = 37,763 10th-grade adolescents who participated in
   the Communities That Care Youth Survey. Standard, zero-inflated, and
   mixture Poisson and negative binomial regression models were considered.
   Results: Standard and mixture negative binomial regression models were
   selected as optimal. The five-class regression model was interpreted
   based on the class-specific regression coefficients, indicating that
   risk factors had varying salience across classes of adolescents.
   Conclusions: Standard regression showed that all risk factors were
   significantly associated with delinquency. Mixture regression provided
   more nuanced information, suggesting a unique set of risk factors that
   were salient for different subgroups of adolescents. Implications for
   the design of subgroup-specific interventions are discussed. (C) 2014

Title = {{Interhospital Transfer and Adverse Outcomes after General Surgery:
   Implications for Pay for Performance}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{218}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Interhospital transfer is frequent, and transferred patients
   can have worse outcomes than direct admissions. We sought to define the
   incidence of interhospital transfer in general surgery and evaluate its
   association with surgical outcomes.
   STUDY DESIGN: The 2011 American College of Surgeons NSQIP database was
   used. Transferred patients were compared with urgent, inpatient direct
   admissions in a series of increasingly complex risk- adjustment models,
   including multiple regression using modified Poisson and negative
   binomial models, as well as propensity scores. Primary outcomes were
   overall complications, mortality, length of stay, and readmission.
   RESULTS: Overall, 7\% of inpatient general surgery cases were
   transferred in. Among urgent cases, there were 6,197 transferred
   patients and 47,267 direct admissions. The most common procedures for
   direct admissions were appendectomy and cholecystectomy, and transfers
   had a more complex and broader range of procedures. On unadjusted
   analysis, transferred patients had a much higher risk for complications
   (risk ratio {[}RR] 1.48; 95\% CI, 1.45-1.52) and mortality (RR = 2.70;
   95\% CI, 2.48-2.94), as well as a longer length of stay (1.74 times
   longer; 95\% CI, 1.69-1.78) and higher risk of readmission (RR = 1.31;
   95\% CI, 1.20-1.44). In the most sophisticated model, the propensity
   score match, the difference in outcomes for transferred patients was
   only modestly higher or equivalent (complications: RR = 1.03; 95\% CI,
   1.00-1.07; mortality: RR = 0.98; 95\% CI, 0.88-1.09; length of stay:
   1.08 times longer; 95\% CI, 1.04-1.11; readmission: RR = 0.97; 95\% CI,
   0.88-1.08).
   CONCLUSIONS: Interhospital transfer is frequent in surgery. Worse
   outcomes seen in transferred patients are largely due to confounding by
   patient characteristics rather than any true harm from transfer. Pay-
   for- performance schemes should adjust for transfer status to avoid
   unfairly penalizing hospitals that frequently accept transfers. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Based on the capillary tension theory and microstructure pore of
   concrete, a prediction method of early autogenous shrinkage of
   self-consolidating concrete (SCC) was established. Self-consolidating
   concrete (SCC) specimens with different strength grades were prepared.
   The physical and mechanical properties (autogenous shrinkage, Poisson's
   ratio, modulus of elasticity and compressive strength) of SCC with
   different strength grades were tested at the age of 3,7, and 28 days.
   The 3,7 and 28 days pore distribution of capillary pores of SCC with
   different strength grades were also tested. Negative pressure of
   capillary and autogenous shrinkage were determined by means of capillary
   tension theory. Finally, based on the calculation results, a prediction
   method of early autogenous shrinkage of SCC was established. The results
   show that predicted values derived from this model matched very well
   with measured values. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background:
   Most antiretroviral drugs are metabolized by the liver; hepatic disease
   or liver damage as a result of hepatitis C virus (HCV) could impair this
   metabolism leading to an increased risk of drug toxicity. This study
   aimed to determine the risk of antiretroviral drug discontinuation among
   HCV/HIV coinfected patients.
   Methods:
   EuroSIDA patients taking combination antiretroviral therapy were
   included. Poisson regression identified factors associated with
   antiretroviral treatment discontinuation.
   Results:
   A total of 9535 HIV-positive patients with known HCV status were
   included (6939 HCVAb-negative; 2596 HCVAb-positive at baseline). Viremic
   HCV infection was associated with a 44\% increased risk of
   antiretroviral drug discontinuation compared with aviremic infection
   {[}adjusted incidence rate ratio, aIRR: 1.44 (95\% confidence interval,
   CI 1.22-1.69)]; this relationship was largest among nonnucleoside
   reverse transcriptase inhibitors {[}aIRR: 1.59 (95\% CI 1.18-2.14)]. In
   the subset of 935 HIV-positive patients also HCV-positive or
   HBV-positive with plasma hyaluronic acid measured, hyaluronic acid more
   than 100 ng/ml was associated with a 37\% increased risk of
   antiretroviral drug discontinuation {[}aIRR: 1.37 (95\% CI 1.08-1.73)
   vs. hyaluronic acid <= 100 ng/ml] and the effect of HCV viremia became
   nonsignificant; the largest drug association was seen for protease
   inhibitors {[}aIRR: 1.40 (95\% CI 1.04-1.89)].
   Conclusion:
   HCV viremia and high levels of hyaluronic acid predict antiretroviral
   drug discontinuation. Evidence was also found to suggest a link between
   impaired liver function and protease inhibitor toxicity.}},

Abstract = {{A symmetry-adapted version of the Maxwell rule appropriate to periodic
   bar-and-joint frameworks is obtained, and is further extended to
   body-and-joint systems. The treatment deals with bodies and forces that

   to the factor group of the space group of the framework. Explicit
   expressions are found for the numbers and symmetries of detectable
   mechanisms and states of self-stress in terms of the numbers and
   symmetries of framework components. This approach allows detection and
   characterization of mechanisms and states of self-stress in microscopic
   and macroscopic materials and meta-materials. Illustrative examples are
   described. The notion of local isostaticity of periodic frameworks is
   extended to include point-group symmetry.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{FEB 13}},
Abstract = {{Synergistic integration of electromagnetic (EM) and mechanical
   properties of metamaterials, a concept known as smart metamaterials,
   promises new applications across the spectrum, from flexible waveguides
   to shape-conforming cloaks. These applications became possible thanks to
   smart transformation optics (STO), a design methodology that utilizes
   coordinate transformations to control both EM wave propagation and
   mechanical deformation of the device. Here, we demonstrate several STO
   devices based on extremely auxetic (Poisson ratio -1)
   elasto-electromagnetic metamaterials, both of which exhibit enormous
   flexibility and sustain efficient operation upon a wide range of
   deformations. Spatial maps of microwave electric fields across these
   devices confirm our ability to deform carpet cloaks, bent waveguides,
   and potentially other quasi-conformal TO-based devices operating at 7
   similar to 8 GHz. These devices are each fabricated from a single sheet
   of initially uniform (double-periodic) square-lattice metamaterial,
   which acquires the necessary distribution of effective permittivity
   entirely from the mechanical deformation of its boundary. By integrating
   transformation optics and continuum mechanics theory, we provide
   analytical derivations for the design of STO devices. Additionally, we
   clarify an important point relating to two-dimensional STO devices: the
   difference between plane stress and plane strain assumptions, which lead
   to elastic metamaterials with Poisson ratio -1 and -infinity,
   respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Background: We sought to clarify the association of HIV infection and
   immunodeficiency on myocardial infarction (MI) risk. Methods: We
   conducted a cohort study from 1996 to 2009 of HIV-positive (HIV+) and
   demographically matched HIV-negative (HIV-) Kaiser Permanente California
   health plan members. Rate ratios (RRs) were obtained from Poisson
   regression models comparing MI incidence rates between HIV+ (overall and
   stratified by recent and nadir CD4 count, and recent HIV RNA levels) and
   HIV- subjects, adjusting for age, sex, calendar era, race/ethnicity,
   census-based socioeconomic status, smoking, alcohol/drug abuse,
   overweight/obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and lipid-lowering therapy.
   Among HIV+ subjects, we also evaluated the independent association of
   CD4, HIV RNA, and antiretroviral therapy (ART) use. Results: The study
   population included 22,081 HIV+ and 230,069 HIV- subjects. The crude MI
   incidence rate per 100,000 person-years was 283 and 165 for HIV+ and
   HIV- subjects, respectively, with an adjusted RR of 1.4 {[}95\%
   confidence interval (CI): 1.3 to 1.6]. Compared with HIV- subjects
   (reference), MI rates were similar for HIV+ subjects with recent CD4 >=
   500 cells per microliter (RR = 1.18; 95\% CI: 0.96 to 1.45) and those
   with nadir CD4 >= 500 cells per microliter (RR = 0.85; 95\% CI: 0.55 to
   1.33). Among HIV+ subjects, nadir CD4 was the only HIV-specific factor
   associated with MIs (RR per 100 cells = 0.88; 95\% CI: 0.81 to 0.96),
   whereas recent CD4 and HIV RNA, prior ART use, and duration of protease
   inhibitors and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors were not
   associated with MIs. Conclusion: HIV+ subjects with recent or nadir CD4
   >= 500 cells per microliter had similar MI rates compared with HIV-
   subjects. Lower nadir CD4, in particular, seems to be independently
   associated with MIs. These results strengthen recommendations for
   earlier ART initiation.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The epidemiology of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection among
   HIV-infected men who have sex with men (MSM) who do not inject drugs in
   Asia remains unknown. Method: The incidence and risk factors for
   incident HCV infection among HIV-infected MSM at a large HIV clinic in
   Tokyo were elucidated. Poisson regression compared the incidence of HCV
   seroconversion at different observation periods. Results: Of 753 HIV-1
   infected MSM patients negative for HCV antibody (HCVAb) at baseline and
   available follow-up HCVAb test, 21 patients (2.8\%) seroconverted to
   HCVAb positive over 2246 person-years (PY), for an incidence of 9.35 per
   1000 PY. The incidence increased over time from 0 per 1000 PY in
   2005-2006, 3.0 per 1000 PY in 2007-2008, 7.7 per 1000 PY in 2009-2010,
   to 24.9 per 1000 PY in 2011-2012 (P = 0.012). Of 21 incident cases, only
   4 (19\%) were injection drug users, and sensitivity analysis that
   excluded injection drug users yielded similar findings. Multivariate
   analysis identified illicit drug use to be an independent risk for HCV
   infection (hazard ratio = 3.006; 95\% confidence interval: 1.092 to
   8.275; P = 0.033). Conclusions: Incident HCV infection is increasing
   among HIV-1-infected MSM noninjection drug users at resource-rich
   setting in Asia. Illicit drug use is an independent risk factor for
   incident HCV infection in this population.}},

Title = {{Negative Poisson's ratios in metal nanoplates}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The Poisson's ratio is a fundamental measure of the elastic-deformation
   behaviour of materials. Although negative Poisson's ratios are
   theoretically possible, they were believed to be rare in nature. In
   particular, while some studies have focused on finding or producing
   materials with a negative Poisson's ratio in bulk form, there has been
   no such study for nanoscale materials. Here we provide numerical and
   theoretical evidence that negative Poisson's ratios are found in several
   nanoscale metal plates under finite strains. Furthermore, under the same
   conditions of crystal orientation and loading direction, materials with
   a positive Poisson's ratio in bulk form can display a negative Poisson's
   ratio when the material's thickness approaches the nanometer scale. We
   show that this behaviour originates from a unique surface effect that
   induces a finite compressive stress inside the nanoplates, and from a
   phase transformation that causes the Poisson's ratio to depend strongly
   on the amount of stretch.}},

   and higher performance. By developing a theoretical analytical model and
   a finite element analysis (FEA) model of Negative Poisson's Ratio (NPR)
   structure cell, the effect of relative density and topological structure
   on the linear and nonlinear properties is studied. A compressive
   experiment using a 3{*}3 NPR structure sample made of ABS material was
   developed. The experimental results concluded that NPR structure
   possesses the negative Poisson's (between 0 and -1) and enhanced
   strength under in-plane compression, which provide theoretical

Abstract = {{This paper examines a novel approach to designing auxetic textiles. Knit
   design techniques are used to create auxetic weft-knitted textiles.
   Development of the appropriate fabrics addresses aesthetic, tactile and
   subjective design qualities alongside questions of auxetic functionality
   and testing considerations. The auxetic fabrics produced exhibit
   expansion in the X- or Y-axis (aligning axes to direction of knitting).
   The results range from neutral Poisson's ratio to those with a marked
   expansion in relation to their extension. The fabric discussed uses
   relief stitch structures and transferred stitches. Variant auxetic
   knitted fabrics have been produced including related stitch structures
   and spacer fabrics using the same design processes. The auxetic effects
   are inspired by common auxetic geometries from the literature. This
   research aims to combine the methodologies used in knit design and knit
   engineering to create functional auxetic textiles by using the methods
   innate to a more traditionally aesthetic design subject. Using
   quantitative methods to measure the auxetic effect in the samples and
   qualitative personal reflections on samples, results are kept simple in
   order to promote dissemination amongst practitioners in different
   fields. Utilising focus groups with practitioners from various design
   fields it is also possible to assess the visual, tactile and commercial
   appeal of the auxetic fabrics whilst they are still in the developmental
   stage. Using these different methods of feedback into the design stage
   the theoretical outcome remains simple in terms of language and results
   stated. The importance of knowledge transfer between disciplines of
   design and engineering is key to this study. Data capture is imperative
   encompassing qualitative and quantitative perspectives in conjunction
   with the use of generically specified terminology. The knowledge
   transfer afforded by these collaborations is a key output to support the
   methods chosen for fabric development, those which cross disciplines and
   appeal to a wide market. Along with an open and experimental approach to
   conceiving product applications, this will help to place auxetic
   materials in public view in areas that are novel to the field of auxetic
   research. (C) 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA, Weinheim}},

   sewing an inextensible thin cord through an elastic fat cord, in a
   triangular pattern, to form a semi-auxetic yarn. When stretched in the
   longitudinal direction, the semi-auxetic yarn exhibits conventional and
   auxetic behavior in the plane perpendicular and parallel, respectively,
   to the plane which the inextensible thin cord lies on. A simplified
   model is developed herein to describe the effective Poisson's ratio of
   the yarn in the conventional and auxetic planes in terms of the initial
   half angle of the thin cord and the Poisson's ratio of the fat cord.
   Results show that the Poisson's ratio of the yarn in the auxetic plane
   decreases and increases with the initial half angle of the thin cord and
   the Poisson's ratio of the fat cord, respectively, while the Poisson's
   ratio of the yarn in the conventional plane increases with both
   parameters. In addition, the dominant parameters for the yarn in the
   auxetic and conventional planes are the initial half angle of the thin
   cord and the Poisson's ratio of the fat cord, respectively. Finally,
   other types of semi-auxetic yarns in the same category are proposed with
   suggested ways of producing them. (C) 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co.

Abstract = {{Auxetic fabrics have gained an increasing attention in the auxetic
   material area in recent years. Especially, auxetic fabrics fabricated
   based on both weft-knitted and warp-knitted structures have made some
   important progress. However, all the knitted auxetic fabrics reported so
   far are fabricated based on 2D knitted structures, although some of the
   weft-knitted auxetic fabrics are finally formed into 3D forms. This
   paper reports a novel kind of 3D auxetic fabric fabricated based on a
   warp-knitted spacer structure with adoption of a special geometrical
   configuration which is formed with parallelograms. The auxetic behavior
   of these fabrics is discussed in terms of tensile direction, geometrical
   parameter, and repeated extension. The shape fitting ability on a
   spherical surface is also demonstrated. The results shows that the 3D
   auxetic fabrics have auxetic behavior in all the fabric plane directions
   and the highest auxetic effect is obtained when stretched in the weft
   direction of the fabric. The 3D auxetic fabrics also display an
   excellent shape fitting ability, which makes them very attractive for
   various applications where fitting to the human body's shape is highly
   required, such as bra cups, protectors for knees and elbows, shoes
   covers, etc. (C) 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA, Weinheim}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this research is to understand more fully the
   out-of-plane auxetic behavior of paper. In the reported research,
   initial characterization of the auxetic properties of common,
   commercially available papers is described. The results of these
   experiments suggest that the auxetic response seen in paper structures
   is related to the cellulose fiber network structure, as previously
   suggested, and is related to inter-fiber bonding and fiber organization
   in the sheet. These results also indicate that further study is needed
   to understand how materials and processing variables influence auxetic
   behavior. A mathematical model, attempting to explain auxetic response
   in an idealized arrangement of fibers is included. Ultimately, the
   fundamental understanding resulting from this research should lead to
   new product development opportunities for forest product-based paper
   materials as well as to the establishment of predictive

Abstract = {{Auxetic foams have been widely studied in view of their superior
   properties and many useful applications and various models have been
   developed to help explain the auxetic behavior in such foams. One such
   model involves the description of auxetic foams in terms of rotating
   units (e.g. the joints where different cell walls meet), a mechanism,
   which has also been observed experimentally. In the models, the rotating
   units are taken, to a first approximation, to be representable through
   rotating rigid triangles, which correspond to the 2D projection of these
   rotating units and although this model has been improved significantly
   since it was first proposed, current models still do not fully capture
   all the deformations that may occur in real foams. In this work, we
   propose an extended model which not only allows for relative rotation of
   the units (joints), represented by non-equilateral triangular units, but
   also for differing amount of material at the joints as well as
   deformation of the joints themselves, a scenario that is more
   representative of real auxetic foams. This model shows that, by
   permitting deformation mechanisms other than rotation of the triangles,
   the predicted extent of auxeticity decreases when compared to the
   equivalent idealized rotating rigid triangles model, thus resulting in
   more plausible predictions of the Poisson's ratios. Furthermore, it is
   shown that in the manufacturing process, a minimum compression factor,
   which is dependent on the amount of materials at the joints, is required
   to obtain an auxetic foam from a conventional foam, as one normally
   observed in experimental work on foams. (C) 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH

Abstract = {{Auxetics, i.e. systems with a negative Poisson's ratio, exhibit the
   unexpected property of becoming wider when stretched and narrower when
   compressed. This property arises from the manner in which the internal
   geometric units within the system deform when the system is submitted to
   a stress and may be explained in terms of geometry-deformation
   mechanism' based models. This work considers realistic finite
   implementations of the well known rotating squares system in the form of
   (i) a finite planar structure and (ii) a tubular conformation, as one
   typically finds in stents. It shows that although the existing models of
   the Poisson's ratios and moduli based on periodic systems may be
   appropriate to model systems where the geometry/deformation mechanism
   operate at the micro- or nano- (molecular) level where a system may be
   considered as a quasi infinite system, corrections to the model may need
   to be made when one considers finite structures with a small number of
   repeat units and suggests that for finite systems, especially for the 2D
   systems, the moduli as predicted by the periodic model may be
   significantly overestimating the moduli of the real system, even
   sometimes by as much as 200\%. (C) 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co.

Abstract = {{It is a well-known fact that the mechanical properties of coronary
   stents are defined mainly by two components, the constituting material
   and the design pattern of the stent itself. The latter especially has
   attracted the interest of entrepreneurs and scientists alike with a
   plethora of patents being issued for numerous stent designs. Despite
   this widespread interest, the suitability of said designs are seldom
   studied. Accordingly, in this work we have investigated the properties
   of stent designs based on the hexagonal honeycomb geometry. Stent
   patterns based upon re-entrant, non re-entrant, and hybrid honeycomb
   geometries were studied with respect to their behaviour at extremely
   high strains using Finite Element Analysis. The data collected indicates
   that although the non re-entrant and hybrid geometries may be more
   suited to stent designs than the re-entrant geometry in terms of
   tolerance to high strains, none of these systems convey all the ideal
   properties desired in a stent, even if the former two have the potential
   of exhibiting some of them. (C) 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA,

Abstract = {{A re-entrant honeycomb structure made from a novel solid composite based
   on recycled rubber is an innovative and sustainable solution for
   engineering applications. This work describes the tensile and failure
   behaviour of multi re-entrant honeycomb topologies consisting of width,
   thickness and angle variations. Finite element (FE) models were also
   developed to simulate tensile tests and failure behaviour of the
   cellular structures. A Taguchi design (L8) was conducted to determine
   the effect of each factor on the ultimate strength, ultimate strain,
   modulus of elasticity, Poisson's ratio and Von Mises stress. The
   experimental and FE results showed a good correlation, validating the
   numerical model which was used to perform a parametric analysis on the
   influence of the cell geometry over the failure behaviour of the
   structures. The magnitude of Poisson's ratio was significantly affected
   by the level of each cell geometric parameter. The structures with lower
   Poisson's ratio values were able to absorb more energy, and
   consequently, exhibiting less points of failure. It was found the
   thickness and the width has a significant effect on the tensile
   properties and failure behaviour. (C) 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co.

Abstract = {{A sandwich-structured composite is a special class of composite
   materials that is fabricated by attaching two thin but stiff layers to a
   lightweight but thick core. Composites analyzed in this paper consist of
   two different materials: auxetic and structural steel. The optimization
   criterion is minimum compliance for the load case where the frame's top
   boundary is downward loaded. Outer layers are made of steel while the
   middle layer is two-phase solid material composite. Only the middle
   layer is optimized by means of minimization of the objective function
   defined as the internal strain energy. In the first part of this paper
   we study the application of the solid isotropic material with
   penalization (SIMP) model to find the optimal distribution of a given
   amount of materials in sandwich-structured composite. In the second part
   we propose a multilayered composite structure in which internal layers
   surfaces are wavy. In both cases the total energy strain is analyzed.

Abstract = {{Using Finite Element computer simulations, Poisson's ratio (PR) is
   determined for anti-chiral structures built on rectangular lattices with
   disorder introduced by stochastic distributions of circular node sizes.
   The investigated models are parameterized by the lattice anisotropy, the
   rib thickness, and the radii distribution of circular nodes. Three
   approaches are developed. The first approach, exact in the limit of
   infinitely large system and infinitely dense mesh, uses only planar
   elements (CPS3). Two other approaches are approximate and exploit
   one-dimensional elements utilizing the Timoshenko beam theory. It is
   shown that in the case of sufficiently large anisotropy of the studied
   structures PR can be highly negative, reaching any negative value,
   including those lower than -1. Thin ribs and thin-walled circular nodes
   favor low values of PR. In the case of thick ribs and thick-walled
   circular nodes PR is higher. In both cases the dispersion of the values
   of circular nodes radii has a minor effect on the lowest values of PR. A
   comparison of the results obtained with three different approaches shows
   that the Timoshenko beam based approximations are valid only in the thin
   rib limit. The difference between them grows with increasing thickness.

   This work presents the results of simulations performed on a number of

   plane waves of distortion for conventional solids but the gap narrows

Abstract = {{Oesophageal cancer is the ninth leading cause of malignant cancer death
   and its prognosis remains poor, ranking as the sixth most frequent cause
   of death in the world. This research work aims to adopt an Auxetic
   (rotating-squares) geometry device, that had previously been examined
   theoretically and analysed by Grima and Evans (J Mater Sci Lett
   19(17):1563-1565, 2000), to produce a novel Auxetic oesophageal stent
   and stent-grafts relevant to the palliative treatment of oesophageal
   cancer and also for the prevention of dysphagia. This paper discusses
   the manufacture of a small diameter Auxetic oesophageal stent and
   stent-graft. The oral deployment of such an Auxetic stent would be
   simplest if a commercial balloon dilatational catheter was used as this
   obviates the need for an expensive dedicated delivery system. A novel
   manufacturing route was employed in this research to develop both
   Auxetic films and Auxetic oesophageal stents, which ranged from
   conventional subtractive techniques to a new additive manufacturing
   method. Polyurethane was selected as a material for the fabrication of
   Auxetic films and Auxetic oesophageal stents because of its good
   biocompatibility and non-toxicological properties. The Auxetic films
   were later used for the fabrication of seamed Auxetic oesophageal
   stents. The flexible polyurethane tubular grafts were also attached to
   the inner luminal side of the seamless Auxetic oesophageal stents, in
   order to prevent tumour in-growth. Scanning electron microscopy was used
   to conduct surface morphology study by using different Auxetic specimens
   developed from different conventional and new additive manufacturing
   techniques. Tensile testing of the Auxetic films was performed to
   characterise their mechanical properties. The stent expansion tests of
   the Auxetic stents were done to analyse the longitudinal extension and
   radial expansion of the Auxetic stent at a range of radial pressures
   applied by the balloon catheter, and to also identify the pressure
   values where the Auxetic stent fails. Finite element models of both
   Auxetic film and Auxetic stent were developed, and the results were
   compared with experimental results with a good agreement. The tensile
   testing of the Auxetic polyurethane films revealed that the Poisson's
   ratio of the sample ranged between -0.87 and -0.963 at different
   uniaxial tensile load values. From the stent expansion test, it was
   found that the Auxetic oesophageal stent radially expanded from 0.5 to
   5.73 mm and longitudinally extended from 0.15 to 1.83 mm at a range of
   applied pressure increments (0.5-2.7 bar) from the balloon catheter.}},

   fluid}},

Abstract = {{We develop an inertial coupling method for modeling the dynamics of
   point-like ``blob{''} particles immersed in an incompressible fluid,
   generalizing previous work for compressible fluids (Balboa Usabiaga et
   al., 2013 {[}42]). The coupling consistently includes excess (positive
   or negative) inertia of the particles relative to the displaced fluid,
   and accounts for thermal fluctuations in the fluid momentum equation.
   The coupling between the fluid and the blob is based on a no-slip
   constraint equating the particle velocity with the local average of the
   fluid velocity, and conserves momentum and energy. We demonstrate that
   the formulation obeys a fluctuation-dissipation balance, owing to the
   non-dissipative nature of the no-slip coupling. We develop a
   spatio-temporal discretization that preserves, as best as possible,
   these properties of the continuum formulation. In the spatial
   discretization, the local averaging and spreading operations are
   accomplished using compact kernels commonly used in immersed boundary
   methods. We find that the special properties of these kernels allow the
   blob to provide an effective model of a particle; specifically, the
   volume, mass, and hydrodynamic properties of the blob are remarkably
   grid-independent. We develop a second-order semi-implicit temporal
   integrator that maintains discrete fluctuation-dissipation balance, and
   is not limited in stability by viscosity. Furthermore, the temporal
   scheme requires only constant-coefficient Poisson and Helmholtz linear
   solvers, enabling a very efficient and simple FFT-based implementation
   on GPUs. We numerically investigate the performance of the method on
   several standard test problems. In the deterministic setting, we find
   the blob to be a remarkably robust approximation to a rigid sphere, at
   both low and high Reynolds numbers. In the stochastic setting, we study
   in detail the short and long-time behavior of the velocity
   autocorrelation function and observe agreement with all of the known
   behavior for rigid sphere immersed in a fluctuating fluid. The proposed
   inertial coupling method provides a low-cost coarse-grained (minimal
   resolution) model of particulate flows over a wide range of time-scales
   ranging from Brownian to convection-driven motion. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Objectives The epilepsy treatment gap is largest in resource-poor
   countries. We evaluated the efficacy of a 1-day health education program
   in a rural area of Kenya. The primary outcome was adherence to
   antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) as measured by drug levels in the blood, and
   the secondary outcomes were seizure frequency and Kilifi Epilepsy
   Beliefs and Attitudes Scores (KEBAS). Methods Seven hundred thirty-eight
   people with epilepsy (PWE) and their designated supporter were
   randomized to either the intervention (education) or nonintervention
   group. Data were collected at baseline and 1year after the education
   intervention was administered to the intervention group. There were 581
   PWE assessed at both time points. At the end of the study, 105 PWE from
   the intervention group and 86 from the nonintervention group gave blood
   samples, which were assayed for the most commonly used AEDs
   (phenobarbital, phenytoin, and carbamazepine). The proportions of PWE
   with detectable AED levels were determined using a standard blood assay
   method. The laboratory technicians conducting the assays were blinded to
   the randomization. Secondary outcomes were evaluated using
   questionnaires administered by trained field staff. Modified Poisson
   regression was used to investigate the factors associated with improved
   adherence (transition from nonoptimal AED level in blood at baseline to
   optimal levels at follow-up), reduced seizures, and improved KEBAS,
   which was done as a post hoc analysis. This trial is registered in
   ISRCTN register under ISRCTN35680481. Results There was no significant
   difference in adherence to AEDs based on detectable drug levels (odds
   ratio {[}OR] 1.46, 95\% confidence interval {[}95\% CI] 0.74-2.90,
   p=0.28) or by self-reports (OR 1.00, 95\% CI 0.71-1.40, p=1.00) between
   the intervention and nonintervention group. The intervention group had
   significantly fewer beliefs about traditional causes of epilepsy,
   cultural treatment, and negative stereotypes than the nonintervention
   group. There was no difference in seizure frequency. A comparison of the
   baseline and follow-up data showed a significant increase in
   adherence-intervention group (36-81\% {[}p<0.001]) and nonintervention
   group (38-74\% {[}p<0.001])-using detectable blood levels. The number of
   patients with less frequent seizures (<= 3 seizures in the last 3months)
   increased in the intervention group (62-80\% {[}p=0.002]) and in the
   nonintervention group (67-75\% {[}p=0.04]). Improved therapeutic
   adherence (observed in both groups combined) was positively associated
   with positive change in beliefs about risks of epilepsy (relative risk
   {[}RR] 2.00, 95\% CI 1.03-3.95) and having nontraditional religious
   beliefs (RR 2.01, 95\% CI 1.01-3.99). Reduced seizure frequency was
   associated with improved adherence (RR 1.72, 95\% CI 1.19-2.47).
   Positive changes in KEBAS were associated with having tertiary education
   as compared to none (RR 1.09, 95\% CI 1.05-1.14). Significance Health
   education improves knowledge about epilepsy, but once only contact does
   not improve adherence. However, sustained education may improve
   adherence in future studies.}},

   Extremal materials can possess interesting properties such as a negative

   microstructures are shown to be close to the theoretical limit given by

   manufacturing constraints. The designs are generated using topology
   optimization. Due to high resolution and the imposed robustness
   requirement they are manufacturable without any need for
   post-processing. This has been validated by the manufacturing of an

Title = {{Maximizing the effective stiffness of laminate composite materials}},
Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{83}},
Pages = {{57-63}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The effective stiffness of laminate composites can be expressed
   explicitly and accurately as a function of several variables such as
   volume fractions and elastic constants of the constituent phases. Based
   on the stiffness function, an optimization procedure is proposed in this
   paper to maximize the effective Young's moduli of laminate composites in
   both longitudinal and transverse directions with respect to a number of
   design variables. By solving such a constrained optimization problem, a
   laminate composite can be designed by finding the optimal material
   properties of the constituent phases and their volume fractions. The
   effects of the volume fractions, the Young's moduli and the Poisson's
   ratios of the constituent phases in the effective composite stiffness
   are demonstrated through various design cases. It is shown that the
   optimized effective Young's moduli can reach values much higher than the
   well-known approximated Voigt estimation. Dramatic increases in the
   effective stiffness have also been found when the Poisson's ratios of
   the constituent phases approach the thermodynamic limits of -1 and 0.5.
   It is envisaged that with the proposed approach and modern fabrication
   technologies, laminate composites with exceptional effective stiffness
   can be easily designed and manufactured. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All

Abstract = {{This paper presents a design approach for developing meso-structure for
   high shear flexure in considering distribution of strain energy for a
   unit cell. Currently, flexible components are often designed with
   elastomers to take advantage of their unique properties of low shear
   modulus and high elongation. However, elastomers exhibit high loss
   modulus at a high frequency when they are subjected to cyclic loading.
   As a design requirement to find an alternative material in one of the
   sub systems in the extraterrestrial rover, materials with high
   elongation but low energy loss is investigated using a meso-structure
   design approach. In this paper, an approach to design a meso-structure
   exhibiting shear flexure is developed by conducting comparative studies
   of shear flexure on three equivalent configurations: auxetic, honeycomb,
   and sinusoidal. Based on this comparative study, a new hypothesis is
   proposed that specific strain energy distribution pattern in these
   meso-structure has a direct impact on the high shear flexure
   performance. This proposition is verified by developing a new
   meso-structure, termed `S'-Type, which is compared with auxetic and
   sinusoidal auxetic meso-structures on their shear flexure ability. It is
   shown from this comparative analysis that the `S'-Type meso-structure
   exhibits higher shear flexure than the other two meso-structures at 5,
   10, 20, and 40 MPa of effective shear moduli. Hence, based on this
   result, a four-step design approach is proposed to design future
   meso-structures with high shear flexure.}},

Abstract = {{In an effort to tailor functional materials with customized anisotropic
   properties - stiffness and yield strain, we propose porous materials
   consisting of flexible mesostructures designed from the deformation of a
   re-entrant auxetic honeycomb and compliant mechanisms. Using an analogy
   between compliant mechanisms and a cellular material's deformation, we
   can tailor in-plane properties of mesostructures; low stiffness and high
   strain in one direction and high stiffness and low strain in the other
   direction. Two mesostructures based on hexagonal honeycombs with
   positive and negative cell angles are generated. An analytical model is
   developed to obtain effective moduli and yield strains of the porous
   materials by combining the kinematics of a rigid link mechanism and
   deformation of flexure hinges. A numerical technique is implemented to
   the analytical model for nonlinear constitutive relations of the
   mesostructures and their strain dependent Poisson's ratios. A Finite
   Element Analysis (FEA) is used to validate the analytical and numerical
   model. The moduli and yield strain of a porous aluminum alloy are about
   6.3GPa and 0.26\% in one direction and about 2.8MPa and 12\% in the
   other direction. The mesostructures have extremely high positive and
   negative Poisson's ratios, v(xy){*} (similar to +/- 40) due to the large
   rotation of the link member in the transverse direction caused by the
   input displacement in the longitudinal direction. The mesostructures
   also show higher moduli for compressive loading due to the contact of
   slit edges at the center region. This paper demonstrates that compliant
   mesostructures can be used for a next generation material design in
   terms of tailoring mechanical properties; moduli, strength, strain, and
   Poisson's ratios. The proposed mesostructures can also be easily
   manufactured using a conventional cutting method.}},

Abstract = {{Cellular materials have a high strength-to-weight ratio, which is good
   for lightweight structural applications. In order to accelerate the
   commercial use of cellular materials in the structural applications, a
   well understanding of fracture behavior of cellular materials is
   required in terms of structural integrity. The objective of the study is
   to develop a predictive model on fracture behavior of orthotropic
   cellular polymers, prepared from an additive manufacturing method, under
   the mode-I macroscopic loading. The constituent material's fracture
   properties are obtained from the three-point bending test of samples
   with a notched crack. Using the base material's properties, a model on
   fracture toughness of hexagonal honeycombs with a varying cell angle is
   developed using a linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) model of a
   cell wall material. Numerical and experimental tests will follow to
   validate the model.}},

Abstract = {{Materials that possess a negative Poisson's ratio are called Auxetics.
   They are characterized by the counterintuitive behavior of expanding in
   tension and contracting in compression. To justify this deformation
   behavior, there have been developed theoretical modelations like the
   reentrant and bowtie models. However, the most generalized models are
   based on geometries that possess rigid trusses and hinging nodes. This
   does not portrait the reality of the application of these models. In
   this study, there have been performed simulations, using kinematic
   analysis to characterize the auxetic behavior of the theoretical
   rigid/hinging models and finite element analysis to characterize elastic
   models that represent real bodies. There were determined and compared
   the Poisson's ratios of the theoretical and elastic reentrant and
   bowtie. Additionally it was shown that there is a significant difference
   between the results. In conclusion the theoretical models predict lower
   values of Poisson's ratio, while the elastic models that simulate a real
   body show less auxetic behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Most current research analyzing traffic crashes is done at either the
   spot level or the regional level. Less attention is placed at the
   community level. In addition, the effects of changes in land use,
   population growth, and transportation networks on community traffic
   safety have not been systematically studied. Although a number of
   studies have defined some variables to describe the influence of the
   built environment on traffic crashes, no research has looked at this
   problem through a comprehensive framework of relevant built-environment
   variables. This study explored a geographic information system-based
   community-level method to understand the effects of the built
   environment on traffic crashes. The census block group was selected as
   the analysis unit for the study. The framework of D transportation
   variables, including the dimensions of density, diversity, design,
   destination accessibility, and distance to transit, was used to
   characterize the built environment. The crash and built-environment data
   were processed in a geographic information system, and the negative
   binomial model was applied. The results showed that density had little
   influence on any type of crash; however, the mixed land use was
   positively associated with all crash categories. Furthermore, street
   length and number of segments under the design variables resulted in
   positive coefficients. However, the number of intersections was negative
   to all crash types. Moreover, whereas the number of bus stops showed a
   positive influence on crashes, the coefficient that designated the
   distance of crashes from bus stops and commercial sites was negative.}},

Abstract = {{Sandwich panels are important components of advanced structures used in
   aerospace, automotive, railway, civil engineering etc. They are
   subjected to high and repeated variations of temperature which induce
   additional stresses as the core and the face sheets are from different
   materials having different coefficients of thermal expansion and moduli
   of elasticity. Therefore it is important to evaluate both mechanical and
   thermal stresses. In the literature one can find thermomechanical
   analyses of sandwich panels with metallic or composite face sheets and
   having a honeycomb or compact core made from polyurethane foam. In this
   paper was analysed a plane sandwich panel made from a cellular rigid
   polyurethane core, having a chiral configuration and auxetic properties
   (negative Poisson's ratio) exposed to a stationary temperature field
   with a linear variation from +25 degrees C on one sheet to -50 degrees C
   on the opposite sheet. Two boundary conditions were considered in the
   thermo-mechanical evaluation: the free panel and the panel simply
   supported around the edges.}},

Volume = {{10}},

Pages = {{7569-7576}},
Abstract = {{Open structures can display a number of unusual properties, including a
   negative Poisson's ratio, negative thermal expansion, and holographic
   elasticity, and have many interesting applications in engineering.
   However, it is a grand challenge to self-assemble open structures at the
   colloidal scale, where short-range interactions and low coordination
   number can leave them mechanically unstable. In this paper we discuss
   the self-assembly of three-dimensional open structures using triblock
   Janus particles, which have two large attractive patches that can form
   multiple bonds, separated by a band with purely hard-sphere repulsion.
   Such surface patterning leads to open structures that are stabilized by
   orientational entropy (in an order-by-disorder effect) and selected over
   close-packed structures by vibrational entropy. For different patch
   sizes the particles can form into either tetrahedral or octahedral
   structural motifs which then compose open lattices, including the
   pyrochlore, the hexagonal tetrastack and the perovskite lattices. Using
   an analytic theory, we examine the phase diagrams of these possible open
   and close-packed structures for triblock Janus particles and
   characterize the mechanical properties of these structures. Our theory
   leads to rational designs of particles for the self-assembly of
   three-dimensional colloidal structures that are possible using current
   experimental techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Even with two doses of an experimental drug in Phase III studies, with
   the commonly used approach for assessing treatment effects of individual
   doses, it may still be difficult to determine the final commercial dose.
   In such a scenario, with plasma concentration data collected in the
   studies, a modeling approach can be applied to predict treatment effects
   at different plasma concentration levels. Through an established
   relationship between plasma concentration and dose, the treatment
   effects of doses not studied in the Phase III studies can then be
   predicted. The results can further be applied to justify the final dose
   confirmation or selection. In this article, a Phase III program example
   with count data as the primary endpoint in the multiple sclerosis area
   is used to illustrate the application of such a technique for dose
   confirmation. Several models, such as the overdispersion Poisson model,
   negative binomial model, and recurrent event models, are considered. The
   negative binomial model is preferable due to better data fitting and the
   capability of within-treatment assessment and between-treatment

Abstract = {{A wide-angle x-ray scatter (WAXS) measurement could potentially be used
   to determine whether a biopsy of a breast duct is healthy or malignant.
   A ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) occurs when the epithelial cells
   lining the wall start to replicate and invade the duct interior. Since
   cells are composed mainly of water a WAXS signal of DCIS could contain a
   larger component due to water. A model approximates that a breast duct
   biopsy consists of connective tissue (c.t.) and cells. For a 2 mm
   diameter 3.81 mm thick healthy duct biopsy, the volumes in cubic mm are
   11.56 c.t. and 0.41 cells whereas 6.64 c.t. and 5.33 cells for DCIS. The
   differential linear scattering coefficients (mu(s)) for both types of
   biopsies were calculated using the sum nu c.t mu(s) c.t + nu cell where
   nu denotes fractional volume. The cell was assumed to be composed of
   water, lipids (fat), and other atoms associated with RNA, DNA, proteins,
   and carbohydrates. The pscell was calculated using the sum 0.771
   mu(water)(s) + 0.023 mu(fat)(s) 0.206(mu s)(other). The mu(s) of c.t.,
   water, and fat were available from literature whereas the independent
   atomic model approximation was used to calculate values for pother. A
   WAXS model provided predictions of the number of 6 degree scattered
   photons N-s for incident 50 kV beams on healthy and malignant ducts. The
   sum of Ns between 31.5 <= E <= 45 keV were 1402 and 1529 for
   respectively the healthy and malignant biopsies. Using Poisson
   statistics, two Gaussian distributions, and a descision threshold set at
   their intersection, the false positive and false negative probabilities
   were 4.7\% and 5.0\%. This work suggests that DCIS could potentially be
   diagnosed via energy dispersive WAXS measurements.}},

Abstract = {{The role of economic resources, distribution of providers, and
   demography may explain part of the variability found in hip arthroplasty
   in international surveys. We aimed to investigate the influence of
   ageing index, health budget, and density of orthopaedic surgeons in the
   regional variability of the primary and revision THR rate in Spain,
   where regions decide on the allocation of their health budget. Inpatient
   database of hip procedures for years 1997 to 2011 was obtained from the
   Spanish Ministry of Health, segregated for each of the 17 regional
   health services in Spain. Crude and adjusted rates (direct method with
   total Spanish population per year) were calculated and used as dependent
   variables. Ageing index, Health Expenditure of Gross Domestic Product
   (GDP), and number of orthopaedic surgeons per region were used as
   independent variables. Negative binomial regression analysis model and
   Poisson regression were calculated to estimate the risk contribution of
   the ecological variables.
   A total of 425,914 hip procedures, with 367,489 primary (mean crude rate
   = 124 x 10(5) inhabitants/year) and 58,425 revision hips (21 x 10(5)
   inhabitants/year) were included in the analysis. Regional variability
   was higher than expected in THR in Spain, despite a universal coverage
   health system in which equity may be challenged in the administration of
   hip arthroplasty. This was found particularly for primary THR. When hip
   replacement rates were adjusted for sex and age, the regional ageing
   index, the density of orthopaedic surgeons and the regional health
   budget could only partially explain risk ratio changes.}},

Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{2705-2714}},
Abstract = {{Numerical simulations based on the full Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP)
   equations are performed to investigate the reverse electrodialysis (RED)
   in negatively charged conical nanopores. The simulations consider three
   different salts (i.e., KCl, NaCl and LiCl) and examine the effects of
   the concentration gradient, surface charge density and diffusion
   coefficient on the current-voltage characteristics and energy conversion
   efficiency of the RED system. When diffusion takes place from the base
   side to the tip side, the transference number of counter-ion (t(+)) can
   be enhanced due to an addition in the EDL overlap near the tip side. It
   results in the higher energy conversion efficiency of RED than the salt
   ion diffusion from the tip side to the base side, i.e., the RED
   performance of the conical nanopore is dependent on the direction of
   salt concentration gradient. In addition, the results show that the
   conversion efficiency increases as the diffusion coefficient of the
   positive ions (D+) approaches that of the negative ions (D-). For D+ <
   D-, the diffusion current and diffusion potential in negatively charged
   conical nanopores show negative on the current-voltage characteristics
   and the conversion efficiency increases as the concentration gradient is
   increased at small surface charge density. Finally, the calculated
   maximum power conversion efficiency reaches 45\%.}},

Abstract = {{The relationship between strawberry powdery mildew and airborne conidium
   concentration (ACC) of Podosphaera aphanis was studied using data
   collected from 2006 to 2009 in 15 fields, and spatial pattern was
   described using 2 years of airborne inoculum and disease incidence data
   collected in fields planted with the June-bearing strawberry (Fragaria x
   ananassa) cultivar Jewel. Disease incidence, expressed as the proportion
   of diseased leaflets, and ACC were monitored in fields divided into 3 x
   8 grids containing 24 100 m(2) quadrats. Variance-to-mean ratio, index
   of dispersion, negative binomial distribution, Poisson distribution, and
   binomial and beta-binomial distributions were used to characterize the
   level of spatial heterogeneity. The relationship between percent leaf
   area diseased and daily ACC was linear, while the relationship between
   ACC and disease incidence followed an exponential growth curve. The V/M
   ratios were significantly greater than 1 for 100 and 96\% of the
   sampling dates for ACC sampled at 0.35 m from the ground (ACC(0.35m))
   and for ACC sampled at 1.0 m from the ground (ACC(1.0m)), respectively.
   For disease incidence, the index of dispersion D was significantly
   greater than 1 for 79\% of the sampling dates. The negative binomial
   distribution fitted 86\% of the data sets for both ACC(1.0m) and
   ACC(0.35m). For disease incidence data, the beta-binomial distribution
   provided a good fit of 75\% of the data sets. Taylor's power law
   indicated that, for ACC at both sampling heights, heterogeneity
   increased with increasing mean ACC, whereas the binary form of the power
   law suggested that heterogeneity was not dependent on the mean for
   disease incidence. When the spatial location of each sampling location
   was taken into account, Spatial Analysis by Distance Indices showed low
   aggregation indices for both ACCs and disease incidence, and weak
   association between ACC and disease incidence. Based on these analyses,
   it was found that the distribution of strawberry powdery mildew was
   weakly aggregated. Although a higher level of heterogeneity was observed
   for airborne inoculum, the heterogeneity was low with no distinct foci,
   suggesting that epidemics are induced by well-distributed inoculum. This
   low level of heterogeneity allows mean airborne inoculum concentration
   to be estimated using only one sampler per field with an overall
   accuracy of at least 0.841. The results obtained in this study could be
   used to develop a sampling scheme that will improve strawberry powdery
   mildew risk estimation.}},

Abstract = {{One of the important mechanical properties of materials is Poisson's
   ratio, which is positive for most of the materials. However, certain
   materials exhibit ``auxetic{''} properties; that is, they have a
   negative Poisson's ratio. Thus auxetic and non-auxetic materials exhibit
   different deformation mechanisms. A specific microscopic structure in
   the auxetic materials is important for maintaining a negative Poisson's
   ratio. Based on their distinct nature auxetic materials execute certain
   unique properties in contrast to other materials, which are reviewed in
   this paper. Thus auxetic materials have important applications in the
   biomedical field which are also a part of this review article. Many
   auxetic materials have been discovered, fabricated, and synthesized
   which differ on the basis of structure, scale and deformation mechanism.
   The different types of auxetic materials such as auxetic cellular
   solids, microscopic auxetic polymers, molecular auxetic materials, and
   auxetic composites have been reviewed comprehensively in this paper.
   Modeling of auxetic structures is of considerable importance and needs
   appropriate stress strain configurations; thus different aspects of
   auxetic modeling have also been reviewed. Packing parameters and
   relative densities are of prime importance in this regard. This review
   would thus help the researchers in determining and deciding the various
   aspects of auxetic nature for their products.}},

Abstract = {{We develop a fast proximal gradient scheme for reconstructing
   nonnegative signals that are sparse in a transform domain from
   underdetermined measurements. This signal model is motivated by
   tomographic applications where the signal of interest is known to be
   nonnegative because it represents a tissue or material density. We adopt
   the unconstrained regularization framework where the objective function
   to be minimized is a sum of a convex data fidelity (negative
   log-likelihood (NLL)) term and a regularization term that imposes signal
   nonnegativity and sparsity via an `1-norm constraint on the signal's
   transform coefficients. This objective function is minimized via
   Nesterov's proximal-gradient method with function restart, where the
   proximal mapping is computed via alternating direction method of
   multipliers (ADMM). To accelerate the convergence, we develop an
   adaptive continuation scheme and a step-size selection scheme that
   accounts for varying local Lipschitz constant of the NLL. In the
   numerical examples, we consider Gaussian linear and Poisson generalized
   linear measurement models. We compare the proposed penalized NLL
   minimization approach and existing signal reconstruction methods via
   compressed sensing and tomographic reconstruction experiments and
   demonstrate that, by exploiting both the nonnegativity of the underlying
   signal and sparsity of its wavelet coefficients, we can achieve
   significantly better reconstruction performance than the existing

Title = {{Analysing recurrent hospitalizations in heart failure: a review of
   statistical methodology, with application to CHARM-Preserved}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF HEART FAILURE}},

Abstract = {{Aims Heart failure is characterized by recurrent hospitalizations, but
   often only the first event is considered in clinical trial reports. In
   chronic diseases, such as heart failure, analysing all events gives a
   more complete picture of treatment benefit. We describe methods of
   analysing repeat hospitalizations, and illustrate their value in one
   major trial.
   Methods and results The Candesartan in Heart failure Assessment of
   Reduction in Mortality and morbidity (CHARM)-Preserved study compared
   candesartan with placebo in 3023 patients with heart failure and
   preserved systolic function. The heart failure hospitalization rates
   were 12.5 and 8.9 per 100 patient-years in the placebo and candesartan
   groups, respectively. The repeat hospitalizations were analysed using
   the Andersen-Gill, Poisson, and negative binomial methods. Death was
   incorporated into analyses by treating it as an additional event. The
   win ratio method and a method that jointly models hospitalizations and
   mortality were also considered. Using repeat events gave larger
   treatment benefits than time to first event analysis. The negative
   binomial method for the composite of recurrent heart failure
   hospitalizations and cardiovascular death gave a rate ratio of 0.75
   {[}95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.62-0.91, P = 0.003], whereas the
   hazard ratio for time to first heart failure hospitalization or
   cardiovascular death was 0.86 (95\% CI 0.74-1.00, P = 0.050).
   Conclusions In patients with preserved EF, candesartan reduces the rate
   of admissions for worsening heart failure, to a greater extent than
   apparent from analysing only first hospitalizations. Recurrent events
   should be routinely incorporated into the analysis of future clinical
   trials in heart failure.}},

Abstract = {{Light-assisted 3D direct-printing of biomaterials and cellular-scaffolds
   has the potential to develop novel lab-on-a-chip devices (LOCs) for a
   variety of biomedical applications, from drug discovery and diagnostic

   describes a broad family of fabrication methods that typically employ
   computer-controlled translational stages to manufacture structures at
   multi-length scales. This review focuses on light-assisted direct-write
   fabrication for generating 3D functional scaffolds with precise
   micro-and nano-architecture, using both synthetic as well as naturally
   derived biomaterials. Two bioprinting approaches are discussed in detail
   - projection printing and laser-based systems - where each method is
   capable of modulating multiple scaffold parameters, such as 3D
   architecture, mechanical properties (e. g. stiffness), Poisson's ratio,
   chemical gradients, biological cell distributions, and porosity. The
   light-assisted direct-writing techniques described in this review
   provide the reader with alternative approaches to fabricate 3D
   biomaterials for utility in LOCs.}},

   addition, we introduce a torsion spring to model the crease line of the
   TMP in order to study nonlinear wave dynamics. We derive analytical
   expression of the crease line's motions, where the folding behavior of
   the crease line provides nonlinear force-displacement responses both in
   compression and tension. These unusual characteristics lead to potential

   interest because of their unique dynamic behavior. These periodic
   structures can control wave propagation through exhibiting pass and stop
   bands over certain frequency ranges. Geometrical modifications of unit
   cells in these hexagonal honeycombs have been explored to achieve
   different properties such as a negative Poisson's ratio, which is also
   known as auxetic materials. It is found that a characteristic angle of
   the unit cell determines the value of the Poisson's ratio. In this
   study, we investigate different topologies of unit cells through the
   Timoshenko beam-based finite element method and the principles of
   Floquet-Bloch theorem. We find that the characteristic angle of the unit

Abstract = {{Internal stability of isotropic nonlinear elastic materials under
   homogeneous deformation is studied. Results provide new insight into
   various intrinsic stability measures, first proposed elsewhere, for
   generic nonlinear elastic solids. Three intrinsic stability criteria
   involving three different tangent elastic stiffness matrices are
   considered, corresponding to respective increments in strain measures
   conjugate to thermodynamic tension, first Piola-Kirchhoff stress, and
   Cauchy stress. Primary deformation paths of interest include spherical
   (i.e., isotropic) deformation, uniaxial strain, and simple shear;
   unstable modes are not constrained to remain along primary deformation
   paths. Effects of choices of second- and third-order elastic constants
   on intrinsic stability are systematically studied for physically
   realistic ranges of constants. For most cases investigated here,
   internal stability according to strain increments conjugate to Cauchy
   stress is found to be the most stringent criterion. When third-order
   constants vanish, internal stability under large compression tends to
   decrease as Poisson's ratio increases. When third-order constants are
   nonzero, a negative (positive) pressure derivative of the shear modulus
   often promotes unstable modes in compression (tension). For large shear
   deformation, larger magnitudes of third-order constants tend to result
   in more unstable behavior, regardless of the sign of the pressure
   derivative of the shear modulus. A compressible neo-Hookean model is
   generally much more intrinsically stable than second- and third-order
   elastic models when Poisson's ratio is non-negative. Published by

Abstract = {{The six independent elastic constants (C-11, C-12, C-13, C-33, C-44, and
   C-66) of single-crystal MgF2 in the rutile structure have been measured
   by Brillouin spectroscopy at room temperature from ambient conditions to
   7.4 GPa. Measurements were performed on two monocrystals with
   perpendicular faces, (001) and (100). A quasi-linear fit from finite
   strain theory was applied to the experimental data revealing the
   pressure dependence of the six elastic constants of MgF2. The shear
   modulus C-S=1/2(C-11-C-12), and the aggregate shear (Voigt-Reuss-Hill)
   modulus G show a softening with increasing pressure, indicating the
   approach of the rutile-to-CaCl2-type structural phase transition at P
   similar to 9 GPa. The adiabatic bulk modulus (Reuss average) and its
   pressure derivative have been determined: K-OS=105.1 +/- 0.3 GPa,
   (partial derivative K-OS/partial derivative P)(T)=4.14 +/- 0.05. The
   pressure-volume equation of state of MgF2 was computed self-consistently
   from the Brillouin data. Our results are in good agreement with X-ray
   diffraction data. As the phase transition is approached, MgF2 becomes
   strongly anisotropic and develops partially auxetic behavior (a negative
   Poisson's ratio in certain directions). (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

   earth-transition metal borides and carbides (RT(x)Z, R=Sc, Y, and La,
   T=Pt and Pd, Z=B and C, and x=2, 3, and 4) compounds were studied.
   Results show that RT(3)Z compounds with tetragonal P4mm structure are
   energetically more favorable than usually cubic perovskite-type
   structure. Furthermore, RT(3)Z with perovskite structure is found to be
   mechanically unstable with the negative C-44. Formation enthalpy
   calculations indicate that Pt-based borides are easier to be synthesized
   compared with Pd-based ones and counterpart carbides, respectively.
   Elastic constants, bulk moduli, shear moduli, Young's moduli, and
   Poisson's ratio of studied compounds have been calculated. Also, all the
   studied compounds show ductile behavior. Moreover, total and partial
   density of states (DOSS) and bonding charge density were employed to
   elucidate the bonding features of these compounds. The results reveal
   that the covalency between Pt-5d and Z-2p as well as T-nd (n=4 for Pd
   and 5 for Pt) and B-2p states, are the cause of the relatively higher
   elastic moduli of Pt-based compounds and R-T-borides, respectively. (C)

   Incidence in Cairns, Australia}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{Background: Dengue fever (DF) outbreaks often arise from imported DF
   cases in Cairns, Australia. Few studies have incorporated imported DF
   cases in the estimation of the relationship between weather variability
   and incidence of autochthonous DF. The study aimed to examine the impact
   of weather variability on autochthonous DF infection after accounting
   for imported DF cases and then to explore the possibility of developing
   an empirical forecast system.
   Methodology/principal finds: Data on weather variables, notified DF
   cases (including those acquired locally and overseas), and population
   size in Cairns were supplied by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology,
   Queensland Health, and Australian Bureau of Statistics. A time-series
   negative-binomial hurdle model was used to assess the effects of
   imported DF cases and weather variability on autochthonous DF incidence.
   Our results showed that monthly autochthonous DF incidences were
   significantly associated with monthly imported DF cases (Relative Risk
   (RR): 1.52; 95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.01-2.28), monthly minimum
   temperature (degrees C) (RR: 2.28; 95\% CI: 1.77-2.93), monthly relative
   humidity (\%) (RR: 1.21; 95\% CI: 1.06-1.37), monthly rainfall (mm) (RR:
   0.50; 95\% CI: 0.31-0.81) and monthly standard deviation of daily
   relative humidity (\%) (RR: 1.27; 95\% CI: 1.08-1.50). In the zero
   hurdle component, the occurrence of monthly autochthonous DF cases was
   significantly associated with monthly minimum temperature (Odds Ratio
   (OR): 1.64; 95\% CI: 1.01-2.67).
   Conclusions/significance: Our research suggested that incidences of
   monthly autochthonous DF were strongly positively associated with
   monthly imported DF cases, local minimum temperature and inter-month
   relative humidity variability in Cairns. Moreover, DF outbreak in Cairns
   was driven by imported DF cases only under favourable seasons and
   weather conditions in the study.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence and to identify sociodemographic
   and oral health factors associated with the negative impact of oral
   health conditions on the quality of life in adolescents.
   METHODS: Data from 5,445 adolescents aged 15-19, who took part in the
   Brazilian Oral Health Survey (SBBrasil 2010) were analyzed, using a
   multistage sampling design. The outcome was quality of life related to
   oral health, which was assessed using the Oral Impacts on Daily
   Performance questionnaire and analyzed as a discrete variable. The
   independent variables were sex, skin color, schooling, household income,
   age, untreated dental caries, malocclusion, gingival bleeding, dental
   calculus, and periodontal pocket. Poisson regression analysis was
   carried out and mean ratios (MR) with their respective 95\% confidence
   intervals (95\%CI) were presented.
   RESULTS: Of the total, 39.4\% reported at least one negative impact on
   their quality of life. After adjustment, the mean negative impact was
   1.52 (95\%CI 1.16;2.00) times higher in females and 1.42 (95\%CI
   1.01;1.99), 2.66 (95\%CI 1.40;5.07) and 3.32 (95\%CI 1.68;6.56) higher
   in those with brown, yellow, and indigenous skin color, respectively,
   when compared to those with white skin. The lower the level of
   schooling, the greater the negative impact (MR 2.11, 95\%CI 1.30;3.41),
   likewise for individuals with household income below R\$500.00 (MR 1.84,
   95\%CI 1.06;3.17) compared with those with higher incomes. The greatest
   impact on quality of life was found among adolescents with four or more
   teeth with untreated dental caries (MR 1.53, 95\%CI 1.12;2.10), one or
   more missing teeth (MR 1.44, 95\%CI 1.16;1.80), those with dental pain
   (RM 3.62, 95\%CI 2.93;4.46) and with severe (MR 1.52, 95\%CI 1.04;2.23)
   and very severe malocclusion (MR 1.32, 95\%CI 1.01;1.72).
   CONCLUSIONS: Brazilian adolescents reported a high negative impact of
   oral health on their quality of life. Inequalities in distribution
   should be taken into account when planning preventive, monitoring and
   treatment strategies for oral health problems in groups with the highest
   impact on their quality of life.}},

Abstract = {{Binomial mixture models (BMMs) have been increasingly applied to account
   for imperfect detection and to estimate abundance from count data, but
   their performance has not been thoroughly evaluated. Here, I conducted
   simulation experiments to examine parameter estimates in BMMs under
   various situations. I generated data by assuming that abundance followed
   a Poisson distribution with an expected value lambda and that the number
   of detected individuals followed a binomial distribution with an
   individual detection probability p. In simple simulations without
   covariates for lambda and p, when the number of sampling sites (n) was
   between 20 and 160, BMMs could recover lambda and p under the following
   conditions: 0.1 <=lambda <= 160 and p >= 0.1. However, within these
   ranges of lambda and p, the estimates were variable under lower values
   of lambda and p, although the situation improved as n increased. When
   lambda and p are expected to exceed these ranges and the sample size is
   small, the results suggest that sampling and/or modeling designs should
   be reconsidered. I then conducted simulation experiments with
   covariates. I assumed that lambda increased with a covariate (x) across
   20 sampling sites. I varied p, number of visits (v), and their
   dependency on a covariate. To compare BMMs with analyses that did not
   accommodate imperfect detection, I fitted ordinary Poisson generalized
   linear models to mean and maximum counts (GLM(mean) and GLM(max)). The
   results showed that GLM(max) was superior to GLM(mean) because GLM(mean)
   underestimated lambda when p was small. GLM(max) underestimated a
   coefficient of the covariate (slope) when v was negatively correlated
   with x. BMMs successfully recovered true values of the intercepts,
   slopes, and lambda in most cases. However, when p and v were small, and
   when p and lambda were highly negatively correlated due to their inverse
   dependency on x, estimates from BMMs were more variable.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of viscoelastic and auxetic (Negative Poisson's Ratio NPR)
   layers on the free vibration modeling of a composite sandwich structure
   is analyzed in this work. For such purpose, an analytical formulation is
   performed based on the specification of kinematic theories in terms of
   displacement fields within each layer of the structure. For instance,
   simple theories like classical laminate theory (CLT) and high order
   shear deformation theory (HSDT) are considered. This enables the
   definition of a dynamic problem for 5-layered sandwich composite using
   the principle of virtual displacement. Moreover, modal parameters in
   terms of natural frequencies and associate loss factors are given
   through the transversal displacement. For linear and isotropic layers,
   numerical applications highlight the result of the Poisson's ratio on
   the modal responses. It is particular observed that the natural
   frequency and loss factor show an increase with respect to the
   auxeticity of the viscoelastic layers while no significant variations
   related to the shear function are noticed from one theory to another.

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Reproductive failure has a negative impact on animal production, health
   and welfare and ultimately rural economies. In Ethiopia, the factors
   affecting small ruminant reproductive efficiency are inadequately
   investigated. A cross-sectional survey was done from November, 2010 to
   May, 2011 to investigate risk factors of reproductive failures including
   Toxoplasma gondii infection. Analysis of 1372 sera (787 sheep and 585
   goats) from 409 flocks using ELISA showed high flock (59.7\%) and animal
   (31.8\%) level T gondii seroprevalence. An overall 24.9\% (341/1372)
   annual abortion rate (19.6\% in sheep and 32.0\% in goats) was recorded.
   Animal level T. gondii seroprevalence was significantly associated with
   abortion in Ambo and Ada'a-Liben districts (Odds ratio {[}OR] = 2.31,
   95\% confidence interval {[}CI]: 1.42, 3.76; P = 0.001). Questionnaire
   survey on 199 households of Ambo, Ada'a-Liben and Fentale districts
   revealed high flock level abortion (57.5\%), still birth (28.9\%) and
   neonatal losses (47.9\%), which are significantly different between
   study districts (P < 0.001). Multivariable logistic regression model
   showed that species (goat), large flock size, pastoral and agro-pastoral
   production systems, drinking water from river and stagnant water bodies,
   grazing/browsing in plain land and extensive management were significant
   predictors of flock level reproductive failures. In the final Zero
   inflated Poisson regression model number of abortions was significantly
   higher in goat than in sheep flocks (Incidence risk ratio {[}IRR] =
   1.42, 95\% CI: 1.08, 1.87; P = 0.012). It is also significantly higher
   in pastoral (IRR = 1.81, 95\% CI: 1.16, 2.83; P = 0.008) and
   agro-pastoral production systems (IRR = 1.94, 95\% CI: 1.32, 2.86; P =
   0.001) than in sedentary production system. Prevention of toxoplasmosis,
   improved husbandry practices and further epidemiological studies to
   identify causes of reproductive failures are recommended. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{One key issue for standardizing catch per unit effort (CPUE) of bycatch
   species is how to model observations of zero catch per fishing
   operation. Typically, the fraction of zero catches is high, and catch
   counts may be overdispersed. In this study, we develop a model selection
   and multimodel inference approach to standardize CPUE in a case study of
   oceanic whitetip shark (Carcharhinus longimanus) bycatch in the
   Hawaii-based pelagic longline fishery. Alternative hypotheses for shark
   catch per longline set were characterized by the variance to mean ratio
   of the count distribution. Zero-inflated and non-inflated Poisson,
   negative binomial, and delta-gamma models were fit to fishery observer
   data using stepwise variable selection. Alternative hypotheses were
   compared using multimodel inference. Results from the best-fitting
   zero-inflated negative binomial model showed that standardized CPUE of
   oceanic whitetip sharks decreased by about 90\% during 1995-2010 because
   of increased zero catch sets and decreased CPUE on sets with positive
   catch. Our model selection approach provides an objective way to address
   the question of how to treat zero catches when analyzing bycatch CPUE.}},

Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF INFECTION CONTROL}},

Volume = {{41}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: ``Zero{''} central line-associated bloodstream infections
   (CLABSI) have not been reported from Asian countries, which usually have
   predominance of difficult to curtail gram negative infections. It also
   remains unclear whether lowering CLABSI rates below National Healthcare
   Safety Network (NHSN) benchmarks in such countries is even possible. In
   this study, we evaluated effects of a quality improvement initiative to
   achieve ``Zero CLABSI{''} in our intensive care unit.
   Methods: A root cause analysis in February 2010 identified problems with
   clinical practice, environment, and products. Extensive education
   sessions were followed by implementation of strategies in the form of
   ``itemized{''} bundles derived from practice guidelines, with complete
   enforcement starting August 2010. Results were benchmarked against NHSN
   data. Data were analyzed in a preintervention (1 year) and
   postintervention (2 years) fashion, using Poisson regression analysis to
   generate incidence-rate ratio (IRR).
   Results: In the preintervention period, CLABSI rate was 6.9/1,000
   catheter-days (CDs) (35 CLABSI/5,083 CDs). In the postintervention year
   1, rate was 1.06/1,000 CDs (4 CLABSI/3,787 CDs) with IRR of 0.15 (95\%
   confidence interval: 0.04-0.44, P < .001) and reduction of 85\%. In
   postintervention year 2, rate was 0.35/1,000 CDs (1/2,860 CDs) with IRR
   of 0.05 (95\% confidence interval: 0.001-0.31, P < .001). There was a
   period of ``Zero CLABSI{''} for 15 consecutive months, surpassing NHSN
   benchmarks.
   Conclusion: : CLABSIs can be eliminated in any intensive care unit
   regardless of the location and type of organism. NHSN data should be a
   realistic CLABSI benchmarking target for developing countries. Copyright

Abstract = {{Inter-tube bridging of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is a reliable way to
   improve the inter-tube stress transfer abilities. The work describes the
   interfacial interactions provided by a wall-to-wall inter-tube bridging
   between two single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) embedded in a
   polyethylene (PE) matrix. Molecular dynamics (MD) models of tube pullout
   phenomena represent by the embedding (10, 10)-(10, 10) SWCNT with
   interconnections into an amorphous PE matrix. The simulations show that
   the inter-tube bridging enhances the pullout energies significantly due
   to the three energy dissipative micro-mechanisms: stress-induced tube
   deformation with localized auxetic effect, ``cutting through{''}
   (penetration) between linker and matrix, and the accompanying tube
   pullout. Moreover, the results also predict that linkers with longer
   aliphatic chains or aromatic rings provide further increase to the
   levels of the nanotube pullout energies. These are of potential
   importance in guiding the design of CNT/polymer composites through
   inter-tube linkage. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives Most global maternal deaths occur in Africa and Asia. In
   response, the Millennium Development Goal (MDG-5) calls for a 75\%
   reduction in maternal mortality from 1990 to 2015. To assess the
   potential for progress in MDG-5 in Africa, we examined the
   cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of socioeconomic,
   demographic and population-health factors with maternal mortality rates
   in Africa.
   Methods We used data from global agencies and the published literature
   to identify socioeconomic, demographic and population-health explanatory
   factors that could be correlated with maternal mortality in 49 countries
   of Africa for the years 1990, 1995, 2000 and 2005. We used correlation,
   negative binomial and mixed Poisson regression models to investigate
   whether there exist associations between potential explanatory factors
   and maternal mortality.
   Results Some African countries have made substantial progress towards
   achieving MDG-5 while others have fallen behind. Lower gross domestic
   product (GDP) and female enrolment in primary schools, but higher HIV
   prevalence, neonatal mortality rate and total fertility rate, were
   associated with higher maternal mortality.
   Conclusions Maternal mortality rates in African countries appear to be
   declining. The mean maternal mortality ratios in Africa decreased from
   695.82 in 1990 to 562.18 in 2005. Yet some countries are more likely
   than others to achieve MDG-5. Better socioeconomic, demographic and
   population health development appear to be conducive to better maternal
   health in Africa. Sustained efforts on all these fronts will be needed
   to close the gap in maternal survival and achieve MDG-5 in Africa.}},

Title = {{Zero inflated statistical count models for analysing the costs imposed

Journal = {{ARAB JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},

Abstract = {{Background and study aims: Recent studies have shown that the high
   prevalence and the various clinical presentations of gastro-oesophageal
   reflux disease (GERD) and dyspepsia impose an enormous economic burden
   on society. Economic cost data have unique characteristics: they are
   counts, and they have zero inflation. Therefore, these data require
   special models. Poisson regression (PR), negative binomial regression
   (NB), zero inflated Poisson (ZIP) and zero inflated negative binomial
   (ZINB) regression are the models used for analysing cost data in this
   paper.
   Patients and methods: In this study, a cross-sectional household survey
   was distributed to a random sample of individuals between May 2006 and
   December 2007 in the Tehran province of Iran to determine the prevalence
   of gastrointestinal symptoms and disorders and their related factors.
   The cost associated with each item was calculated. PR, NB, ZIP and ZINB
   models were used to analyse the data. The likelihood ratio test and the
   Voung test were used to conduct pairwise comparisons of the models. The
   log likelihood, the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian
   information criterion (BIC) were used to compare the performances of the
   models.
   Results: According to the likelihood ratio test and the Voung test and
   all three criteria used to compare the performance of the models, ZINB
   regression was identified as the best model for analysing the cost data.
   Sex, age, smoking status, BMI, insurance status and education were
   significant predictors.
   Conclusion: Because the NB model demonstrated a better fit than the PR
   and ZIP models, over-dispersion was clearly only due to unobserved
   heterogeneity. In contrast, according to the likelihood ratio test, the
   ZINB model was more appropriate than the ZIP model. Conclusion: The ZINB
   model for the cost data was more appropriate than the other models. (C)

Abstract = {{Systems with a negative Poisson's ratio (auxetic) exhibit the unusual
   yet very useful property of getting wider rather than thinner when
   uniaxially stretched. A novel mechanism to generate auxetic behaviour at
   tailor-made values which may be implemented in composites manufacture
   using readily available materials is proposed. FEA simulations are used
   to provide a proof of principle for this concept and an analytical model
   is proposed so as to elucidate the requirements for auxetic behaviour.
   It is shown that the simulations and analytical model give comparable
   results and confirm that this system may reach giant negative values of
   the Poisson's ratio. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   nanotube networks under tension}},
Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{80}},
Pages = {{15-26}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Carbon-based nanomaterials have attracted significant attention due to
   their unique physical properties. In this study, various
   multi-dimensional graphitic architectures are constructed by spanning
   fullerenes with carbon nanotube (CNT) super-bonds. The mechanical
   properties of these novel architectures are systematically investigated
   by full atomistic simulations. The stress and strain of 1D nano-bamboo
   structures upon the onset of instability are almost constant, about 1/5
   and 1/2, respectively, of those of a perfect CNT. The deformation and
   fracture behavior of 2D and 3D periodic graphitic nanostructures are
   largely dictated by the inter-fullerene distance and loading
   orientation. Surprising negative Poisson's ratio observed in 2D and 3D
   networks is revealed to originate as a result of curvature-flattening or
   rigid mechanical model. The magnitude of Poisson's ratio is strongly
   dependent on the level of strain, CNT length as well as temperature. The
   insight on the deformation mechanism of these periodic graphitic
   nanostructures will facilitate the integration of low-dimensional
   materials towards high-dimensional organized structures to realize
   targeted multi-functional properties. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{The Poisson's ratio describes an extent of transverse deformation of a
   material when an axial strain is applied. A change of the Poisson's
   ratio from positive to negative can equip a material with a set of
   specific properties. In this paper, a study of a composite material with
   a tunable Poisson's ratio is presented. Samples of such a composite were
   first fabricated with two different polymers based on a composite
   structure proposed in our previous work using a multi-material
   additive-manufacturing system. Using both experimental and numerical
   methods, deformation mechanisms and mechanical properties of this
   composite material were analyzed. The obtained results demonstrate that
   its Poisson's ratio can be reduced by increasing the difference in
   stiffness of constituent materials and turned from positive to negative
   when this difference is sufficiently high. Additionally, the study also
   validates a possible method to fabricate composites with designed
   structures and multi-constituent materials using additive-manufacturing
   techniques.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the daily risk of central
   line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) increases over the
   dwell time of peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) in
   high-risk neonates.
   METHODS: Multicenter retrospective cohort including NICU patients with a
   PICC inserted between January 2005 and June 2010. We calculated
   incidence rates and used Poisson regression models to assess the risk of
   developing CLABSI as a function of PICC dwell time.
   RESULTS: A total of 4797 PICCs placed in 3967 neonates were included;
   149 CLABSIs occurred over 89 946 catheter-days (incidence rate 1.66 per
   1000 catheter-days). In unadjusted analysis, PICCs with a dwell time of
   8 to 13 days, 14 to 22 days, and >= 23 days each had an increased risk
   of infection compared with PICCs in place for <= 7 days (P < .05). In
   adjusted analysis, the average predicted daily risk of CLABSIs after
   PICC insertion increased during the first 2 weeks after PICC insertion
   and remained elevated for the dwell time of the catheter. There was an
   increased risk of CLABSIs in neonates with concurrent PICCs (adjusted
   incidence rate ratio 2.04, 1.12-3.71). The incidence of Gram-negative
   CLABSIs was greater in PICCs with dwell times >50 days (incidence rate
   ratio 5.26, 2.40-10.66).
   CONCLUSIONS: The risk of CLABSIs increased during the 2 weeks after PICC
   insertion and then remained elevated until PICC removal. Clinicians
   should review PICC necessity daily, optimize catheter maintenance
   practices, and investigate novel CLABSI prevention strategies in PICCs
   with prolonged dwell times.}},

Abstract = {{Metamaterials are rationally designed man-made structures composed of
   functional building blocks that are densely packed into an effective
   (crystalline) material. While metamaterials are mostly associated with
   negative refractive indices and invisibility cloaking in
   electromagnetism or optics, the deceptively simple metamaterial concept
   also applies to rather different areas such as thermodynamics, classical
   mechanics (including elastostatics, acoustics, fluid dynamics and
   elastodynamics), and, in principle, also to quantum mechanics. We review
   the basic concepts, analogies and differences to electromagnetism, and
   give an overview on the current state of the art regarding theory and
   experiment-all from the viewpoint of an experimentalist. This review
   includes homogeneous metamaterials as well as intentionally
   inhomogeneous metamaterial architectures designed by
   coordinate-transformation-based approaches analogous to transformation
   optics. Examples are laminates, transient thermal cloaks, thermal
   concentrators and inverters, `space-coiling' metamaterials, anisotropic
   acoustic metamaterials, acoustic free-space and carpet cloaks, cloaks
   for gravitational surface waves, auxetic mechanical metamaterials,
   pentamode metamaterials ('meta-liquids'), mechanical metamaterials with

Title = {{Psychiatric treatment following participation in the CapOpus randomized
   trial for patients with comorbid cannabis use disorder and psychosis}},

Abstract = {{Background: Randomized trials targeting cannabis use disorders in
   patients with psychosis have generally been unsuccessful. One of the
   largest such trials was the CapOpus trial, which had an impact on the
   number of monthly joints used, but not on the number of days with
   cannabis use or positive or negative symptoms.
   Objective: To investigate the effects of CapOpus on psychiatric
   treatment.
   Methods: Six-month randomized trial on participants meeting ICD-10
   criteria for cannabis use disorder and schizophrenia-spectrum psychosis.
   Participants were randomized to treatment as usual (TAU, n = 51) alone
   versus TAU plus CapOpus (n = 52) consisting of motivational interviewing
   and cognitive behavior therapy. Data regarding psychiatric treatment was
   obtained from complete nationwide registers. Analyses were
   intention-to-treat. Cox and poisson regression were used as appropriate.
   Results: Compared with treatment as usual, participants in the CapOpus
   group had an overall higher risk of having a psychiatric emergency room
   contact (hazard ratio 2.02, 95\% confidence interval 1.22-3.34).
   Participants in CapOpus also had more contacts with psychiatric
   emergency rooms (incidence rate ratio 3.47 (2.64-4.57)) and more
   admissions to psychiatric hospitals (incidence rate ratio 2.24
   (1.65-3.03)); conversely, CapOpus-participants spent fewer days admitted
   to psychiatric hospitals than treatment-as-usual participants (incidence
   rate ratio 0.72 (0.68-0.75)).
   Conclusions: CapOpus led to earlier and more psychiatric emergency room
   contacts and admissions that, however, were of fewer days. This pattern
   could indicate that participants receiving treatment as usual were
   inadequately treated. However, it cannot be excluded that the
   differences might be an adverse reaction to the psychosocial
   intervention. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The tensile behaviour of standard and auxetic polyurethane foams are
   contrasted by digital volume correlation of 3D images collected by in
   situ X-ray computed tomography (CT). It was found that subset sizes of
   32 and 64 voxels for the auxetic and standard foams were optimal for
   strain resolutions in the order of 0.1\%. For the standard foam, good
   uniformity of strain was observed at low strains giving a tangent
   Poisson's ratio of 0.5. Some heterogeneity of strain was observed at
   higher strains, which may be related to the fixtures. The behaviour of
   the auxetic foam was totally different, with strain being spatially
   heterogeneous with transverse strains both positive and negative but
   giving a negative Poisson's ratio on average. This suggests that the
   unfolding tendency of some groups of cells was higher than others
   because of the complex frozen starting microstructure. Further different
   methods of deriving Poisson's ratio gave different results. Besides
   revealing interesting microstuctural mechanisms of transverse straining,
   the study also shows digital volume correlation of tomography sequences
   to be the perfect tool to study complex mechanical behaviour of cellular
   materials.}},

Title = {{Linear and Non-linear Creep models for a multi-layered concrete
   composite}},
Journal = {{ARCHIVES OF CIVIL AND MECHANICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{472-490}},

Abstract = {{One- and two-dimensional linear and nonlinear creep models for
   predicting the time-dependent behavior of a concrete composite under
   compression are proposed. These models use the analytical and iterative
   solutions of the Volterra integral equation. The analytical approach is
   based on the age-adjusted effective modulus method, and the nonlinear
   technique applies an iterative approach to the system of non-linear
   equations, implying a generalization of the principle of superposition.
   Both models are validated in this study.
   It has been recently found that negative Values of the aging coefficient
   can emerge in early age multi-layered composites when the stress
   redistribution between the layers is governed by the combination of
   considerably different creep strains and aging of the layers.
   In the plane-strain state, the two-dimensional creep analysis of
   multi-layered composites yields the same vertical stress-time history as
   that in a one-dimensional case if the Poisson ratios of the layers are
   equal. This is valid even though the average value of the vertical
   stress used to calculate the Volterra integral term is dependent on the
   Poisson ratio of the layers. In particular, the evolution of vertical
   stress with time is dependent only on the vertical strain and
   compatibility conditions in a direction parallel to the lamination.
   A fracture mechanics approach is also introduced to predict the gradual
   degradation of long-term strength for a multi-layered composite under a
   sustained compressive load. The results show that the stress
   redistribution near the crack-tip under the final period of a high level
   of sustained loading may lead to an additional required compressive
   stress for complete failure of the composite. Long-term failure
   primarily begins with the less deformable (stiffer) layers because the
   more-deformable layers can relieve the initial stresses. Thus, the
   long-term strength of the composite can exceed its instantaneous
   strength for early age composites or for composites composed of layers
   that possess considerably different creep and aging properties. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Cellular materials are known to have two properties; structures and
   mechanisms. Therefore, one may design structures with cellular materials
   while controlling stiffness and flexibility depending on the struts'
   connectivity. The objectives of this study are to investigate in-plane
   flexible properties of bending dominated cellular materials under
   macroscopic deformation and to secure a method to design a passive
   morphing airfoil with flexible cellular cores. The airfoil with three
   cellular cores (chiral, regular and re-entrant hexagonal honeycombs) is
   investigated under a static load through the deformation gradient of the
   cellular cores under an aerostatic load. The structural performance of
   the airfoil with the designed compliant cellular cores is validated
   through the fluid structure interaction through which a structural
   finite element analysis is combined with fluid statics. Considering the
   deformation of the airfoil with flexible cellular cores under an
   aerostatic load, shear is the dominant deformation mode of the cores of
   the airfoil. The re-entrant hexagonal honeycomb core shows the highest
   flexibility in shear and causes a lower stress in local cell walls in
   shear than the other cellular cores when the cellular mesostructures are
   designed to have the same shear modulus. This implies that the
   re-entrant hexagonal honeycomb core has the potential to be used as a
   structure with a passive morphing airfoil. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Compared with triangular, square and Kagome honeycombs, hexagonal
   honeycomb has superior heat dissipation capabilities, but its lower
   in-plane stiffness hinders its multifunctional applications. Regarding
   this problem, in this paper we propose a multifunctional hierarchical
   honeycomb (MHH) with negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) sub-structures. This
   MHH is constructed by replacing the solid cell walls of the original
   regular hexagonal honeycomb (ORHH) with two kinds of equal mass NPR
   honeycombs, the anisotropic re-entrant honeycomb or the isotropic chiral
   honeycomb. Based on the Euler beam theory, formulas for the Young's
   moduli of these two kinds of MHH structures are derived. Results show
   that by appropriately adjusting the geometrical parameters both the
   re-entrant honeycomb (when the cell-wall thickness-to-length ratio of
   the ORHH is less than 0.045) and the chiral honeycomb (when the
   cell-wall thickness-to-length ratio of the ORHH is less than 0.75) can
   greatly tune the in-plane stiffness of the MHH structure. The presented
   theory could thus be used in designing new tailorable hierarchical
   honeycomb structures for multifunctional applications. (C) 2013 The

Abstract = {{The high-order fluid model developed in part I of this series is
   employed here to study the propagation of negative planar streamer
   fronts in pure nitrogen. The model consists of the balance equations for
   electron density, average electron velocity, average electron energy and
   average electron energy flux. These balance equations have been obtained
   as velocity moments of Boltzmann's equation and are here coupled to the
   Poisson equation for the space charge electric field. Here the results
   of simulations with the high-order model, with a particle-in-cell/Monte
   Carlo (PIC/MC) model and with the first-order fluid model based on the
   hydrodynamic drift-diffusion approximation are presented and compared.
   The comparison with the MC model clearly validates our high-order fluid
   model, thus supporting its correct theoretical derivation and numerical
   implementation. The results of the first-order fluid model with local
   field approximation, as usually used for streamer discharges, show
   considerable deviations. Furthermore, we study the inaccuracies of
   simulation results caused by an inconsistent implementation of transport
   data into our high-order fluid model. We also demonstrate the importance
   of the energy flux term in the high-order model by comparing with
   results where this term is neglected. Finally, results with an
   approximation for the high-order tensor in the energy flux equation is
   found to agree well with the PIC/MC results for reduced electric fields
   up to 1000 Townsend, as considered in this work.}},

Abstract = {{We have employed parameter-free density functional theory calculations
   to study the thermodynamic stability and structural parameters as well
   as elastic and electronic properties of Ni4N in eight selected
   crystallographic phases. In agreement with the experimental findings,
   the cubic structure with Pearson symbol cP5, space group Pm (3) over
   barm (221) is found to be the most stable and it is also the only
   thermodynamically stable structure at T = 0 K with respect to
   decomposition to the elemental Ni crystal and N-2 gas phase. We
   determine structural parameters, bulk moduli, and their pressure
   derivatives for all eight allotropes. The thermodynamic stability and
   bulk modulus is shown to be anticorrelated. Comparing ferromagnetic and
   nonmagnetic states, we find common features between the magnetism of
   elemental Ni and studied ferromagnetic Ni4N structures. For the
   ground-state Ni4N structure and other two Ni4N cubic allotropes, we

Abstract = {{This article investigates the effect of auxeticity on the thermal
   stresses of isotropic plates. The thermal stress is non-dimensionalized
   against the coefficient of thermal expansion, the change in temperature
   and at least one of the moduli so as to express the dimensionless
   thermal stresses solely in terms of Poisson's ratio of the plate
   material. Results show that increasing auxeticity leads to mild and
   significant drop in the thermal stresses under the conditions of
   constant Young's modulus and constant shear modulus, respectively.
   However, increasing auxeticity causes increase in the thermal stress
   under the condition of constant bulk modulus. It is also shown that
   increasing auxeticity under the condition of constant product of all the
   three moduli reduces the thermal stress if Poisson's ratio falls within
   a wide range of -1 and 0.303. These results suggest that, under most
   circumstances, the replacement of conventional plate materials with
   auxetic solids is useful for reducing thermal stresses therein. The use
   of auxetic materials, therefore, provides an additional choice for the
   reduction of thermal stresses in plates other than selecting materials
   of lower modulus and low coefficient of thermal expansion.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To examine the impact of the Health Canada regulatory
   warnings regarding antidepressant (AD) prescribing on suicide rates in
   boys and girls under the age of 18 and aged 18 to 19 years in Canada
   between 2004 and 2009. We hypothesized that an increase in suicide rates
   would be specific to girls, reflecting higher AD prescribing rates in
   girls than boys.
   Method: We graphed and tested the difference between Canada-wide suicide
   rates before and after the regulatory warning periods (either from 1995
   to 2006 or from 1995 to 2009) in boys and girls under the age of 18 or
   aged 18 to 19 years. For comparison with prior studies, we estimated
   rate ratios and 95\% confidence intervals using either Poisson
   regression or negative binomial regression.
   Results: There was no statistically significant increase in suicide
   rates in girls under the age of 18, or aged 18 to 19 years in response
   to the AD regulatory warnings. In boys under the age of 18 or aged 18 to
   19 years, suicide rates declined after 2003.
   Conclusions: We did not find increased rates of suicide after the AD
   regulatory warnings in boys or girls under the age of 18 or aged 18 to
   19 years in Canada-wide rates. However, this does not rule out the
   possibility that such an effect occurred in some jurisdictions in girls
   and (or) the regulatory warnings prevented the trend toward declining
   suicide rates. Factors influencing the downward trend in boys merit
   further attention.}},

Abstract = {{Breakfast skipping is a potentially modifiable behavior that has
   negative effects on health and is socioeconomically patterned. This
   study aimed to examine the intrapersonal (health, behavioral, and
   cognitive) and social factors associated with breakfast skipping.
   Nonpregnant women (n = 4123) aged 18-45 y from socioeconomically
   disadvantaged neighborhoods throughout Victoria, Australia, completed a
   postal questionnaire. Sociodemographic characteristics, diet, physical
   activity, sedentary behaviors, and cognitive and social factors were
   assessed by self-report. Breakfast skipping was defined in 2 ways: 1)
   ``rarely/never{''} eating breakfast (n = 498) and 2) eating breakfast <=
   2 d/wk (includes those who rarely/never ate breakfast; n = 865). Poisson
   regression was used to calculate prevalence ratios and linear trends,
   adjusting for covariates. The P values for linear trends are reported
   below. Compared with breakfast consumers, women who reported
   rarely/never eating breakfast tended to have poorer self-rated health
   (P-trend < 0.001), be current smokers (P-trend < 0.001), pay less
   attention to health (P-trend < 0.001), not prioritize their own healthy
   eating when busy looking after their family (P-trend < 0.001), have less
   nutrition knowledge (P-trend < 0.001), and a lower proportion were
   trying to control their weight (P-trend < 0.020). When breakfast
   skipping was defined as eating breakfast d/wk, additional associations
   were found for having lower leisure-time physical activity (P-trend =
   0.012) and less self-efficacy for eating a healthy diet (P-trend <
   0.043). In conclusion, a range of intrapersonal and social factors were
   significantly associated with breakfast skipping among women living in
   socioeconomically disadvantaged areas. Acknowledging the cross-sectional
   design and need for causal confirmation, programs that aim to promote
   breakfast consumption in this population group should consider targeting
   family-related barriers to healthy eating and nutrition knowledge.}},

Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The possibility of designing metamaterials with ad hoc designed
   elasticity tensors or counter-intuitive mechanical properties, such as a
   negative Poisson ratio (auxetics), a negative effective bulk modulus or
   even a negative effective density, has led to the concept of `mechanical
   metamaterials'. Due to their special structures, their mechanical
   properties can be designed to have values that cannot be found in nature
   which are and adapted for specific applications. A very recent and
   interesting set of mechanical metamaterials are pentamodes, materials in
   which five out of six components of the diagonalized elasticity tensor
   tend to zero, hence somehow imitating the behavior of liquids but being
   solid.
   Most studies on pentamodal metamaterials and their applications have
   been linked to the structure proposed by Milton and Cherkaev in their
   pioneering work. Here we present the development of a computer-aided
   design library of potential pentamodal metamaterials, inspired by
   Bravais lattices, together with a comparative study of their mechanical
   properties and the eventual verification of pentamodal behavior as a
   result of simulations based on finite-element methods. We hope this may
   provide useful information for future designs of devices based on these
   interesting structures.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{82}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1135-1145}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{1.If animals moved randomly in space, the use of different habitats
   would be proportional to their availability. Hence, deviations from
   proportionality between use and availability are considered the
   tell-tale sign of preference. This principle forms the basis for most
   habitat selection and species distribution models fitted to
   use-availability or count data (e.g. MaxEnt and Resource Selection
   Functions). Yet, once an essential habitat type is sufficiently abundant
   to meet an individual's needs, increased availability of this habitat
   type may lead to a decrease in the use/availability ratio. Accordingly,
   habitat selection functions may estimate negative coefficients when
   habitats are superabundant, incorrectly suggesting an apparent
   avoidance. Furthermore, not accounting for the effects of availability
   on habitat use may lead to poor predictions, particularly when applied
   to habitats that differ considerably from those for which data have been
   collected. Using simulations, we show that habitat use varies
   non-linearly with habitat availability, even when individuals follow
   simple movement rules to acquire food and avoid risk. The results show
   that the impact of availability strongly depends on the type of habitat
   (e.g. whether it is essential or substitutable) and how it interacts
   with the distribution and availability of other habitats. We demonstrate
   the utility of a variety of existing and new methods that enable the
   influence of habitat availability to be explicitly estimated. Models
   that allow for non-linear effects (using b-spline smoothers) and
   interactions between environmental covariates defining habitats and
   measures of their availability were best able to capture simulated
   patterns of habitat use across a range of environments. An appealing
   aspect of some of the methods we discuss is that the relative influence
   of availability is not defined a priori, but directly estimated by the
   model. This feature is likely to improve model prediction, hint at the
   mechanism of habitat selection, and may signpost habitats that are
   critical for the organism's fitness.}},

   high-speed video camera, were conducted to measure the energy
   dissipation, G-value, and the Poisson's ratio. Scanning electron
   microscopy was used to investigate the cellular morphology before and
   after the felting and volumetric heat and compression. The study showed
   that both felted foam and triaxial compressed foam demonstrated
   reasonably well the cushion performance due to the presence of auxetic
   and microcell structures.}},

Abstract = {{Inter-tube cross-linking of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is an effective
   approach to improve the inter-tube stress and current transfer

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to design isotropic periodic microstructures
   of cellular materials using the bidirectional evolutionary structural
   optimization (BESO) technique. The goal was to determine the optimal
   distribution of material phase within the periodic base cell. Maximizing
   bulk modulus or shear modulus was selected as the objective of the
   material design subject to an isotropy constraint and a volume
   constraint. The effective properties of the material were found using
   the homogenization method based on finite element analyses of the base
   cell. The proposed BESO procedure utilizes the gradient-based
   sensitivity method to impose the isotropy constraint and gradually
   evolve the microstructures of cellular materials to an optimum.
   Numerical examples show the computational efficiency of the approach. A
   series of new and interesting microstructures of isotropic cellular
   materials that maximize the bulk or shear modulus have been found and
   presented. The methodology can be extended to incorporate other material
   properties of interest such as designing isotropic cellular materials
   with negative Poisson's ratio.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE. Describe the epidemiology of central line-associated
   bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) in neonatal intensive care units
   (NICUs) participating in a standardized and mandatory CLABSI
   surveillance program.
   DESIGN. Retrospective cohort.
   SETTING. We included patients admitted (April 2007-March 2011) to 7
   level II/III NICUs who developed a CLABSI (as defined by the National
   Healthcare Safety Network).
   METHODS. CLABSIs/1,000 central line-days and device utilization ratio
   were calculated; chi(2) test, Student t test, Kruskal-Wallis, and
   Poisson regression were used.
   RESULTS. Overall, 191 patients had 202 CLABSI episodes for a pooled mean
   rate of 4.0 CLABSIs/1,000 central line-days and a device utilization
   ratio of 0.20. Annual pooled mean CLABSI rates increased from 3.6 in
   2007-2008 to 5.1 CLABSIs/1,000 central line-days in 2010-2011 (P = .01).
   The all-cause 30-day case fatality proportion was 8.9\% (n = 17) and
   occurred a median of 8 days after CLABSI. Coagulase-negative
   Staphylococcus was identified in 112 (50.5\%) cases. Staphylococcus
   aureus was identified in 22 cases, and 3 (13.6\%) were resistant to
   methicillin. An underlying intra-abdominal pathology was found in 20\%
   (40/202) of CLABSI cases, 50\% of which were reported in the last year
   of study. When adjusted for mean birth weight, annual CLABSI incidence
   rates were independently associated with the proportion of
   intra-abdominal pathology (P = .007) and the proportion of pulmonary
   pathology (P = .016) reported.
   CONCLUSION. The increase in CLABSI rates in Quebec NICUs seems to be
   associated with an increased proportion of cases with underlying
   intra-abdominal and pulmonary pathologies, which needs further
   investigation.}},

Abstract = {{The continuous extension of a discrete random variable is amongst the
   computational methods used for estimation of multivariate normal
   copula-based models with discrete margins. Its advantage is that the
   likelihood can be derived conveniently under the theory for copula
   models with continuous margins, but there has not been a clear analysis
   of the adequacy of this method. We investigate the asymptotic and
   small-sample efficiency of two variants of the method for estimating the
   multivariate normal copula with univariate binary, Poisson, and negative
   binomial regressions, and show that they lead to biased estimates for
   the latent correlations, and the univariate marginal parameters that are
   not regression coefficients. We implement a maximum simulated likelihood
   method, which is based on evaluating the multidimensional integrals of
   the likelihood with randomized quasi-Monte Carlo methods. Asymptotic and
   small-sample efficiency calculations show that our method is nearly as
   efficient as maximum likelihood for fully specified multivariate normal
   copula-based models. An illustrative example is given to show the use of
   our simulated likelihood method. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{We investigated character and distribution of the gas hydrate zone in
   the western part of the Ulleung Basin in the East Sea (Japan Sea) from
   seismic data using stochastic sparse spike deconvolution, analysis of
   frequencies, and acoustic-elastic coupled full-waveform inversion. The
   presence of gas hydrates is primarily indicated by a bottom-simulating
   reflector (BSR) with negative polarity at approximately 240-250 ms below
   the seafloor. The instantaneous frequency section defines a
   high-frequency anomaly above the BSR underlain by a less clear
   low-frequency anomaly. Sparse spike deconvolution indicates that the BSR
   occurs horizontally along the boundary between the high- and
   low-frequency anomalies. Compared to well logs obtained from the
   seafloor through the BSR, the high-frequency anomaly, maximally 50 ms
   thick (ca. 45 m), appears to outline the hydrate-bearing zone. The
   results from full-waveform inversion appear to delineate the
   hydrate-bearing zone and the underlying gas-bearing zone, although their
   depth ranges do not coincide accurately with those inferred from well
   logs. The hydrate-bearing zone is characterized by an increase in both
   p- and s-wave velocities, while the gas-bearing zone is marked by a
   decrease in p-wave velocity. The very narrow free gas zone is less than
   30 m thick and appears to be concentrated immediately below the gas
   hydrate stability zone. The hydrate-bearing zone is also defined by
   decreased Poisson's ratio which suggests appreciable variations of the
   hydrate-bearing zone in thickness. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Effectiveness of sampling plans by attributes based on mixture
   distributions characterising microbial clustering in food}},
Journal = {{FOOD CONTROL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{50-60}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{As in many cases, pathogenic microorganisms contaminate the food
   material as clusters or group of individual cells; the effectiveness of
   sampling plans based on mixture distributions representing bacterial
   agglomeration was assessed. In general, sampling plans that do not take
   into account such consideration lead to higher probabilities of
   accepting defective lots. Since quite often no scientific data are
   available in order to determine the degree of over-dispersion or
   clustering of the target microorganisms, in this theoretical study we
   compare the variance-to-mean ratio and the reciprocal of the exponent k
   of the negative binomial distribution (NB) as measures of dispersion.
   The mixture Poisson-logarithmic (Plog) model is proposed as a special
   case of the NB distribution, where the bacterial clusters are Poisson
   distributed while the individuals in each cluster follow a logarithmic
   distribution. In order to describe microbial data characterised by an
   excess of zero counts (1-pi, we assess the zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP)
   and zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) distributions as alternative
   statistical models. The Operating Characteristic (OC) curves generated
   on the basis of the zero-inflated distributions were compared for fixed
   values of the variance-to-mean ratio and the parameter it at any mean
   level of contamination and sample weight adopted. The results show that
   assuming fixed 1/k and it for the NB and ZIP distributions,
   respectively, both models converge to a Poisson distribution at the
   producer's quality level. In contrast, the consumer's quality level is
   highly affected by assuming fixed values of 1/k and pi since it
   increases. The OC curves generated for the NB and ZIP distributions
   assuming fixed values of the variance-to-mean ratio at any mean level of
   contamination and sample weight adopted, reveal that both the consumer's
   and producer's quality level are affected, as they both increase. Within
   the ZINB distribution, a separate investigation is conducted to
   determine which parameters are mostly responsible for describing
   microbial over-dispersion. As a general conclusion, for the design of
   sampling plans based on any statistical distribution, OC curves that
   reflect microbial agglomeration should be constructed considering that
   variance is not constant but dependant on the level of microbial
   concentration of the lot. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The risk of HIV associated with hormonal contraceptives is
   controversial. We assessed hormonal contraceptive use and HIV incidence
   in HIV-discordant couples in Rakai, Uganda.
   Methods: HIV-discordant couples were retrospectively identified from a
   cohort between 1999 and 2009. Hormonal contraception included oral
   contraception, depomedroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA), and implants
   (Norplant). Poisson regression estimated adjusted incidence rate ratios
   (adjIRRs) associated with hormonal contraceptive methods. A case-control
   subanalysis estimated odds ratios (ORs) of HIV associated with hormonal
   contraceptive, adjusted for viral load and age.
   Results: We identified 190 male HIV-positive/ female HIV-negative (M+F-)
   and 159 male HIV-negative/female HIV-positive (M-F+) couples not using
   antiretroviral therapy or condoms. Female HIV incidence was 5.8/100
   person-years (py) among nonhormonal contraceptive users, 12.0/100 py
   among oral contraceptive users {[}adjIRR 2.65, 95\% confidence interval
   (CI) 0.82-8.60], 4.5 among Norplant users (adjIRR: 0.89, 95\% CI
   0.11-7.10), and 7.5/100 py among DMPA users (adjIRR 1.42, 95\% CI
   0.60-3.36). Male HIV incidence was 7.4/100 py during nonhormonal
   contraceptive use, 16.5/100 py during female oral contraceptive use
   (adjIRR 2.52, 95\% CI 0.49-12.95), and 4.9/100 py with DMPA use (adjIRR
   0.57, 95\% CI 0.19-1.70). The number of female seroconverters was three
   among oral contraceptive users, one among Norplant users, and seven
   among DMPA users. Male seroconverters were two during female oral
   contraceptive use, none with Norplant use, and three with DMPA use. In a
   nested case-control analysis after adjustment for HIV viral load, the
   adjOR associated with oral contraceptive use was 1.59 (95\% CI
   0.32-97.85) for M+F- and 2.11 (95\% CI 0.18-25.26) for M-F+ couples. For
   DMPA use, the adjOR was 1.44 (95\% CI 0.46-4.51) for M+F- and 1.40 (95\%
   CI 0.30-6.49) for M-F+ couples.
   Conclusion: We did not observe significant risk of HIV acquisition or
   transmission with oral contraceptives or DMPA use in HIV discordant
   couples, but several point estimates were above 1.0 and statistical
   power was limited. (C) 2013 Wolters Kluwer Health vertical bar

Abstract = {{Background: We studied the association between HIV infection,
   antiretroviral medications, and the risk of spontaneous intracranial
   hemorrhage. Methods: We performed a cohort and nested case control study
   in an administrative database. We selected all HIV-positive individuals
   presenting between 1985 and 2007. Each HIV-positive subject was matched
   with 4 HIV-negative individuals. We used a Poisson regression model to
   calculate rates of intracranial hemorrhage according to HIV status. We
   conducted a case -control study nested within the cohort of HIV-positive
   individuals to look at the effect of antiretroviral medications. Odds
   ratios for antiretroviral exposure were obtained using conditional
   logistic regression. Results: There were 7,053 HIV-positive and 27,681
   HIV-negative subjects, representing 138,704 person-years. There were 49
   incident intracranial hemorrhages, 29 in HIV-positive and 20 in
   HIV-negative individuals. The adjusted hazard ratio for intracranial
   hemorrhage in HIV-positive compared to HIV-negative patients was 3.28
   (95\% confidence interval {[}CI] 1.75-6.12). The effect was reduced to
   1.99 (95\% CI 0.92-4.31) in the absence of AIDS-defining conditions, and
   increased to 7.64 (95\% CI 3.78-15.43) in subjects with AIDS-defining
   conditions. Hepatitis C infection, illicit drug or alcohol abuse,
   intracranial lesions, and coagulopathy were all strongly associated with
   intracranial hemorrhage (all P < .001). In the case control study, 29
   cases of ICH in HIV-positive individuals were matched to 228
   HIV-positive controls. None of the antiretroviral classes were
   associated with an increase in the odds ratio of intracranial
   hemorrhage. Conclusions: The risk of intracranial hemorrhage in
   HIV-positive individuals seems to be mostly associated with
   AIDS-defining conditions, other comorbidities, or lifestyle factors. No
   association was found between use of antiretroviral medications and
   intracranial hemorrhage.}},

Abstract = {{The Poisson's ratios of re-entrant Cu foams with different initial

   small unidirectional compression. The transformation into the re-entrant
   foam was accomplished by applying a sequence of permanent triaxial
   compression deformations. The Poisson's ratio first decreases and then
   increases with increasing compression strain. A minimum in Poisson's
   ratio of approximately -0.7 for all initial densities was achieved with
   an appropriate permanent compression strain, compared with -0.6 at
   similar density determined earlier via optical methods. Foams with
   higher values of initial density attained minima in Poisson's ratio at
   lower permanent volumetric compression. The shear modulus increased with
   increasing volumetric compression ratio, and showed a small hump near
   the point corresponding to Poisson's ratio minimum.}},

Abstract = {{Centro-symmetric cellular honeycombs, in particular, their re-entrant
   version have been the subject of much research in recent years in view
   of their highly desirable macroscopic properties, including negative
   Poisson's ratio (auxetic) behavior. This work re-examines the mechanical
   properties of such honeycombs at the transition between the re-entrant
   and non re-entrant form, i.e. when the joints form a T-shaped junction,
   including the more general cases when the vertical ligaments have
   different thickness and material properties from the horizontal
   ligaments. It was shown through FE simulations that, contrary to current
   understanding, such honeycombs may deform in a manner which results in
   bending of the horizontal ligaments upon loading in the horizontal
   direction, with the result that such honeycombs may exhibit non-zero
   Poisson's ratio values. This effect was explained in terms of uneven
   stretching of the horizontal ribs upon uniaxial horizontal loading, a
   property which may also be employed to design honeycombs with negative
   Poisson's ratios.}},

Abstract = {{Chiral systems are a class of structures, which may exhibit the
   anomalous property of a negative Poisson's ratio. Proposed by
   Wojciechowski and implemented later by Lakes, these structures have
   aroused interest due to their remarkable mechanical properties and
   numerous potential applications. In view of this, this paper
   investigates the on-axis mechanical properties of the general forms of
   the flexing anti-tetrachiral system through analytical and finite
   element models. The results suggest that these are highly dependent on
   the geometry (the ratio of ligament lengths, thicknesses, and radius of
   nodes) and material properties of the constituent materials. We also
   show that the rigidity of an anti-tetrachiral system can be changed
   without altering the Poisson's ratio.}},

   be negative and decreases with increase of temperature and size
   polydispersity in the {[}110]{[}1 (1) over bar0] direction. Hence, the
   system is partially auxetic. Additionally, the obtained results indicate

Abstract = {{Auxetics exhibit the unusual property of a negative Poisson's ratio,
   meaning they get wider rather than thinner when stretched. This work
   employs force-field based simulations to study the effect of solvent
   molecules on the structure and mechanical properties of porous
   polyphenylacetylene auxetic organic networked polymers. In particular,
   nano-level re-entrant honeycombs 1,4- and 2,8-reflexyne were exposed to
   three types of solvent molecules (ethanol, propanol and benzene) at
   different concentrations by performing Monte-Carlo based sorption
   simulations in two scenarios, one where the solvent was permitted into
   the pores of the system upon exposure, and one were the solvent could
   also enter in between the layers of the polymer. Results indicate that
   the presence of solvent molecules within the molecular framework of the
   networked polymers has a significant effect on their density and
   stiffness but does not influence the Poisson's ratio of the material.
   The effect on the stiffness was found to be highly dependent on various
   factors, including the properties of the network and the type and amount
   of solvent adsorbed. These results have important implications in future
   case scenarios which may involve the synthesis of such systems, and it
   throws light on how the mechanical properties could be affected due to
   contamination, while also identifying new methods on how to tailor such
   properties by exposing the material to specific solvents.}},

Abstract = {{Burr is an important character of the surface quality for machined
   parts, and it is even more severe in micro cutting. Due to the uncut
   chip thickness and the cutting edge radius at the same range in micro
   cutting process, the tool extrudes the workpiece with negative rake
   angle. The workpiece flows along the direction of minimum resistance,
   and Poisson burr is formed. Based on the deformation analysis and
   experiment observations of micro cutting process, the factor for Poisson
   burr formation is analyzed. It is demonstrated that the ratio of the
   uncut chip thickness to the cutting edge radius plays an important role
   on the height of Poisson burr. Increasing the uncut chip thickness or
   decreasing the cutting edge radius makes the height of exit burr reduce.
   A new model of micro exit burr is established in this paper. Due to the
   size effect of specific cutting energy, the exit burr height increases.
   The minimum exit burr height will be obtained when the ratio of uncut
   the chip thickness to the cutting edge radius reaches 1. It is found
   that the curled radius of the exit burr plays an important role on the
   burr height.}},

Abstract = {{The structural properties, the formation enthalpies, and the mechanical
   properties of Co-Al compounds (CoAl, CoAl3, Co3Al, Co2Al5, Co2Al9, and
   Co4Al13) are studied by using Chen's lattice inversion embedded-atom
   method. The potential is transferable and therefore does well for
   studying different Co-Al compounds. The calculated lattice parameters
   and cohesive energies are consistent with the experimental and
   theoretical results. The formation enthalpies of all the Co-Al compounds
   are negative; therefore, the chemical bonding between Co and Al atoms
   increases the stability of compounds. According to elastic constant
   restrictions, all the six Co-Al compounds are mechanically stable. CoAl
   alloy with the larger moduli and lower Poisson's ratio is the hard or
   brittle phase. Moreover, CoAl3, Co3Al, Co2Al5, and Co2Al9 alloys are
   considered to be ductile materials, which have lower ratio of shear
   modulus to bulk modulus.}},

Abstract = {{In the present paper, various computational methods and tools are used
   to investigate the effect of the prior processing and the resulting
   microstructure on the performance of all-metal sandwich-structures with
   an auxetic-hexagonal core. Specific fabrication processes analyzed in
   the present work include: (a) sheet-metal fabrication using cold flat
   rolling; (b) a simple stamping process used to impart the desired
   corrugation to the as-cold rolled sheet-metal blanks; and (c) laser
   welding used to join the corrugated and stacked adjacent blanks over
   their areas of contact. The computational analyses employed yielded the
   results which clearly revealed how each of the three fabrication
   processes affects the grain microstructure of the sheet-metal blanks,
   the presence of residual stresses within the sandwich-structure as well
   as the presence of distortions. In the last portion of the present work,
   a series of transient nonlinear dynamics finite-element computational
   analyses is carried out in order to demonstrate how the prior
   fabrication processes and the material microstructure, residual stresses
   and distortions yielded by them affects the dynamic performance of the
   all-metal auxetic sandwich-structures subjected to blast loading. The
   results obtained clearly showed that the effect of prior processing must
   be taken into account in order to obtain accurate insight into the
   dynamic response of sandwich structures when subjected to blast loading.

Title = {{Physicians Build Less Rapport With Obese Patients}},
Journal = {{OBESITY}},

Volume = {{21}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Objective: Physicians' negative attitudes toward patients with obesity
   are well documented. Whether or how these beliefs may affect
   patient-physician communication is unknown. To describe the relationship
   between patient body mass index (BMI) and physician communication
   behaviors (biomedical, psychosocial/ lifestyle, and rapport building)
   during typical outpatient primary care visits was aimed.
   Design and Methods: Using audio-recorded outpatient encounters from 39
   urban primary care physicians (PCPs) and 208 of their patients, the
   frequency of communication behaviors using the Roter Interaction
   Analysis System was examined. The independent variable was measured;
   patient BMI and dependent variables were communication behaviors by the
   PCP within the biomedical, psychosocial/lifestyle, and rapport building
   domains. A cross-sectional analysis using multilevel Poisson regression
   models to evaluate the association between BMI and physician
   communication was performed.
   Results: PCPs demonstrated less emotional rapport with overweight and
   obese patients (incidence rate ratio, IRR, 0.65, 95\% CI 0.48-0.88, P =
   0.01; IRR 0.69, 95\% CI 0.58-0.82, P < 0.01, respectively) than for
   normal weight patients. No differences in PCPs' biomedical or
   psychosocial/lifestyle communication by patient BMI were found.
   Conclusions: Our findings raise the concern that low levels of emotional
   rapport in primary care visits with overweight and obese patients may
   weaken the patient-physician relationship, diminish patients' adherence
   to recommendations, and decrease the effectiveness of behavior change
   counseling.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetics are a modern class of material fabricated by altering the
   material microstructure. Unlike conventional materials, auxetics exhibit
   a negative Poisson's ratio when subjected to tensile loading. These
   materials have gained popularity within the research community because
   of their enhanced properties, such as density, stiffness, fracture
   toughness and dampening. This paper provides a critical oversight of the
   auxetic field with particular emphasis to the auxetic foams, due to
   their low price, easy availability and desirable mechanical properties.
   Key areas discussed include the fabrication method, the effects played
   by different parameters (temperature, heating time, cell shape and size
   and volumetric compression ratio), microstructural models, mechanical
   properties and potential applications.}},

Abstract = {{Materials and structures with negative Poisson's ratio are characterized
   as auxetics. They are interesting for engineering applications due to
   their non-conventional behavior. However, most of the auxetic structures
   suffer with a disadvantage that they are difficult to be fabricated

   problem, an auxetic structure made of tubes and corrugated sheets using
   conventional technology is proposed in this study. Its auxetic effect is
   investigated by both geometrical analysis and finite element method. For
   validating the analyses, a real auxetic structure is made with aluminum
   material and tested under compression condition. All the results
   obtained show that the proposed structure has very significant negative
   Poisson's ratio effect under compression. The study has provided a
   simple way to fabricate auxetic structure for using in a wide range of
   industrial fields at a low cost.}},

   A brief analysis of the equivalence of this two-parameter consideration

   which is composed of the crystals elastic compliances. The auxetic
   surface separates the regions with negative and positive Poisson's
   ratio. The character of its changes with change of the dimensionless
   complex is determined. The critical value of the complex where a
   topological rearrangement of the auxetic surface occurs is obtained. The
   distribution of partial auxetics in zones with different values of the

   parameter influences the location of a region with negative Poisson's

Abstract = {{Auxetic structures, due to their negative Poisson's ratios, should have
   a positive effect on the comfort of using seating furniture. The aim of
   this study was to develop numerical models of auxetic compression
   springs suitable for seat structures of office and home furniture.
   Analyses were conducted on real and numerical models of different spring
   structures having concave cell walls, subjected to uniaxial compression.
   By changing the modulus of elasticity for the material of the frame and
   geometry of the internal structure non-linear characteristics of
   rigidity and negative Poisson's ratios were established for designed
   springs. Based on numerical calculations structures best adapted to
   provide functionality for to the seats of resting and work furniture

Abstract = {{In this work we present a detailed study on the magnetostrictive
   contribution to Poisson ratio for samples under applied mechanical
   stress. Magnetic contributions to strain and Poisson ratio for cubic
   materials were derived by accounting elastic and magneto-elastic
   anisotropy contributions. We apply our theoretical results for a
   material of interest in magnetomechanics, namely, galfenol (Fe1-xGax).
   Our results show that there is a non-negligible magnetic contribution in
   the linear portion of the curve of stress versus strain. The rotation of
   the magnetization towards {[}110] crystallographic direction upon
   application of mechanical stress leads to an auxetic behavior, i.e.,
   exhibiting Poisson ratio with negative values. This magnetic
   contribution to auxetic behavior provides a novel insight for the
   discussion of theoretical and experimental developments of materials
   that display unusual mechanical properties. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Recently natrolite was shown to be an auxetic material that is able to
   exchange extra-framework Na+ cations with other mono-, di-, and
   trivalent cations. Under pressure up to several GPa, these
   cation-exchanged natrolites undergo superhydration and/or phase
   transformations in the cation-water arrangement. Using density
   functional theory we studied in silico the ion exchange in natrolites.
   First we optimized the structures of Li+-, Na+-, K+-, Rb+-, and
   Cs+-exchanged natrolites at ambient conditions and compared the
   resulting lattice energies to that of the hypothetical H-form of
   natrolite. Of all natrolites, the smallest formal exchange energy was
   found for Na-NAT, in agreement with the natural occurrence of this
   material. Then we modeled the effect of pressure on Na-, Rb-, and
   Cs-natrolites, addressing (i) the incorporation of water ligands into
   the zeolite framework, accompanied by an increase in volume; and (ii)
   the changes in the cation-water arrangement within the zeolite pores.
   The computational models reproduce reasonably well the critical
   pressure, at which these phenomena occur, and, in the case of Cs-NAT,
   point toward a cation displacement model for its structural transition
   under pressure.}},

Abstract = {{The HET-MN assay (hen's egg test for micronucleus induction) is
   different from other in vitro genotoxicity assays in that it includes
   toxicologically important features such as absorption, distribution,
   metabolic activation, and excretion of the test compound. As a promising
   follow-up to complement existing in vitro test batteries for
   genotoxicity, the HET-MN is currently undergoing a formal validation. To
   optimize the validation, the present study describes a critical analysis
   of previously obtained HET-MN data to check the experimental design and
   to identify the most appropriate statistical procedure to evaluate
   treatment effects. Six statistical challenges (I-VI) of general
   relevance were identified, and remedies were provided which can be
   transferred to similarly designed test methods: a Williams-type trend
   test is proposed for overdispersed counts (II) by means of a square-root
   transformation which is robust for small sample sizes (I), variance
   heterogeneity (III), and possible downturn effects at high doses (IV).
   Due to near-to-zero or even zero-count data occurring in the negative
   control (V), a conditional comparison of the treatment groups against
   the mean of the historical controls (VI) instead of the concurrent
   control was proposed, which is in accordance with US-FDA
   recommendations. For the modified Williams-type tests, the power can be
   estimated depending on the magnitude and shape of the trend, the number
   of dose groups, and the magnitude of the MN counts in the negative
   control. The experimental design used previously (i.e. six eggs per dose
   group, scoring of 1000 cells per egg) was confirmed. The proposed
   approaches are easily available in the statistical computing environment
   R, and the corresponding R-codes are provided. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{In several cases, count data often have excessive number of zero
   outcomes. This zero-inflated phenomenon is a specific cause of
   overdispersion, and zero-inflated Poisson regression model (ZIP) has
   been proposed for accommodating zero-inflated data. However, if the data
   continue to suggest additional overdispersion, zero-inflated negative
   binomial (ZINB) and zero-inflated generalized Poisson (ZIGP) regression
   models have been considered as alternatives. This study proposes the
   score test for testing ZIP regression model against ZIGP alternatives
   and proves that it is equal to the score test for testing ZIP regression
   model against ZINB alternatives. The advantage of using the score test
   over other alternative tests such as likelihood ratio and Wald is that
   the score test can be used to determine whether a more complex model is
   appropriate without fitting the more complex model. Applications of the
   proposed score test on several datasets are also illustrated.}},

Abstract = {{A representative fabrication processing of SU-8 photoresist, Ultraviolet
   (UV) lithography is usually composed of spin coat, soft bake, UV
   exposure, post exposure bake (PEB), development and optional hard bake,
   etc. The exposed region of SU-8 is crosslinked during the PEB process
   and its physical properties highly depend on UV exposure and PEB
   condition. This work was initiated to investigate if thermal baking
   after fabrication can affect the mechanical properties of SU-8
   photoresist material because SU-8 is trying to be used as a structural
   material for MEMS operated at high temperature. Since a temperature of
   95 degrees C is normally recommended for PEB process, elevated
   temperatures up to 200 degrees C were considered for the optional hard
   bake process. The viscoelastic material properties were measured by
   dynamic mechanical analyses (DMA). Also, pulling tests were performed to
   obtain Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio as a function of strain rate
   in a wide temperature range. From this study, the effects of temperature
   on the elastic and viscoelastic material properties of SU-8 were
   obtained.}},

Abstract = {{Decades of intensive anthelmintic treatment has caused equine large
   strongyles to become quite rare, while the cyathostomins have developed
   resistance to several drug classes. The larval culture has been
   associated with low to moderate negative predictive values for detecting
   Strongylus vulgaris infection. It is unknown whether detection of other
   large strongyle species can be statistically associated with presence of
   S. vulgaris. This remains a statistical challenge because of the rare
   occurrence of large strongyle species. This study used a modified
   Poisson regression to analyse a dataset for associations between S.
   vulgaris infection and simultaneous occurrence of Strongylus edentatus
   and Triodontophorus spp. In 663 horses on 42 Danish farms, the
   individual prevalences of S. vulgaris, S. edentatus and Triodontophorus
   spp. were 12\%, 3\% and 12\%, respectively. Both S. edentatus and
   Triodontophorus spp. were significantly associated with S. vulgaris
   infection with relative risks above 1. Further, S. edentatus was
   associated with use of selective therapy on the farms, as well as
   negatively associated with anthelmintic treatment carried out within 6
   months prior to the study. The findings illustrate that occurrence of S.
   vulgaris in larval cultures can be interpreted as indicative of other
   large strongyles being likely to be present.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this work was to investigate the effect of the membrane
   fixed-charge concentration on the electrochemical impedance of
   ion-exchange membrane systems and the specific properties of the
   impedance of ion-exchange systems with weakly charged membranes. The
   systems under study are constituted by a membrane with a homogeneous
   distribution of negative fixed-charge and two diffusion boundary layers
   on both sides of the membrane. The ionic transport processes of a binary
   electrolyte are theoretically described by the Nernst-Planck and Poisson
   equations not only in the ion-exchange membrane but also in the two
   diffusion boundary layers. The electrochemical impedance for different
   values of the anion diffusion coefficients and the direct component of
   the applied electric current has been obtained by using the network
   simulation method as a function of the membrane fixed-charge
   concentration. New results are presented in relation with the evolution
   of the characteristic frequency of the diffusion impedance and the dc
   resistance of the system with the uniform concentration of the
   fixed-charge inside the membrane.}},

   models are recommended for handling excessive zeros in count data. For
   various reasons, researchers may not address zero inflation. This paper
   helps educate researchers on the importance of accounting for zero
   inflation and the consequences of misspecifying the statistical model.
   Using simulations, we found that when the zero inflation in the data was
   ignored, estimation was poor and statistically significant findings were
   missed. When overdispersion within the zero-inflated data was ignored,
   poor estimation and inflated Type I errors resulted. Recommendations on
   when to use the ZINB and ZIP models are provided. In an illustration
   using a two-step model selection procedure (likelihood ratio test and
   the Vuong test), the ZIP model was correctly identified only when the

Abstract = {{Uniaxial tension of the nanofilm of the FeAl intermetallic alloy has
   been simulated by the molecular dynamics method. It has been found that
   the nanofilm is elastically deformed by 37\%. There is a region in the
   stress-strain curve, where the strain increases with a decrease in the
   tensile stress, which indicates the negative stiffness of the nanofilm
   in this region. The uniform strain with a decrease in the tensile stress
   is unstable thermodynamically, which leads to the appearance domains
   with different elastic strains in the nanofilm. The deformation in the
   unstable region develops due to the domain-wall motion; as a result, the
   domains with a higher strain grow at the expense of the domains with a
   lower strain. A similar deformation mechanism was recently described by
   Savin with coworkers for the DNA molecule.}},

Abstract = {{Two flood analysis estimation schemes, based on, respectively, partial
   duration series (PDS) and annual maximum series (AMS), are compared. The
   PDS model assumes a Generalized Pareto (GP) distribution for modeling
   the flood exceedances above threshold corresponding to a generalized
   extreme value (GEV) distribution for annual maxima. As a generalization
   of the common assumption of the Poisson distribution (PD) to count the
   occurrences of peaks over threshold in the PDS models, the advantage of
   negative binomial (NB) distribution is explored in this study. The
   T-year event estimator for the annual maximum distribution corresponding
   to the parent PDS model is formulated for producing AMS samples
   consistent with PDS samples which are used in simulations. The
   performance of the two models in terms of the uncertainty of the T-year
   event estimator is evaluated in the cases of estimation with the method
   of probability weighted moments (PWM). In a similar way, the performance
   of the derived PDS/NB-GP model is compared with the existing PDS/PD-GP
   model in terms of uncertainty of T-year event estimator using simulation
   and field data. The results show the T-year event estimate using
   PDS/NB-GP model yields lower variance compared to PDS/PD-GP models for
   most cases. However both the models perform similarly at higher return
   periods more than 300 years, using the ratios of the variance of T-years
   estimate as an index, and the ratio decreases with an increase in mean
   number of annual exceedances above threshold (mu). From the results it
   is observed that both AMS and PDS models yield the same variance when mu
   varies from 1.4 to 1.65. However, in case of NB distribution the PDS and
   AMS models gives the same variance of q(T) when variance (sigma(2)) is
   1.5 times the mean number of annual exceedance above threshold. The
   performance of the PDS models and the corresponding AMS models using the
   available data of Dee (at Cairnton) shows the PDS/NB-GP model to be
   marginally better at return periods lower than 50 years. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To investigate the link between self-rated oral health and
   socio-demographic inequalities.
   METHODS: Cross-sectional study, carried out with 2,016 adults between 20
   and 59 years of age in 2009, in Florianopolis, SC, Southern Brazil. We
   adopted a two-stage sampling design (census tracts and households). Data
   were collected through face-to-face interviews, conducted in the
   participants' households. The outcome was self-rated oral health. The
   exploratory variables were demographic characteristics, indicators of
   socioeconomic position, dental service utilization and adverse
   self-reported oral health conditions. Analysis was performed using
   multivariable poisson regression, which allowed the estimation of
   prevalence ratios and 95\% confidence intervals.
   RESULTS: The prevalence of negative self-rated oral health was 33.2\%
   (95\% CI 29.8; 36.6). In the adjusted analysis, being of an older age,
   self-classifying as light-skinned black, lower education, the most
   recent dental appointment being three years or more ago, attending
   public dental surgeries, having less than 10 natural teeth in at least
   one arch, self-reporting need for dental treatment, reporting dry mouth,
   and difficulty eating due to tooth problems were associated with
   negative self-rated oral health.
   CONCLUSIONS: Self-rated oral health reflects social inequalities in
   health, and it is associated with low socioeconomic status, less
   frequent use of dental services and poorer self-reported oral health
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The work describes the manufacturing, mechanical properties, and wave
   propagation characteristics of a pyramidal lattice made exhibiting an
   auxetic (negative Poisson's ratio) behavior. Contrary to similar lattice
   tessellations produced using metal cores, the pyramidal lattice
   described in this work is manufactured using a kirigami (origami plus
   cutting pattern) technique, which can be applied to a large variety of
   thermoset and thermoplastic composites. Due to the particular geometry
   created through this manufacturing technique, the kirigami pyramidal
   lattice shows an inversion between in-plane and out-of-plane mechanical
   properties compared to classical honeycomb configurations. Long
   wavelength approximations are used to calculate the slowness curves,
   showing unusual zero-curvature phononic properties in the transverse
   plane. A novel 2D wave propagation technique based on Bloch waves for
   damped structures is also applied to evaluate the dispersion behavior of
   composite (Kevlar/epoxy) lattices with intrinsic hysteretic loss. The 2D
   wave propagation analysis shows evanescence directivity at different
   frequency bandwidths and complex modal behavior due to unusual
   deformation mechanism of the lattice.}},

Title = {{Negative self-perception of smile associated with malocclusions among

Volume = {{35}},

Pages = {{483-490}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{This study estimated the prevalence of negative self-perception of smile
   because of occlusion abnormalities and investigated their association
   according to standard clinical criteria. The sample consisted of 1290
   randomly selected Brazilian adolescent boys and girls aged 12-16 years.
   The outcome of interest was dissatisfaction with smile, and data were
   collected using a standardized questionnaire. Occlusion characteristics
   were assessed using the dental aesthetic index (DAI). The other study
   variables were gender, age, and use of dental services. A chi-square
   test and Poisson multiple regression were used for statistical analysis.
   Of the 1290 students interviewed and examined, 539 (41.8 per cent) were
   dissatisfied with their smile; of these, 373 (69.2 per cent) assigned
   their dissatisfaction to the presence of an occlusal abnormality, and
   166 (30.8 per cent) reported reasons other than occlusal abnormalities
   for their negative self-perception of their smile. In multivariate
   analysis, the following variables were associated with the outcome of
   interest: maxillary anterior irregularity {[}prevalence ratio (PR) =
   1.40; 95 per cent confidence interval (CI) = 1.29-1.80], incisal spacing
   (PR = 1.37; 95 per cent CI = 1.19-1.57), vertical open bite (PR = 1.34;
   95 per cent CI = 1.15-1.55), mandibular anterior irregularity (PR =
   1.29; 95 per cent CI = 1.14-1.46), permanent anterior teeth missing (PR
   = 1.21; 95 per cent CI = 1.05-1.39), and incisal diastema (PR = 1.14; 95
   per cent CI = 1.01-1.31). The negative self-perception of smile was
   statistically associated with severity of occlusal disorders according
   to the DAI scores, which suggests that self-perception should be used
   together with standard clinical criteria when decisions about
   orthodontic treatments are made in public health care systems.}},

Abstract = {{Diabetes is associated with increased risk of developing colorectal
   cancer (CRC), but its effect on overall and cancer-specific mortality in
   CRC patients has been little investigated. The aim of this study was to
   assess the influence of diabetes on overall and cancer-specific
   mortality in Italian CRC patients.
   Cases of adult (a parts per thousand yen15 years) CRC, diagnosed in
   2003-2005, most followed-up to the end of 2008, were randomly selected
   from the Italian Cancer Registries database. Diabetic status, sex, age,
   tumor stage, subsite, treatment, morphology, and grade were obtained by
   consultation of patient clinical records. Poisson multivariable
   regression models, adjusted for potential confounding variables, were
   used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for all-cause and CRC-specific
   mortality, according to diabetic status.
   A total of 1,039 CRC cases with known fasting glucose or diabetic
   status, archived in 7 cancer registries, was analyzed. Compared to
   non-diabetics, diabetics (specific diagnosis or glucose a parts per
   thousand yen126 mg/dl) were older and less likely to receive adjuvant
   therapy. Diabetics were at higher risk of all-cause death {[}HR 1.41; 95
   \% confidence interval (CI) 1.18-1.70] and CRC death (HR 1.36; 95 \% CI
   1.11-1.67), with no differences by sex or subsite.
   Diabetes was significantly associated with increased overall and
   CRC-specific mortality. Our findings indicate that diabetes is a
   negative prognostic factor for CRC and suggest that in patients with
   CRC, diabetes prevention and treatments that stabilize the condition and
   control its complications might reduce mortality. Further studies are
   required to ascertain the mechanisms linking diabetes to greater
   mortality in CRC patients.}},

Abstract = {{This work describes the vibration transmissibility behaviour in
   conventional and auxetic (negative Poisson's ratio) foams under low and

   conventional open cell PU-PE based blocks using an alternative
   manufacturing process to the one currently used in the mainstream
   literature. The dynamic behaviour of both conventional and auxetic
   porous materials was assessed within the frequency bandwidth 5-500 Hz
   using a base excitation technique with a calibrated seismic mass. The
   foam pads were subjected to white noise broadband excitation at low
   dynamic strain, followed by a sine sweep around the resonance of the
   foam-mass system. The experimental data have been used to perform an
   inverse identification of the nonlinear dependence of the foam
   permeability versus the amplitude and frequency of excitation using a
   single-degree-of-freedom poroelastic vibration model. The auxetic foam
   shows higher dynamic stiffness and enhanced viscous dissipation
   characteristics, in particular when subjected to nonlinear vibration
   loading.}},

Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{This paper reports the finite element analysis of an innovative 3D
   auxetic textile structure consisting of three yarn systems (weft, warp
   and stitch yarns). Different from conventional 3D textile structures,
   the proposed structure exhibits an auxetic behaviour under compression
   and can be used as a reinforcement to manufacture auxetic composites.
   The geometry of the structure is first described. Then a 3D finite
   element model is established using ANSYS software and validated by the
   experimental results. The deformation process of the structure at
   different compression strains is demonstrated, and the validated finite
   element model is finally used to simulate the auxetic behaviour of the
   structure with different structural parameters and yarn properties. The
   results show that the auxetic behaviour of the proposed structure
   increases with increasing compression strain, and all the structural
   parameters and yarn properties have significant effects on the auxetic
   behaviour of the structure. It is expected that the study could provide
   a better understanding of 3D auxetic textile structures and could
   promote their application in auxetic composites.}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Negative compressibility is the ability to expand in at least one
   dimension rather than shrinking upon the application of an externally

   perception, negative linear compressibility may be obtained from
   re-entrant hexagonal truss systems of specific geometric features which
   deform through non-equal changes in the lengths of the cell walls when
   deforming through a constrained angle stretching rather than other modes
   of deformation (such as flexure or hinging, modes of deformation that
   also lead to auxetic behaviour in honeycombs). Negative compressibility
   is predicted in the vertical direction for particular re-entrant
   geometries of this smart hexagonal truss system when the vertical ribs
   are much stiffer than the inclined ribs.}},

   material design}},
Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{In an effort to tailor functional materials with customized anisotropic
   properties-stiffness and yield strain, we propose porous materials
   consisting of flexible mesostructures designed from the deformation of a
   re-entrant auxetic honeycomb and compliant mechanisms. Using an analogy
   between compliant mechanisms and a cellular material's deformation, we
   can tailor the in-plane properties of mesostructures; low stiffness and
   high strain in one direction and high stiffness and low strain in the
   other direction. An analytical model is developed to obtain the
   effective moduli and yield strains of the porous materials by combining
   the kinematics of a rigid link mechanism and deformation of flexure
   hinges. A numerical technique is implemented with the analytical model
   for the nonlinear constitutive relations of the mesostructures and their
   strain-dependent Poisson's ratios. A finite element analysis (FEA) is
   used to validate the analytical and numerical models. The designed
   moduli and yield strain of porous materials with an aluminum alloy are 2
   GPa and 0.28\% in one direction and 0.2 MPa and 28\% in the other
   direction. These porous materials with mesostructures have high negative
   Poisson's ratios, v(xy){*} down to -82 due to the large rotation of the
   link member in the transverse direction caused by the input displacement
   in the longitudinal direction. The porous materials also show higher
   moduli for compressive loading due to the contact of flexure hinges.
   This paper demonstrates that compliant mesostructures can be used for
   next-generation material design in terms of customized mechanical
   properties; modulus, strength, strain, and Poisson's ratio. The proposed
   mesostructures can also be easily manufactured using a conventional
   cutting method.}},

Title = {{Homogenized mechanical properties of auxetic composite materials in

Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2013}},

Abstract = {{Careful microstructural design can result in materials with
   counterintuitive effective (macroscale) mechanical properties such as a
   negative Poisson's ratio, commonly referred to as auxetic behavior. One
   specific approach to achieving auxetic behavior is to elastically
   connect structural elements with rotational degrees of freedom to result
   in elastic structures that unfold under uniaxial loading in specific
   directions, thereby giving rise to bi- or triaxial expansion, i.e.
   auxetic behavior (transverse expansion under uniaxial extension). This
   concept has been applied successfully to elastically coupled
   two-dimensional rigid rotational elements (such as rotating rectangles
   and triangles) which exhibit a negative effective in-plane Poisson's
   ratio under uniaxial (ex) tension. Here, we adopt this fundamental
   design principle but take it to the next level by achieving auxetic
   behavior in finitely strained composites made of stiff inclusions in a
   hyperelastic matrix, and we study the resulting elastic properties under
   in-plane strain by numerical homogenization. Our results highlight the
   emergence of auxetic behavior based on geometric arrangement and
   properties of the base material and demonstrate a path towards simple
   inclusion-matrix composites with auxetic behavior.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{This paper aims to understand the effect of auxeticity on shear
   deformation in thick plates. Three models for the shear correction
   factor of plates as a function of Poisson's ratio were proposed: an
   analytical model, a cubic fit model and a modified model. Of these
   three, the cubic fit model exhibits the best accuracy over the entire
   range of Poisson's ratio from -1 to 0.5. The extent of shear deformation
   is herein investigated using the example of uniformly loaded circular
   plates. It was found that the maximum deformation of such plates based
   on Mindlin theory approximates to those according to Kirchhoff theory
   when the Poisson's ratio of the plate material is highly negative. When
   the Poisson's ratio of the plate material is -1 and the edge of the
   plate is simply supported, the calculation of the maximum deflection by
   Mindlin theory simplifies into that by Kirchhoff theory. These results
   suggest that auxeticity reduces shear deformation in thick plates,
   permitting the use of classical plate theory for thick plates only if
   the plate material is highly auxetic.}},

   experiment was conducted during the 2010-2011 crop season in UNESP/FCAV,
   Jaboticabal, SP, Brazil, in two fields of 10,000-m(2) area that were
   subdivided into 100 plots (10 m x 10 m). The cultivars sown were M 7908
   RR and its isoline M-SOY 8001. The number of the first to fifth instars
   and the number of adults were determined. To evaluate insect dispersion
   in the area, the following indices were used: variance/mean ratio,
   Morisita index, Green coefficient, and the k exponent of the negative
   binomial distribution. To study probabilistic models to describe the
   spatial distribution of the insects, the adjustments of the Poisson and
   negative binomial distributions were tested. The first to third instars
   showed aggregated spatial distribution, whereas the fourth and fifth
   instars, and adults, isolated or grouped, showed variation in the
   arrangement, ranging from moderately aggregated to randomly dispersed.
   During the adjustment of probability distributions, the negative
   binomial distribution model showed adjustment for the first to third
   instars, fourth and fifth instars, adults, and fourth and fifth instars

Abstract = {{Objectives: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of oral
   health conditions on oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) in
   population-based sample of Brazilian preschool children. A further aim
   was to identify the influence of socio-demographic profile and
   perceptions regarding general health and oral health status on OHRQoL.
   Methods: An epidemiological survey was carried out at public and private
   preschools in the city of Belo Horizonte, Brazil. The sample consisted
   of 1632 5-year-old male and female preschoolers randomly selected using
   a multi-stage sampling technique and their parents/caregivers. Oral
   examinations of the children were performed by a single, previously
   calibrated examiner for the assessment of dental caries experience,
   malocclusion, traumatic dental injury and developmental defects of
   enamel. Caregivers were asked to complete the Brazilian Early Childhood
   Oral Health Impact Scale (B-ECOHIS) and a form on socio-demographic
   data. Descriptive, bivariate and adjusted Poisson regression model
   analyses were carried out. Results: In the child section of the
   B-ECOHIS, OHRQoL was negatively impacted by decayed, missing and filled
   teeth {[}prevalence ratios (PR) = 2.18; 95\% CI, 1.88-2.52], position of
   the child among siblings in the family (PR = 1.20; 95\% CI, 1.04-1.39),
   type of preschool (PR = 1.36; 95\% CI, 1.10 -1.69), age of
   parents/caregivers (PR = 1.18; 95\% CI, 1.04-1.34), monthly household
   income (PR = 1.48; 95\% CI, 1.18-1.85) and perception of the child's
   general health status (PR = 1.26; 95\% CI, 1.06-1.51). In the family
   section, the adjusted results demonstrated a negative impact on OHRQoL
   associated with dental caries experience (PR = 3.40; 95\% CI,
   2.83-4.08), age of parents/caregivers (PR = 1.16; 95\% CI, 1.01-1.33)
   and monthly household income (PR = 1.41; 95\% CI, 1.16-1.72).
   Conclusions: Dental caries experience was the only normative criteria
   with a negative impact on OHRQoL. Families with low income and younger
   parents reported a greater impact on quality of life. According to
   parents' perceptions, a poor general health status rating was related to
   poorer quality of life among the children.}},

Abstract = {{Water inside the low-dimensional carbon structures has been considered
   seriously owing to fundamental interest in its flow and structures as
   well as its practical impact. Recently, the anomalous perfect
   penetration of water through graphene oxide membrane was demonstrated
   although the membrane was impenetrable for other liquids and even gases.
   The unusual auxetic behavior of graphene oxide in the presence of water
   was also reported. Here, on the basis of first-principles calculations,
   we establish atomistic models for hybrid systems composed of water and
   graphene oxides revealing the anomalous water behavior inside the
   stacked graphene oxides. We show that formation of hexagonal ice bilayer
   in between the flakes as well as melting transition of ice at the edges
   of flakes are crucial to realize the perfect water permeation stacked
   structures. The distance between adjacent layers that can be controlled
   either by oxygen reduction process or pressure is shown to determine the
   water flow thus highlighting a unique water dynamics in randomly
   connected two-dimensional spaces.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic and other mechanical metamaterials are typically studied in
   situations where they are subjected solely to mechanical forces or
   displacements even though they may be designed to exhibit additional
   anomalous behaviour or tunability when subjected to other disturbances
   such as changes in temperature or magnetic fields. It is shown that
   externally applied magnetic fields can tune the geometry and macroscopic
   properties of known auxetics that incorporate magnetic component/s, thus
   resulting in a change of their macroscopic properties. Anomalous
   properties which are observed in such novel magneto-mechanical systems
   include tunable Poisson's ratios, bi-stability or multi-stability,
   depending on the applied magnetic fields, and other
   electromagnetic-mechanical effects such as strain dependent induced
   electric currents and magnetic fields. The properties exhibited depend,
   amongst other things, on the relative position and orientation of the
   magnetic insertion/s within the structure, the geometry of the system
   and the magnetic strength of the magnetic components, including that of
   the external magnetic field.}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic cellular tubes are emerging as potential candidates for a number
   of critical devices requiring high resistance to kinking, such as
   angioplasty stents or annuloplasty rings. This work investigates the
   collapse under pure bending of auxetic tubes based on inverted hexagonal
   honeycombs, with the aim to identify design strategies suitable for
   improving their kinking response. First, the mechanical properties of
   the structure are determined under small deformation by means of
   analytical approaches, and used to verify the validity of numerical
   models. These are then used to simulate the tube collapse under pure
   bending, and identify the influence of the geometric parameters defining
   the structure on the phenomenon. The study indicates that the adoption
   of auxetic tubular structures can contribute to improving considerably
   the resistance to kinking, suggesting the parameters to be controlled in
   the design of critical applications.}},

Title = {{Computer simulations of auxetic foams in two dimensions}},
Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Two simple models of two-dimensional auxetic (i.e. negative Poisson's
   ratio) foams are studied by computer simulations. In the first one,
   further referred to as a Y-model, the ribs forming the cells of the foam
   are connected at points corresponding to sites of a disordered honeycomb
   lattice. In the second one, coined a Delta-model, the connections of the
   ribs are not point-like but spatial. For simplicity, they are
   represented by triangles centered at the honeycomb lattice points. Three
   kinds of joints are considered for each model, soft, normal and hard,
   respectively corresponding to materials with Young's modulus ten times
   smaller than, equal to and ten times larger than that of the ribs. The
   initial lattices are uniformly compressed, which decreases their linear
   dimensions by about 15\%. The resulting structures are then used as
   reference structures with no internal stress. The Poisson's ratios of
   these reference structures are determined by stretching them, in either
   the x or the y direction. The results obtained for finite meshes and
   finite samples are extrapolated to infinitely fine mesh and to the
   thermodynamic limit, respectively. The extrapolations indicate that
   meshes with as few as 13 nodes across a rib and samples as small as
   containing 16 x 16 cells approximate the Poisson's ratios of systems of
   infinite size and infinite mesh resolution within the statistical
   accuracy of the experiments, i.e. a few per cent. The simulations show
   that by applying harder joints one can reach lower Poisson's ratios,
   i.e. foams with more auxetic properties. It also follows from the
   simulations performed that the Delta-model gives lower Poisson's ratios
   than the Y-model. Finally, the simulations using fine meshes for the
   samples are compared with the ones in which the ribs are approximated by
   Timoshenko beams. Taking into account simplifications in the latter
   model, the agreement is surprisingly good.}},

   ratio}},
Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel honeycomb structure that exhibits a negative
   Poisson's ratio (NPR). In contrast to other NPR honeycomb structures
   studied in the past, the new structure can be easily fabricated using
   conventional technology and materials on a large scale of production
   with a low cost. The geometry of the structure is first described, and
   then an elastic analysis based on standard beam theory is carried out to
   establish the relation of its Young's modulus with relevant geometrical
   parameters and material properties. The effects of the geometrical
   parameters in non-dimensional forms on the Young's modulus of the
   structure are discussed. The compressive tests were performed on samples
   of the structure made with the same aluminum alloy but with different
   geometrical parameters to verify the theoretical analysis. The results
   obtained from both the theoretical calculations and experiments show
   that the proposed NPR honeycomb structure has a very obvious NPR
   behavior. Moreover, its elastic modulus is significantly affected by its
   geometrical parameters, and can be optimized for specific applications
   through the design and control of honeycomb geometry parameters.}},

Title = {{The Epidemiology of HIV and HSV-2 Infections among Women Participating

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To prepare for future HIV prevention trials, we conducted
   prospective cohort studies among women working in food and recreational
   facilities in northern Tanzania. We examined the prevalence and
   incidence of HIV and HSV-2, and associated risk factors.
   Methods: Women aged 18-44 years working in food and recreational
   facilities were screened to determine their eligibility for the studies.
   Between 2008-2010, HIV-negative women were enrolled and followed for 12
   months. At enrolment and 3-monthly, we collected socio-demographic and
   behavioural data, and performed clinical examinations for collection of
   biological specimens that were tested for reproductive tract infections.
   Risk factors for HIV and HSV-2 incidence were investigated using Poisson
   regression models.
   Results: We screened 2,229 and enrolled 1,378 women. The median age was
   27 years (interquartile range, IQR 22, 33), and median duration working
   at current facility was 2 years. The prevalences of HIV at screening and
   HSV-2 at enrolment were 16\% and 67\%, respectively. Attendance at the
   12-month visit was 86\%. HIV and HSV-2 incidence rates were 3.7 (95\%
   confidence interval, CI: 2.8,5.1) and 28.6 (95\% CI: 23.5,35.0)/100
   person-years, respectively. Women who were separated, divorced, or
   widowed were at increased risk of HIV (adjusted incidence rate ratio,
   aRR = 6.63; 95\% CI: 1.97,22.2) and HSV-2 (aRR = 2.00; 95\% CI:
   1.15,3.47) compared with married women. Women reporting >= 3 partners in
   the past 3 months were at higher HIV risk compared with women with 0-1
   partner (aRR = 4.75; 95\% CI: 2.10,10.8), while those who had reached
   secondary education or above were at lower risk of HSV-2 compared with
   women with incomplete primary education (aRR = 0.42; 95\% CI:
   0.22,0.82).
   Conclusions: HIV and HSV-2 rates remain substantially higher in this
   cohort than in the general population, indicating urgent need for
   effective interventions. These studies demonstrate the feasibility of
   conducting trials to test new interventions in this highly-mobile
   population.}},

Abstract = {{This work aims to analyze the damping response of viscoelastic composite
   reinforced by elastic auxetic heterogeneities by means of
   micromechanical modeling. The linear viscoelastic problem can be
   transformed into the associated elastic one via the Carson-Laplace
   transform (C-LT). Loss factors are taken into account by the
   introduction of the frequency-dependent complex stiffness tensors of the
   viscoelastic phases. The micromechanical formalism, based on the
   kinematic integral equation, leads to the computation of effective
   storage modulus and its associated loss factor in the quasi-static
   domain. The possibility to enhance viscoelastic (VE) properties of a
   polymeric material such as PVB is examined through several mixing
   configurations. Thus, the use of elastic auxetic heterogeneities is
   analyzed in comparison with classical elastic and viscoelastic
   reinforcements. The model predictions for VE phases, confirm the
   possibility to improve the global material stiffness. Also, it is shown
   in the particular case of elastic and spherical heterogeneities, by a
   proper choice of phases' stiffness ratio Q, that auxetic reinforcements
   represent a good compromise to have simultaneously enhanced stiffness
   and loss factor response in composite materials. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Cells sense and respond to mechanical forces, regardless of whether the
   source is from a normal tissue matrix, an adjacent cell or a synthetic
   substrate. In recent years, cell response to surface rigidity has been
   extensively studied by modulating the elastic modulus of poly(ethylene
   glycol) (PEG)-based hydrogels. In the context of biomaterials, Poisson's
   ratio, another fundamental material property parameter has not been
   explored, primarily because of challenges involved in tuning the
   Poisson's ratio in biological scaffolds. Two-photon polymerization is
   used to fabricate suspended web structures that exhibit positive and
   negative Poisson's ratio (NPR), based on analytical models. NPR webs
   demonstrate biaxial expansion/compression behavior, as one or multiple
   cells apply local forces and move the structures. Unusual cell division
   on NPR structures is also demonstrated. This methodology can be used to
   tune the Poisson's ratio of several photocurable biomaterials and could
   have potential implications in the field of mechanobiology.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: We evaluated work-related injuries involving a hand or
   fingers and associated costs among a cohort of 24,830 carpenters between
   1989 and 2008. Methods: Injury rates and rate ratios were calculated by
   using Poisson regression to explore higher risk on the basis of age,
   sex, time in the union, predominant work, and calendar time. Negative
   binomial regression was used to model dollars paid per claim after
   adjustment for inflation and discounting. Results: Hand injuries
   accounted for 21.1\% of reported injuries and 9.5\% of paid lost time
   injuries. Older carpenters had proportionately more amputations,
   fractures, and multiple injuries, but their rates of these more severe
   injuries were not higher. Costs exceeded \$21 million, a cost burden of
   \$0.11 per hour worked. Conclusions: Older carpenters' higher proportion
   of serious injuries in the absence of higher rates likely reflects
   age-related reporting differences.}},

Abstract = {{The investigation assesses the thermal-mechanical and thermodynamic
   properties of various graphene sheets using a modified Nose-Hoover (NH)
   thermostat method incorporated with molecular dynamics (MD) simulation.
   The investigation begins with an exploration of their thermal-mechanical
   properties at atmospheric pressure, including Young's modulus, shear
   modulus, Poisson's ratio, specific heats and linear and volumetric
   coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE). Two definitions of the line
   change ratio (Delta L/L) are utilized to determine the linear CTE of
   graphene sheets, and the calculations are compared with each other and
   data in the literature. To estimate the volumetric CTE values, the
   Connolly surface method is applied to predict the volume of the deformed
   graphene sheets in the free relaxation state and under temperature
   loading. Their specific heats are also determined by estimating the
   ratio of the amount of heat energy per unit mass that is required to
   raise the temperature-by one degree. Finally, the dependences of the
   size and temperature on the thermal-mechanical and thermodynamic
   properties are examined. The calculations are validated by comparison
   with the results obtained from the existing thermostats and with the
   literature experimental and theoretical data The results indicate that
   the presently calculated thermal-mechanical and thermodynamic properties
   of graphene sheets are very similar to the published experimental and
   theoretical results. The graphene sheets tend to have a negative linear
   CTE at temperatures below 300 K. Additionally, the calculated linear CTE
   of graphene sheets depends strongly on the line-change-ratio
   assumptions. The modified NH thermostat is the only one of five
   thermostats that can accurately reproduce the Debye T-3-dependent
   specific heat at temperatures below the Debye temperature.}},

Abstract = {{Many models describing the deformation of general foam or auxetic
   materials are based on the assumption of homogeneity and order within
   the materials. However, non-uniform heterogeneity is often an inherent

   the porous PVA hydrogels with internal inby-concave pores (IICP) or
   interconnected pores (ICP) were designed and processed. The deformation
   of the PVA hydrogels under compression was tested and their Poisson's
   ratio was characterized. The results indicated that the size, shape and
   distribution of the pores in the hydrogel matrix had strong influence on
   the local Poisson's ratio, which varying from positive to negative at
   micro-scale. The size-dependency of their local Poisson's ratio
   reflected and quantified the uniformity and heterogeneity of the

Abstract = {{A complete characterization is given of the possible macroscopic
   deformations of periodic non-linear affine unimode metamaterials
   constructed from rigid bars and pivots. The materials are affine in the
   sense that their macroscopic deformations can only be affine
   deformations: on a local level the deformation may vary from cell to
   cell. Unimode means that macroscopically the material can only deform
   along a one dimensional trajectory in the six dimensional space of
   invariants describing the deformation (excluding translations and
   rotations). We show by explicit construction that any continuous
   trajectory is realizable to an arbitrarily high degree of approximation
   provided at all points along the trajectory the geometry does not
   collapse to a lower dimensional one. In particular, we present two and
   three dimensional dilational materials having an arbitrarily large
   flexibility window. These are perfect auxetic materials for which a
   dilation is the only easy mode of deformation. They are free to dilate
   to arbitrarily large strain with zero bulk modulus. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Structural grade materials with Young's Modulus in the gigapascal range
   generally have very low damping, leading to requirement for auxiliary
   damping treatments in many applications. This article examines whether a
   high Young's Modulus and damping level can simultaneously be realized by
   introducing lossy polymeric infills into auxetic aluminum honeycombs.
   Using finite element analysis, auxetic honeycombs with varying cell
   geometry and infill stiffness, loaded in the x-and y-directions, are
   examined. From the results, it is observed that the best performance is
   achieved when auxetic honeycombs with shallow inclined walls and short
   vertical walls are loaded in the x-direction. Young's Modulus in excess
   of 10 GPa is achievable in combination with a loss factor of 5\%. If a
   higher loss factor of 10\% is required, Young's Modulus in the range of
   5.5-6.5 GPa can still be realized. The high loss factors achieved are
   attributed to the very high local strain levels in the polymeric infill
   in the central region of the cell between the top and the bottom cell
   walls, which are in close proximity, further increased by the large
   negative Poisson's ratios of the configuration.}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{A symmetry-extended Maxwell treatment of the net mobility of periodic
   bar-and-joint frameworks is used to derive a sufficient condition for
   auxetic behaviour of a 2D material. The type of auxetic behaviour that
   can be detected by symmetry has Poisson's ratio -1, with equal
   expansion/contraction in all directions, and is here termed equiauxetic.
   A framework may have a symmetry-detectable equiauxetic mechanism if it
   belongs to a plane group that includes rotational axes of order n = 6,
   4, or 3. If the reducible representation for the net mobility contains
   mechanisms that preserve full rotational symmetry (A modes), these are
   equiauxetic. In addition, for n = 6, mechanisms that halve rotational
   symmetry (B modes) are also equiauxetic. Copyright (c) EPLA, 2013}},

Abstract = {{Using first-principles calculations, we investigate the fully oxidized
   silicene and germanene with stoichiometric ratio Si:O/Ge:O = 1:1. For
   both compounds, the zigzag ether-like conformation (z-sSiO/z-sGeO) is
   found to be the most energetically favorable structure. These z-sSiO and
   z-sGeO nanosheets have prominent elastic characteristics, which even
   exhibit an unconventional auxetic behavior with negative Poisson ratios.
   After oxidation, the semi-metallic nanosheets are transformed into
   semiconductors with narrow direct band gaps. Due to the anisotropic
   mechanical and electronic properties, the z-sSiO and z-sGeO possess an
   axially high intrinsic charge mobility up to the order of 104 cm2/Vs,
   which is comparable to that of graphene nanoribbons. Our studies
   demonstrate that the silicene and germanene oxides have peculiar
   mechanical and electronic properties, which endow these nanostructures
   for potential applications in nanoelectronics and devices. ((c) 2013

   That Chitosan Has a Similar Capability to Induce a Proton-Sponge Effect

Abstract = {{Polycations having a high buffering capacity in the endosomal pH range,
   such as polyethylenimine (PEI), are known to be efficient at delivering
   nucleic acids by overcoming lysosomal sequestration possibly through the
   proton sponge effect, although other mechanisms such as membrane
   disruption arising from an interaction between the polycation and the
   endosome/lysosome membrane, have been proposed. Chitosan is an efficient
   delivery vehicle for nucleic acids, yet its buffering capacity has been
   thought to be significantly lower than that of PEI, suggesting that the
   molecular mechanism responsible for endolysosomal escape was not proton
   sponge based. However, previous comparisons of PEI and chitosan
   buffering capacity were performed on a mass concentration basis instead
   of a charge concentration basis, the latter being the most relevant
   comparison basis because polycation-DNA complexes form at ratios of
   charge groups (amine to phosphate), rather than according to mass. We
   hypothesized that chitosan has a high buffering capacity when compared
   to PEI on a molar basis and could therefore possibly mediate
   endolysosomal release through the proton sponge effect. In this study,
   we examined the ionization behavior of chitosan and chitosan-DNA
   complexes and compared to that of PEI and polylysine on a charge
   concentration basis. A mean field theory based on the use of the
   Poisson-Boltzmann equation and an Ising model were also applied to model
   ionization behavior of chitosan and PEI, respectively. We found that
   chitosan has a higher buffering capacity than PEI in the endolysosomal
   pH range, while the formation of chitosan-DNA complexes reduces chitosan
   buffering capacity because of the negative electrostatic environment of
   nucleic acids that facilitates chitosan ionization. These data suggest
   that chitosans have a similar capacity as PEI to mediate endosomal
   escape through the proton sponge effect, possibly in a manner which
   depends on the presence of excess chitosan.}},

   then used to perform a parametric analysis on the influence of the
   gradient core geometry over the mechanical performance of the
   structures. It was found that the aspect ratio and the extent of
   gradient (i.e. the horizontal rib length growth rate or the internal

Title = {{Can we understand an auxetic pion-photon transition form factor within

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW D}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{87}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{MAY 22}},
Abstract = {{A state-of-the-art analysis of the pion-photon transition form factor is
   presented based on an improved theoretical calculation that includes the
   effect of a finite virtuality of the quasireal photon in the method of
   light-cone sum rules. We carry out a detailed statistical analysis of
   the existing experimental data using this method and by employing pion
   distribution amplitudes with up to three Gegenbauer coefficients a(2),
   a(4), a(6). Allowing for an error range in the coefficient a(6)
   approximate to 0, the theoretical predictions for gamma{*}gamma -> pi(0)
   obtained with nonlocal QCD sum rules are found to be in good agreement
   with all data that support a scaling behavior of the transition form
   factor at higher Q(2), like those of the Belle Collaboration. The data
   on gamma{*}gamma -> eta/eta' from CLEO and BABAR are also reproduced,
   while there is a strong conflict with the auxetic trend of the BABAR
   data above 10 GeV2. The broader implications of these findings are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Origami structures are mechanical metamaterials with properties that
   arise almost exclusively from the geometry of the constituent folds and
   the constraint of piecewise isometric deformations. Here we characterize
   the geometry and planar and nonplanar effective elastic response of a
   simple periodically folded Miura-ori structure, which is composed of
   identical unit cells of mountain and valley folds with four-coordinated
   ridges, defined completely by two angles and two lengths. We show that
   the in-plane and out-of-plane Poisson's ratios are equal in magnitude,
   but opposite in sign, independent of material properties. Furthermore,
   we show that effective bending stiffness of the unit cell is singular,
   allowing us to characterize the two-dimensional deformation of a plate
   in terms of a one-dimensional theory. Finally, we solve the inverse
   design problem of determining the geometric parameters for the optimal
   geometric and mechanical response of these extreme structures.}},

Title = {{Consequences of the application of the streamer fluid model to the study
   of the sprite inception mechanism}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{51}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{1902-1915}},
Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{We present the results of a streamer-fluid model used to investigate the
   electrodynamical coupling between the troposphere and upper atmosphere
   due to the penetration of lightning electric fields into the mesosphere
   and the lower ionosphere, generating sprites. The model solves the
   continuity equation for electrons and ions coupled to Poisson equation.
   The dominant physical response of the atmosphere is the formation of a
   screening-ionization wave. The wave shields the atmosphere above it from
   the action of the lightning field and, together with the conductivity
   reduction below it due to attachment, the wave amplifies the total field
   below it, allowing for the penetration of intense electric fields in the
   mesosphere as it propagates downwards into regions of higher density
   that compress the wave. This is the key physical mechanism for sprite
   inception. We evaluated the effects of the thundercloud charge geometry,
   lightning current wave-shape, atmospheric conductivity, via different
   electron density profiles, and the effect of ionization, attachment and
   electron mobility coefficients in the electrical breakdown process,
   related to halo production, and sprite streamer initiation. The results
   showed that electrons with higher mobility are more efficient in
   shielding the lightning electric field before breakdown, causing delay,
   and they contribute to the formation of the streamer seed after
   breakdown, anticipating the sprite streamer inception. Similarly, a
   higher effective ionization rate, produced by modifications in the
   attachment and ionization coefficients, anticipates sprite inception.
   The simulations with 6 different electron density profiles, and
   therefore conductivities, spanning 4 orders of magnitude, showed that
   the altitude of breakdown and sprite initiation, as well as their time
   delays from the lightning discharge are directly related to atmospheric
   conductivity: higher conductivities produce halo and sprite inception at
   lower altitudes with longer delays and may hinder sprite formation. We
   document that variations of 30 times in the lightning current leads to
   sprite initiation altitudes in the range 66.0-73.5 km, with delays
   between 1.550 and 34.500 ms, while variations of 4 orders of magnitude
   in the conductivity profile lead to initiation altitudes 61.0-70.6 km,
   with delays in the range 3.825-9.825 ms. Consequently, we suggest that
   lightning characteristics dominate over atmospheric parameters in
   determining sprites' initiation altitude and delay. The simulation of a
   -CG, with a constant current of 30 kA, did not produce a sprite seed,
   confirming an asymmetry in the response of the atmosphere to positive
   and negative lightning. This is due to the free electron drift direction
   that is away from the screening ionization wave, preventing the
   formation of the streamer seed for the great majority of -CGs. The same
   does not apply to halos, which depend on the occurrence of breakdown and
   can be produced by discharges of both polarities. (C) 2012 COSPAR.

Abstract = {{Molecular dynamics simulations of polyethylene/silver-nanoparticle
   composites are implemented to calculate the structures, electrical,

   composites are of isotropic amorphous structure, and the dispersion of
   nanoparticles in composite can be enhanced at a relatively higher
   temperature. Multi-layers of atoms on nanoparticle surface change into
   amorphous configurations, and electrical polarization interface layers
   are formed between silver nanoparticles and polyethylene matrix. The
   interface region shrinks and expends respectively with nanoparticle
   dimension and temperature increasing. Compared with polyethylene system,
   the polyethylene/silver-nanoparticle composite presents explicitly high
   polarizability which increases with temperature and nanoparticle size
   rising simultaneously. The silver nanopaticle dimension directly
   influences the intensity and frequency of interfacial dipole moment,
   resulting in corresponding variations of peak position and intensity in
   infrared spectrum. The polyethylene/silver-nanoparticle composite also
   shows higher isometric heat capacity and negative thermal pressure
   coefficient with better temperature stability, which decreases
   explicitly with temperature and nanoparticle size increasing
   respectively, than polyethylene system. The mechanical property of
   polyethylene/silver-nanoparticle composite shows isotropic elastic

Abstract = {{The flexural vibration of nano-meter sized single layer graphene sheets

   In addition to the nonlocal parameter, the equivalent Poisson's ratio of
   the plate model of graphene sheet in flexure is also shown to be a scale
   effect parameter having mostly negative values. This phenomenon is

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the influences of material parameters on the

   with the basic wave equations and the FDTD formulation to derive the

   impedance ratio and the Poisson ratios (or equivalently, the mass
   density ratio, the shear modulus ratio and the Poisson ratios) of the
   scatterers and host materials. The negative Poisson ratio is also
   considered in our investigation. The effects of these material
   parameters on band gap width are discussed based on detailed numerical
   calculations for systems with three typical lattices. The generation
   mechanism of band gaps (Bragg scattering or local resonance) which is
   determined by the material parameters is also discussed. The analysis is

Abstract = {{Background The definition of fever, and thus fever and neutropenia (FN),
   varies between different pediatric oncology centers. Higher temperature
   limit should reduce FN rates, but may increase rates of FN with
   complications by delaying therapy. This study determined if different
   fever definitions are associated with different FN rates. Procedure Two
   pediatric oncology centers had used three fever definitions in 20042011:
   ear temperature 38.5 degrees C persisting 2hours (low definition);
   axillary temperature 38.5 degrees C 2hours or 39.0 degrees C once
   (middle); and ear temperature 39.0 degrees C once (high). Clinical
   information was retrospectively extracted from charts. FN rates were
   compared using mixed Poisson regression. Results In 521 pediatric
   patients with cancer, 783 FN were recorded during 6,009 months
   cumulative chemotherapy exposure time (501 years; rate, 0.13/month
   {[}95\% CI, 0.120.14]), 124 of them with bacteremia (16\%; 0.021/month
   {[}0.0170.025]). In univariate analysis, the high versus low fever
   definition was associated with a lower FN rate (0.10/month {[}0.080.11]
   vs. 0.15/month {[}0.130.16]; rate ratio, 0.66 {[}0.450.97]; P=0.036),
   the middle definition was intermediate (0.13/month {[}0.110.15]). This
   difference was not confirmed in multivariate analysis (rate ratio, 0.94
   {[}0.671.33]; P=0.74). The high versus low definition was not associated
   with an increased rate of FN with bacteremia (multivariate rate ratio,
   1.39 {[}0.533.62]; P=0.50). Conclusion A higher fever definition was not
   associated with a lower FN rate, nor with an increased rate of FN with
   bacteremia. These may be false negative findings due to methodological
   limitations. These questions, with their potential impact on
   health-related quality of life, and on costs, need to be assessed in
   prospective studies. Pediatr Blood Cancer 2013; 60: 799805. (c) 2012

Abstract = {{Magnetostrictive Fe1-xGax alloys, as a new class of smart materials,
   have great potential in sensing and actuator applications. However, the
   fundamental understanding of the anisotropic elastic responses at high
   Ga concentration remains one of the most challenging problems for the
   binary alloys. Here, we apply the density functional theory and
   large-scale ab initio molecular dynamics simulation to investigate the
   effect of high Ga concentration on the elastic anisotropy of the Fe-Ga
   alloys with supercell models obtained by non-linear and non-uniform
   annealing processes. It is demonstrated that the formation of D0(3)-like
   structures has an important effect on the softness of the tetragonal
   shear modulus and a negligible influence on the rhombohedral shear
   modulus. Meanwhile, the Fe dangling bond to its nearest Ga atoms results
   in a decrease in the Young's modulus and the negative Poisson's ratio in
   the {[}1 1 0] direction. The improved Young's modulus in the {[}1 1 0]
   direction compared to that in the {[}1 0 0] direction is attributed to
   the different arrangement of the pure Fe layer and the Fe-Ga mixed layer
   along the {[}1 1 0] and {[}1 0 0] axes. Furthermore, the ductility of
   Fe1-xGax alloys is enhanced at high Ga content, playing a key role in
   the enhanced magnetostriction. (c) 2013 Acta Materialia Inc. Published

   Using established fiducial quantities for binomial proportions, Poisson

   handle functions of discrete random variables, whose distributions are
   either not available or are intractable. The construction of tolerance
   intervals using fiducial quantities is straightforward and, thus,

Abstract = {{We present first-principles studies of structural, elastic, phonon,
   thermal and electronic properties of MnX. According to the calculated
   total energies, the predicted phase stability trends are consistent with
   previous experiments. For the L1(0) lattice, the calculated Mn-Mn
   exchange couplings J(Mn-Mns), depending on the valence electron
   concentration C-v, have been investigated. The dominant inter-layer
   nearest-neighbors coupling J(1L) and in-plane next-nearest-neighbor
   coupling J(2) are responsible for the differences in energy between the
   two structural phases (T=0 K). The negative shear modulus C' of the
   paramagnetic B2 (phase) triggers the cubic to tetragonal distortion. The
   calculated phonon dispersions indicate that the primary driving force
   for the paramagnetic L1(0) to antiferromagnetic L1(0) transition is the
   magnetic ordering energy, rather than some entropic contribution from
   thermal vibrations. The Debye temperatures, anisotropy and Poisson's
   ratio are also assessed. The calculated results show that the collinear
   antiferromagnetic CuAu-I type structures are mechanically and
   dynamically stable, and agree with the empirical ground states. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Aims: The potential influence of lunar phases on the occurrence of
   myocardial infarction is still controversial. The purpose of the present
   study was to investigate the association of the lunar cycle on the
   occurrence of fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction based on a
   myocardial infarction registry.
   Methods and results: We studied 15,985 patients consecutively
   hospitalised with an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) between 1 January
   1985 and 31 December 2007 with a known date of symptom onset who were
   recruited from a population-based myocardial infarction registry. The
   exact hour of AMI onset was known for 9813 events. Poisson regression
   analysis was performed to examine the relation between the lunar cycle
   and the occurrence of AMI.
   There was no association between new moon, full moon, waning moon and
   waxing moon and the occurrence of AMI. However, we observed that the
   three days after a new moon may be significantly protective for the
   occurrence of AMI, rate ratio (RR) 0.94 (95\% CI 0.91-0.98), and the day
   before a new moon had a slightly negative effect (RR 1.06, 95\% CI
   1.00-1.12). Stratified analysis did not reveal any susceptible
   subgroups.
   Conclusion: The moon phases did not show any apparent association with
   AMI occurrence. However, there might be a `cardioprotective' time three
   days after a new moon.}},

Abstract = {{Although most materials used in practice possess positive Poisson's
   ratio in the range 0 to 1/2, there has been increasing number of auxetic
   materials being developed and investigated. The counter-intuitive
   property of auxetic materials opens up the possibility of solids and
   structures that behave in ways that have been overlooked in the past but
   are nevertheless consistent with physical laws. This article
   investigates how the auxeticity of a plate material influences the
   stresses and moments arising from lateral loads. Using classical plate
   theories, the optimal Poisson's ratio of simply supported rectangular
   plates under lateral loads are obtained on the basis of (a) stress
   minimization from the maximum bending and shearing stresses, and (b)
   moment minimization from the maximum bending and twisting moments.
   Results from stress minimization shows that the optimal Poisson's ratio
   is strongly influenced by the relative plate thickness and plate aspect
   ratio. Using the example of a simply supported rectangular plate under
   sinusoidal load, the optimal Poisson's ratio becomes more negative for
   higher aspect ratio. In addition, the optimal Poisson's ratio becomes
   more negative, until a limit of -1 is reached, for decreasing relative
   plate thickness. Results from moment minimization reveal that the
   optimal Poisson's ratio is strongly influenced by the load distribution.
   For a square plate, the optimal Poisson's ratio is a negative value if
   the load distribution is more concentrated than a sinusoidal load or if
   the central square patch of uniform load takes up less than 43\% of the
   plate area. These results suggest the usefulness of auxetic materials
   for lowering the stresses and moments in rectangular plates under most
   loading conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Poisson's ratio, nu, was measured for four materials, a rubbery polymer,
   a conventional soft foam, and two auxetic foams. We find that for the
   first two materials, having nu >= 0.2, the experimental determinations
   of Poisson's ratio are in good agreement with values calculated from the
   shear and tensile moduli using the equations of classical elasticity.
   However, for the two auxetic materials (nu < 0), the equations of
   classical elasticity give values significantly different from the
   measured nu. We offer an interpretation of these results based on a
   recently published analysis of the bounds on Poisson's ratio for
   classical elasticity to be applicable. Copyright 2013 Author(s). All

Abstract = {{The Poisson's ratio (PR) of asphalt mixtures is a fundamental material
   property that is an important input parameter to viscoelastic pavement
   models. It is typically assumed that PR of asphalt is time independent
   or, in cases where the time dependency of viscoelastic PR is considered,
   calculated as the negative ratio of the time-dependent transverse and
   axial strains measured in a uniaxial creep test. This paper presents
   analytical and experimental results demonstrating the errors involved in
   these assumptions. The first part of this study derives an expression
   for viscoelastic PR. The second part of this study reports the results
   of various experimental tests to measure axial and transverse strains of
   asphalt concrete specimens under different loading conditions. The
   viscoelastic PR increased with time in the tensile relaxation test and
   ramped tensile test, whereas it slightly increased at the beginning of
   the compressive relaxation test and was subsequently virtually constant.
   The error introduced by incorrectly determining the PR as the negative
   ratio of transverse to axial strains in the time domain was found to be
   significant. (C) 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Circular braiding has been traditionally used for forming tubular
   structures but there is an ever-increasing interest to use these
   structures for various composite applications. A tubular braid without
   any core undergoes large lateral contraction but when elastic materials
   are inserted in the hollow braids, they can potentially act as
   reinforcement in energy absorbing composites. In this paper, the tensile
   behaviour of tubular braids consisting of an elastic core has been
   predicted based on defined braid geometry, core properties and tensile
   properties of helically undulated strands of filaments. The constituent
   filaments considered here are monofilament type but the proposed tensile
   model of braid-core system has also been extended for low twist
   multifilament yarns with non-hybrid weave. Braid angle is found to be
   the most important design parameter for varying the extensibility of
   braid-core systems. A comparison has been made between the theoretical
   and experimental stress-strain curves of tubular braids consisting of
   elastic core. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{This paper describes the manufacturing, characterization and parametric
   modeling of a novel fiber-reinforced composite flexible skin with
   in-plane negative Poisson's ratio (auxetic) behavior. The elastic
   mechanical performance of the auxetic skin is evaluated using a
   three-dimensional analytical model based on the classical laminate
   theory (CLT) and Sun's thick laminate theory. Good agreement is observed
   between in-plane Poisson's ratios and Young's moduli of the composite
   skin obtained by the theoretical model and the experimental results. A
   parametric analysis carried out with the validated model shows that
   significant changes in the in-plane negative Poisson's ratio can be
   achieved through different combinations of matrix and fiber materials
   and stacking sequences. It is also possible to identify fiber-reinforced
   composite skin configurations with the same in-plane auxeticity but
   different orthotropic stiffness performance, or the same orthotropic
   stiffness performance but different in-plane auxeticity. The analysis
   presented in this work provides useful guidelines to develop and
   manufacture flexible skins with negative Poisson's ratio for
   applications focused on morphing aircraft wing designs.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanical behaviour of chiral materials is of interest for the

   materials and bones. This paper is concerned with a theory of chiral
   Cosserat elastic plates. In this theory, in contrast with the case of
   achiral plates, the stretching and flexure cannot be treated
   independently of each other. First, we derive the basic equations which
   characterize the deformation of chiral plates. Then we establish a
   uniqueness result in the dynamical theory. In the equilibrium theory we
   establish conditions under which the Neumann problem admits solutions.
   Finally, the deformation of an infinite plate with a circular hole is
   studied. It is shown that, in contrast with the theory of Cosserat
   achiral plates a uniform pressure acting on the boundary of the hole
   produces a microrotation of the material particles.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{66}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{415-425}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Objective: We compared the performance of aggregate data (AD)-based and
   individual patient data (IPD)-based meta-analyses to synthesize evidence
   on the ability of D-dimer to distinguish recurrence risk in patients
   with unprovoked venous thromboembolism (VTE) who stopped
   anticoagulation.
   Study Design and Setting: We compared the results of the published
   AD-based rate ratio of VTE recurrence for positive vs. negative D-dimer,
   estimated by a mixed-effect Poisson model, with those of the IPD-based
   hazard ratio obtained by a Cox regression stratified by trial. We
   performed three additional analyses to investigate the methodological
   reasons for differences between the two approaches, comparing the IPD
   Cox regression with AD generated from IPD Poisson regression (to control
   for differences in population on study), AD time-to-event meta-analysis,
   and AD generated from IPD meta-regression.
   Results: Published analyses agreed in direction and statistical
   significance when estimating the prognostic value of D-dimer even if IPD
   estimates suggested a stronger effect. The additional analyses suggested
   that differences in study populations might explain this slight
   difference. Poor reporting in published studies precluded a true
   comparison of AD- and IPD-based assessments of heterogeneity sources.
   Conclusion: AD and IPD meta-analyses yielded similar estimates of
   D-dimer effect to distinguish risk for recurrent VTE. The IPD approach
   was justified by the need to investigate sources of heterogeneity. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper enables the synthesis of flexure-based transmission
   mechanisms that possess multiple decoupled inputs and outputs of any
   type (e.g., rotations, translations, and/or screw motions), which are
   linked by designer-specified transmission ratios. A comprehensive
   library of geometric shapes is utilized from which a multiplicity of
   feasible concepts that possess the desired transmission characteristics
   may be rapidly conceptualized and compared before an optimal concept is
   selected. These geometric shapes represent the mathematics of screw
   theory and uniquely link a body's desired motions to the flexible
   constraints that enable those motions. This paper is significant to the
   design of nano-positioners, motion stages, and optical mounts. It is
   also significant to the design of transmission-based microstructural
   architectures for creating new materials with extraordinary mechanical
   properties. The microstructural architecture for a material that
   achieves a negative Poisson's ratio as well as a hand-actuated two
   degree of freedom (DOF) microscopy stage are designed as case studies to
   demonstrate the utility of this theory. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Introduction: Poor CD4 response to antiretroviral treatment (HAART) is
   associated with increased mortality. We analyzed the impact of CD4
   increase on non-AIDS-related morbidity and on mortality in HIV patients
   and their parents.
   Methods: Mortality rates were estimated among 1758 virally suppressed
   patients in the Danish HIV Cohort Study after 2 years on HAART and among
   their parents (n = 1603). Analyses were stratified by pre-HAART CD4
   count and CD4 increase. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of non-AIDS-related
   morbidity and mortality rate ratios (MRR) were analyzed using Poisson
   regression.
   Results: CD4 increases less than 25 vs. more than 100 cells/mu l was
   associated with increased mortality {[}MRR 3.5 (95\% confidence interval
   (CI) 1.8-6.8)] even in individuals with pre-HAART CD4 cell count more
   than 250 cells/mu l (MRR 3.2 (95\% CI, 1.3-7.8). Mortality of parents of
   patients with poor CD4 response was also increased {[}MRR 1.5 (95\% CI,
   1.1-2.1)]. There was a trend towards association between poor CD4
   response and increased risk of cardiovascular disease and cancer {[}IRR
   1.6 (95\% CI, 0.8-3.2) and 1.6 (95\% CI, 0.6-4.8)].
   Conclusion: Poor CD4 increase post-HAART is associated with adverse
   prognosis even in absence of severe immunosuppression. CD4 response in
   HIV patients is associated with mortality among their parents, thus poor
   CD4 response may be caused by genetic factors, which might also affect
   morbidity and mortality in the HIV-negative population. (c) 2013 Wolters

Abstract = {{This article explores Poisson's ratio, starting with the controversy
   concerning its magnitude and uniqueness in the context of the molecular
   and continuum hypotheses competing in the development of elasticity
   theory in the nineteenth century, moving on to its place in the
   development of materials science and engineering in the twentieth
   century, and concluding with its recent re-emergence as a universal
   metric for the mechanical performance of materials on any length scale.
   During these episodes France lost its scientific pre-eminence as
   paradigms switched from mathematical to observational, and accurate
   experiments became the prerequisite for scientific advance. The
   emergence of the engineering of metals followed, and subsequently the
   invention of composites-both somewhat separated from the discovery of
   quantum mechanics and crystallography, and illustrating the bifurcation
   of technology and science. Nowadays disciplines are reconnecting in the
   face of new scientific demands. During the past two centuries, though,
   the shape versus volume concept embedded in Poisson's ratio has remained
   invariant, but its application has exploded from its origins in
   describing the elastic response of solids and liquids, into areas such
   as materials with negative Poisson's ratio, brittleness, glass
   formation, and a re-evaluation of traditional materials. Moreover, the
   two contentious hypotheses have been reconciled in their complementarity
   within the hierarchical structure of materials and through computational
   modelling.}},

Abstract = {{This work describes the theoretical, numerical and experimental in-plane
   and out-of-plane elastic behavior of a class of anti-tetrachiral lattice
   structures with in-plane negative Poisson's ratios and anisotropic
   behavior. Closed form analytical solutions related to the uniaxial
   stiffness, in-plane Poisson's ratio and bounds for the transverse shear
   modulus are derived, and compared against homogenization-based finite
   element methods and experimental tests performed on rapid
   prototyping-made samples. The bench-marked models are then used to
   investigate the behaviors of the anisotropic negative Poisson's ratio
   structures against the geometry parameters defining the unit cell. The
   results show the existence of large variations in linear elastic
   constants and degree of anisotropy, which can be achieved by changing
   the lattice geometry parameters. The analysis presented in this work
   provides meaningful guidance to assist design anti-tetrachiral
   anisotropic lattices, which could serve as sandwich panel cores in
   aerospace applications. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{To establish implant longevity of hip prosthesis in orthopedics, a new
   approach was proposed to improve dramatically the wear resistance and to
   reduce the surface friction of the acetabular cup as a bearing material
   in the femoral head. To do so, ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene
   (UHMWPE) and hydroxyapatite (HA) composites with four amounts of HA
   content were prepared by a sol-gel process, and the four composites were
   hot-molded to make a composite with HA gradient content. When the
   resultant UHMWPE/HA agglomerates by the sol-gel method were molded in
   the narrow temperature range of 145-153 degrees C, the (110) planes with
   highest density of atoms in the PE crystal unit were oriented
   predominantly parallel to the resultant film surface. Such an unusual
   planar orientation contributed excellent wear resistance and low
   friction on the surface. Polarized light-scattering patterns, SEM
   images, and FTIR spectra of the specimens with such unusual planar
   orientation supported that the narrow molding temperature range achieves
   good dispersion of HA particles and high crystallinity of the UHMWPE
   matrix on the surface layer. Negative complex Poisson's ratio reduced
   from complex tensile and shear moduli was attributed to spongy-like
   tissue formation under crystallization of UHMWPE chains on the HA
   particle surface. The gradient composite molded maintained the
   spongy-like structure, which played an important role to avoid the
   cracking under bending stress.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To analyze the correlation between breastfeeding in the first
   hour of life with neonatal mortality rates.
   Methods: The present study used secondary data from 67 countries,
   obtained from the Demographic and Health Surveys. Initially, for data
   analysis, Spearman Correlation (95\% CI) and Kernel graphical analysis
   were employed, followed by a Negative Binomial Poisson regression model,
   adjusted for potential confounders.
   Results: Breastfeeding within the first hour of life was negatively
   correlated with neonatal mortality (Spearman's Rho = -0.245, p = 0.046),
   and this correlation was stronger among countries with more than 29
   neonatal deaths per 1000 newborns (Spearman's Rho = -0.327, p = 0.048).
   According to the statistical model, countries with the lowest
   breastfeeding tertiles had 24\% higher neonatal mortality rates (Rate
   ratio = 1.24, 95\% CI = 1.07-1.44, p < 0.05), even when adjusted for
   potential confounders.
   Conclusion: The protective effect of breastfeeding during the first hour
   of life on neonatal mortality in this ecological study is consistent
   with findings from previous observational studies, indicating the
   importance of adopting breastfeeding within the first hour as a routine
   neonatal care practice. (C) 2013 Sociedade Brasileira de Pediatria.

Abstract = {{This paper presents an innovative three-dimensional (3D) fabric
   structure for composite reinforcement. Different from most conventional
   3D fabric structures, the new structure displays a negative Poisson's
   ratio (NPR) effect under compression. Based on a manufacturing process
   developed by combining both non-weaving and knitting technologies, four
   NPR 3D fabric samples with different warp yarn diameters were first
   manufactured manually. Then, their Poisson's ratio (PR) values under
   compression along the fabric thickness direction were experimentally
   evaluated. A geometrical model was also proposed for the theoretical
   calculation of PR values of these fabrics and was compared with
   experimental data. The good agreements were obtained between the
   calculation and experiment. The results show that all the 3D fabrics
   display NPR effect under compression, which results in a unique feature
   that allows the structure to concentrate itself under the compressive
   load to better resist the load. This special feature makes this
   innovative 3D fabric structure very attractive for many potential
   applications such as automobile, aerospace, defense and sports
   equipment, where impact protection can be a highly desirable property.}},

Title = {{The relationships between housing quality and occupant health in Uganda}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL SCIENCE \& MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{81}},
Pages = {{115-122}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The Government of Uganda created in 2010 a strategic plan to invest in
   public health as part of its broader national development goals. The
   health plan recognizes housing and urbanization as a determinant of
   health, but has not yet formulated policy to address the relationship.
   This study can help guide health policy development as it relates to
   housing. It estimates relationships between housing quality and occupant
   health using ``count outcome{''} regression models. An economic model of
   optimal household labor allocation in poor countries provides the
   foundation for the regression modeling. The data used to estimate the
   regressions are a stratified random sample of 7096 households surveyed
   in the 2005-06 Uganda National Household Survey. They provide, among
   other things, detailed information on physical housing attributes as
   well as the health status of its occupants. Consistent with the economic
   model and other empirical work, the results show that exposure to
   burning of biomass for cooking has the largest adverse health effect.
   Different definitions of illness yield results consistent with
   expectations, and a separate specification test suggests that the
   findings are reasonably robust. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Background The incidence of non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSCs), including
   basal cell (BCC) or squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), is not well
   documented among HIV-positive (HIV+) individuals.
   Methods We identified 6560 HIV+ and 36 821 HIV(-)negative (HIV-)
   non-Hispanic white adults who were enrolled and followed up in Kaiser
   Permanente Northern California from 1996 to 2008. The first
   biopsy-proven NMSCs diagnosed during follow-up were identified from
   pathology records. Poisson models estimated rate ratios that compared
   HIV+ (overall and stratified by recent CD4 T-cell counts and serum HIV
   RNA levels) with HIV(-)subjects and were adjusted for age, sex, smoking
   history, obesity diagnosis history, and census-based household income.
   Sensitivity analyses were adjusted for outpatient visits (ie, a proxy
   for screening). All statistical tests were two-sided.
   Results The NMSC incidence rate was 1426 and 766 per 100 000
   person-years for HIV+ and HIV- individuals, respectively, which
   corresponds with an adjusted rate ratio of 2.1 (95\% confidence interval
   {[}CI] = 1.9 to 2.3). Similarly, the adjusted rate ratio for HIV+ vs
   HIV- subjects was 2.6 (95\% CI = 2.1 to 3.2) for SCCs, and it was 2.1
   (95\% CI = 1.8 to 2.3) for BCCs. There was a statistically significant
   trend of higher rate ratios with lower recent CD4 counts among HIV+
   subjects compared with HIV- subjects for SCCs (P-trend < .001).
   Adjustment for number of outpatient visits did not affect the results.
   Conclusion HIV+ subjects had a twofold higher incidence rate of NMSCs
   compared with HIV(-)subjects. SCCs but not BCCs were associated with
   immunodeficiency. J Natl Cancer Inst; 2013;105:350-360}},

Abstract = {{Spider silks possess nature's most exceptional mechanical properties,
   with unrivalled extensibility and high tensile strength. Unfortunately,
   our understanding of silks is limited because the complete elastic
   response has never been measured-leaving a stark lack of essential
   fundamental information. Using non-invasive, non-destructive Brillouin
   light scattering, we obtain the entire stiffness tensors (revealing
   negative Poisson's ratios), refractive indices, and longitudinal and
   transverse sound velocities for major and minor ampullate spider silks:
   Argiope aurantia, Latrodectus hesperus, Nephila clavipes, Peucetia
   viridans. These results completely quantify the linear elastic response
   for all possible deformation modes, information unobtainable with
   traditional stress-strain tests. For completeness, we apply the
   principles of Brillouin imaging to spatially map the elastic stiffnesses
   on a spider web without deforming or disrupting the web in a
   non-invasive, non-contact measurement, finding variation among discrete
   fibres, junctions and glue spots. Finally, we provide the stiffness
   changes that occur with supercontraction.}},

Abstract = {{As high-temperature structural materials, L1(2) intermetallic compounds
   have attracted the strong interest from both fundamental and industrial
   aspects. Understanding of elastic property is a basis for the complete
   investigations of mechanical behavior of L1(2) alloys. In an effort to
   explore the electronic origin of elastic properties of L1(2)
   intermetallics, we have performed a systematic study on elastic
   constants for single crystals, and Young's modulus, shear modulus, bulk
   modulus and Poisson's ratio for poly-crystals of 22 known Al3X and
   X3Al-type (X= transition or main group metal) intermetallics using the
   ab initio calculations. Based on the calculations of elastic constants
   and extreme (both positive and negative) Poisson's ratios, we found a
   pronounced correlation between the extreme Poisson's ratio and the
   elastic anisotropy, i.e., approximate 40\% of the investigated L1(2)
   intermetallics exhibit intrinsic auxetic behavior. Furthermore, based on
   the distribution of bonding charge densities, we revealed that the
   ductility and extreme Poisson's ratios were attributable to the
   directionality of bonds of these alloys. Our findings provide a new
   method to predict mechanical behavior of intermetallics. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Dependence of relaxor behavior of incompletely filled tetragonal

   (CaxBa1-xNb2O6, CBN-x) on its composition was investigated by varying
   Ca/Ba ratio (0.18 <= x <= 0.35) and studying its thermal and elastic
   properties. Recently, we have reported the relaxor behavior CBN-28 with
   the evidence of the existence of the Burns temperature T-B, and the
   intermediate characteristic temperature T{*} {[}Pandey et al., Phys.
   Rev. B 84, 174102 (2011)]. In this work, we show that the dynamics of
   polar nanoregions (and hence the relaxor behavior) strongly varies with
   the Ca/Ba ratio. Evidence is found for a more pronounced relaxor
   behavior with increasing x. The Curie temperature and the Burns
   temperature are also very sensitive to the composition, whereas the
   characteristic temperature T{*} appears unaffected from the Ca/Ba ratio.
   The bonding interaction has been explained on the basis of bulk modulus,
   Poisson's ratio, and deviation from Cauchy relations. Presented results
   open the perspective to understand the variation of relaxor behavior of
   CBN-x (similar to 0.18 <= x <= similar to 0.35) above Curie temperature.

   (382/421) among HIV-positive men and 60.9\% (596/978) among HIV-negative
   men (PRR 1.49, 95\% CI 1.40 to 1.58). HIV-positive men had a
   significantly higher risk of infection with three or more HR-HPV
   genotypes (PRR = 5.76, 95\% CI 4.27 to 7.79). Among HIV-positive men,
   high-risk sexual behaviours were not associated with increased HR-HPV
   prevalence. Among HIV-negative men, HR-HPV prevalence was associated
   with self-reported genital warts (adjPRR 1.57, 95\% CI 1.07 to 2.31).
   Among all men (both HIV negative and HIV positive), HR-HPV prevalence
   was associated with more than 10 lifetime sexual partners (adjPRR 1.30,
   95\% CI 1.01 to 1.66), consistent condom use (adjPRR 1.31, 95\% CI 1.08
   to 1.60) and HIV infection (adjPRR 1.80, 95\% CI 1.60 to 2.02). HR-HPV
   prevalence was lower among men who reported no sexual partners during
   the past year (adjPRR 0.47, 95\% CI 0.23 to 0.94).
   Conclusion The burden of HR-HPV infection is high among heterosexual men
   in sub-Saharan Africa and most pronounced among the HIV-infected
   individuals.}},

Abstract = {{This study is concerned with the viscoelastic behavior of wood. The time
   dependency of the orthotropic compliance for beech wood is investigated
   by performing tensile (Te) and compressive (Co) creep experiments in all
   wood's orthotropic directions. Time evolution of the creep strain in the
   axial and lateral directions is recorded using the digital image
   correlation technique, to determine the time dependent Young's moduli
   and the Poisson's ratios needed for the calculation of the diagonal and
   nondiagonal elements of the viscoelastic compliance matrix. The results
   of this study demonstrate the viscoelastic character of wood, revealing
   the significant time influence on the mechanical behavior. The unequal
   time dependency of the Young's moduli and the Poisson's ratios obtained
   for the individual directions highlights the orthotropic nature of the
   viscoelastic compliance. Differences between the time dependent behavior
   for the compliance determined in Te and Co further indicate that the
   viscoelastic behavior of wood depends on the loading modality. Supported
   by the unequal evolution of the Te and Co creep strain, the results
   suggest that the time dependent stress-strain relationship of wood is
   essentially different in Te and Co. Poisson's ratio values, which are
   shown to increase with time in Te and decrease in Co, demonstrated this
   fact. The substantially different time dependency of the nondiagonal
   elements of the compliance matrix further emphasizes the complexity of
   the viscoelastic character of wood. Visualized by the time evolution of
   the corresponding nondiagonal elements ratio, differences between the Te
   and Co viscoelastic behavior become particularly visible in the time
   dependency of the orthotropic compliance asymmetry. (C) 2013 The Society

Abstract = {{The structural, elastic, phonon, thermal and electronic properties of
   MnMe are investigated by the first-principles calculations. The
   predicted phase stability trends due to structural energy differences
   are consistent with those observed experimentally. The obtained negative
   shear modulus (C = (C-11 - C-12)/2) of paramagnetic B2 (PM-B2) phases
   triggers the cubic to tetragonal distortion. The calculated phonon
   dispersions without negative frequency indicate that antiferromagnetic
   L1(0) (AFM-L1(0)) together with paramagnetic L1(0) (PM-L1(0)) structures
   are dynamically stable, and the PM-L1(0) -> AFM-L1(0) transition is
   caused by magnetism rather than lattice dynamics. Debye temperatures,
   anisotropy and Poisson's ratios are also first evaluated. The calculated
   results show that the collinear antiferromagnetic states (CuAu-I type)
   are mechanically and dynamically stable, thus are the low temperature
   phases. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the suitability of auxetic materials for
   load-bearing circular plates. This herein shown that the optimal
   Poisson's ratio for minimizing the bending stresses is strongly
   dependent on the final deformed shape, load distribution, and the type
   of edge supports. Specifically, the use of auxetic material for circular
   plates is recommended when (a) the plate is bent into a spherical or
   spherical-like cap, (b) a point load is applied to the center of the
   plate regardless of the edge conditions, and (c) a uniform load is
   applied on a simply-supported plate. However, auxetic materials are
   disadvantaged when a flat plate is to be bent into a saddle-like shell.
   The optimal Poisson's ratios concept recommended in this paper is useful
   for providing an added design consideration. In most cases, the use of
   auxetic materials for laterally loaded circular plates is more
   advantageous compared to the use of materials with conventional
   Poisson's ratio, with other factors fixed. This is achieved through
   materials-based stress redistribution in addition to the common
   practices of dimensioning-based stress redistribution and materials
   strengthening.}},

Abstract = {{Materials presenting a negative Poisson's ratio (auxetics) have drawn
   attention for the past two decades, especially in the field of
   lightweight composite structures and cellular media. Studies have shown
   that auxeticity may result in higher shear modulus, indentation
   toughness and acoustic damping. In this work, three auxetic periodic
   microstructures based on 2D geometries are considered for being used as
   sandwich-core materials. Elastic moduli are computed for each
   microstructure by using finite elements combined with periodic
   homogenization technique. Anisotropy of elastic properties is
   investigated in and out-of-plane. Comparison is made between auxetics
   and the classical honeycomb cell. A new 3D auxetic lattice is proposed
   for volumic applications. Cylindrical and spherical elastic indentation
   tests are simulated in order to conclude on the applicability of such
   materials to structures. Proof is made that under certain conditions,
   auxetics can be competitive with honeycomb cells in terms of indentation
   strength. Their relatively soft response in tension can be compensated,
   in some situations, by high shear moduli.}},

   structure is introduced, where the fold pattern provides a negative
   Poisson's ratio for in-plane deformations and a positive Poisson's ratio
   for out-of-plane bending. Second, a cellular metamaterial is described
   based on a stacking of individual folded layers, where the folding
   kinematics are compatible between layers. Additional freedom in the
   design of the metamaterial can be achieved by varying the fold pattern

Title = {{Phase stability and elastic properties of Cr-V alloys}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{25}},

Abstract = {{V is the only element in the periodic table that forms a complete solid
   solution with Cr and thus is particularly important in alloying strategy
   to ductilize Cr. This study combines first-principles density functional
   theory calculations and experiments to investigate the phase stability
   and elastic properties of Cr-V binary alloys. The cluster expansion
   study reveals the formation of various ordered compounds at low
   temperatures that were not previously known. These compounds become
   unstable due to the configurational entropy of bcc solid solution as the
   temperature is increased. The elastic constants of ordered and
   disordered compounds are calculated at both T = 0 K and finite
   temperatures. The overall trends in elastic properties are in agreement
   with measurements using the resonant ultrasound spectroscopy method. The
   calculations predict that addition of V to Cr decreases both the bulk
   modulus and the shear modulus, and enhances the Poisson's ratio, in
   agreement with experiments. Decrease in the bulk modulus is correlated
   to decrease in the valence electron density and increase in the lattice
   constant. An enhanced Poisson's ratio for bcc Cr-V alloys (compared to
   pure Cr) is associated with an increased density of states at the Fermi
   level. Furthermore, the difference charge density in the bonding region
   in the (110) slip plane is highest for pure Cr and decreases gradually
   as V is added. The present calculation also predicts a negative Cauchy
   pressure for pure Cr, and it becomes positive upon alloying with V. The
   intrinsic ductilizing effect from V may contribute, at least partially,
   to the experimentally observed ductilizing phenomenon in the literature.}},

Title = {{On anisotropic versions of three-dimensional pentamode metamaterials}},
Journal = {{NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{FEB 18}},
Abstract = {{Pentamode materials are artificial solids with elastic properties that
   approximate those of isotropic liquids. The corresponding
   three-dimensional mechanical metamaterials or `meta-liquids' have
   recently been fabricated. In contrast to normal liquids, anisotropic
   meta-liquids are also possible-a prerequisite for realizing many of the
   envisioned transformation-elastodynamics architectures. Here, we study
   several possibilities theoretically for introducing intentional
   anisotropy into three-dimensional pentamode metamaterials. In static
   continuum mechanics, the transition from anti-auxetic pentamode
   materials to auxetics is possible. Near this transition, in the dynamic
   case, approximately uniaxial versions of pentamode metamaterials deliver
   anisotropic longitudinal-wave phase velocities different by nearly a
   factor of 10 for realistically accessible microstructure parameters.}},

Abstract = {{We used cross-sectional data on 2,660 black and 2,611 Mexican-American
   adult participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination
   Survey (1999-2006) to investigate the association between
   metropolitan-level racial/ethnic residential segregation and obesity and
   to determine whether it was mediated by the neighborhood socioeconomic
   environment. Residential segregation was measured using the black and
   Hispanic isolation indices. Neighborhood poverty and negative income
   incongruity were assessed as mediators. Multilevel Poisson regression
   with robust variance estimates was used to estimate prevalence ratios.
   There was no relationship between segregation and obesity among men.
   Among black women, in age-, nativity-, and metropolitan
   demographic-adjusted models, high segregation was associated with a 1.29
   (95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.00, 1.65) times higher obesity
   prevalence than was low segregation; medium segregation was associated
   with a 1.35 (95\% CI: 1.07, 1.70) times higher obesity prevalence.
   Mexican-American women living in high versus low segregation areas had a
   significantly lower obesity prevalence (prevalence ratio, 0.54; 95\% CI:
   0.33, 0.90), but there was no difference between those living in medium
   versus low segregation areas. These associations were not mediated by
   neighborhood poverty or negative income incongruity. These findings
   suggest variability in the interrelationships between residential
   segregation and obesity for black and Mexican-American women.}},

Title = {{The elasticity anisotropy in the basal atomic planes of Mg(OH)(2) and

   sub-lattice}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{550}},

Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{Within the framework of the Hook's generalized law and using the
   experimental data for characteristic crystallographic parameters and
   stiffness constants available from literature, the individual elastic
   properties of constituent octahedral layers and interlayers of the (0 0
   0 1) atomic planes in the Mg(OH)(2) and Ca(OH)(2) crystal lattices are
   theoretically quantified from intermolecular interaction energy. It is
   shown that, under uniaxial type of deformation applied along the (0 0 0
   1) basal planes, in the ``load-deformation response'' the octahedral
   layers and interlayers exhibit the positive and negative Poisson's
   ratio, respectively. Manifestation of such a type strong elastic
   anisotropy in the basal atomic planes and auxetic elastic behavior of
   the hydrogen sub-lattice (interlayers) upon applied uniaxial load result
   from a large difference in the strength of bonding within octahedral
   layers and interlayers. The intermolecular binding energy is contributed
   both by ``hydroxyl-hydroxyl'' and ``metal atom-hydroxyl'' dispersion
   interactions, whereas the Young's modulus in the direction parallel to a
   (0 0 0 1) plane is practically contributed only by the former
   interaction. For this Young's modulus, an approximate analytical
   expression is derived, which is convenient for a physical analysis and
   presumably is also applicable to other metal hydroxides with brucite
   structure. The proposed theoretical model may be extended to hydrostatic
   type loading of metal hydroxides for analysis of the hydrogen associated
   bonding under high-pressure conditions. The approach applied in this
   study to estimate the dispersive energy may be useful in the evaluation
   of the physisorption energy for system ``H-2-metal hydroxide'' in terms
   of the potential application of metal hydroxides as hydrogen storage
   materials. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the significant luminescent properties of ZnS and the half
   metallic features of Cr doped ZnS (Zn0.75Cr0.25S), many researches have
   been done to make possible the use of these materials in optical and
   spintronic devices. The environmental conditions, such as, high pressure
   and high temperature, are crucial for the device service, however, it is
   difficult to exploit this issue from the experimental aspect. Therefore,
   spin-polarized first-principle calculations were performed to study the
   structural stability, band structure and magnetic properties of
   zincblende ZnS and Zn0.75Cr0.25S under pressure. It is shown that ZnS
   can exist stably under pressure up to 10 GPa, while Zn0.75Cr0.25S
   becomes unstable under a pressure of 5GPa or so. The bulk modulus (B-H),
   Poisson ratio (v) and anisotropic parameter (A) of ZnS and Zn0.75Cr0.25S
   increase with pressure, but the shear modulus (G(H)) decreases. B-H and
   G(H) of Zn0.75Cr0.25S are smaller than those of ZnS, while v and A of
   Zn0.75Cr0.25S are larger than those of ZnS. Both ZnS and Zn0.75Cr0.25S
   behave in a ductile manner, while Zn0.75Cr0.25S is more anisotropic and
   is easier to induce deformation than ZnS. As for ZnS, the direct band
   structure is kept but the band gap increases gradually with the
   pressure. As for Zn0.75Cr0.25S, the half metallic features are
   maintained up to a pressure of 10 GPa, but both the band gap for
   minority spin and the half metallic band gap have the largest values
   under 6 Pa. The spin exchange splitting energy Delta(x)(d) and
   Delta(x)(pd) decrease with the increase of pressure. The negative values
   of Delta(x)(pd) under pressure imply that the effective potential (E-ep)
   of the minority spin is more attractive than that of majority spin. (C)

Title = {{The Demography of Medical Malpractice Suits against Radiologists}},
Journal = {{RADIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{266}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{539-547}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: To delimit demographic characteristics of malpractice claims
   against radiologists in the United States by sex and location and to
   note the varying percentages of favorable outcomes and award amounts to
   plaintiffs by state.
   Materials and Methods: This HIPAA-compliant study was institutional
   review board-approved. All radiologists enrolled in One-Call Medical, a
   specialized preferred provider organization, go through an initial and
   recurrent credentialing process, which records state of residence, age,
   sex, and malpractice history. For each radiologist, a record of
   unfavorable outcomes and payment awards is derived from narratives
   provided by the National Practitioner's Data Bank. All other suits are
   self-reported. Rates of malpractice claims per state were calculated
   with a zero-inflated negative binomial regression model allowing for
   differences in years at risk. Poisson regression was used to calculate
   the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for any payment as a result of a
   malpractice claim compared with the average of all 36 states, adjusted
   for sex. To determine the association of age, sex, and state with amount
   of payment, we used a general linear model assuming a gamma family
   distribution.
   Results: In August 2010, 8401 radiologists from 47 states composed
   One-Call Medical's panel. During their careers, 30.9\% (2600 of 8401)
   had been the subject of at least one malpractice claim. Median payment
   awards varied by 14-fold from Maine (\$350 000) to Colorado (\$24 105),
   while mean payments varied ninefold from Oregon (\$715 707) to Nebraska
   (\$74 373). Adjusted for age and state, radiologists in Alabama had the
   lowest rate of malpractice suits per 100 practice-years for men (0.95;
   95\% confidence interval {[}CI]; 0.73, 1.28) and women (0.70; 95\% CI:
   0.52, 0.96) compared with those in New York, who had the highest rate of
   suits for men (5.65; 95\% CI: 5.09, 6.26) and women (4.13; 95\% CI:
   3.54, 4.80). Overall, male radiologists had a higher rate of being sued
   than did their female counterparts (IRR = 1.37; 95\% CI: 1.20, 1.56).
   Conclusion: The likelihood of a radiologist being the defendant in at
   least one suit is 50\% by age 60, yet the difference in frequency and
   average number of suits accrued varies widely by state of residence and
   sex. Among resolved suits, the percentage of cases in which payment was
   made to the plaintiff differs markedly by state, as do median and mean
   award amount. Men are more likely than women to be sued during the
   course of their careers. (C)RSNA, 2012}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new kind of hierarchical tube with a negative Poisson's
   ratio (NPR) is proposed. The first level tube is constructed by rolling
   up an auxetic hexagonal honeycomb. Then, the second level tube is
   produced by substituting the arm of the auxetic sheet with the first
   level tube and rolling it up. The Nth (N >= 1) level tube can be built
   recursively. Based on the Euler beam theory, the equivalent elastic
   parameters of the NPR hierarchical tubes under small deformations are
   derived. Under longitudinal axial tension, instead of shrinking, all
   levels of the NPR hierarchical tubes expand in the transverse direction.
   Using these kinds of auxetic tubes as reinforced fibers in composite
   materials would result in a higher resistance to fiber pullout. Thus,
   this paper provides a new strategy for the design of fiber reinforced
   hierarchical bio-inspired composites with a superior pull-out mechanism,
   strength and toughness. An application with super carbon nanotubes
   concludes the paper.}},

Abstract = {{Object of the paper is to show the exact analytical solutions for the
   elastic response of a solid circular cylinder composed by the assembly
   of a central core and n surrounding hollow phases, all made of different
   homogeneous elastic materials, under de Saint Venant load conditions,
   finally obtaining for the whole object an equivalent one-dimensional
   homogenized beam model. In particular, the exact solution for the case
   of combined shear and bending is new for this type of heterogeneous
   compound materials, and hence it can turn useful for the comparison with
   other classical simplified solutions widely adopted in practical
   engineering problems.
   The analytical procedure, producing overall elastic relationships
   between generalized stresses and strains for Functionally Graded
   Material Cylinders (FGMCs) in cases of axial force, torque, bending and
   shear, leads to register possible large increases of selected
   homogenized stiffness coefficients as effect of mutual interactions
   among the constituents mediated by their different Poisson ratios. The
   special case of negative Poisson ratios is then considered, envisaging
   the possibility of exploiting their relevant effects on the overall
   stiffness of the heterogeneous media in the design of new materials,
   starting from the particular microstructures or work processes. At the
   end, some example applications and sensitivity analyses are shown for
   two-phase cylinders. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS \& DATA ANALYSIS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{58}},
Pages = {{257-264}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Poisson regression is important in the analysis of longitudinal count
   data. However, the variance of responses is often much greater than the
   sample mean in practice, contradicting the Poisson model. To solve this
   overdispersion problem, negative binomial regression model was
   introduced by earlier researchers by adding another error term to the
   Poisson model. By default, the parameter of the additional error term,
   called the overdispersion parameter, is constant during the study
   period, but we find that it may fail in the research of epilepsy. Thus a
   formal likelihood ratio test is proposed and the test conforms that a
   time-dependent overdispersion phenomenon does exist. Then a mixed effect
   negative binomial model is proposed to take into account the
   time-dependent overdispersion, producing significantly better regression
   results compared with most earlier models. The proposed test and
   regression approach can easily be done by SAS PROC NLMIXED. The
   extensive simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the performance
   of the methods proposed. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Community-level risk factors for notifiable gastrointestinal illness in
   the Northwest Territories, Canada, 1991-2008}},
Journal = {{BMC PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{JAN 22}},
Abstract = {{Background: Enteric pathogens are an important cause of illness,
   however, little is known about their community-level risk factors (e.
   g., socioeconomic, cultural and physical environmental conditions) in
   the Northwest Territories (NWT) of Canada. The objective of this study
   was to undertake ecological (group-level) analyses by combining two
   existing data sources to examine potential community-level risk factors
   for campylobacteriosis, giardiasis and salmonellosis, which are three
   notifiable (mandatory reporting to public health authorities at the time
   of diagnosis) enteric infections.
   Methods: The rate of campylobacteriosis was modeled using a Poisson
   distribution while rates of giardiasis and salmonellosis were modeled
   using a Negative Binomial distribution. Rate ratios (the ratio of the
   incidence of disease in the exposed group to the incidence of disease in
   the non-exposed group) were estimated for infections by the three major
   pathogens with potential community-level risk factors.
   Results: Significant (p <= 0.05) associations varied by etiology. There
   was increased risk of infection with Salmonella for communities with
   higher proportions of `households in core need' (unsuitable, inadequate,
   and/or unaffordable housing) up to 42\% after which the rate started to
   decrease with increasing core need. The risk of giardiasis was
   significantly higher both with increased `internal mobility' (population
   moving between communities), and also where the community's primary
   health facility was a health center rather than a full-service hospital.
   Communities with higher health expenditures had a significantly
   decreased risk of giardiasis. Results of modeling that focused on each
   of Giardia and Salmonella infections separately supported and expanded
   upon previous research outcomes that suggested health disparities are
   often associated with socioeconomic status, geographical and social
   mobility, as well as access to health care (e. g. facilities, services
   and professionals). In the campylobacteriosis model, a negative
   association was found between food prices in communities and risk of
   infection. There was also a significant interaction between trapping and
   consumption of traditional foods in communities. Higher rates of
   community participation in both activities appeared to have a protective
   effect against campylobacteriosis.
   Conclusions: These results raise very interesting questions about the
   role that traditional activities might play in infectious enteric
   disease incidence in the NWT, but should be interpreted with caution,
   recognizing database limitations in collection of case data and risk
   factor information (e. g. missing data). Given the cultural,
   socioeconomic, and nutritional benefits associated with traditional food
   practices, targeted community-based collaborative research is necessary
   to more fully investigate the statistical correlations identified in
   this exploratory research. This study demonstrates the value of
   examining the role of social determinants in the transmission and risk
   of infectious diseases.}},

Abstract = {{We systematically analyse the mechanical deformation behaviour, in

   periodic tessellations of the plane. For frameworks with more than one
   deformation mode, crystallographic symmetry constraints or minimization
   of an angular vertex energy functional are used to lift this ambiguity.
   Our analysis allows for systematic searches for auxetic mechanisms in
   archives of tessellations; applied to the class of one- or two-uniform
   tessellations by regular or star polygons, we find two auxetic
   structures of hexagonal symmetry and demonstrate that several other
   tessellations become auxetic when retaining symmetries during the
   deformation, in some cases with large negative Poisson ratios nu < -1
   for a specific lattice direction. We often find a transition to negative
   Poisson ratios at finite deformations for several tessellations, even if
   the undeformed tessellation is infinitesimally non-auxetic. Our
   numerical scheme is based on a solution of the quadratic equations
   enforcing constant edge lengths by a Newton method, with periodicity
   enforced by boundary conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic yarn is designed by ourselves by wrap-core structure, which has
   special physical properties and geometrical structure different from
   traditional yarn. The wrap-core auxetic yarn will expand transversely
   under tension. Therefore, the tensile tests were conducted to analyze
   effects of structural parameters and performance on lateral deformation
   of yarn. The experimental results show that yarn with negative Poisson's
   ratio as low as -4.31 is produced successfully. Moreover, effects of
   structure and performance, including the wrap angle, the diameter ratio,
   the tension modulus of the wrap yarn and the twist of the core yarn, on
   poisson's ratio of yarn are analyzed. It is found that the negative
   Poisson's ratio effect becomes more observable with the higher diameter
   ratio or lower wrap angle, and it becomes much more observable when the
   twist degree of the core yarn is higher or the wrap yarn's modulus is
   lower.}},

Title = {{Spatial Effects on Zone-Level Collision Prediction Models}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2013}},

Pages = {{50-59}},
Abstract = {{A recent study developed a set of zone-level negative binomial collision
   prediction models to investigate the relationship between various
   transportation and sociodemographic characteristics and overall roadway
   safety. The developed models used data from Metro Vancouver, British
   Columbia, Canada, and considered the effect of Poisson variations and
   heterogeneity (extra variation) on collision occurrence. This study aims
   to evaluate spatial effects on the occurrence of collisions and to check
   whether the inclusion of spatial variables can improve the goodness of
   fit and inference capability of those previously developed prediction
   models. Transit-reliant and application-based collision prediction
   models with spatial correlations were developed by using the WinBUGS
   software. The convergence of the developed models was tested by trace
   plots of the parameter estimated, the Brooks-Gelman-Rubin statistics,
   and ratios of Monte Carlo errors relative to the standard deviations of
   the estimates. The results showed that incorporation of the spatial
   correlations affected the parameter estimates, the values of dispersion
   parameters and intercepts, and also the t-statistics. The effect of the
   main exposure variable on all of the models for total, severe, and
   property-damage-only collisions was found to be smaller under spatial
   models. The smaller values of the exponents of the main exposure
   variable confirmed the assumption that spatial effects need to be
   considered in collision prediction models to mitigate any potential bias
   associated with model misspecification.}},

Abstract = {{Multiplexed imaging is a powerful mechanism for achieving high
   signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the presence of signal-independent
   additive noise. However, for imaging in presence of only
   signal-dependent shot noise, multiplexing has been shown to
   significantly degrade SNR. Hence, multiplexing to increase SNR in
   presence of Poisson noise is normally thought to be infeasible. In this
   paper, we present an exception to this view by demonstrating
   multiplexing advantage when the scene parameters are non-negative valued
   and are observed through a low-rate Poisson channel.}},

Abstract = {{Theoretical investigations were performed to study on alloying
   stability, and electronic structure of (AlCu3, AlCu2Zr and AlZr3). The
   results show that the lattice parameters obtained after full relaxation
   of crystalline cells are consistent with experimental data, and these
   intermetallics have a strong alloying ability and structural stability
   due to the negative formation energies and the cohesive energies. The
   further analysis find out that single-crystal elastic constants at
   zero-pressure satisfy the requirement of mechanical stability for cubic
   crystals. The calculations on Poisson's ratio show that AlCu3 is much
   more anisotropic than the other two intermetallics. In addition,
   calculations on densities of states indicates that the valence bonds of
   these intermetallics are attributed to the valence electrons of Cu 3d
   states for AlCu3, Cu 3d and Zr 4d states for AlCu2Zr, and Al 3s, Zr 5s
   and 4d states for AlZr3, respectively; in particular, the electronic

Abstract = {{This paper presents results from shock tube experiments on the
   transmitted overpressure through multiple layers of ballistic fabrics
   backed by various foam based flexible blunt trauma pads. The results
   corroborate previous reports that multiple layers of ballistic
   protection fabrics alone are not effective in reducing the occurrence of
   shock/blast wave injury. On the contrary, multiple layers of fabric and
   flexible laminates (Twaron T717, Twaron UD41 and Spectra Shield SA-1211)
   amplified the transmitted shock wave pressure. Moreover, this
   amplification in the transmitted peak pressure increased further when
   more plies were added. Incorporating foam based flexible blunt trauma
   pads behind the Twaron fabric resulted in mixed outcomes on the
   transmitted shock wave depending on the makeup of the blunt trauma pads.
   Adding pads comprising open cell polyurethane foams resulted in further
   and significant amplification of the recorded peak pressure. Attempts
   were made to reduce the pressure amplification by infusing the foams
   with shear thickening fluid. Although successful in reducing the peak
   pressure compared to a system of fabric backed by neat foam padding, the
   transmitted peak pressure was still slightly higher or at best equal to
   a system of fabrics without any padding. It was also found that padding
   made of auxetic foams fared better than conventional foams as they did
   not give rise to the large amplification in peak pressures.}},

Abstract = {{Common materials have Poisson's ratio values ranging from 0.0 to 0.5.
   Auxetic materials exhibit negative Poisson's ratio. They expand
   laterally when stretched longitudinally and contract laterally when
   compressed. In recent years the use of textile technology to fabricate
   auxetic materials has attracted more and more attention. It is reflected
   in the extent of available research work exploring the auxetic potential
   of various textile structures and subsequent increase in the number of
   research papers published. Generally there are two approaches to
   producing auxetic textiles. The first one includes the use of auxetic
   fibers to produce an auxetic textile structure, whereas the other
   utilizes conventional fibres to produce a textile structure with auxetic
   properties. This review deals with auxetic materials in general and in
   the specific context of auxetic polymers, auxetic fibers, and auxetic
   textile structures made from conventional fibers and knitted structures
   with auxetic potential.}},

Abstract = {{The elastic properties of silica phases are reviewed. Available
   monocrystal data for crystalline SiO2 polymorphs (low-quartz,
   high-quartz, low-cristobalite, high-cristobalite, stishovite) are
   collected from the literature, and effective elastic constants (Young's
   moduli, shear moduli, bulk moduli and Poisson ratios) are calculated
   from these using Voigt-Reuss-Hill averaging. Both experimental data and
   simulation results are taken into account. A table of room temperature
   elastic constants for crystalline silica polymorphs and silica glass is
   given that lists the recommended current ``state-of-the-art{''} values.
   All data are consistent with the well-known auxetic behavior of
   cristobalite at room temperature, and high-temperature simulation data
   published for cristobalite confirm aztxetic behavior for all
   temperatures from room temperature up to more than 1500 degrees C. The
   calculations of this paper show that also quartz can be auxetic, but
   only in a very limited temperature range around the low-to-high-quartz
   transition temperature (420 - 577 degrees C). Experimental measurements
   of elastic properties of tridymite and cristobalite, including

   Longitudinal Evaluation of Observational Profiles of Adverse events
   Related to Drugs (LEOPARD) methods were developed specifically for this
   task. LGPS applies Bayesian shrinkage to an estimated incidence rate
   ratio, and LEOPARD aims to detect and discard associations due to
   protopathic bias. The operating characteristics of these methods still
   need to be determined.
   Objective Establish the operating characteristics of LGPS and LEOPARD
   for large scale observational analysis in drug safety.
   Research Design We empirically evaluated LGPS and LEOPARD in five real
   observational healthcare databases and six simulated datasets. We
   retrospectively studied the predictive accuracy of the methods when
   applied to a collection of 165 positive control and 234 negative control
   drug-outcome pairs across four outcomes: acute liver injury, acute
   myocardial infarction, acute kidney injury, and upper gastrointestinal
   bleeding.
   Results In contrast to earlier findings, we found that LGPS and LEOPARD
   provide weak discrimination between positive and negative controls,
   although the use of LEOPARD does lead to higher performance in this
   respect. Furthermore, the methods produce biased estimates and
   confidence intervals that have poor coverage properties.
   Conclusions For the four outcomes we examined, LGPS and LEOPARD may not
   be the designs of choice for risk identification.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the large compressive deformation of low-density polymer
   foam is simulated by modeling a regular dodecahedron cell unit. The
   effects of strut thickness, cell size, Young's modulus and Poisson's
   ratio on the compressive mechanical behavior of foam are investigated.
   By the use of a factorial design, The results indicate that the strut
   thickness has the greatest effect on the maximum reaction force with
   positive non-linearity. Cell size ranks second in negative non-linear
   effect on the response while Young's modulus ranks third in positive
   linear effects. Moreover, the effect of the Poisson's ratio plays only a
   small role on the response. This study demonstrates that ideally, cell
   modeling with the properties of flexible open-cell foam material,
   followed by FE simulation, is an effective approach to understanding the
   mechanical behavior of foam during moulding process.}},

Abstract = {{Study Objectives: (1) To describe the incidence rate of motor vehicle
   crashes (MVCs) in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA); and (2)
   to investigate MVC risk factors in OSA patients.
   Methods: A retrospective case-series observational study was conducted
   using data from the West Australian Sleep Health Study at a tertiary
   hospital-based sleep clinic. Participants were patients (N = 2,673)
   referred for assessment of suspected sleep disordered breathing.
   Questionnaire data were collected including age, sex, years of driving,
   near-misses and MVCs, sleepiness, and consumption of alcohol and
   caffeinated drinks. Overnight laboratory-based polysomnography was
   performed using standard methodology. 1 Poisson univariate and negative
   binomial multivariable regression models were used to investigate
   associations between risk factors and MVC and nearmiss risk in patients
   with untreated OSA.
   Results: In patients with untreated OSA, the crash rate was 0.06
   MVC/person-year compared with the general community crash rate of 0.02
   MVC/person-year. The rate ratio comparing very sleepy men with normal
   men was 4.68 (95\% CI 3.07, 7.14) for near-misses and 1.27 (95\% CI
   1.00, 1.61) for crashes, after adjusting for confounders. In women there
   was a significant association with sleepiness score (p = 0.02) but no
   dose effect across quartiles.
   Conclusions: Untreated OSA is associated with an increased risk of
   near-misses in men and women and an increased risk of MVCs in very
   sleepy men. There is a strong association between excessive daytime
   sleepiness and increased report of near-misses. Our data support the
   observation that it is those patients with increased sleepiness
   regardless of OSA severity who are most at risk.}},

Journal = {{ADVANCES IN MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{2013}},
Abstract = {{An auxetic polyurethane (PU) scaffold was prepared to investigate
   chondrocyte proliferation under compressive stimulation for cartilage
   regeneration. To give a negative Poisson's ratio to the PU scaffold,
   volumetric compression with a 3:1 ratio was applied during heat
   treatment. For the control PU scaffold, the Poisson's ratio was 0.9 +/-
   0.25 with elongation at 20\% of the strain range. Poisson's ratio for
   experimental specimens was approximately -0.4 +/- 0.12 under the same
   conditions. In cell proliferation tests, cells were cultivated within
   the prepared scaffold under compression with a 20\% strain range. With a
   20\% strain range elongation, the compressive load was approximately 0.3
   N. The experimental group showed a 1.3 times higher cellular
   proliferation rate than that of the control group after 3 days in
   culture. At day 5 of culture, however, the rate of proliferation of the
   control group increased so that there was no significant difference
   between groups. However, collagen content (produced by the cells) in the
   cell-proliferated medium was 1.5 times higher in the experimental group
   after 5 days in culture. This may have been due to the effectiveness of
   the auxetic structure of the scaffold. An isotropic compressive load was
   transmitted to the cells due to the negative Poisson ratio of the
   scaffold.}},

Title = {{Ballistic Resistance of Honeycomb Sandwich Panels under In-Plane
   High-Velocity Impact}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC WORLD JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Abstract = {{The dynamic responses of honeycomb sandwich panels (HSPs) subjected to
   in-plane projectile impact were studied by means of explicit nonlinear
   finite element simulations using LS-DYNA. The HSPs consisted of two
   identical aluminum alloy face-sheets and an aluminum honeycomb core
   featuring three types of unit cell configurations (regular,
   rectangular-shaped, and reentrant hexagons). The ballistic resistances
   of HSPs with the three core configurations were first analyzed. It was
   found that the HSP with the reentrant auxetic honeycomb core has the
   best ballistic resistance, due to the negative Poisson's ratio effect of
   the core. Parametric studies were then carried out to clarify the
   influences of both macroscopic (face-sheet and core thicknesses, core
   relative density) and mesoscopic (unit cell angle and size) parameters
   on the ballistic responses of the auxetic HSPs. Numerical results show
   that the perforation resistant capabilities of the auxetic HSPs increase
   as the values of the macroscopic parameters increase. However, the
   mesoscopic parameters show nonmonotonic effects on the panels' ballistic
   capacities. The empirical equations for projectile residual velocities
   were formulated in terms of impact velocity and the structural
   parameters. It was also found that the blunter projectiles result in
   higher ballistic limits of the auxetic HSPs.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper effect of the orientation of the main crystallographic
   axes on the piezoelectric anisotropy and hydrostatic parameters of 2-2
   parallel-connected single crystal (SC) / auxetic polymer composites is
   analysed. SCs are chosen among the perovskite-type relaxor-ferroelectric
   solid solutions of (1 - x)Pb(Zn1/3Nb2/3)O-3-xPbTiO(3) and
   xPb(In1/2Nb1/2)O-3-yPb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O-3-(1 - x - y)PbTiO3. The SC layers
   in a composite sample are poled along the perovskite unit-cell {[} 011]
   direction and characterised by mm2 symmetry. The orientation of the main
   crystallographic axes in the SC layer is observed to strongly influence
   the effective piezoelectric coefficients d(3j){*}, g(3j){*}, squared
   figured of merit d(3j){*} g(3j){*}, electromechanical coupling factors
   k(3j){*} (j = 1, 2 and 3), and hydrostatic analogs of these parameters
   of the 2-2 composite. A comparison of values of d(3j){*}g(3j){*} was
   first carried out at d(31){*} not equal d(32){*} in a wide range of
   orientations and volume-fraction. Large values of the effective
   parameters and inequalities vertical bar d(33){*} / d(3f){*}vertical bar
   > 5 and vertical bar k(33){*} / k(3f){*}vertical bar > 5 (f = 1 and 2)
   are achieved at specific orientations of the main crystallographic axes
   due to the anisotropy of elastic and piezoelectric properties of the SC
   component. The use of an auxetic polyethylene with a negative Poisson's
   ratio leads to a significant increase in the hydrostatic parameters of
   the 2-2 composite. Particular advantages of the studied composites over
   the conventional ceramic / polymer composites are taken into account for
   transducer, hydroacoustic and energyharvesting applications.}},

Volume = {{9}},

Pages = {{8198-8202}},
Abstract = {{Most materials have a unique form optimized for a specific property and
   function. However, the ability to reconfigure material structures
   depending on stimuli opens exciting opportunities. Although mechanical
   instabilities have been traditionally viewed as a failure mode, here we
   exploit them to design a class of 2D soft materials whose architecture
   can be dramatically changed in response to an external stimulus. By
   considering geometric constraints on the tessellations of the 2D
   Euclidean plane, we have identified four possible periodic distributions
   of uniform circular holes where mechanical instability can be exploited
   to reversibly switch between expanded (i.e. with circular holes) and
   compact (i.e. with elongated, almost closed elliptical holes) periodic
   configurations. Interestingly, in all these structures buckling is found
   to induce large negative values of incremental Poisson's ratio and in
   two of them also the formation of chiral patterns. Using a combination
   of finite element simulations and experiments at the centimeter scale we
   demonstrate a proof-of-concept of the proposed materials. Since the
   proposed mechanism for reconfigurable materials is induced by elastic
   instability, it is reversible, repeatable and scale-independent.}},

Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{369-376}},
Abstract = {{It is commonly believed that furniture spring systems are far more
   durable and friendly to use than foam systems. The aim of this research
   project was to design and realise models of individual auxetic
   compression springs and determine their resistance to cyclic as well as
   prolonged static loads. The study was conducted using numerical
   calculations and verification of results by laboratory experiments. The
   results of the performed investigations made it possible to conclude
   that the designed spring had stiffness characteristics similar to the
   compression characteristics of polyurethane foams. Cyclical and
   prolonged static loads have no significant influence on changes in
   spring heights; their impact on the comfort of seating is insignificant.
   New construction of springs guaranteed the auxetic properties of systems
   made up of many parallel-joined spring systems. Due to such properties,
   seats designed using auxetic springs can exhibit high comfort levels in
   comparison with traditional systems made of wire springs or foams.}},

Abstract = {{The design and development of a novel six-axis micropositioning stage
   are presented in this study. Based on Stewart's theory, negative
   Poisson's ratio is adopted for the design of flexure hinges for this
   stage. The stage consists of a top hexagonal plate, a bottom hexagonal
   plate and six trapezoidal amplifiers. The flexure hinge in the inner
   part of the amplifier has a symmetrical double layer, and that in the
   outer part of the amplifier has an unsymmetrical single layer. The
   deformation and amplification are calculated in a numerical simulation
   with the finite element method. An experiment for measuring the
   displacement of the stage is carried out. In the experiments, each
   amplifier is driven by a piezoelectric transducer, and the displacements
   are measured with a laser displacement sensor then recorded for
   comparison of the single-axis amplifier with the six-axis stage. The
   results show that the amplification of the displacement of a single-axis
   amplifier is about 15. Also, the simulation and experimental results for
   the six-axis stage show all errors of motion to be <3\%. It is obvious
   that the novel six-axis stage possesses the characteristics of high
   amplification and minimisation, as well as being low cost.}},

Abstract = {{First-principles calculations were performed to study the alloying
   stability and electronic structure of the Al-based intermetallic
   compounds AlCu3, AlCu2Zr and AlZr3. The results show that the lattice
   parameters obtained after the full relaxation of the crystalline cells
   are consistent with the experimental data, and these intermetallics have
   a strong alloying ability and structural stability due to their negative
   formation energies and their cohesive energies. A further analysis
   revealed that the single-crystal elastic constants at zero-pressure
   satisfy the requirements for the mechanical stability of cubic crystals.
   The calculations on Poisson's ratio show that AlCu3 is much more
   anisotropic than the other two intermetallics. In addition, calculations
   on the densities of states indicate that the valence bonds of these
   intermetallics are attributed to the valence electrons of Cu 3d states
   for the AlCu3, Cu 3d and Zr 4d states for AlCu2Zr, and Al 3s, Zr 5s and
   4d states for AlZr3, respectively. In particular, the electronic

Abstract = {{Poisson regression model has been considered as a standard method for
   modeling count data. However, count data often display overdispersion,
   and thus, negative binomial (NB) regression model has been suggested for
   handling overdispersed count data. In addition, generalized Poisson (GP)
   regression model has been proposed for handling both over-and
   underdispersed count data. This study proposes the score test for
   testing Poisson regression against GP alternatives and proves that it is
   equal to the score test for testing Poisson regression against NB
   alternatives. The advantage of score test over other alternative tests
   such as likelihood ratio and Wald is that the score test can be used to
   determine whether a more complex model is appropriate without fitting
   the more complex model. Application of the proposed score test on the
   Malaysian private car claim count data is illustrated.}},

Abstract = {{RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) is the current method of choice for
   characterizing transcriptomes and quantifying gene expression changes.
   This next generation sequencing-based method provides unprecedented
   depth and resolution. The negative binomial (NB) probability
   distribution has been shown to be a useful model for frequencies of
   mapped RNA-Seq reads and consequently provides a basis for statistical
   analysis of gene expression. Negative binomial exact tests are available
   for two-group comparisons but do not extend to negative binomial
   regression analysis, which is important for examining gene expression as
   a function of explanatory variables and for adjusted group comparisons
   accounting for other factors. We address the adequacy of available
   large-sample tests for the small sample sizes typically available from
   RNA-Seq studies and consider a higher-order asymptotic (HOA) adjustment
   to likelihood ratio tests. We demonstrate that 1) the HOA-adjusted
   likelihood ratio test is practically indistinguishable from the exact
   test in situations where the exact test is available, 2) the type I
   error of the HOA test matches the nominal specification in regression
   settings we examined via simulation, and 3) the power of the likelihood
   ratio test does not appear to be affected by the HOA adjustment. This
   work helps clarify the accuracy of the unadjusted likelihood ratio test
   and the degree of improvement available with the HOA adjustment.
   Furthermore, the HOA test may be preferable even when the exact test is
   available because it does not require ad hoc library size adjustments.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the present population study was to evaluate the impact of
   early childhood caries (ECC) on the oral health-related quality of life
   (OHRQoL) of preschool children and their parents/caregivers. A random
   sample of 638 children (aged 2-5 years) underwent a clinical oral
   examination to assess ECC, and their parents were invited to answer two
   questionnaires: one on the OHRQoL of the child, the Early Childhood Oral
   Health Impact Scale, and another on the characteristics and
   sociodemographic conditions of the child. Descriptive analysis, chi(2)
   test, Mann-Whitney test, Kruskal-Wallis test, and hierarchically
   adjusted Poisson regression models were used. The prevalence of ECC was
   52.2\%. The number of teeth with decay ranged from 1 (n = 42; 6.6\%) to
   20 (n = 5; 0.8\%), averaging 2.86 (SD = 4.04). There was a significant
   difference between the severity of ECC and OHRQoL in terms of the impact
   on both child and family (p < 0.001). An increase in the severity of ECC
   resulted in an increased negative impact on the quality of life of the
   child (rate ratio, RR = 5.32; 95\% confidence interval, Cl: 3.67-7.71).
   Greater age of the mother had a positive impact on the OHRQoL of
   preschool children (RR = 0.72; 95\% Cl: 0.54-0.97). Increased age
   resulted in an increased negative impact on the quality of life of the
   child (RR = 2.97; 95\% Cl: 1.61-5.47). ECC has a negative impact on the
   OHRQoL of children aged 2-5 years and their parents. Mothers aged 30 or
   older reported better OHRQoL, independent of the presence of ECC and the
   age of the child. Copyright (C) 2012 S. Karger AG, Basel}},

Abstract = {{Background: Self-reported hypertension is an important piece of
   information for public health that is available in epidemiological
   studies. For proper use of this information, such studies should be
   validated.
   Objective: To validate self-reported hypertension and associated factors
   in adults and elderly individuals in Sao Paulo, Brazil.
   Methods: Participants were selected from the sample of a
   population-based cross-sectional health survey carried out in Sao Paulo
   (ISA Capital-2008). Their age was 20 years or older, they were from both
   genders, and had their blood pressure measured (n = 535). Hypertension
   was defined as blood pressure >= 140/90 mmHg and/or use of medication
   for hypertension. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value
   (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and Kappa coefficient were
   calculated. Poisson regression was used to identify factors associated
   with sensitivity of self-reported hypertension.
   Results: Sensitivity of self-reported hypertension was 71.1\% (95\%CI:
   64.8 to 76.9), specificity 80.5\% (95\%CI: 75.6 to 84.8), PPV 73.7\%
   (95\%CI: 67.4 to 79.3), and NPV 78.5\% (95\%CI: 73.5 to 82.9). There was
   moderate agreement between self-reported hypertension and hypertension
   as diagnosed by blood pressure measurement (kappa = 0.52, 95\%CI: 0.45
   to 0.59). Body mass index and level of education were independently
   associated with sensitivity (body mass index >= 25 kg/m(2): PR = 1.42,
   95\% CI: 1.15 to 1.76; schooling >= 9 years: PR = 0.71 95\% CI:
   0.54-0.94).
   Conclusion: Self-reported hypertension was shown to be valid in adults
   and the elderly in the city of Sao Paulo, and is thus an appropriate
   indicator for the surveillance of hypertension prevalence in the absence
   of blood pressure measurement. Overweight was positively associated with
   validity of self-reported hypertension. Further studies are needed to
   elucidate the inverse association between the validity of self-reported
   hypertension and level of education. (Arq Bras Cardiol.

Abstract = {{In this paper we study the effects of negative Poisson's ratios on
   elastic problems containing singularities. Materials with a negative

   then two particular cases of this problem are investigated: the
   free-edge problem and the interface crack problem. We study the effect
   on the stress singularity due to one portion of the bimaterial becoming
   auxetic. We find that the auxetic material has a significant effect on
   the singularity order, even causing the singularity to vanish for
   certain values of the elastic constants. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Background and aims: Lifestyle variables have a key role in the
   development of abdominal obesity (AO). The objective of this study was
   to identify lifestyle factors and socioeconomic variables associated
   with AO in adolescents.
   Methods and results: This study carried out a school-based survey in the
   Brazilian city of Maringa in Parana. The representative sample was of
   991 adolescents (54.5\% girls) from both public and private high schools
   selected through multi-stage random sampling. AO was classified
   according to waist circumference value. The independent variables
   studied were: gender, age, socioeconomic level, parental and household
   characteristics, smoking, alcohol use, physical inactivity, sedentary
   behaviour and nutrition-related habits. Poisson regression was used with
   robust variance adjustment to analyse the associations. The analysis was
   stratified by sexes. The prevalence of AO was 32.7\% (girls 36.3\%, boys
   28.4\%). In girls, excessive intake of fried foods was inversely
   associated with AO and excessive consumption of soda was positively
   associated. In boys, the results demonstrated a negative association
   with excessive consumption of sweets and soda.
   Conclusion: It is concluded that the prevalence of AO among adolescents
   was higher in both sexes. AO is associated with different eating habits
   in females and males and these relationships are mediated by familial
   contexts.}},

Abstract = {{Skeletal muscle tissue provides support and mobility of the
   musculoskeletal system. Numerical modeling of muscle tissue aids in
   understanding disease pathophysiology, however, the effectiveness is
   dependent on accurately accounting for various tissue phenomena. Muscle
   modeling is made difficult due to the multitude of constituents that
   contribute to elastic and viscous mechanisms. Often, deterministic
   single fiber or fiber bundle studies are undertaken to examine these
   contributions. However, examination of whole, intact and structurally
   altered tissue and comparison to findings at the myofibril scale can
   help elucidate tissue mechanics. Stress relaxation tests at 10\% strain
   were performed on 28 New Zealand White rabbit's tibialis anterior
   muscles for whole, intact muscle and sub-sectioned muscle samples.
   Additionally, to aid in examining viscous effects, sub groups were
   tested with and without a phosphate buffered saline bath. The
   steady-state elastic modulus was not significantly different between
   groups. Interestingly, sectioning did result in a negative Poisson's
   ratio following tensile loading. Additionally, sectioning resulted in
   altering the viscous tissue response as the time to reach steady-state
   was significantly faster than whole muscle samples (p < 0.05), as well
   as the linear relaxation rate from 0 to 0.1 (p < 0.01), 1 to 10 (p <
   0.05), and 10 to 100 s (p < 0.05). Bathing tissue resulted in a
   significantly greater amount of percent stress relaxation for whole
   muscle (p < 0.01). These findings provide new insight into the differing
   mechanical characteristics of whole and sectioned muscle tissue. (c)

Journal = {{TUNNELLING AND UNDERGROUND SPACE TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{33}},
Pages = {{98-110}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Liners are typically used to prevent leakage from large-diameter
   conduits (e.g., sewage pipelines, shafts, tunnels, or penstocks) to
   their surroundings. The liner is usually designed to resist buckling
   from external grout pressure during installation or from the external
   water pressure or internal negative pressure when the conduit is
   dewatered quickly for inspection and/or maintenance. This study uses the
   finite element method to investigate the inelastic stability of
   cylindrical liners with localized wavy imperfections. The liner's
   material is assumed to follow elastic-perfectly-plastic stress-strain
   relationship. The effects of the different geometrical parameters of the
   liner on its stability are studied. This is in addition to the effect of
   the liner's material properties (Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, and
   yield stress) on its buckling pressure. Results of the study are
   expected to contribute to the understanding of the mechanical behavior
   of locally imperfect cylindrical liners when subjected to external
   uniform pressure, and also in the improvement of the associated design
   standards. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

   deformation. Then, we study the deformation of the rod when the thermal
   field is a polynomial of degree m in the axial coordinate. The solution
   is reduced to the solving of some two-dimensional problems. The method
   is used to solve the problem of a circular cylinder subjected to a
   uniform temperature field. In contrast with the case of achiral
   materials, a constant thermal field in an isotropic chiral cylinder
   produces torsional effects. (C) 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights

Abstract = {{The modeling of the mechanisms of generation, loss, multiplication and
   transport of charge carriers is vital for the simulation of the
   prebreakdown process in dielectric liquids. Unfortunately, there is a
   lack of suitable coefficients to describe the electron generation and
   transport of carriers in liquids, which hinders the development of
   numerical models with sufficient predictive power. In this paper, the
   drift-dominated continuity equations for electrons and ions are coupled
   with Poisson's equation in order to simulate the carrier production and
   drift in the liquid phase under positive and negative voltages in
   cyclohexane. The estimations of the model are compared with measurements
   of current-voltage characteristics and Trichel current pulses reported
   in the literature for needle-plane configurations. In the analysis, the
   electron generation mechanisms suggested for dielectric liquids are
   analyzed and discussed. It is found that estimations based on the Zener
   equation for field-dependent molecular ionization do not agree with
   measurements for negative sharp points. It is also shown that the proper
   estimation of the electric current in the liquid phase should consider a
   field-dependent attachment term as well as the electrohydrodynamic
   movement of the liquid.}},

   Aluminum Foam and Auxetic Honeycomb Cores}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Abstract = {{An innovative auxetic-cored sandwich panel (AXP) is proposed. Its
   perforation resistant performance under high-velocity projectile impact
   was numerically analyzed using the validated finite element simulation
   techniques and compared with that of the aluminum foam-cored sandwich
   panel (AFP) of identical dimensions and weight. It has been found that
   the AXP is far superior to the AFP in ballistic resistance because of
   the material concentration at the impacted area due to the negative
   Poisson's ratio (NPR) effect. A parametric study was carried out to
   investigate the effects of several key parameters, including impact
   velocity, face and core thicknesses, and core density, on the ballistic
   resistance of the AXP and AFP. The results show that the ballistic limit
   and perforation energy of the AXP is greatly affected by these
   parameters. Meanwhile, the advantages of AXP over AFP being used as
   ballistic resistant structures are highlighted. The primary outcome of
   this research is new information on the development and design of
   advanced ballistic resistant structures containing auxetic materials.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of the chapter is to test the hypothesis that food safety
   (chemical) standards act as barriers to international seafood imports.
   We use zero-accounting gravity models to test the hypothesis that food
   safety (chemical) standards act as barriers to international seafood
   imports. The chemical standards on which we focus include
   chloramphenicol required performance limit, oxytetracycline maximum
   residue limit, fluoro-quinolones maximum residue limit, and
   dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) pesticide residue limit. The study
   focuses on the three most important seafood markets: the European
   Union's 15 members, Japan, and North America.
   Our empirical results confirm the hypothesis and are robust to the OLS
   as well as alternative zero-accounting gravity models such as the
   Heckman estimation and the Poisson family regressions. For the choice of
   the best model specification to account for zero trade and
   heteroskedastic issues, it is inconclusive to base on formal statistical
   tests; however, the Heckman sample selection and zero-inflated negative
   binomial (ZINB) models provide the most reliable parameter estimates
   based on the statistical tests, magnitude of coefficients, economic
   implications, and the literature findings. Our findings suggest that
   continually tightening of seafood safety standards has had a negative
   impact on exporting countries. Increasing the stringency of regulations
   by reducing analytical limits or maximum residue limits in seafood in
   developed countries has negative impacts on their bilateral seafood
   imports. The chapter furthers the literature on food safety standards on
   international trade. We show competing gravity model specifications and
   provide additional evidence that no one gravity model is superior.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the development of an SLS 3D printed auxetic
   structure actuated to a predefined form by an embedded pneumatic network
   through an iterative process of feedback between digital simulation and
   physical testing. This feedback process is critical to the development
   of a more accurate predictive model, and to compose the geometry of the
   suggested structure. An approach based on the emergence of the final
   structure from the convergence of the behaviour of sub - structures and
   a methodology based on the analysis and synthesis of the simplest
   sub-system is the core of this research. The results indicate a

Abstract = {{A new approach for a compressor casing design has been developed using
   new design possibilities offered by additive manufacturing technologies.
   Tip clearance behaviour is a serious problem in compressor design
   leading to increased aerodynamic losses and limiting the operating range
   of a compressor through a decrease in surge margin. Efforts are
   necessary to minimise the tip clearance in the load cycle of an engine.
   The approach presented in this work uses auxetic structures in a
   double-walled compressor casing with the aim to force the radial
   expansion behaviour of the inner casing wall in order to adapt the
   casing to the rotor. The studies of the casing and the calculations of
   the transient rotor displacement are carried out by using
   coupled-temperature-displacement calculations using commercial
   FEM-tools.
   Elements which influence the radial expansion of the casing are
   identified with the aim of generating a modular system for future
   compressor casing developments. So the casing elements are adaptable to
   the radial expansion of a certain rotor. An improved tip clearance
   behaviour in relevant operating points is achieved. In the latter part
   of the paper, practical design considerations are made as the auxetic
   structures are integrated into the CAD model of an existing compressor
   casing. Design challenges are also briefly discussed.
   This paper presents a new potential application of additive
   manufacturing technologies in future aero engine design. The focus of
   this paper is on the practical implementation of the new design freedom
   using the example of a compressor casing. The advantages for the overall
   engine performance as well as identified problems are also discussed
   qualitatively.}},

Volume = {{14}},

Pages = {{766-775}},
Abstract = {{Objective: Previous studies of pavement management factors that relate
   to the occurrence of traffic-related crashes are rare. Traditional
   research has mostly employed summary statistics of bidirectional
   pavement quality measurements in extended longitudinal road segments
   over a long time period, which may cause a loss of important information
   and result in biased parameter estimates. The research presented in this
   article focuses on crash risk of roadways with overall fair to good
   pavement quality. Real-time and location-specific data were employed to
   estimate the effects of pavement management factors on the occurrence of
   crashes.
   Methods: This research is based on the crash data and corresponding
   pavement quality data for the Tennessee state route highways from 2004
   to 2009. The potential temporal and spatial correlations among
   observations caused by unobserved factors were considered. Overall 6
   models were built accounting for no correlation, temporal correlation
   only, and both the temporal and spatial correlations. These models
   included Poisson, negative binomial (NB), one random effect Poisson and
   negative binomial (OREP, ORENB), and two random effect Poisson and
   negative binomial (TREP, TRENB) models. The Bayesian method was employed
   to construct these models. The inference is based on the posterior
   distribution from the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation. These
   models were compared using the deviance information criterion.
   Results: Analysis of the posterior distribution of parameter
   coefficients indicates that the pavement management factors indexed by
   Present Serviceability Index (PSI) and Pavement Distress Index (PDI) had
   significant impacts on the occurrence of crashes, whereas the variable
   rutting depth was not significant. Among other factors, lane width,
   median width, type of terrain, and posted speed limit were significant
   in affecting crash frequency.
   Conclusions: The findings of this study indicate that a reduction in
   pavement roughness would reduce the likelihood of traffic-related
   crashes. Hence, maintaining a low level of pavement roughness is
   strongly suggested. In addition, the results suggested that the temporal
   correlation among observations was significant and that the ORENB model
   outperformed all other models.}},

Abstract = {{Control of human papillomavirus (HPV)-related cancers by inclusion of

   enrolled in the 1:1 randomized phase III (PATRICIA) trial of the
   efficacy of vaccination with the AS04-adjuvanted HPV-16/18 virus-like

Abstract = {{This study investigates the impact of reproductive factors on the
   association between education and breast cancer mortality in Belgium.
   The role of reproductive factors has been investigated in several
   studies, with mixed results. Reproductive factors are either completely
   or partially responsible for the association between education and
   breast cancer mortality. The data consist of the 1991 census linked to
   registration data on cause-specific mortality during the period
   19911995, including all breast cancer deaths in Belgium during the
   observation period. The study population includes all women aged 3579 at
   time of the census. Age-standardized mortality rates and mortality rate
   ratios (Poisson regression) are computed for educational groups with and
   without control for reproductive factors. The population is stratified
   according to age (women aged 3549 and 5079) and according to
   nulliparity. The relationship between education and breast cancer is
   significant among postmenopausal women. Breast cancer mortality is
   higher among the higher educated women. These results are consistent
   with international findings, the gradient not being negative as in most
   other causes of death, but positive. Statistical control for parity and
   age at first birth reduces the association largely. In addition, among
   nonparous women, differences in breast cancer mortality by education are
   not consistent and generally not significant. Reproductive factors are
   largely responsible for the positive association between education and
   breast cancer mortality among postmenopausal women in Belgium. Among
   premenopausal women, the relation is not significant, a pattern
   consistent with international studies.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of microalloying on the toughness of Cu-Ti-based metallic
   glasses is explored. Minor additions of Si and Sn in glass former
   Cu47Ti34Zr11Ni8 known to improve glass-forming ability are found here to
   sharply decrease toughness. The drop in toughness is associated with a
   small but meaningful increase in shear modulus, glass-transition
   temperature, yield strength, and a decrease in Poisson's ratio, implying
   a negative correlation between toughness and shear flow barrier. The
   strong influence of minor additions on the glass properties could be a
   useful tool for simultaneously tuning both the glass-forming ability and
   toughness of metallic glasses. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

   Stress Relief}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{134}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{A methodology for topology optimization to the design of compliant
   cellular mechanisms with and without internal contact is presented. A
   two-step procedure is pursued. First, a baseline noncontact mechanism is
   developed and optimized via an inverse homogenization method using the
   ``solid isotropic material with penalization{''} approach. This
   compliant mechanism is optimized to yield specified elasticity
   coefficients, with the capability to sustain large effective strains by
   minimizing local linear elastic strain. In the second step, a system of
   internal contacts is designed. The initial continuum model of a
   noncontact mechanism is converted into a frame model, and possible
   contact links are defined. A computationally efficient algorithm is
   employed to eliminate those mechanisms having overlapping contact links.
   The remaining nonoverlapping designs are exhaustively investigated for
   stress relief. A differential evolution optimizer is used to maximize
   the stress relief. The results generated for a range of specified
   elasticity coefficients include a honeycomb-like cell, an auxetic cell,
   and a diamond-shaped cell. These various cell topologies have different
   effective properties corresponding to different structural requirements.
   For each such topology, a contact mechanism is devised that demonstrates
   stress relief. In one such case, the contact mechanism increases the
   strain magnification ratio by about 30\%. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4007694]}},

Abstract = {{Using molecular dynamic (MD) simulation, the mechanical properties of a
   buckypaper/epoxy composite were calculated. In order to simulate a large
   model within a large enough timescale, a general MD code fully
   implemented on graphical processing units (GPUs) was developed. The
   code, which enables the simulation of large systems with about five
   hundreds speed up in simulation time relative to a single CPU core, is
   capable of running on CUDA enabled GPUs. In this study the
   buckpaper/epoxy composite consists of single wall carbon nanotubes
   (CNTs), epoxy resin (EPON-862) and the curing agent
   diethyltoluenediamine (DETDA). Next, the mechanical properties of
   buckypaper/epoxy composite, namely elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio,
   were studied through the simulation of a set of tension tests. For the
   first time directional properties of this material is calculated. A
   comparison with previously published data is also included. The results
   prove that the proposed procedure is suitable for investigating the
   mechanical properties of the buckypaper/epoxy composites. In addition,
   the results show a negative Poisson ratio and high modulus of elasticity
   for the buckypaper/epoxy composites, which proves the application of
   such material in producing artificial muscles, and advanced composites
   in aviation industries, respectively. Finally, a study on the failure
   mechanisms of the material is conducted and the integrity of the results
   was checked by the available experimental and analytical data.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanics of beam vibration is of fundamental importance in
   understanding the shift of resonant frequency of microcantilever and
   nanocantilever sensors. Unlike the simpler Euler-Bernoulli beam theory,
   the Timoshenko beam theory takes into consideration rotational inertia
   and shear deformation. For the case of microcantilevers and
   nanocantilevers, the minute size, and hence low mass, means that the
   topmost deviation from the Euler Bernoulli beam theory to be expected is
   shear deformation. This paper considers the extent of shear deformation
   for varying Poisson's ratio of the beam material, with special emphasis
   on solids with negative Poisson's ratio, which are also known as auxetic
   materials. Here, it is shown that the Timoshenko beam theory approaches
   the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory if the beams are of solid cross-sections
   and the beam material possess high auxeticity. However, the Timoshenko
   beam theory is significantly different from the Euler-Bernoulli beam
   theory for beams in the form of thin-walled tubes regardless of the beam
   material's Poisson's ratio. It is herein proposed that calculations on
   beam vibration can be greatly simplified for highly auxetic beams with
   solid cross-sections due to the small shear correction term in the
   Timoshenko beam de ection equation.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate theoretically that the presence of ions in insulating
   materials such as nematic liquid crystals may be responsible for the
   dielectric spectroscopy behavior observed experimentally. It is shown
   that, at low frequencies, an essentially non-Debye relaxation process
   takes place due to surface effects. This is accomplished by
   investigating the effects of the adsorption-desorption process on the
   electrical response of an electrolytic cell when the generation and
   recombination of ions is present. The adsorption-desorption is governed
   by a non-usual kinetic equation in order to incorporate memory effects
   related to a non-Debye relaxation and the roughness of the surface. The
   analysis is carried out by searching for solutions to the
   drift-diffusion equation that satisfy the Poisson equation relating the
   effective electric field to the net charge density. We also discuss the
   effect of the mobility of the ions, i.e., situations with equal and
   different diffusion coefficients for positive and negative ions, on the
   impedance and obtain an exact expression for the admittance. The model
   is compared with experimental results measured for the impedance of a
   nematic liquid crystal sample and a very good agreement is obtained.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To study trends in overall deaths and cause-specific deaths
   stratified by hepatitis C virus (HCV) serostatus in a cohort of
   combination antiretroviral (cART)-naive HIV-infected patients in Spain.
   Methods: We analyzed data from 1997 to 2008 in two calendar periods:
   1997-2003 and 2004-2008. Deaths were ascertained through cohort
   reporting and a cross-match with the Spanish National Death Index. We
   used Poisson regression to model mortality rates and risk factors.
   Results: We analyzed 5974 HIV-positive cART-naive patients: 2471 (1497
   HCV positive) in the period 1997-2003, and 3503 (689 HCV positive) in
   the period 2004-2008. A total of 232 deaths (158 during the first
   period, and 74 during the second period) were detected during 19 416
   person-years of follow-up; the death rate was 12.9 of 1000 person-years.
   Crude overall death rates {[}95\% confidence interval (CI)] were 16.5
   (14.2-19.1) in 1997-2003 and 8.5 (6.7-10.6) in 2004-2008. The incidence
   rate ratio (IRR) (95\% CI) in 2004-2008 taking 1997-2003 as a reference
   was 0.51 (0.39-0.67). When we stratified by HCV serostatus, the overall
   death IRR (95\% CI) taking 1997-2003 as reference was 0.52 (0.32-0.85)
   for HCV-negative patients and 1.27 (0.90-1.79) for HCV-positive
   patients. When we considered cause-specific deaths (liver-related,
   AIDS-related, and nonliver-related/non-AIDS-related), findings were
   similar to those for overall-deaths.
   Conclusion: Taking the first years of the cART era as a reference, we
   observed a decrease in overall and cause-specific mortality. This
   decrease was only observed in HCV-negative patients. (C) 2012 Wolters

Abstract = {{The objective of this work was to develop a proposal for Neohydatothrips
   signifer sampling in the passion fruit crop. Average thrip infestation
   on the crop was correlated with the meteorological variables of relative
   humidity, temperature, and precipitation using Pearson correlation
   coefficient. Likewise, determinations were done for the aggregation rate
   of the growing population using chi square (X-2) for the Poisson
   distribution, the ratio test V-2/mu and the negative binomial
   distribution. Temperature is the only climatic variable that
   significantly correlated with the mean density of the thrips. There were
   higher incidence and population density of the insects at the vegetative
   terminal buds, in comparison to the flower buds. The spatial
   distribution pattern for this insect, along all phenological stages of
   the plant, was aggregated. Using the aggregation index and the average
   population, a sample of 22 new vegetative terminal buds per hectare was
   determined as appropriate, regardless of its position within the plant.
   A thrip sampling method in the passion fruit crop should sample over
   terminal buds, without account their position on plants.}},

Abstract = {{Background and objectives Smoking is common in the hemodialysis
   population and is associated with increased all-cause mortality and
   development of cardiovascular disease. Cause-specific outcomes have not
   yet been examined in detail. This study investigated the association of
   baseline smoking status with all-cause, cardiovascular, and
   infection-related morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing
   long-term hemodialysis.
   Design, setting, participants, \& measurements Post hoc analysis of the
   HEMO Study in patients with available comorbidity, clinical, and
   nutritional data. Cox proportional hazards regression models were fit to
   estimate the association of smoking status with mortality. Poisson and
   negative binomial regression models were fit to estimate the association
   of smoking status with hospitalization rate.
   Results Complete data were available for 1842 individuals (44\% male,
   63\% black, 45\% diabetic). Mean age was 58 +/- 14 years. At baseline,
   17\% were current smokers and 32\% were former smokers. After case-mix
   adjustment, compared with never smoking, current smoking was associated
   with greater infection-related mortality (hazard ratio {[}HR], 2.04;
   95\% confidence interval {[}CI], 1.32-3.10) and all-cause mortality (HR,
   1.44; 95\% Cl, 1.16-1.79) and greater cardiovascular (incidence rate
   ratio {[}IRR], 1.49; 95\% Cl, 1.22-1.82), infection-related (IRR, 1.35;
   95\% Cl., 1.11-1.64) and all-cause (IRR, 1.43; 95\% Cl, 1.24-1.65)
   hospitalization rates. The population attributable fraction (i.e.,
   fraction of observed deaths that may have been avoided) was 5.3\% for
   current smokers versus never-smokers and 2.1\% for current versus former
   smokers.

Abstract = {{In this paper, the elastic band structures of two-dimensional solid
   phononic crystals (PCs) with both negative and positive Poisson's ratios
   are investigated based on the finite difference domain method. Systems
   with different combinations of mass density ratio and shear modulus
   ratio, filling fractions and lattices are considered. The numerical
   results show that for the PCs with both large mass density ratio and
   shear modulus ratio, the first bandgap becomes narrower with its upper
   edge becoming lower as Poisson's ratio of the scatterers decreases from
   -0.1 to -0.9. Generally, introducing the material with a negative
   Poisson's ratio for scatterers will make this bandgap lower and
   narrower. For the PCs with large mass density ratio and small shear
   modulus ratio, the first bandgap becomes wider with Poisson's ratio of
   the scatterers decreasing and that of the host increasing. It is easy to
   obtain a wide low-frequency bandgap by embedding scatterers with a
   negative Poisson's ratio into the host with a positive Poisson's ratio.
   The PCs with large filling fractions are more sensitive to the
   variations of Poisson's ratios. Use of negative Poisson's ratio provides
   us a way of tuning bandgaps. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The researched polyisocyanurate foam FENIX is an innovative expanded
   structural material constituted of fine open cells suitable for
   transports, aeronautics, marine industries and for all those areas that
   require materials with strong fire reaction. In the paper the FENIX foam
   behaviour during quasi-static compression tests was examined. The
   experimental research was carried out with the use of the material
   testing stage which is an integral part of the microtomograph Skyscan
   1147. The very interesting phenomenon was observed during experiment.
   Both types of researched foam showed an auxetic behaviour - the samples
   collapsed inside their volume, what resulted in their negative Poisson's
   ratios.
   The next step of such material structure research was its microstrutural
   model development. The model was based on the well known Kelvin geometry
   and solid eight-node elements. The aim of the numerical study was to
   examine if the dimension of the sample influence its auxetic or
   non-auxetic behaviour. For that purpose three models built of 3 x 3 x 3,
   3 x 3 x 6 and 3 x 3 x 9 cells were prepared and subjected to the
   compression load. Numerical analyses were carried out with the use of
   LS-Dyna computer code. Material characteristics and model for solid
   polyisocyanurate were chosen on the base of literature studies. The
   strain-stress results of numerical analyses were compared to the
   experiment with good accordance. The deformations were then examined.
   The samples showed an auxetic behaviour only for the 3 x 3 x 3 cells
   model. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In continuum mechanics, the non-centrosymmetric micropolar theory is
   usually used to capture the chirality inherent in materials. However,
   when reduced to a two dimensional (2D) isotropic problem, the resulting
   model becomes non-chiral. Therefore, influence of the chiral effect
   cannot be properly characterized by existing theories for 2D chiral
   solids. To circumvent this difficulty, based on reinterpretation of
   isotropic tensors in the 2D case, we propose a continuum theory to model
   the chiral effect for 2D isotropic chiral solids. A single material
   parameter related to chirality is introduced to characterize the
   coupling between the bulk deformation and the internal rotation, which
   is a fundamental feature of 2D chiral solids. Coherently, the proposed
   continuum theory is applied for the homogenization of a triangular
   chiral lattice, from which the effective material constants of the
   lattice are analytically determined. The unique behavior in the chiral
   lattice is demonstrated through the analyses of a static tension problem
   and a plane wave propagation problem. The results, which cannot be
   predicted by the non-chiral model, are verified by the exact solution of
   the discrete model. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The response of epitaxial CoFe2O4 thin films to biaxial compressive
   stress imposed by MgAl2O4 and SrTiO3 single crystalline substrates is
   studied using X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. It is found that
   the Poisson ratio ? signals a non-auxetic behavior and depends on the
   substrate used. The Raman modes show an increase in frequency when
   increasing compressive strain by reducing film thickness; this is due to
   the shrinking of the unit cell volume. Such behavior is in qualitative
   agreement with recent ab initio calculations, although the measured
   values are significantly smaller than predictions. In contrast, the
   measured Poisson ratio is found to be in good agreement with
   expectations based on general arguments of atomic packing density.

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{137}},
Number = {{15}},

Abstract = {{Two phenomenological forms proposed to take into account the
   generation-recombination phenomenon of ions are investigated. The first
   form models the phenomenon as a chemical reaction, containing two
   coefficients describing the dissociation of neutral particles in ions,
   and the recombination of ions to give neutral particles. The second form
   is based on the assumption that in thermodynamical equilibrium, a
   well-defined density of ions is stable. Any deviation from the
   equilibrium density gives rise to a source term proportional to the
   deviation, whose phenomenological coefficient plays the role of a life
   time. The analysis is performed by evaluating the electrical response of
   an electrolytic cell to an external stimulus for both forms. For
   simplicity we assume that the electrodes are blocking, that there is
   only a group of negative and positive ions, and that the negative ions
   are immobile. For the second form, two cases are considered: (i) the
   generation-recombination phenomenon is due to an intrinsic mechanism,
   and (ii) the production of ions is triggered by an external source of
   energy, as in a solar cell. We show that the predictions of the two
   models are different at the impedance as well as at the admittance
   level. In particular, the first model predicts the existence of two
   plateaux for the real part of the impedance, whereas the second one
   predicts just one. It follows that impedance spectroscopy measurements
   could give information on the model valid for the
   generation-recombination of ions. (C) 2012 American Institute of

Title = {{Socioeconomic determinants of geographic disparities in
   campylobacteriosis risk: a comparison of global and local modeling
   approaches}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH GEOGRAPHICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{OCT 13}},
Abstract = {{Background: Socioeconomic factors play a complex role in determining the
   risk of campylobacteriosis. Understanding the spatial interplay between
   these factors and disease risk can guide disease control programs.
   Historically, Poisson and negative binomial models have been used to
   investigate determinants of geographic disparities in risk. Spatial
   regression models, which allow modeling of spatial effects, have been
   used to improve these modeling efforts. Geographically weighted
   regression (GWR) takes this a step further by estimating local
   regression coefficients, thereby allowing estimations of associations
   that vary in space. These recent approaches increase our understanding
   of how geography influences the associations between determinants and
   disease. Therefore the objectives of this study were to: (i) identify
   socioeconomic determinants of the geographic disparities of
   campylobacteriosis risk (ii) investigate if regression coefficients for
   the associations between socioeconomic factors and campylobacteriosis
   risk demonstrate spatial variability and (iii) compare the performance
   of four modeling approaches: negative binomial, spatial lag, global and
   local Poisson GWR.
   Methods: Negative binomial, spatial lag, global and local Poisson GWR
   modeling techniques were used to investigate associations between
   socioeconomic factors and geographic disparities in campylobacteriosis
   risk. The best fitting models were identified and compared.
   Results: Two competing four variable models (Models 1 \& 2) were
   identified. Significant variables included race, unemployment rate,
   education attainment, urbanicity, and divorce rate. Local Poisson GWR
   had the best fit and showed evidence of spatially varying regression
   coefficients.
   Conclusions: The international significance of this work is that it
   highlights the inadequacy of global regression strategies that estimate
   one parameter per independent variable, and therefore mask the true
   relationships between dependent and independent variables. Since local
   GWR estimate a regression coefficient for each location, it reveals the
   geographic differences in the associations. This implies that a factor
   may be an important determinant in some locations and not others.
   Incorporating this into health planning ensures that a needs-based,
   rather than a ``one-size-fits-all{''}, approach is used. Thus, adding
   local GWR to the epidemiologists' toolbox would allow them to assess how
   the impacts of different determinants vary by geography. This knowledge
   is critical for resource allocation in disease control programs.}},

Abstract = {{Materials with negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) effects have been studied
   for decades. However, the studies have mainly focused on 2D periodic
   structures which only have NPR effects in certain in-plane directions.
   In this paper, a novel concept is proposed to develop composite
   structures with isotropic NPR effects using NPR random inclusions. The
   study starts from a finite element analysis of deformation mechanisms of
   two 2D representative cells which are embedded with a re-entrant square
   and a re-entrant triangle. respectively. Based on the analysis results,
   the re-entrant triangles are selected as random inclusions into a matrix
   to form 2D composite structures. Four such composite structures are
   built with different numbers of inclusions through a parametric model,
   and their NPR effects and mechanical behaviors are analyzed using the
   finite element method. The results show that the isotropic NPR effects
   of composites can be obtained with high random re-entrant inclusions.
   Thus, the novel concept proposed is numerically proved by this study.

Abstract = {{A three-dimensional cellular system that may be made to exhibit some
   very unusual but highly useful mechanical properties, including negative
   Poisson's ratio (auxetic), zero Poisson's ratio, negative linear and
   negative area compressibility, is proposed and discussed. It is shown
   that such behaviour is scale-independent and may be obtained from
   particular conformations of this highly versatile system. This model may
   be used to explain the auxetic behaviour in auxetic foams and in other
   related cellular systems; such materials are widely known for their
   superior performance in various practical applications. It may also be
   used as a blueprint for the design and manufacture of new man-made
   multifunctional systems, including auxetic and negative compressibility
   systems, which can be made to have tailor-made mechanical properties.}},

Title = {{SERE: Single-parameter quality control and sample comparison for RNA-Seq}},
Journal = {{BMC GENOMICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{13}},
Pages = {{1-9}},
Month = {{OCT 3}},
Abstract = {{Background: Assessing the reliability of experimental replicates (or
   global alterations corresponding to different experimental conditions)
   is a critical step in analyzing RNA-Seq data. Pearson's correlation
   coefficient r has been widely used in the RNA-Seq field even though its
   statistical characteristics may be poorly suited to the task.
   Results: Here we present a single-parameter test procedure for count
   data, the Simple Error Ratio Estimate (SERE), that can determine whether
   two RNA-Seq libraries are faithful replicates or globally different.
   Benchmarking shows that the interpretation of SERE is unambiguous
   regardless of the total read count or the range of expression
   differences among bins (exons or genes), a score of 1 indicating
   faithful replication (i.e., samples are affected only by Poisson
   variation of individual counts), a score of 0 indicating data
   duplication, and scores > 1 corresponding to true global differences
   between RNA-Seq libraries. On the contrary the interpretation of
   Pearson's r is generally ambiguous and highly dependent on sequencing
   depth and the range of expression levels inherent to the sample
   (difference between lowest and highest bin count). Cohen's simple Kappa
   results are also ambiguous and are highly dependent on the choice of
   bins. For quantifying global sample differences SERE performs similarly
   to a measure based on the negative binomial distribution yet is simpler
   to compute.
   Conclusions: SERE can therefore serve as a straightforward and reliable
   statistical procedure for the global assessment of pairs or large groups
   of RNA-Seq datasets by a single statistical parameter.}},

Abstract = {{Sutures are the materials primarily used for closing wounds, and their
   performance is significantly dependent on their mechanical
   characteristics. Thus, their tensile property is a key parameter
   responsible for the success of a suture. In this paper, a simple
   analytical tensile model of braided sutures has been developed based on
   braid geometry, braid kinematics, and constituent monofilament
   properties. The model has accounted for the changes in the braid
   geometry, including braid angle, diameter, and Poisson's ratio. The
   kinematics of the braided suture is analyzed pertaining to monofilament
   locking or jamming in the braid. The model of jamming state of
   monofilaments has been presented, and both braid angle and diameter are
   found to be critical design parameters. The experimental results have
   been compared to the theoretical stress-strain curves of braided
   sutures, and an excellent agreement has been observed between them.}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{40}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{While collagen is recognized as the predominant mechanical component of
   soft connective tissues, the role of the non-fibrillar matrix (NFM) is
   less well understood. Even model systems, such as the collagen-agarose
   co-gel, can exhibit complex behavior, making it difficult to identify
   relative contributions of specific tissue constituents. In the present
   study, we developed a two-component microscale model of collagen-agarose
   tissue analogs and used it to elucidate the interaction between collagen
   and NFM in uniaxial tension. Collagen fibers were represented with
   Voronoi networks, and the NFM was modeled as a neo-Hookean solid. Model
   predictions of total normal stress and Poisson's ratio matched
   experimental observations well (including high Poisson's values of
   similar to 3), and the addition of NFM led to composition-dependent
   decreases in volume change and increases in fiber stretch. Because the
   NFM was more resistant to volume change than the fiber network,
   extension of the composite led to pressurization of the NFM. Within a
   specific range of parameter values (low shear modulus and moderate
   Poisson's ratio), the magnitude of the reaction force decreased relative
   to this pressurization component resulting in a negative (compressive)
   NFM stress in the loading direction, even though the composite tissue
   was in tension.}},

Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{968-975}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present novel methods for exploiting passive and
   active radially folding mechanisms for reactive and dynamic structures.
   These enable the application of radially folding structures in domains
   including fluidics, medical stents, and auxetic materials. A compact
   form of elastic deployment utilizing linkage strain energy is proposed
   using beam theory analysis. Elastic strain energy is also shown to
   produce bistable folding behavior, with two low energy states at full
   contraction and full expansion, and a bistable switching point at some
   intermediate position. Polymeric smart materials are investigated for
   driving active folding. These materials can be readily exploited through
   the features of the folding structure including its ability to resolve
   1-D, 2-D, and 3-D actuation strains into a more effective single
   degree-of-freedom linear, areal, volumetric or rotational output. The
   elastic and solid-state nature of many polymeric smart materials means
   they can implement elastic deployment and bistability. A
   thermally-activated shape memory polymer is shown to fold a 4-segment
   structure from expanded to contracted states. Experimental testing of an
   8-segment dielectric elastomer actuator prototype demonstrates that
   radially folding structures can resolve large biaxial planar strains
   generated by dielectric elastomers into a single linear or rotational
   output stroke.}},

Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic materials (or metamaterials) are those with a negative Poisson
   ratio (NPR) and display the unexpected property of lateral expansion
   when stretched, as well as an equal and opposing densification when
   compressed. Such geometries are being progressively employed in the
   development of novel products, especially in the fields of intelligent
   expandable actuators, shape morphing structures and minimally invasive
   implantable devices. Although several auxetic and potentially auxetic
   geometries have been summarized in previous reviews and research,
   precise information regarding relevant properties for design tasks is
   not always provided.
   In this study we present a comparative study of two-dimensional and
   three-dimensional auxetic geometries carried out by means of
   computer-aided design and engineering tools (from now on CAD-CAE). The
   first part of the study is focused on the development of a CAD library
   of auxetics. Once the library is developed we simulate the behavior of
   the different auxetic geometries and elaborate a systematic comparison,
   considering relevant properties of these geometries, such as Poisson
   ratio(s), maximum volume or area reductions attainable and equivalent
   Young's modulus, hoping it may provide useful information for future
   designs of devices based on these interesting structures.}},

Abstract = {{Many countries around the world are implementing
   Public-Private-Partnership (PPP) contacts to manage road infrastructure.
   In some of these contracts the public sector introduces economic
   incentives to the private operator to foster the accomplishment of
   social goals. One of the incentives that have been introduced in some
   PPP contracts is related to safety in such a way that the better the
   safety outcome the greater will be the economic reward to the
   contractor. The aim of this paper is at identify whether the incentives
   to improve road safety in highway PPPs are ultimately effective in
   improving safety ratios. To this end Poisson and negative binomial
   regression models have been applied using information from highway
   sections in Spain. The findings indicate that even though road safety is
   highly influenced by variables that are not much controllable by the
   contractor such as the Average Annual Daily Traffic and the percentage
   of heavy vehicles, the implementation of safety incentives in PPPs has a
   positive influence in the reduction of fatalities, injuries and
   accidents. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Mechanical properties of materials have long been one of the most
   fundamental and studied areas of materials science for a myriad of
   applications. Recently, mechanical metamaterials have been shown to
   possess extraordinary effective properties, such as negative dynamic
   modulus and/or density, phononic bandgaps, superior thermoelectric
   properties, and high specific energy absorption. To obtain such
   materials on appropriate length scales to enable novel mechanical
   devices, it is often necessary to effectively design and fabricate
   micro-/nano- structured materials. In this Review, various aspects of
   the micro-/nano-structured materials as mechanical metamaterials,
   potential tools for their multidimensional fabrication, and selected
   methods for their structural and performance characterization are
   described, as well as some prospects for the future developments in this
   exciting and emerging field.}},

Title = {{Examination of the risk of reinfection with hepatitis C among injecting

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DRUG POLICY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{5}},

Abstract = {{Background: Unsafe injecting practices put injecting drug users (IDUs)
   at repeat exposure to infection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV). It has
   not yet been determined if spontaneously clearing one's primary
   infection influences the risk of reinfection; our aim was to estimate
   the relative risk of reinfection in IDUs who have cleared the virus.
   Methods: We conducted a retrospective study using a large database of
   HCV test results covering Greater Glasgow Health Board during 1993-2007
   to calculate rates of infection and reinfection in current/former IDUs.
   The relative risk of (re)infection in previously infected compared with
   never-infected IDUs was estimated using Poisson regression, adjusting
   for age at study entry, sex, and calendar period of test.
   Results: Although the rate of reinfection in IDUs who were HCV
   antibody-positive, RNA-negative at baseline was lower (7/100
   person-years, 95\% CI: 5-9) than the rate of acute infection in IDUs who
   were HCV antibody-negative at baseline (10/100 person-years, 95\% CI:
   9-12), the risk of reinfection was not significantly different than the
   risk of initial infection (adjusted rate ratio = 0.78, 95\% CI:
   0.57-1.08).
   Conclusion: We found only weak evidence for a reduced risk of HCV
   reinfection in IDUs who had cleared their previous infection. Further
   research among those who have cleared infection through antiviral
   therapy is needed to help inform decisions regarding treatment of IDUs.

   ribbons}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{112}},

Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{(Fe81-xCoxGa19)(80)B-20 ribbons, with x = 0, 7, 11, 19, and 23, were
   made by the single-roller quenching method. The x-ray diffraction
   patterns showed the A2, D0(19), and L1(2) diffraction peaks coexisting
   with the amorphous matrix background. When Fe was replaced by Co, i.e.,
   when x was increased, the first crystallization temperature (T-X1) and
   Curie temperature (T-C1) rose greatly. With a sufficiently heavy load
   (or weight) stretching the ribbon downward, the magnetization MS was
   pulled along the vertical direction (i.e., the tension-axis). Then, by
   applying a horizontal field (H-E) up to 6 KOe, we determined the sign
   and magnitude of the saturation magnetostriction (lambda(S)). The
   Young's modulus (E-S) at magnetization saturation and Delta E effect was
   estimated from the stress-strain curve. We discovered that the
   stress-strain curve of (Fe81Ga19)(80)B-20 exhibits the auxetic (or
   abnormal) characteristic with Delta E < 0. For the rest of the
   (Fe81-xCoxGa19)(80)B-20 with x not equal 0, their stress-strain curves
   are normal with Delta E > 0. Because the sign of lambda(S) of the A2
   phase is opposite to that of the D0(19) and L1(2) phases, lambda(S) of
   (Fe81-xCoxGa19)(80)B-20 is much reduced. However, Delta E/E-0 is
   approximately equal to 36\% is quite large for (Fe58Co23Ga19)(80)B-20.

Abstract = {{In many applications, we assume that two random observations x and y are
   generated according to independent Poisson distributions P(lambda S) and

   trials, x and y are typically the numbers of cases in the vaccine and
   the control groups respectively, phi is called the relative risk and the
   statistical model is called `partial immunity model'. In this paper we
   start by defining a natural semi-conjugate family of prior distributions
   for this model, allowing straightforward computation of the posterior
   inference. Following theory on reference priors, we define the reference
   prior for the partial immunity model when phi is the parameter of
   interest. We also define a family of reference priors with partial
   information on mu while remaining uninformative about phi. We notice
   that these priors belong to the semi-conjugate family. We then
   demonstrate using numerical examples that Bayesian credible intervals
   for phi enjoy attractive frequentist properties when using reference
   priors, a typical property of reference priors.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The self-medication hypothesis is commonly put forward to
   explain the high prevalence of smoking in psychiatric patients. However,
   studies supporting the self-medication hypothesis have most often been
   carried out on chronic patients stabilized by antipsychotics. Aim: Given
   that antipsychotics tend to erase psychiatric symptoms, the present
   study was undertaken on acutely ill patients usually receiving no
   medications, or on whom medications are ineffective. Methods:
   Participants were 492 consecutively hospitalized patients. They were
   evaluated the day of their hospitalization with the Brief Psychiatric
   Rating Scale (BPRS, 18 items). Urinary cotinine and creatinine were
   measured the morning following their hospitalization. The urinary
   cotinine/creatinine ratio and the cotinine/creatinine/number of
   cigarettes smoked per day ratio (nicotine extraction index) were
   calculated for each patient. Results: The positive symptoms subscale of
   the BPRS significantly correlated with smoking, whereas other BPRS
   subscales did not. In patients with mood disorder, the nicotine
   extraction index correlated with the positive symptoms, activation and
   hostility subscales, but not with the negative symptoms subscale.
   Analyses of individual BPRS items using the cotinine/creatinine ratio
   measure showed that smoking is positively associated with ``unusual
   thought content{''} and ``grandiosity{''} items and negatively
   associated with ``guilt feeling{''}, ``depressed mood{''} and ``motor
   retardation{''}. Analyses of individual BPRS items using the nicotine
   extraction index showed a positive association only with ``unusual
   thought content{''} and ``grandiosity{''} items. Patients with
   schizophrenia extract more nicotine from cigarettes than other patients.
   Conclusion: In acutely ill psychiatric patients, smoking is linked with
   positive symptoms and not with negative symptoms.}},

   children in a nationally representative sample from Canada.
   Methods Data from the Canadian Health Measures Survey 2007/2009, a
   cross-sectional survey assessing indicators of health and wellness in
   Canadians, was used in the current study. The analysis included 2087
   children and adolescents between 6-19 years of age with valid measures
   of body mass index (BMI). Poisson/negative binomial regression was used
   to examine the association between weight status and the number of
   medications taken in the last month.
   Result For 6-11 year olds, the frequency of prescription,
   over-the-counter and natural health product (NHP) medication use did not
   differ between normal weight and overweight/obese children. For 12-19
   year olds, overweight/obese children used prescription medication
   significantly more often than their normal weight peers (adjusted
   incidence rate ratio (IRR), 1.59; 95\% CI 1.19 to 2.14), whereas for NHP
   the opposite was the case (adjusted IRR, 0.52; 95\% CI 0.32 to 0.82).
   These children also used nervous system and respiratory medications more
   frequently than their normal weight peers.
   Conclusion The findings of the present study suggest that the
   differential usage of prescription drugs among overweight/obese children
   underline the need to develop effective obesity prevention programmes
   and policies that may reduce the health and economic burden of childhood
   obesity.}},

Abstract = {{In this population-based retrospective study, we sought to investigate
   the association between HIV/AIDS during pregnancy and adverse birth
   outcomes, including low birth weight (LBW), very low birth weight
   (VLBW), preterm birth (PTB), very preterm birth (VPTB), and small for
   gestational age (SGA), among women in Florida by socio-demographic
   variables. Using data from Florida's maternally linked birth cohort
   files, we examined singleton live births in the state during 1998 to
   2007 (N = 1,698,107). The study population was categorized based on the
   maternal HIV/AIDS status. Poisson regression models were used to
   generate adjusted rate ratios (ARR) to estimate the association between
   HIV/AIDS status and fetal growth parameters. The main outcome measures
   were fetal growth parameters, including LBW, VLBW, PTB, VPTB, and SGA.
   As compared to HIV/AIDS-negative women, mothers with HIV/AIDS had
   elevated risks for LBW (ARR = 1.40; 95\% CI = 1.30-1.50), VLBW (ARR =
   1.25; 95\% CI = 1.04-1.51), SGA (ARR = 1.26; 95\% CI = 1.17-1.35), PTB
   (ARR = 1.23; 95\% CI = 1.03-1.47), and VPTB (ARR = 1.27; 95\% CI =
   1.20-1.36). Risk estimates for LBW and SGA were highest among Hispanics
   mothers with HIV/AIDS, while white mothers with HIV/AIDS had the highest
   risk levels for VLBW and PTB, compared to their HIV/AIDS negative
   counterparts. Our findings show that women with HIV/AIDS have elevated
   risks for inhibited fetal growth and shortened gestation with important
   racial/ethnic variation. This is the first known population-based study
   that reveals racial/ethnic differences in HIV/AIDS-related fetal growth
   morbidity outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Designing micro-structures that lead to materials with negative
   Poisson's ratio, the so-called auxetics, is studied here with techniques
   of topology optimization for compliant mechanisms. Compliant mechanisms
   are monolithic structures that are able to deliver two or more different
   motions depending on the applied loading. Single and multi-objective
   topology optimization problems for the design of compliant mechanisms
   are formulated. This formulation together with simple homogenization
   thoughts links the behavior of the flexible microstructure with the
   overall, homogenized continuum and, in particular, the negative
   Poisson's ratio effect (auxetic material). Due to the local minima that
   arise, iterative local search methods are not very effective. On the
   other hand genuine global optimization algorithms may become too
   expensive, due to the large number of design variables. A hybrid method
   based on global optimization algorithms such as Particle Swarm
   Optimization (PSO) and Differential Evolution (DE), using an iterative
   local search method as an evaluation tool is proposed and tested. The
   iterative local method is based on discretization of the design space
   with truss elements. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Enhancement of Young's moduli and auxetic windows in laminates with

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{58}},
Pages = {{95-114}},

Abstract = {{Recently an enhancement of certain mechanical properties of composites
   have been shown to be attained by the introduction of auxetic phases
   (materials with negative Poisson's value) such as indentation
   resistance, fracture toughness and improved energy absorption. Here one
   aim is to use well-known closed-form formulas for the effective
   stiffness and engineering constants of a periodic composite where the
   repetitive cell is a laminate of n elastic isotropic constituents. The
   formulas are given as a function of the elastic stiffnesses or in terms
   of the engineering constants of the constituents and their volume
   fraction. Effective mechanical properties are independent of the order
   in which the laminas are taken. In order to confirm the theoretical
   formulas and show them reliable, comparisons with two independent
   numerical calculations using finite element are given. They are
   excellent. For a bilaminate the conditions by which Young's moduli are
   enhanced are given. Also we provide expressions for auxetic and
   enhancement windows. The stiffness constants exhibit certain
   characteristics associated with auxetics such as the negatively of
   non-diagonal components of the stiffness tensor. It is shown that the
   laminas combination of positive-positive materials may be produce
   enhancement of Young's moduli as some auxetic-auxetic ones. The relative
   indentation compliance of a circular punch upon transversely isotropic
   medium is calculated using Fabrikant's formulas. Two different
   indentations are considered. In one the indenter and the bilaminate are
   frictionless contact and in the other they are bonded. The indentation
   attains the asymptotic limits of Boussinesq or Mossakovskii-Spence when
   the auxetic phase is very thin compared with the width of the
   non-auxetic phase and in the opposite case. The results given here may
   be of interest in practical applications using composites with auxetic
   constituents when the microstructure is small compared with the
   dimensions of the laminate. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A new design principle is suggested for constructing auxetic structures
   - the structures that exhibit negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) at
   macroscopic level. We propose 2D assemblies of identical units made of a
   flexible frame with a sufficiently rigid reinforcing core at the centre.
   The core increases the frame resistance to the tangential movement thus
   ensuring high shear stiffness, whereas the normal stiffness is low being
   controlled by the local bending response of the frame. The structures
   considered have hexagonal symmetry, which delivers macroscopically
   isotropic elastic properties in the plane perpendicular to the axis of
   the symmetry. We determine the macroscopic Poisson's ratio as a ratio of
   corresponding relative displacements computed using the direct
   microstructural approach. It is demonstrated that the proposed design
   can produce a macroscopically isotropic system with NPR close to the
   lower bound of -1. We also developed a 2D elastic Cosserat continuum
   model, which represents the microstructure as a regular assembly of
   rigid particles connected by elastic springs. The comparison of values
   of NPRs computed using both structural models and the continuum approach
   shows that the continuum model gives a healthy balance between the
   simplicity and accuracy and can be used as a simple tool for design of
   auxetics. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This article examines the relationship between personality disorder (PD)
   symptoms and personality traits using a variety of distributional
   assumptions. Prior work in this area relies almost exclusively on linear
   models that treat PD symptoms as normally distributed and continuous.
   However, these assumptions rarely hold, and thus the results of prior
   studies are potentially biased. Here we explore the effect of varying
   the distributions underlying regression models relating PD
   symptomatology to personality traits using the initial wave of the
   Longitudinal Study of Personality Disorders (N = 250; Lenzenweger,
   1999), a university-based sample selected to include PD rates resembling
   epidemiological samples. PD symptoms were regressed on personality
   traits. The distributions underlying the dependent variable (i.e., PD
   symptoms) were variously modeled as normally distributed, as counts
   (Poisson, Negative-Binomial), and with two-part mixture distributions
   (zero-inflated, hurdle). We found that treating symptoms as normally
   distributed resulted in violations of model assumptions, that the
   negative-binomial and hurdle models were empirically equivalent, but
   that the coefficients achieving significance often differ depending on
   which part of the mixture distributions are being predicted (i.e.,
   presence vs. severity of PD). Results have implications for how the
   relationship between normal and abnormal personality is understood.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Since 2000, notifications of HIV and other sexually
   transmitted infections (STIs) have increased significantly in Australian
   gay men. We evaluated the impact of a social marketing campaign in
   2008-2009 aimed to increase health-seeking behavior and STI testing and
   enhance HIV/STI knowledge in gay men.
   Methods: A convenience sample of 295 gay men (18-66 years of age) was
   surveyed to evaluate the effectiveness of the campaign. Participants
   were asked about campaign awareness, HIV/STI knowledge, health-seeking
   behavior, and HIV/STI testing. We examined associations between recent
   STI testing and campaign awareness. Trends in HIV/STI monthly tests at 3
   clinics with a high case load of gay men were also assessed. Logistic
   and Poisson regressions and chi(2) tests were used.
   Results: Both unaided (43\%) and aided (86\%) campaign awareness was
   high. In a multivariable logistic regression, awareness of the campaign
   (aided) was independently associated with having had any STI test within
   the past 6 months (prevalence ratio = 1.5; 95\% confidence interval =
   1.0-2.4. Compared with the 13 months before the campaign, clinic data
   showed significant increasing testing rates for HIV, syphilis, and
   chlamydia among HIV-negative gay men during the initial and continued
   campaign periods.
   Conclusion: These findings suggest that the campaign was successful in
   achieving its aims of increasing health-seeking behavior, STI testing,
   and HIV/STI knowledge among gay men in Victoria.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To provide a broad and up-to-date picture of the effect of
   antiretroviral therapy (ART) provision on population-level mortality in
   Southern and East Africa. Methods Data on all-cause, AIDS and non-AIDS
   mortality among 1559 year olds were analysed from demographic
   surveillance sites (DSS) in Karonga (Malawi), Kisesa (Tanzania), Masaka
   (Uganda) and the Africa Centre (South Africa), using Poisson regression.
   Trends over time from up to 5 years prior to ART roll-out, to 46 years
   afterwards, are presented, overall and by age and sex. For Masaka and
   Kisesa, trends are analysed separately for HIV-negative and HIV-positive
   individuals. For Karonga and the Africa Centre, trends in AIDS and
   non-AIDS mortality are analysed using verbal autopsy data. Results For
   all-cause mortality, overall rate ratios (RRs) comparing the period 26
   years following ART roll-out with the pre-ART period were 0.58 (5.9 vs.
   10.2 deaths per 1000 person-years) in Karonga, 0.79 (7.2 vs. 9.1 deaths
   per 1000 person-years) in Kisesa, 0.61 (6.7 compared with 11.0 deaths
   per 1000 person-years) in Masaka and 0.79 (14.8 compared with 18.6
   deaths per 1000 person-years) in the Africa Centre DSS. The mortality
   decline was seen only in HIV-positive individuals/AIDS mortality, with
   no decline in HIV-negative individuals/non-AIDS mortality. Less
   difference was seen in Kisesa where ART uptake was lower. Conclusions
   Falls in all-cause mortality are consistent with ART uptake. The largest
   falls occurred where ART provision has been decentralised or available
   locally, suggesting that this is important.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To investigate trends in all-cause adult mortality after the
   roll-out of an antiretroviral therapy (ART) programme in rural Uganda.
   Methods Longitudinal population-based cohort study of approximately 20
   000 residents in rural Uganda. Mortality in adults aged 1559 years was
   determined for the 5-year period (19992003) before introduction of ART
   in January 2004 and for the 5-year period afterwards. Poisson regression
   was used to estimate mortality rate ratios (RRs) for the period before
   ART, 1 year after ART introduction (from January 2004 to January 2005)
   and more than 1 year after ART introduction. Trends in mortality were
   analysed by HIV status, age and sex. Results Before ART became
   available, the mortality rate (deaths per 1000 person-years) was 4.0
   (95\% CI = 3.34.8) among HIV-negative individuals and 116.4 (95\% CI =
   101.9133.0) among HIV-positive individuals. During the period January
   2004end November 2009, 279 individuals accessed ART. In the year after
   ART was introduced, the mortality rate (deaths per 1000 person-years)
   among HIV-negative individuals did not change significantly (adjusted RR
   = 0.95, 95\% CI = 0.611.47), but among HIV-positive individuals dropped
   by 25\% to 87.4 (adjusted RR = 0.75, 95\% CI = 0.531.06). In the period
   20052009, the mortality rate (deaths per 1000 person-years) among
   HIV-positive individuals fell further to 39.9 (adjusted RR = 0.33, 95\%
   CI = 0.260.43). The effect was greatest among individuals aged 3044
   years, and trends were similar in men and women. Conclusion The
   substantially reduced mortality rate among HIV-positive individuals
   after ART roll-out lends further support to the intensification of
   efforts to ensure universal access to ART.}},

Abstract = {{Model lattices consisting of balls connected by central-force springs
   provide much of our understanding of mechanical response and phonon
   structure of real materials. Their stability depends critically on their
   coordination number z. d-dimensional lattices with z = 2d are at the
   threshold of mechanical stability and are isostatic. Lattices with z <
   2d exhibit zero-frequency ``floppy{''} modes that provide avenues for
   lattice collapse. The physics of systems as diverse as architectural
   structures, network glasses, randomly packed spheres, and biopolymer
   networks is strongly influenced by a nearby isostatic lattice. We
   explore elasticity and phonons of a special class of two-dimensional
   isostatic lattices constructed by distorting the kagome lattice. We show
   that the phonon structure of these lattices, characterized by vanishing
   bulk moduli and thus negative Poisson ratios (equivalently, auxetic
   elasticity), depends sensitively on boundary conditions and on the
   nature of the kagome distortions. We construct lattices that under free
   boundary conditions exhibit surface floppy modes only or a combination
   of both surface and bulk floppy modes; and we show that bulk floppy
   modes present under free boundary conditions are also present under
   periodic boundary conditions but that surface modes are not. In the
   long-wavelength limit, the elastic theory of all these lattices is a
   conformally invariant field theory with holographic properties
   (characteristics of the bulk are encoded on the sample boundary), and
   the surface waves are Rayleigh waves. We discuss our results in relation
   to recent work on jammed systems. Our results highlight the importance
   of network architecture in determining floppy-mode structure.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: High-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) infection is the
   most common sexually transmitted infection. Penile and cervical cancer
   rates are highest in sub-Saharan Africa. However, little is known about
   the impact of HIV infection on HR-HPV acquisition and clearance among
   heterosexual men.
   Design: HR-HPV incidence and clearance were evaluated in 999 men (776
   HIV-negative and 223 HIV-positive) aged 15-49 years who participated in
   male circumcision trials in Rakai, Uganda.
   Methods: Penile swabs were tested for HR-HPV by Roche HPV Linear Array.
   A Poisson multivariable model was used to estimate adjusted incidence
   rate ratios (adjIRRs) and clearance risk ratios (adjRRs).
   Results: HR-HPV incidence was 66.5/100 person-years in HIV-positive men
   and 32.9/100 person-years among HIV-negative men {[}IRR = 2.02, 95\%
   confidence interval (CI) 1.67-2.44]. Incidence was higher in the
   unmarried men (adjIRR = 1.73, 95\% CI 1.19-2.52), and decreased with age
   (adjIRR for men >35 years = 0.64, 95\% CI 0.43-0.94) and male
   circumcision (adjIRR = 0.70, 95\% CI 0.55-0.89). HR-HPV clearance was
   114.7/100 person-years for HIV-positive men and 170.2/100 person-years
   for HIV-negative men (risk ratio = 0.67, 95\% CI 0.59-0.77). HR-HPV
   clearance in HIV-negative men increased with circumcision (adjRR = 1.48,
   95\% CI 1.26-1.74), HSV-2 infection (adjRR = 1.20, 95\% CI 1.01-1.44),
   and symptoms of urethral discharge (adjRR = 1.35, 95\% CI 1.06-1.73).
   Clearance of HR-HPV was significantly lower for unmarried men (adjRR
   0.76, 95\% CI 0.59-0.98).
   Conclusion: HR-HPV is common among heterosexual Ugandan men,
   particularly the HIV-infected. HIV infection increases HR-HPV
   acquisition and reduces HR-HPV clearance. Promotion of male circumcision
   and additional prevention measures, such as HPV vaccination, is critical
   in sub-Saharan Africa. (C) 2012 Wolters Kluwer Health vertical bar

Abstract = {{While elastic modulus is tunable in tissue engineering scaffolds, it is
   substantially more challenging to tune the Poisson's ratio of scaffolds.
   In certain biological applications, scaffolds with a tunable Poisson's
   ratio may be more suitable for emulating the behavior of native tissue
   mechanics. Here, we design and fabricate a scaffold, which exhibits
   simultaneous negative and positive Poisson's ratio behavior. Custom-made
   digital micro-mirror device stereolithography was used to fabricate
   single- and multiple-layer scaffolds using polyethylene glycol-based
   biomaterial. These scaffolds are composed of pore structures having
   special geometries, and deformation mechanisms, which can be tuned to
   exhibit both negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) and positive Poisson's ratio
   (PPR) behavior in a side-to-side or top-to-bottom configuration. Strain
   measurement results demonstrate that analytical deformation models and
   simulations accurately predict the Poisson's ratios of both the NPR and
   PPR regions. This hybrid Poisson's ratio property can be imparted to any
   photocurable material, and potentially be applicable in a variety of
   biomedical applications. (C) 2012 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by

Abstract = {{The paper reports results on the high performance of novel piezo-active
   composites based on relaxor-ferroelectric single crystals (SCs) of
   xPb(In0.5Nb0.5)O3yPb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3(1-x-y)PbTiO3. We present a
   comparative analysis of the electromechanical properties of 22-type
   composites based on single-domain SCs from symmetry classes 3m and mm2.
   The parallel connection of the layers, the presence of an auxetic
   polymer component and the appropriate orientation of the main
   crystallographic axes of the single-crystal layers lead to the
   development of large piezoelectric anisotropy and considerable
   hydrostatic piezoelectric response in comparison to the single-crystal
   component. Effective piezoelectric coefficients d(3j){*} and
   electromechanical coupling factors k(3j){*} of the composites obey the
   conditions d(33){*}/d(31){*}vertical bar >= 10, d(33){*}/vertical bar
   d(32){*}vertical bar >= 10,k(33){*}/vertical bar k(31){*}vertical bar >=
   10, and k(33){*}/vertical bar k(32){*} vertical bar >= 10 at k(33){*}
   approximate to 0.6. Hydrostatic piezoelectric coefficients
   d(h){*}approximate to 470 pC/N and g(h){*} similar to (10(2)10(3))mVm/N
   are one to two orders-of-magnitude larger than those of the
   single-crystal component, which make it attractive for various
   piezotechnical applications. The role of the elastic properties of the
   components is discussed in connection with the large hydrostatic

Abstract = {{Materials exhibiting auxetic behaviour get fatter when stretched (i.e.
   possess a negative Poisson's ratio). This property has been closely
   related to particular geometrical features of a system and how it
   deforms. One of the mechanisms which is known to have a potential to
   generate such behaviour is that of rotating rigid units. Several models
   based on this concept have been developed, including two-dimensional as
   well as three-dimensional (3D) models. In this work, we propose a new 3D
   structure constructed from rigid cuboids which also deform through
   relative rotation of the units. In particular, analytical models for the
   mechanical properties, namely the Poisson's ratio and the Young's
   moduli, are derived and it is shown that for loading on-axis, these
   systems have the potential to exhibit negative values for all the six
   on-axis Poisson's ratios.}},

Abstract = {{The growing demand for tyres in transport industry provides a negative
   impact on the environment, due to the problems related to recycling and
   disposal of the rubber waste. However, adding waste tyres as a
   dispersive phase in polymeric composites has shown high toughness and
   moderate increase of mechanical strength within the composites. In this
   work, we investigate the use of recycled rubber core to manufacture
   auxetic (re-entrant) honeycomb structures. The re-entarnt honeycombs
   produced are evaluated using finite element analysis and tensile
   in-plane to assess the sensitivity of the mechanical properties versus
   the cell geometric parameters. A full factorial design (33) was
   performed to investigate the effects of the factors width (10 and
   20?mm), thickness (2 and 4?mm) and angle (-10 and -20 degrees) on
   Poisson's ratio of honeycomb structures. The results give further
   evidence that the Poisson's ratio is affected not only by individual
   factors but also by interaction originated by the other geometric
   parameters.}},

Abstract = {{Materials with unusual mechanical properties can be potentially used as
   matrices to create high-performance lightweight composites. The
   appearance of materials with negative Poisson's ratio (auxetics), has
   led to the evaluation of auxetic composites for possible engineering
   applications. Because the experimental evaluation of composites with
   specific properties is expensive and time consuming, computational
   modelling and simulation provide efficient alternatives to predict the
   parameters of the composites. In this paper a finite element method was
   used to find the engineering constants (Young's modulus and Poisson's
   ratio) of auxetic composites consisting of concentric cylindrical
   inclusions made of combinations of auxetic and classic (non-auxetic)
   materials. It has been observed that not only the mechanical properties
   of the different composite phases influence the effective mechanical
   properties of the whole composite, but also the location of the same
   material phases do matter.}},

Abstract = {{Previously, a sandwich structure in which the Poisson ratios of the core
   and facesheets possess opposite signs has been shown to exhibit overall
   conventional and auxetic behavior depending on the loading mode axial
   loading or bending for an intermediate range of relative core thickness.
   In addition to these two loading modes, sandwich structures in aerospace
   applications encounter torsional loads. In this paper, the effective
   Poisson's ratio for torsional loading is proposed. Results show that,
   depending on the loading mode and the relative core thickness, there can
   be up to four levels of overall auxeticity, namely (i) full auxeticity
   (FA) if the structure behaves as an auxetic structure under all three
   modes of loading, (ii) high auxeticity (HA) if the structure behaves as
   an auxetic structure in two of the loading modes, (iii) low auxeticity
   (LA) if the structure behaves as an auxetic structure in only one of the
   loading modes, and (iv) no auxeticity (NA) if the structure behaves as a
   conventional structure under all of the three loading modes. These
   results indicate that by selecting the Poisson's ratios and the
   thickness of the cores and facesheets, the sandwich structure can be
   made to respond differently under different external loading conditions.}},

Abstract = {{A number of basic features of the mechanical properties of a cubic
   symmetry solid material are identified and discussed within the
   framework of the XY-plane approach, where X?=?G/K, Y?=?G/W, K is the
   bulk modulus and G, W are shear moduli. An anisotropic part of the Debye
   temperature is analysed, which was found to be weakly dependent on X and
   is mainly determined by Y which quantifies the material elastic
   anisotropy. The anisotropic part has a considerable effect on the Debye
   temperature of partially auxetic materials. An empirical
   ductility-brittleness criterion is considered, which indicates that many
   auxetics may deform in a brittle manner. A possible correlation between
   directional tensile deformation and the surface of the most extreme
   Poisson's ratio (PR) values is suggested. Finally, the reasons for the
   paucity of cubic materials in the part of the XY-plane with low Y values
   is investigated using static microscopic models in which the particles
   interact with nearest and next nearest neighbours only. An example of a
   type of microscopic model system located in this empty region has been
   found, which consists of a system under tension, where the interparticle
   interaction decays with distance in an oscillatory way. The results
   obtained suggest that a rather unconventional form of the interparticle
   interaction set and thermodynamic conditions may therefore be required
   to develop a solid material with these mechanical properties.}},

   nonlinear terms. The obtained results are compared with some exact
   analytic solutions, called solitons, what leads to the conclusion that
   the solitons describe well the more complicated wave fields which are
   obtained by numerical simulations. This is because the analytic
   solutions reflect complete balance between various orders of
   nonlinearity and dispersion. Collisions between some obtained solitary
   waves are also presented.}},

Abstract = {{Estrogen receptor (ER) status is important for breast cancer survival,
   it is however unclear how prognosis of contralateral breast cancer (CBC)
   is affected by ER-status of the two tumors. We conducted a large,
   population-based study of ER-status of both tumors in CBC patients and
   its influence on prognosis. The cohort consisted of all women diagnosed
   with CBC in Stockholm, Sweden during 1976-2005, with information on
   ER-status from medical records (N = 933). Prognosis was modeled as
   incidence rates of distant metastasis via Poisson regression. The
   proportion of CBCs with both cancers of the same ER-status was
   significantly larger than expected by chance. For synchronous
   (simultaneous) cancers the prognosis was significantly affected by the
   combined ER-status of both tumors (p = 0.01). Compared to unilateral
   breast cancer patients the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for patients with
   double ER-positive tumors was 1.25 (95 \% CI: 0.88-1.76), for
   ER-discordant tumors 2.19 (95 \% CI: 1.18-4.08) and for double
   ER-negative tumors 3.95 (95 \% CI: 1.77-8.81). For metachronous
   (non-simultaneous) cancers, women with double ER-positive tumors had
   similarly bad prognosis (IRR = 2.95; 95 \% CI: 2.39-3.64) as women with
   double ER-negative tumors (IRR = 2.88; 95 \% CI: 1.83-4.52). Both
   shorter time span between first and second cancer and endocrine therapy
   for the first cancer further worsened prognosis of women with double
   ER-positive metachronous CBC. For synchronous CBC patients, ER-pattern
   of both tumors is an important prognosticator, while among metachronous
   CBC patients, double ER-positive tumors confer equally bad prognosis as
   double ER-negative cancers. Our results indicate that this might be due
   to endocrine therapy resistance.}},

Abstract = {{The nonlinear ion-acoustic double layers (IADLs) in a warm magnetoplasma
   with positive-negative ions and nonthermal electrons are investigated.
   For this purpose, the hydrodynamic equations for the positive-negative
   ions, nonthermal electron density distribution, and the Poisson equation
   are used to derive a modified Zakharov-Kuznetsov (MZK) equation, in the
   small amplitude regime. It is found that compressive and rarefactive
   IADLs strongly depend on the mass and density ratios of the
   negative-to-positive ions as well as the nonthermal electron parameter.
   Also, it is shown that there are one critical value for the density
   ratio of the negative-to-positive ions (nu), the ratio between
   unperturbed electron-to-positive ion density (mu), and the nonthermal
   electron parameter (beta), which decide the existence of positive and
   negative IADLs. The present study is applied to examine the small
   amplitude nonlinear IADL excitations for the and (H+,H-) plasmas, where
   they are found in the D- and F-regions of the Earth's ionosphere. This
   investigation should be helpful in understanding the salient features of
   the nonlinear IADLs in either space or laboratory plasmas where two
   distinct groups of ions and non-Boltzmann distributed electrons are
   present.}},

Abstract = {{The combination of cationic lipids with cationic peptides and DNA
   vectors can produce synergistic effects in gene delivery to eukaryotic
   cells. Binary complexes of cationic lipids with DNA are well-studied
   whereas little information is available about the structure of the
   ternary lipid/peptide/DNA (LPD) complexes and mechanisms defining DNA
   protection and delivery. Here we use synchrotron small angle X-ray
   scattering and dynamic light scattering zeta-potential measurements to
   determine structure and the net charge of supramolecular aggregates of
   complexes in mixtures of plasmid DNA, cationic liposomes formed from
   DOTAP, plus a linear cationic epsilon-oligolysine with the pendant
   alpha-amino acids Leu-Tyr-Arg (LYR), epsilon-(LYR)K10. These ternary
   complexes display multilamellar structures with relatively constant
   separation between DOTAP bilayers, accommodating a hydrated monolayer of
   parallel DNA rods. The DNA-DNA distance in the complexes varies as a
   function of the net positive to negative (lipid + peptide)/DNA charge
   ratio. An explanation for the observed dependence of DNA-DNA distance on
   charge ratio was proposed based on general polyelectrolyte properties of
   non-stoichiometric polycation-DNA mixtures. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{A range of modes of mobility for spatial structures can be achieved by
   selecting the rotational features of the joints. Similar mechanical
   characteristics are observed in structures ranging from molecules to

   repetitive motion structure assembled with straight rigid bars connected
   by 8-bar pivot joints. By determining the rotational modes of the 8-bar
   joint with certain geometrical constraints, we introduce some telescopic
   transformations of the proposed structure producing both well-known and
   novel motions. In addition, we verify one of the deployable mechanisms
   by manufacturing it and testing activation by a single rotary operation.

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS B}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{14}},
Month = {{JUN 10}},
Abstract = {{We investigate the configuration of gel sheets with centrosymmetric
   distribution of monomer concentration in this paper. The configuration
   energy of these gel sheets consists of the in-plane stretching energy
   and bending energy. The equilibrium shape equations are derived by
   variation principle. This provides a way to control the shape of gel
   sheets by the initial concentration and thickness. From the equilibrium
   shape equations, we know that the Gaussian curvature on boundary (K|C)
   of equilibrium shape is determined by the Poisson ratio (v) over cap.
   K|C is negative when (v) over cap > 0 but positive when (v) over cap <
   0. Specially, we derive two dome-like solutions from the equilibrium
   shape equations to compare with the experimental data. In these
   dome-like sheets, on the boundary part the Gaussian curvature is K < 0,
   which is different from the center part (K > 0). Furthermore, we deduce
   that the initial gel distribution of cylinder sheets is proportional to
   1/r and find that N-isopropylacrylamide cylinder sheets cannot be formed
   without additional edges. Our theoretical results agree well with the
   experimental data {[}Klein et al., Science 315, 1116 (2007)]. On the
   other hand, we predict a special type of gel sheets as minimal surface.
   Their residual stresses are constant and same along radial and
   circumference directions. For axisymmetric sheets, we give a criterion
   about the sign of Gaussian curvature K when thickness h is infinite
   small.}},

Abstract = {{We derive some statistical properties of the distribution of two
   Negative Binomial random variables conditional on their total. This type
   of model can be appropriate for paired count data with Poisson
   over-dispersion such that the variance is a quadratic function of the
   mean. This statistical model is appropriate in many ecological
   applications including comparative fishing studies of two vessels and or
   gears. The parameter of interest is the ratio of pair means. We show
   that the conditional means and variances are different from the more
   commonly used Binomial model with variance adjusted for over-dispersion,
   or the Beta-Binomial model. The conditional Negative Binomial model is
   complicated because it does not eliminate nuisance parameters like in
   the Poisson case. Maximum likelihood estimation with the unconditional
   Negative Binomial model can result in biased estimates of the
   over-dispersion parameter and poor confidence intervals for the ratio of
   means when there are many nuisance parameters. We propose three
   approaches to deal with nuisance parameters in the conditional Negative
   Binomial model. We also study a random effects Binomial model for this
   type of data, and we develop an adjustment to the full-sample Negative
   Binomial profile likelihood to reduce the bias caused by nuisance
   parameters. We use simulations with these methods to examine bias,
   precision, and accuracy of estimators and confidence intervals. We
   conclude that the maximum likelihood method based on the full-sample
   Negative Binomial adjusted profile likelihood produces the best
   statistical inferences for the ratio of means when paired counts have
   Negative Binomial distributions. However, when there is uncertainty
   about the type of Poisson over-dispersion then a Binomial random effects
   model is a good choice.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: To estimate temporal trends in burn injury hospitalisations,
   mortality and hospital stay, for older adults with a burn-related
   hospitalisation. Methods: De-identified data of all incident burn
   hospitalisations for adults 60 years and older in Western Australia from
   19832008 were analysed. Poisson regression analyses were used to
   estimate temporal trends in hospital admissions and mortality. Zero
   truncated negative binomial regression analysis was used to identify
   factors associated with hospital stay. Results: Between 1983 and 2008,
   hospitalisation rates increased for scalds (incident rate ratio (IRR)
   1.01, 95\% CI: 1.001.02) and contact burns (IRR 1.05, 95\% CI: 1.031.07)
   while a significant reduction in flame hospitalisation rates (IRR 0.93,
   95\% CI: 0.920.94) was estimated. No significant changes in length of

Abstract = {{Objective: The goal of this study was to analyze trends in the annual
   rates of reported medical outcomes of US copperhead (Agkistrodon
   contortrix) snakebites published in the annual reports of the American
   Association of Poison Control Centers in the course of 26 years.
   Methods: This was a retrospective analysis of medical outcomes for
   copperhead snakebite victims who developed fatal, major, moderate,
   minor, or no effects. The annual rates for these medical outcomes were
   calculated by dividing the annual number of patients in each outcome
   category by the total annual number of people reported as being bitten
   by copperheads. Poisson and negative binomial regression were used to
   examine trends in annual rates.
   Results: From 1983 through 2008, the incidence rate of copperhead
   snakebites causing no effect significantly decreased by 12.1\%/year
   (incidence rate ratio {[}IRR] 0.879; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI]
   0.848-0.911]. From 1985 through 2008, the incidence rate of minor
   outcomes significantly decreased by 2.3\%/year (IRR 0.977; 95\% CI
   0.972-0.981), whereas the rate of moderate outcomes significantly
   increased by 2.8\%/year (IRR 1.028; 95\% CI 1.024-1.033). The rate of
   major outcomes did not significantly change. One fatality was reported
   in 2001.
   Conclusions: Annual rates of copperhead snakebites producing no effects
   and minor outcomes significantly decreased, those producing moderate
   outcomes significantly increased, and those producing major outcomes did
   not significantly change in a 26-year period.}},

Abstract = {{Diets low in fruits and vegetables and/or high in fast foods are
   associated with obesity and chronic diseases. Such diets may relate to
   different aspects of neighborhood food environments. We sought to
   evaluate if people's perceptions of their neighborhood food environment
   are associated with reported fruit-and-vegetable and fast-food
   consumption.
   Cross-sectional analysis of a community health survey from Philadelphia,
   PA and four surrounding suburban counties (n = 10,450 individuals). We
   used mixed-effects multi-level Poisson models, nesting individuals
   within neighborhoods-i.e. census tracts (n = 991).
   Negative perceptions of the food environment (perceived difficulty
   finding fruits and vegetables, having to travel outside of one's
   neighborhood to get to a supermarket, and perceived poor grocery
   quality) were each directly associated with fast-food consumption
   (incident rate ratios {[}IRRs] 1.31, 1.06, 1.20; p < 0.001, 0.04, <
   0.001 respectively), but not significantly associated with
   fruit-and-vegetable consumption.
   Perceived difficulty finding or accessing produce and high-quality
   groceries may support the eating of more fast food. Neighborhoods where
   food-environment perceptions are worst might benefit from interventions
   to improve availability, accessibility, and quality of healthy foods,
   towards shifting consumption away from fast foods.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Prompt linkage to HIV primary care may reduce the need for
   inpatient hospitalization.
   Methods: Retrospective cohort study of South Carolina HIV-infected
   individuals diagnosed from January 1986 to December 2006 who utilized 62
   inpatient facilities from (January 2007 to June 2010). Suboptimal
   primary care engagement was defined as <2 reports of a CD4(+)T-cell
   count or viral load value to surveillance in each calendar year from
   January 2007 to June 2010. Multivariable logistic regression explored
   associations of HIV primary care engagement with inpatient
   hospitalization after accounting for sociodemographic characteristics
   and disease stage. Poisson and negative binominal regression examined
   primary care engagement, sociodemographic characteristics, and disease
   stage on frequency of inpatient hospitalization and total inpatient
   days.
   Results: Individuals presenting to the hospital with an AIDS-defining
   illness had greater risk of suboptimal HIV primary care engagement

   hospitalizations (IRR = 1.09; 95\% CI: 1.01 to 1.18). AIDS disease stage
   was associated with decreased suboptimal care risk (AIDS <= 1 year, aOR
   = 0.05; 95\% CI: 0.02 to 0.12; AIDS > 1 year, aOR = 0.11; 95\% CI: 0.06

Abstract = {{Objective: Hypopituitarism is associated with an increased mortality
   rate but the reasons underlying this have not been fully elucidated. The
   purpose of this study was to evaluate mortality and associated factors
   within a large GH-replaced population of hypopituitary patients.
   Design: In KIMS (Pfizer International Metabolic Database) 13 983
   GH-deficient patients with 69 056 patient-years of follow-up were
   available.
   Methods: This study analysed standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) by
   Poisson regression. IGF1 SDS was used as an indicator of adequacy of GH
   replacement. Statistical significance was set to P<0.05.
   Results: All-cause mortality was 13\% higher compared with normal
   population rates (SMR, 1.13; 95\% confidence interval, 1.04-1.24).
   Significant associations were female gender, younger age at follow-up,
   underlying diagnosis of Cushing's disease, craniopharyngioma and
   aggressive tumour and presence of diabetes insipidus. After controlling
   for confounding factors, there were statistically significant negative
   associations between IGF1 SDS after 1, 2 and 3 years of GH replacement
   and SMR. For cause-specific mortality there was a negative association
   between 1-year IGF1 SDS and SMR for deaths from cardiovascular diseases
   (P=0.017) and malignancies (P=0.044).
   Conclusions: GH-replaced patients with hypopituitarism demonstrated a
   modest increase in mortality rate; this appears lower than that
   previously published in GH-deficient patients. Factors associated with

Abstract = {{The equation of state, elastic constants, and Poisson's ratio of a
   crystalline two-dimensional polydisperse hard disk system were
   determined in the close packing limit. Monte Carlo simulations in the
   NpT ensemble with variable shape of the periodic box reveal that the
   pressure and elastic constants grow with increasing polydispersity. The
   equation of state and the bulk modulus are well described by the free
   volume approximation. The latter approximation fails, however, for the
   shear modulus. The simulations also show that the introduction of any
   amount of size polydispersity in the hard disk systems causes a
   discontinuous ``jump{''} of the Poisson's ratio in the close packing
   limit from the value nu(delta=0) = 0.1308(22), obtained for equidiameter
   hard disks, to nu(delta>0) approximate to 1, estimated for the
   polydisperse disks. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Title = {{A review of statistical estimators for risk-adjusted length of stay:
   analysis of the Australian and new Zealand intensive care adult patient
   data-base, 2008-2009}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{MAY 16}},
Abstract = {{Background: For the analysis of length-of-stay (LOS) data, which is
   characteristically right-skewed, a number of statistical estimators have
   been proposed as alternatives to the traditional ordinary least squares
   (OLS) regression with log dependent variable.
   Methods: Using a cohort of patients identified in the Australian and New
   Zealand Intensive Care Society Adult Patient Database, 2008-2009, 12
   different methods were used for estimation of intensive care (ICU)
   length of stay. These encompassed risk-adjusted regression analysis of
   firstly: log LOS using OLS, linear mixed model {[}LMM], treatment
   effects, skew-normal and skew-t models; and secondly: unmodified (raw)
   LOS via OLS, generalised linear models {[}GLMs] with log-link and 4
   different distributions {[}Poisson, gamma, negative binomial and
   inverse-Gaussian], extended estimating equations {[}EEE] and a finite
   mixture model including a gamma distribution. A fixed covariate list and
   ICU-site clustering with robust variance were utilised for model fitting
   with split-sample determination (80\%) and validation (20\%) data sets,
   and model simulation was undertaken to establish over-fitting (Copas
   test). Indices of model specification using Bayesian information
   criterion {[}BIC: lower values preferred] and residual analysis as well
   as predictive performance (R-2, concordance correlation coefficient
   (CCC), mean absolute error {[}MAE]) were established for each estimator.
   Results: The data-set consisted of 111663 patients from 131 ICUs; with
   mean(SD) age 60.6(18.8) years, 43.0\% were female, 40.7\% were
   mechanically ventilated and ICU mortality was 7.8\%. ICU length-of-stay
   was 3.4(5.1) (median 1.8, range (0.17-60)) days and demonstrated marked
   kurtosis and right skew (29.4 and 4.4 respectively). BIC showed
   considerable spread, from a maximum of 509801 (OLS-raw scale) to a
   minimum of 210286 (LMM). R2 ranged from 0.22 (LMM) to 0.17 and the CCC
   from 0.334 (LMM) to 0.149, with MAE 2.2-2.4. Superior residual behaviour
   was established for the log-scale estimators. There was a general
   tendency for over-prediction (negative residuals) and for over-fitting,
   the exception being the GLM negative binomial estimator. The
   mean-variance function was best approximated by a quadratic function,
   consistent with log-scale estimation; the link function was estimated
   (EEE) as 0.152(0.019, 0.285), consistent with a fractional-root
   function.
   Conclusions: For ICU length of stay, log-scale estimation, in particular
   the LMM, appeared to be the most consistently performing estimator(s).
   Neither the GLM variants nor the skew-regression estimators dominated.}},

Abstract = {{The frequency-wavenumber spectra of laminated media often exhibit
   anomalous modes with descending branches whose group velocity is
   negative, and these terminate at a minimum point at which the group
   velocity transitions from negative to positive. These minima are
   associated with resonant conditions in the medium, which have been
   clearly observed in experiments and in the nondestructive testing of
   laminated plates. Starting from first principles, this paper provides a
   theoretical analysis on the number and location of such
   zero-group-velocity (ZGV) modes for horizontally layered media bounded
   by any arbitrary combination of external boundaries. It is found that
   these ZGV points are few in number and show up mostly in low-order modes
   which are characterized by a negative second derivative at the cutoff
   frequencies, a condition that can readily be tested. It is also shown
   that the effective number of ZGVs is small even when the ratio of the
   dilatational and shear wave velocity is a rational number and there
   exist coincidences in cutoff frequencies, a condition that at first
   would suggest that the number of ZGVs is infinite. Finally, it is shown
   that the number of ZGVs decreases with the Poisson's ratio. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Human papillomavirus (HPV) has been recognized as a major factor for
   cervical cancer causation. Other factors, relating to reproduction, are
   also important. This study aims to disentangle the roles of baseline HPV
   infection, high vaginal parity (defined as having a parts per thousand
   yen4 vaginal deliveries), and the interaction between the two in
   predicting cervical cancer risk.
   The authors apply a newly developed causal-pie modeling technique to
   analyze a cohort of more than 10,000 women conducted in Taiwan with more
   than 10 years of follow-up. The rate ratios adjusted by age and
   menopausal status were further modeled by an additive Poisson regression
   with non-negative parameters. The index of causal-pie weight (CPW) was
   calculated to indicate the proportion of cervical cancer cases
   attributable to a particular class of causal pies.
   It was found that the CPWs are 36.3 \% for baseline HPV infection, 35.6
   \% for baseline HPV infection and high vaginal parity, and 28.1 \% for
   other factors.

Abstract = {{Closed-form expressions for the nine effective elastic constants of a
   binary fiber-reinforced composite with transversely isotropic
   constituents with positive (conventional) and negative (auxetic)
   Poisson's ratio are considered. Such formulae were obtained by means of
   the asymptotic homogenization method and were verified numerically with
   an independent finite element model. The overall properties display
   explicit dependence on (i) the properties of the constituents, (ii) the
   volume fraction or radius of inclusion and (iii) the array periodicity.
   They are finally obtained by solving a normal infinite symmetric linear
   system of algebraic equations by truncation to a relatively small order
   term. This allows a fast solution and low computation cost. The overall
   orthotropy of the elastic properties is obtained by varying the distance
   between the fibers in two of the principal directions leading to
   different spacial aspect ratio for fiber distribution. In addition to
   this, an analytical relation between the effective properties based on
   the symmetry of the stiffness tensor is introduced. With the previous
   elements, we present reliable predictions for auxetic and conventional
   composites of this kind wherein a significant enhancement in Young's
   modulus is found in a composite with an auxetic matrix reinforced by
   conventional fibres. Finally, we compute auxeticity windows (i.e.,
   intervals of volume fraction where the composite is auxetic) when the
   fibres are auxetic. It is reported that spacial fiber aspect ratio plays
   a key role in the composite auxetic behavior. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Background. We examined the epidemiology of community-associated
   methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) nasal colonization
   among 3 groups of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected and 1
   group of HIV-negative outpatients.
   Methods. We determined prevalence and risk factors associated with MRSA
   colonization among women, recently incarcerated, and Hispanic
   HIV-infected patients and HIV-negative patients; isolates were typed by
   pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Relative prevalence was calculated
   using Poisson regression, and logistic regression was used for
   multivariate analysis.
   Results. Of 601 patients, 9.3\% were colonized with MRSA; 11\% of
   HIV-infected and 4.2\% of HIV-negative patients were colonized (relative
   prevalence, 2.6; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI], 1.12-6.07; P = .03).
   Among HIV-infected patients, recently incarcerated patients had the
   highest colonization prevalence (15.6\%) followed by women (12\%);
   Hispanic patients had the lowest (2.8\%). Eighty percent of confirmed
   MRSA isolates were identified as USA300.
   On multivariate analysis, history of incarceration or residence in
   alternative housing (odds ratio {[}OR], 2.3; 95\% CI, 1.1-4.7; P = .03)
   was associated with MRSA colonization; Hispanic ethnicity was negatively
   associated (OR, 0.3; 95\% CI, .11-.98; P = .045). There was a trend (OR,
   1.6; 95\% CI, .9-3.0; P = .097) toward geographic location of residence
   being associated with colonization. After controlling for incarceration,
   residence, and geography, HIV status was no longer significantly
   associated with colonization.
   Conclusions. The CA-MRSA and HIV epidemics have intersected. Examination
   of networks of individuals released from incarceration, both HIV
   positive and negative, is needed to assess the role of social networks
   in spread of CA-MRSA and inform prevention strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Implications of the negative Poisson ratio with regard to the
   quasi-static and dynamic indentation compliances for isotropic
   homogeneous materials are considered. It has been shown that analogously
   to some solutions for three-dimensional stress or displacement fields
   concentrations, the indentation, vibrational, and impact compliances are
   significantly affected when Poisson's ratio of the material assumes
   negative values. It was observed that the friction at the contact
   interface between the indenter and the surface of an elastic medium
   strengthens the negative Poisson ratio effect. In the Hertzian contact
   problem, it was found out that the location of the maximum shear stress
   approaches the contact interface as Poisson's ratio is made sufficiently
   negative. In view of this fact, the local indentation of a coated
   elastic half-space, which is reinforced with an elastic plate, has been
   considered. It was shown that the reinforcement preserves the negative
   Poisson ratio effect, and the perfect bonding of the plate to the
   surface of an auxetic half-space significantly strengthens it. This
   theoretical work be considered as a first step towards an indentation
   and impact analysis of real auxetic materials. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{In this current work, a Ti-6Al-4V 3-D re-entrant lattice auxetic
   structure is manufactured by the electron beam melting (EBM) process.
   Four different design configurations (two negative Poisson's ratio
   values x two relative densities) were manufactured and tested under
   compressive stress. Two failure modes were observed whose occurrence
   appeared to be dependent on the ratio of vertical strut length to
   re-entrant strut length. A small deflection analytical model is
   presented that predicts yield strength and modulus for one type of
   design with good accuracy. Results also show that the re-entrant lattice
   structure possesses superior mechanical properties compared to regular
   foam structures. Limitations of the analytical model are also discussed.

Abstract = {{The deformation micromechanics of bacterial cellulose (BC) and
   microfibrillated cellulose (MFC) networks have been investigated using
   Raman spectroscopy. The Raman spectra of both BC and MFC networks
   exhibit a band initially located at similar to 1095 cm(-1). We have used
   the intensity of this band as a function of rotation angle of the
   specimens to study the cellulose fibril orientation in BC and MFC
   networks. We have also used the change in this peak's wavenumber
   position with applied tensile deformation to probe the stress-transfer
   behavior of these cellulosic materials. The intensity of this Raman band
   did not change significantly with rotation angle, indicating an in-plane
   2D network of fibrils with uniform random orientation; conversely, a
   highly oriented flax fiber exhibited a marked change in intensity with
   rotation angle. Experimental data and theoretical analysis shows that
   the Raman band shift rate arising from deformation of networks under
   tension is dependent on the angles between the axis of fibrils, the
   strain axis, the incident laser polarization direction, and the back
   scattered polarization configurations. From this analysis, the effective
   moduli of single fibrils of BC and MFC in the networks were estimated to
   be in the ranges of 79-88 and 29-36 GPa, respectively. It is shown also
   that for the model to fit the data it is necessary to use a negative
   Poisson's ratio for MFC networks and BC networks. Discussion of this
   in-plane ``auxetic' behavior is given.}},

Abstract = {{Background. The role of seasonal variation in peritoneal dialysis
   (PD)-related peritonitis has been limited to a few small single-centre
   studies.
   Methods. Using all 6610 Australian patients receiving PD between 1
   October 2003 and 31 December 2008, we evaluated the influence of seasons
   on peritonitis rates (Poisson regression) and outcomes (multivariable
   logistic regression).
   Results. The overall rate of peritonitis was 0.59 episodes per
   patient-year of treatment. Using winter as the reference season, the
   peritonitis incidence rate ratios (95\% confidence interval) for summer,
   autumn and spring were 1.02 (0.95-1.09), 1.01 (0.94-1.08) and 0.99
   (0.92-1.06), respectively. Significant seasonal variations were observed
   in the rates of peritonitis caused by coagulase-negative Staphylococci
   (spring and summer peaks), corynebacteria (winter peak) and
   Gram-negative organisms (summer and autumn peaks). There were trends to
   seasonal variations in fungal peritonitis (summer and autumn peaks) and
   pseudomonas peritonitis (summer peak). No significant seasonal
   variations were observed for other organisms. Peritonitis outcomes did
   not significantly vary according to season.
   Conclusions. Seasonal variation has no appreciable influence on overall
   PD peritonitis rates or clinical outcomes. Nevertheless, significant
   seasonal variations were observed in the rates of peritonitis due to
   specific microorganisms, which may allow institutions to more precisely
   target infection control strategies prior to higher risk seasons.}},

Abstract = {{An auxetic material is one which exhibits a negative Poisson's ratio; it
   expands laterally when stretched longitudinally and contracts laterally
   when compressed longitudinally. The helical auxetic yarn is a novel
   fibre structure with a diverse range of potential applications. The
   unusual mechanical properties of the yarn can be determined by
   particular combinations of geometry and component material properties.
   This paper reports on the development of low-stiffness auxetic yarns and
   fabrics which offer a range of applications such as medical devices,
   particularly bandages, compression hosiery and support garments and
   fashion apparel. The mechanical performance of the yarns and fabrics is
   elucidated, with emphasis on the ability to exploit significant changes
   through a prescribed strain range. A yarn Poisson's ratio as low as -1.5
   is demonstrated, and fabrics with in-plane and out-of-plane negative
   Poisson's ratios are illustrated. Stiffness is shown to be highly
   dependent upon yarn geometry.}},

Abstract = {{The Al-Cu-TM (TM transition metal) alloy system has attracted great
   attention for both excellent glass-forming ability and its interesting
   physical properties. In this work, an investigation into the crystal,
   electrical and elastic properties of the AlCu2TM (TM = Ti, Zr, and Hf)
   compounds has been conducted by first-principles calculations based on
   density-functional theory. The fully relaxed structure parameters of the
   AlCu2TM compounds are in good agreement with previous experimental and
   other theoretical results. Besides, the cohesive energies of all the
   AlCu2TM compounds have been evaluated. The energy band and densities of
   state of these compounds are also obtained. According to the calculated
   single crystal elastic constants, all the compounds are mechanically
   stable. The polycrystalline bulk moduli, shear moduli, Young's moduli
   and Poisson's ratio have been deduced by using Voigt-Reuss-Hill (VRH)
   approximations. The calculated negative Cauchy pressure and ratio of
   bulk modulus to shear modulus indicated that the AlCu2TM compounds are
   ductile materials. The Debye temperatures of the AlCu2TM compounds
   decrease with increasing the TM (Ti, Zr, and Hf) atomic number. (C) 2011

Month = {{APR 23}},
Abstract = {{Negative Poisson's ratios have been observed in a variety of metals and
   alloys. However, the electronic origin of this effect remains unclear,
   as is evident by our limited knowledge about intermetallics showing this
   behavior. In an effort to clarify the electronic origin of a negative
   Poisson's ratio, we have performed a systematic and comprehensive study
   of extreme (both positive and negative) Poisson's ratios behavior in the
   B2 CsCl-type AB intermetallic family (including 14 common intermetallics
   and 128 rare-earth-metal transition or main-group-metal intermetallics)
   by way of density functional theory calculations. We found a pronounced
   correlation between the extreme Poisson's ratios and the elastic
   anisotropy, with approximately 70\% of the B2 intermetallics showing
   intrinsic auxetic behavior. We went on to examine the topology and
   geometry of the electron charge density and found that the extreme
   Poisson's ratios are attributable to the directionality of the bonds of
   the material. Auxetic materials were found to have nondirectional bonds,
   and nonauxetic compounds had directional bonds. Our findings provide an
   essential electronic perspective to forecast the auxetic behavior, and
   suggest a new application for intermetallic compounds.}},

   Vaccine Trial Conducted among South African Women}},

Abstract = {{Background: HIV prevention trials are increasingly being conducted in
   sub-Saharan Africa. Women at risk for HIV are also at risk of pregnancy.
   To maximize safety, women agree to avoid pregnancy during trials, yet
   pregnancies occur. Using data from the HVTN 503/{''}Phambili{''} vaccine
   trial, we report pregnancy incidence during and after the vaccination
   period and identify factors, measured at screening, associated with
   incident pregnancy.
   Methods: To enrol in the trial, women agreed and were supported to avoid
   pregnancy until 1 month after their third and final vaccination
   ({''}vaccination period{''}), corresponding to the first 7 months of
   follow-up. Unsterilized women, pooled across study arms, were analyzed.
   Poisson regression compared pregnancy rates during and after the
   vaccination period. Cox proportional hazards regression identified
   associations with first pregnancy.
   Results: Among 352 women (median age 23 yrs; median follow-up 1.5 yrs),
   pregnancy incidence was 9.6/100 women-years overall and 6.8/100 w-yrs
   and 11.3/100 w-yrs during and after the vaccination period, respectively
   {[}Rate Ratio = 0.60 (0.32-1.14), p = 0.10]. In multivariable analysis,
   pregnancy was reduced among women who: enrolled at sites providing
   contraception on-site {[}HR = 0.43, 95\% CI (0.22-0.86)]; entered the
   trial as injectable contraceptive users {[}HR = 0.37 (0.21-0.67)] or as
   consistent condom users (trend) {[}HR = 0.54 (0.28-1.04)]. Compared with
   women with a single partner of HIV-unknown status, pregnancy rates were
   increased among women with: a single partner whose status was
   HIV-negative {[}HR = 2.34(1.16-4.73)] and; 2 partners both of
   HIV-unknown status {[}HR = 4.42(1.59-12.29)]. Women with 2 more of these
   risk factors: marijuana use, heavy drinking, or use of either during
   sex, had increased pregnancy incidence {[}HR = 2.66 (1.24-5.72)].
   Conclusions: It is possible to screen South African women for pregnancy
   risk at trial entry. Providing injectable contraception for free on-site
   and supporting consistent condom use may reduce incident pregnancy.
   Screening should determine the substance use, partnering, and HIV status
   of both members of the couple for both pregnancy and HIV prevention.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NON-NEWTONIAN FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2012}},

Abstract = {{Electroviscous and thermal effects on steady, fully developed, combined
   pressure driven and electroosmotic flow of power-law liquids through a
   uniform microannulus subject to uniform wall heat flux are studied
   numerically by solving the Poisson-Boltzmann, momentum and energy
   equations using a finite difference method. Considering the
   Poisson-Boltzmann equation in the exact form without using the
   Debye-Huckel approximation and taking into account phenomena such as
   viscous dissipation and Joule heating in the energy equation, influences
   of major parameters, namely, the radius ratio of the annuli, flow
   behavior index, dimensionless pressure gradient, dimensionless electric
   force, dimensionless wall zeta potential, Debye-Huckel parameter,
   Brinkman number, and Joule number on the velocity and temperature
   distributions as well as the Nusselt number are discussed. The results
   reveal that higher velocities exist in case of pressure assisted flow
   compared to the purely electroosmotic and pressure opposed flows.
   Moreover, in the presence of a favorable pressure gradient, the system
   experiences the maximum absolute dimensionless temperature. Also, at
   higher values of the Debye-Huckel parameter, the effect of the
   non-Newtonian behavior on the thermal characteristics of the flow
   reduces. As for the Nusselt number, depending on the value of the flow
   parameters some singularities may occur in the Nusselt profile at the
   inner wall for the pressure assisted shear-thinning and shear-thickening
   flows in case of wall cooling. In addition, the effect of Joule heating
   on the inner Nusselt number diminishes as the value of the dimensionless
   electric force approaches relatively high positive or negative values,
   independent of the value of the flow behavior index. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The relation curve between the apparent velocity of S wave and the
   filter-parameter is obtained by low-pass filtering the radial and
   vertical receiver function, then it is transformed into the S velocity
   structure beneath the station with empirical formula; moreover, the S
   velocity structure will be regarded as initial model for receiver
   function inversion. The numerical simulation indicated that the
   inversion processes would approach quickly to the true model once the
   initial S velocity can supply the effective constraint to inversion,
   even if the depth of Moho is not accurate. In addition, for the same
   initial S structure, the inversion results also approach to the true
   model quickly, even adding 10\% of random noises to the ``observed{''}
   receiver function, and 5\% of positive and negative perturbation to the
   velocity ratio (corresponding to the Poisson's ratio of 0.27 and 0.23)
   respectively. We processed the teleseismic receiver function recorded by
   Baoshan station. The result from our method is similar to that of
   sounding section. These confirmed that the inversion processes of
   receiver function are not sensitive to the initial P velocity if the
   initial S wave velocity can provide the effective constraint
   information.}},

Abstract = {{About a 100 nm thick multilayer film of nanoparticle monolayers and
   polymer layers is shown to behave like cellular-foam with a modulus
   below 100 KPa. The 1.25 cm radius film adhered to a rigid surface can be
   compressed reversibly to 60\% strain. The more than 4 orders of
   magnitude lower modulus compared to its constituents is explained by
   considering local bending in the (nano)cellular structure, similar to
   cork and wings of beetles. As the rigidity of the polymer backbone is
   increased in just four monolayers, the modulus of the composite
   increases by over 70\%. Electro-optical map of the strain distribution
   over the area of compression and increase in modulus with thickness
   indicates the films have zero Poisson's ratio.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is dedicated to Prof. Jacques Friedel, an inspirational
   scientist and a great man. His excellence and clear vision led to
   significant advances in theoretical physics, which spilled into material
   science and technological applications. His fundamental theoretical work
   on commonplace materials has become classic. We can think of no better
   tribute to Friedel than to apply a fundamental analysis in his spirit to
   a peculiar class of materials-auxetic materials. Auxetic materials, or
   negative-Poisson'-ratio materials, are important technologically and
   fascinating theoretically. When loaded by external stresses, their
   internal strains are governed by correlated motion of internal
   structural degrees of freedom. The modelling of such materials is mainly
   based on ordered structures, despite the existence of auxetic behaviour
   in disordered structures and the advantage in manufacturing disordered
   structures for most applications. We describe here a first-principles
   expression for strains in disordered such materials, based on insight
   from a family of `iso-auxetic' structures. These are structures,
   consisting of internal structural elements, which we name `auxetons',
   whose inter-element forces can be computed from statics alone.
   Iso-auxetic structures make it possible not only to identify the
   mechanisms that give rise to auxeticity, but also to write down the
   explicit dependence of the strain rate on the local structure, which is
   valid to all auxetic materials. It is argued that stresses give rise to
   strains via two mechanisms: auxeton rotations and auxeton
   expansion/contraction. The former depends on the stress via a local
   fabric tensor, which we define explicitly for 2D systems. The latter
   depends on the stress via an expansion tensor. Whether a material
   exhibits auxetic behaviour or not depends on the interplay between these
   two fields. This description has two major advantages: it applies to any
   auxeton-based system, however disordered, and it goes beyond
   conventional elasticity theory, providing an explicit expression for
   general auxetic strains and outlining the relevant equations.}},

Abstract = {{Background: We aimed to estimate the incidence and predictors of late
   presentation among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected
   individuals in Denmark. Methods: Incidence rates (IR) of presentation
   with advanced HIV (CD4 < 200 cells/mu l and/or acquired immune
   deficiency syndrome (AIDS)) and late presentation (CD4 < 350 cells/mu l
   and/or AIDS) were calculated per 100,000 population aged 16-60 y.
   Mortality rate ratios (MRR) were estimated using Poisson regression
   analysis. Results: Three thousand and twenty-seven individuals were
   diagnosed with HIV in 1995-2009; 34.7\% presented with advanced HIV and
   51.2\% were late presenters. The IR of HIV was stable (6.2/100,000
   population), but IR of presentation with advanced HIV declined during
   the study period from 2.2 (95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.8-2.8) to 1.1
   (95\% CI 0.8-1.5). Age >50 y, heterosexuals of non-Danish origin,
   `other' route of transmission, and diagnosis before 2002 were associated
   with an increased risk of presenting with advanced HIV, whereas a
   negative HIV test prior to diagnosis was associated with a significantly
   reduced risk. A total of 414 individuals (40.0\%) had attended a
   hospital 1-3 y before presenting with advanced HIV. After 2002 the
   proportion of men who have sex with men with a negative HIV test prior
   to diagnosis increased (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 1.3, 95\% CI
   1.1-1.6), coinciding with a reduction in IR of presentation with
   advanced HIV. Mortality rates were increased the first 2 y following
   presentation with advanced HIV (MRR 5.9, 95\% CI 3.6-9.4 and MRR 2.5,
   95\% CI 1.4-4.1, respectively). Conclusion: In a setting with a low HIV
   prevalence, the rate of presentation with advanced HIV can potentially
   be reduced by repeated HIV testing of individuals with a continuous high
   risk of transmission and by adhering to guidelines for targeted HIV
   testing.}},

Abstract = {{Materials having a negative Poisson's ratio (auxetic) get fatter rather
   than thinner when uniaxially stretched. This phenomenon has been often
   explained through models that describe how particular geometric features
   in the micro or nanostructure of the material deform when subjected to
   uniaxial loads. Here, a new model based on scalene rigid triangles
   rotate relative to each other will be presented and analysed. It is
   shown that this model can afford a very wide range of Poisson's ratio
   values, the sign and magnitude of which depends on the shape of the
   triangles and the angles between them. This new model has the advantage
   that it is very generic and may be potentially used to describe the
   properties in various types of materials, including auxetic foams and
   their relative surface density. Specific applications of this model,
   such as a blueprint for a system that can exhibit temperature-dependent
   Poisson's ratios, are also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, we focus on the circumstances in quasi-likelihood
   inference that the estimation accuracy of mean structure parameters is
   guaranteed by correct specification of the first moment, but the
   estimation efficiency could be diminished due to misspecification of the
   second moment. We propose an information ratio (IR) statistic to test
   for model misspecification of the variance/covariance structure through
   a comparison between two forms of information matrix: the negative
   sensitivity matrix and the variability matrix. We establish asymptotic
   distributions of the proposed IR test statistics. We also suggest an
   approximation to the asymptotic distribution of the IR statistic via a
   perturbation resampling method. Moreover, we propose a selection
   criterion based on the IR test to select the best fitting
   variance/covariance structure from a class of candidates. Through
   simulation studies, it is shown that the IR statistic provides a
   powerful statistical tool to detect different scenarios of
   misspecification of the variance/covariance structures. In addition, the
   IR test as well as the proposed model selection procedure shows
   substantial improvement over some of the existing statistical methods.
   The IR-based model selection procedure is illustrated by analyzing the
   Madras Longitudinal Schizophrenia data. Appendices are included in the
   supplemental materials, which are available online.}},

Volume = {{22}},

Abstract = {{The first-principle calculations were performed to investigate the
   structural, mechanical, electronic and thermal properties of the binary
   ductile intermetallic compound CeAg with B2 (CsCl) structure. The
   calculated value of lattice constant a(0) for CeAg with generalized
   gradient approximation is 3.713 angstrom, which is in better agreement
   with experimental data than local spin density approximation. The
   negative energy of formation implies that CeAg with B2 structure is
   thermodynamically stable phase. The greater separation between the d
   bands of Ce and Ag results in weaker bond hybridization of Ce d-Ag d,
   which prevents formation of directional covalent bonding. The three
   independent elastic constants (C-11, C-12 and C-44) are derived and the
   bulk modulus, shear modulus, elastic modulus, anisotropy factor, and
   Poisson ratio are determined to be 57.6 GPa, 15.8 GPa, 43.4 GPa, 3.15
   and 0.374, respectively. The elastic constants meet all the mechanical
   stability criteria. The value of Pugh's criterion is 3.65. The ductility
   of CeAg is predicted if Pugh's criterion is greater than 1.75.
   Furthermore, the variations of volume, bulk modulus, heat capacity, and
   thermal expansion coefficient with temperature and/or pressure were
   calculated and discussed.}},

Abstract = {{This study aimed to analyze the impact of the Family Health Strategy

   than 100 thousand inhabitants. The reference was 20 census tracts, 10 of
   which in areas with oral health covered by the FHS for at least a year,
   matched with 10 census tracts without oral health coverage. The total
   sample included 59,221 individuals. Three possible effects were
   considered: negative, positive, and absence of effect on the outcomes,
   based on the prevalence ratio adjusted by Poisson regression. The
   outcomes ``access to collective preventive measures{''} and ``treatment
   of toothache{''} indicate a positive effect in the FHS oral health
   model. However, the outcomes ``coverage of tooth extraction{''} and
   ``restorative treatment{''} showed either a negative effect or no effect
   in the majority of the municipalities in the sample. Evidence indicates
   that within the FHS, the results reflect the local organizational models

   auxetic and one conventional. He gave plots of numerical examples, but
   these are incorrect. The plots do not correspond to the properties of
   the given materials. The purpose of this paper is to give the correct
   plots of his numerical examples. The enhancement of the effective
   out-of-plane Young modulus with respect to the stiffest phase for some
   semi-auxetic laminates is much bigger and spread over a wider interval
   of volume fraction, bigger and wider than the ones showed by him. In all

Abstract = {{Observations in many applications consist of counts of discrete events,
   such as photons hitting a detector, which cannot be effectively modeled
   using an additive bounded or Gaussian noise model, and instead require a
   Poisson noise model. As a result, accurate reconstruction of a spatially
   or temporally distributed phenomenon (f(star)) from Poisson data (y)
   cannot be effectively accomplished by minimizing a conventional
   penalized least-squares objective function. The problem addressed in
   this paper is the estimation of f(star) from in an inverse problem
   setting, where the number of unknowns may potentially be larger than the
   number of observations and f(star) admits sparse approximation. The
   optimization formulation considered in this paper uses a penalized
   negative Poisson log-likelihood objective function with nonnegativity
   constraints (since Poisson intensities are naturally nonnegative). In
   particular, the proposed approach incorporates key ideas of using
   separable quadratic approximations to the objective function at each
   iteration and penalization terms related to l(1) norms of coefficient
   vectors, total variation seminorms, and partition-based multiscale
   estimation methods.}},

Volume = {{52}},
Pages = {{103-114}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Negative Poisson's ratio, while thermodynamically permitted is only
   observed in some natural crystals in certain directions. All other known
   cases of negative Poisson's ratio are the man-made structures exhibiting
   this property macroscopically. One class of these structures includes
   re-entrant foams and specially engineered structures with springs and
   hinges. Another class is constituted by materials consisting of a matrix
   with positive Poisson's ratio with embedded microstructural elements
   producing macroscopic negative Poisson's ratio. In the first class, we
   propose structures made of balls bonded by links with high shear to
   normal stiffness ratio. In the second class, we introduce materials
   filled with cracks with suppressed relative shearing of the faces. In
   the case of multiscale crack distributions the minimum value of
   Poisson's ratio achievable is -1/3. Materials with positive and negative
   Poisson's ratio can be combined into hybrid materials. We show that
   multiscale distribution of spherical inclusions whose Poisson's ratio
   has different sign to that of the elastic isotropic matrix can
   considerably (up to two orders of magnitude) increase the effective
   Young's modulus even when the Young's moduli of the matrix and
   inclusions are the same. Generic mechanical properties of auxetics such
   as fracture toughness, wave propagation and damping are discussed. (C)

Abstract = {{Objectives: This study aimed to establish the prevalence, pattern and
   nature of coaches' verbal behaviour at children's (ages 6-12 years) team
   sports events. The study draws upon the motivational model presented by
   Mageau and Vallerand (2003) to examine the influence of global (gender),
   contextual (sport related), and social (athlete gender) factors on coach
   comments.
   Design: A cross-sectional observational study of coaches stratified
   across four team sports: Rugby Union, Netball, Association Football and
   Touch Rugby.
   Method: The Observation Instrument at Sports Events was used to
   categorise covertly recorded verbal comments made by coaches at
   organised team sports games.
   Results: Overall, 10,697 comments were recorded at 72 games at a rate of
   3.71 comments/minute; 35.4\% were categorised as positive, 21.6\% as
   negative, and 43.0\% as neutral. Significant differences in negative
   comments were identified between sport (p<.001) with rugby coaches
   recording the highest percentage of negative comments and the lowest
   percentage of positive comments; by coach gender (p<.001), with male
   coaches recording higher rates of negative comments; and by athlete
   gender (p<.001), with coaches of male-only teams recording higher rates
   of negative comments. When simultaneously included in a Poisson
   regression model the difference in negative comments between sports
   remained statistically significant (p<.001) whereas coach gender was no
   longer significant.
   Conclusions: The ratio of negative coach comments for all sports gives
   cause for concern. These findings suggest that sports of national and
   cultural significance are a key driver of coaching behaviours in a
   competitive environment. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To determine (trends in) HIV incidence among
   MSM\textbackslash{} who have recently had postexposure prophylaxis (PEP)
   prescribed in Amsterdam, compared with MSM participating in the
   Amsterdam Cohort Studies (ACS).
   Design and methods: We used data from MSM who were prescribed PEP in
   Amsterdam between 2000 and 2009, who were HIV-negative at the time of
   PEP prescription and had follow-up HIV testing 3 and/or 6 months after
   PEP prescription (n = 395). For comparison, cohort data from MSM
   participating in the ACS in the same period were used (n 782). Poisson
   log-linear regression analyses were performed to model trends in HIV
   incidence and identify differences in HIV incidence between both cohorts
   at different time points.
   Results: Between 2000 and 2009, among MSM who were prescribed PEP, an
   overall HIV incidence of 6.4 {[}95\% confidence interval (CI) 3.4-11.2]
   per 100 person-years was found, compared with an HIV incidence of 1.6
   (95\% CI 1.3-2.1) per 100 person-years among MSM participating in the
   ACS (P < 0.01). In both cohorts, an increasing trend in HIV incidence
   over time was observed {[}incidence rate ratio (IRRper calendar year)
   1.3 (95\% CI 0.9-1.7) and 1.1 (95\% CI 1.0-1.2) among MSM prescribed PEP
   and MSM of the ACS, respectively]. The difference in HIV incidence
   between both cohorts was most evident in more recent years {[}IRRPEP
   versus ACS in 2009 4.8 (95\% CI 2.0-11.5)].
   Conclusion: Particularly in more recent years, MSM recently prescribed
   PEP had a higher HIV incidence compared with MSM participating in the
   ACS, indicating ongoing sexual risk behaviour. (C) 2012 Wolters Kluwer

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{420}},
Pages = {{59-71}},
Month = {{FEB 14}},
Abstract = {{As a generalization of the commonly assumed Poisson distribution (PD)
   used to estimate the annual number of peaks over threshold in partial
   duration series (PDS) model, the negative binomial (NB) distribution is
   proposed in this study. Instead of generalized pareto distribution (GPD)
   and exponential distribution (ED) models popularly applied to predict
   the probability of the exceedances of peak over threshold, the
   performance of the general logistic distribution (GLD) models is
   analyzed. Two different models for analyzing extreme hydrologic events
   are compared, based on, PDS and annual maximum series (AMS),
   respectively. The performance of the two models in terms of uncertainty
   of T-year event estimator {[}q(T)] is evaluated in the cases of
   estimation with the method of moments (MOMs), maximum likelihood (ML),
   and probability weighted moments (PWMs). The annual maximum distribution
   corresponding to a PDS model with Poisson distributed count of peaks
   above threshold and GLD for flood exceedances was found to be an extreme
   value type I (EV1) distribution. The comparison between PDS and AMS is
   made using ratio of variance of the T-year event estimates, which is
   derived analytically after checking the reliability of the expressions
   with Monte Carlo simulations. The results reveal that the AMS/NB-GLD and
   PDS/GLD models using PWM estimation method give least variance of flood
   estimates with the PDS model giving marginally better results. From the
   overall results, it was observed that the Poisson distribution performs
   better, where the difference between mean (mu) and variance of counts of
   threshold exceedances is small otherwise the NB distribution is found to
   be efficient when used in combination with generalized logistic
   distribution in the PDS model, and this is more prominent for it mu <
   1.4. Hence, in such cases when the PDS data have a mean less than this,
   the AMS/NB-GLD and PDS/GLD should be a better model for q(T) estimation
   as compared to PDS/ED. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Natrolite (Na16Al16Si24O80 center dot 16H(2)O) at ambient conditions is
   the paradigmatic example of an auxetic material whose behavior under
   pressure can be rationalized using a ``rotating squares{''} model with
   the squares being made up of T5O10 subunits (T = Al, Si). This model
   also rationalizes reversible superhydration where water is inserted
   under pressure ({''}pressure-induced hydration{''}). Using combined
   pressure and temperature in situ synchrotron powder diffraction
   techniques, we have investigated the structural changes occurring in
   ``superhydrated{''} natrolite (Na16Al16Si24O80 center dot 32H(2)O)
   between 20 and 300 K at 1.7(3) GPa. Rietveld refinements allowed us to
   identify significant changes within the sodium-water substructure
   located in the pores of the superhydrated natrolite. Despite the higher
   water content of the superhydrated phase, its thermal volumetric
   expansion coefficient is 15 times larger than that of natrolite at
   ambient pressure. We put forward a structural descriptor relating
   thermal expansion and the rotations of T5O10 units that measures the
   impact of nonframework cations and water contained in the pores on the
   ``rotational squares{''} mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials are those which expand when stretched and contract
   when pushed. One area which is currently attracting attention is in the
   production of auxetic fibres and textiles. Here, the history of auxetic
   microporous polymers and subsequent fibres development and production is
   reviewed along with attempts to understand how the auxetic effect is
   achieved based on the observed microstructures. Larger scale auxetic
   polymers appear to have a different causal mechanism to auxetic fibres.
   A natural development from the production of auxetic fibres is to use
   the fibres to produce textiles. Progress in this area is examined
   together with work towards using conventional fibres to produce a
   textile which is auxetic due to its structure rather than its
   constituents. Possible applications are also presented.}},

Abstract = {{A computational finite element analysis based on a structural molecular
   mechanics approach was conducted to predict effective mechanical
   stiffness properties of a novel 3D carbon structure, pillared graphene
   structure (PGS), which is constituted with several graphene sheets and
   single-walled carbon nanotubes. Four sets of representative unitcell
   models were developed atomistically for predicting the mechanical
   properties of PGSs having different values of pillar length and
   inter-pillar distance. We introduced proper selections of the periodic
   geometry and boundary conditions which enabled our unitcell model to
   yield consistent results on the property prediction without any size or
   edge effects. The parametric study shows that the pillar length and
   inter-pillar distance significantly affect the effective in-plane and
   through-thickness properties. PGSs with shorter pillars in height yield
   higher planar Young's and shear moduli, while those with smaller
   interpillar distance yield higher through-thickness moduli. Negative
   in-plane Poisson's ratios are observed for all sets of PGSs and are
   associated with the curvature at the junction. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Colloids with patchy metal coating under laser irradiation could act as
   local heat sources and generate temperature gradients that could induce
   self-propulsion and interactions between them. The collective behavior
   of a dilute solution of such thermally active particles is studied using
   a stochastic formulation. It is found that when the Soret coefficient is
   positive, the system could be described in a stationary state by the
   nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann equation and could adopt density profiles
   with significant depletion in the middle region when confined. For
   colloids with a negative Soret coefficient, the system can be described
   as a dissipative equivalent of a gravitational system. It is shown that
   in this case the thermally active colloidal solution could undergo an
   instability at a critical laser intensity, which has similarities to a
   supernova explosion.}},

Abstract = {{Models of smectic-C liquid-crystal elastomers predict that they can
   display soft elasticity, in which the shape of the elastomer changes at
   no energy cost. The amplitude of the soft mode and the accompanying
   shears are dependent on the orientation of the layer normal and the
   director with respect to the stretch axis. We demonstrate that in some
   geometries the director is forced to rotate perpendicular to the stretch
   axis, causing lateral expansion of the sample-a negative Poisson's
   ratio. Current models do not include the effect of imperfections that
   must be present in the physical sample. We investigate the effect of a
   simple model of these imperfections on the soft modes in monodomain
   smectic-C elastomers in a variety of geometries. When stretching
   parallel to the layer normal (with imposed strain) the elastomer has a
   negative stiffness once the director starts to rotate. We show that this
   is a result of the negative Poisson's ratio in this geometry through a
   simple scalar model.}},

Abstract = {{The chiral lattice is a unique structural network not symmetric to its
   mirror image, and with a negative Poisson's ratio. Previous
   investigations have considered this structural network for the design of
   superior structural components with sandwich construction, but these
   were limited by the in-plane Poisson's ratio predicted to be exactly -1.
   This paper presents estimates of the mechanical properties of the chiral
   lattice obtained from a multi-cell finite-element model. It is shown
   that the chiral lattice has a shear stiffitess bound by that of the
   triangular lattice and it is very compliant to direct stresses. The
   minimum in-plane poisson's ratio is estimated to be approximate to
   -0.94.}},

Abstract = {{In theory, a negative Poisson's ratio (i.e. auxetie) material has
   improved hardness, impact resistance, fracture toughness, and shear
   modulus over one with a positive Poisson's ratio and comparable
   stiffness. These enhanced properties make them attractive candidates for
   a wide range of applications, including ones in the biomedical industry.
   Over the past two decades there has been increasing interest in auxetie
   materials leading to the discovery and development of new auxetic
   materials at the micro- and macro-scales. It has been reported in the
   literature that some human trabecular bone is auxetic; however
   verification of this claim and measurement of the,Poisson's ratio of
   biological materials remains a challenge. This research need is the
   motivation for the current work.
   The central research objective of this project is to develop an approach
   to gain fundamental insight into the geometric characteristics of
   auxetic open cell materials by studying the underpinning mechanics
   behind the transition from positive to negative Poisson's ratio that
   takes place when open-cell foam is compressed and heat treated. The
   approach involves detailed image analysis and finite element modeling of
   the microstructure of polyurethane foam, which is commonly used as a
   test material to model the structure of human cancellous bone. By
   studying both conventional and auxetie foam, and the process by which
   conventional foams are transformed to auxetic, we seek to identify the
   critical features of auxetic open-cell structures. The results will lead
   to a better understanding of auxetic cellular materials in general, and
   will be used to develop a framework for use in determining the
   mechanical properties and potential auxeticity of human trabecular bone
   and to aid in the design of synthetic auxetic biomaterials. In this
   paper we report on preliminary results of our modeling efforts.}},

Abstract = {{Cellular structures with hexagonal unit cells show a high degree of
   flexibility in design. Based on the geometry of the unit cells, highly
   orthotropic structures, structures with negative Poisson's ratios,
   structures with high strain capability in a particular direction, or
   other desirable characteristics may be designed. Much of the prior work
   on cellular structures is based on hexagonal honeycomb-like unit cells,
   without any inclusions. The present paper envisages extending
   conventional cellular honeycomb-like structures to have inclusions or
   internal features within the unit cells. Various types of internal
   features such as contact elements, buckling beams,
   bi-stable/snap-through elements or viscous dashpots can result in unit
   cells which display stiffening, softening, negative stiffness, or
   dissipative behavior. A structure can be assembled using a specific
   element type, or different types of elements in specific arrangements,
   to provide desired system level behavior. The ability to so optimally
   and flexibly design cellular structures could potentially lead to their
   replacing conventional structures made from bulk materials.
   As a first step, this paper presents work on hexagonal unit cells with
   linear springs as the simplest of inclusions. The hexagonal cell itself
   is comprised of rigid links and pin-joints. Since such a cell has no
   stiffness of its own, the behavior of any internal feature is
   emphasized. However, for kinematic stability purposes, three springs are
   required, and the significance of these constraints within the cell will
   be discussed. For different spring arrangements, closed-form analytical
   expressions are derived for the in-plane modulus and Poisson's ratio.
   The analytical expressions are validated using NASTRAN finite element
   simulations, as well as against experimental tensile/compressive tests
   of fabricated unit cells with internal springs. When the spring
   stiffness exceeds certain values, the rigid cell wall assumption is no
   longer valid, and these bounds are established. The validated analysis
   is used to conduct design studies on how the cell modulus would vary
   with geometric parameters such as cell angle and cell wall length ratio.}},

   structures with high strain capability in a particular direction, or

   on cellular structures is based on hexagonal honeycomb-like unit cells,

   a vision of cellular honeycomb-like structures with diverse inclusions
   or internal features within the unit cells (such as contact elements
   resulting in stiffening behavior, buckling beams resulting in softening
   behavior, hi-stable elements producing negative stiffness or viscous
   dashpots producing dissipative behavior). That paper further went into
   details on linear springs as the most fundamental of inclusions.
   In the present paper, a buckling beam and viscous dashpots are used as
   inclusions in the basic pin-jointed rigid-walled hexagonal unit cell.
   The buckling beam provides the cell with a high initial stiffness and
   load carrying capability. At loads beyond the critical buckling load,
   the unit cell softens (while still retaining the ability to carry a
   ``design{''} load), and undergoes large deformation under incremental
   load. The viscous dampers undergo a correspondingly large stroke
   resulting in high dissipative capability and loss factor under harmonic
   or transient disturbance beyond the design load. In the paper, an
   analysis and design study of the cell behavior with variation in unit
   cell geometric parameters, buckling beam parameters and viscous dashpot
   parameters is presented. The analytical results in the paper are
   validated against ANSYS Finite Element results. Further, a prototype
   unit cell with an aluminum internal buckling beam and viscous dashpots
   is fabricated and tested under static and dynamic loads in an Instron
   machine. Good correlation is observed between the tests, the FE results
   and the analytical simulations when accounting for the non-linear
   behavior of the viscous dashpot used in the tests.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the energy absorption properties of hexagonal
   honeycomb structures of varying cellular geometries to high speed
   in-plane impact. While the impact responses in terms of energy
   absorption and densification strains have been extensively researched
   and reported, a gap is identified in the generalization of honeycombs
   with controlled and varying geometric parameters. This paper attempts to
   address this gap through a series of finite element (FE) simulations
   where cell angle and angled wall thickness are varied while maintaining
   a constant mass of the honeycomb structure. A randomly filled,
   non-repeating Design of Experiments (DOE) is generated to determine the
   effects of these geometric parameters on the output of energy absorbed,
   and a statistical sensitivity analysis is used to determine the
   parameters significant for optimization. A high degree of variation in
   the impact response of varying cellular geometries has shown the
   potential for the forward design into lightweight crushing regions in
   many applications, particularly the automotive and aerospace industries.
   It is found that while an increase in angled wall thickness enhances the
   energy absorption of the structure, increases in either the cell angle
   or ratio of cell angle to angled wall thickness have adverse effects on
   the output. Finally, optimization results present that a positive angle
   cellular geometry with maximum angled wall thickness provides for
   maximum energy absorption, which is verified with a 6\% error when
   compared to a final FE simulation.}},

   strain is nearly unchangeable and the hysteresis curve becomes stable.
   Slope of warp curve is larger than weft curves, and the weft loop area
   is greater than the warp one with the same load ratio. The generalized
   Poisson ratio changes due to variations of the load ratio (R). when R<1,
   the experimental values and theoretical values of the generalized

Abstract = {{With the development of functional and structural materials, increasing
   interests have been shown in the field of biomaterials with a negative
   Poisson's ratio (auxetic), which exhibit the unusual property of
   becoming thinner when compressed. This unusual property makes it
   potentially a synthetic replacement biomaterial with adequate mechanical
   property and wear resistance. In this study, the potential of applying
   the auxetic ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) for the
   artificial hip joint was discussed. The contact mechanics
   characteristics in artificial hip joint replacement under different
   Poisson's ratios of -1<mu <= 0.5 were investigated and compared using
   the finite element method. The results show that Poisson's ratio had
   great effect on the contact mechanics in artificial hip joint
   replacement. Therefore, the future work should focus on tailoring an
   auxetic UHMWPE with a suitable Poisson's ratio for artificial hip joint
   replacements.}},

Abstract = {{This paper demonstrates impact damage detection in a composite sandwich
   panel. The panel is built from a chiral honeycomb and two composite
   skins. Chiral structures are a subset of auxetic solids exhibiting
   counterintuitive deformation mechanism and rotative - but not reflective
   - symmetry. Damage detection is performed using nonlinear
   acoustics,involves combined vibroacoustic interaction of high-frequency
   ultrasonic wave and low-frequency vibration excitation. High- and
   low-frequency excitations are introduced to the panel using a
   low-profile piezoceramic transducer and an electromagnetic shaker,
   respectively. Vibro-acoustic modulated responses are measured using
   laser vibrometry. The methods used for impact damage detection clearly
   reveal debonding in the composite panel. The high-frequency ``weak{''}
   ultrasonic wave is also modulated by the low-frequency ``strong{''}
   vibration wave when nonlinear acoustics is used for damage detection. As
   a result frequency sidebands can be observed around the main acoustic
   harmonic in the spectrum of the ultrasonic signal.}},

Abstract = {{Poisson's ratio sigma in linear elasticity theory is the ratio of the

   is in approximate agreement with the negative value inferred from
   measurements of the bending and twisting moduli of DNA.}},

Journal = {{ENGINEERING COMPUTATIONS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{3-4}},
Pages = {{260-276}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - Auxetic materials differ from conventional materials by the
   manner in which they respond to stretching; they tend to get fatter when
   stretched, resulting in a negative Poisson's ratio. The purpose of this
   paper is to present a numerical methodology for design of microstructure
   of 2D and 3D auxetic materials with a wide range of different negative
   Poisson's ratios.
   Design/methodology/approach - The proposed methodology is based on a
   combination of finite element method and a genetic algorithm. The
   problem is formulated as an optimization problem of finding
   microstructures with prescribed behavioral requirements. Different
   microstructures are generated and evolved using the genetic algorithm
   and the behavior of each microstructure is analyzed using the finite
   element method to evaluate its fitness in competition with other
   generated structures.
   Findings - Numerical examples show that it is possible to design a large
   number of new auxetic materials, each with a different value of negative
   Poisson's ratio.
   Originality/value - The proposed methodology can be used as an effective
   method to tailor new materials with prescribed values of negative (or
   positive) Poisson's ratio. The methodology can also be used to optimize
   other material properties.}},

   generalized Poisson regression (BGPR) model is defined. An advantage of
   the new regression model over the BNBR and BPLR models is that the BGPR
   can be used to model bivariate count data with either over-dispersion or
   under-dispersion. In this paper, we carry out a simulation study to
   compare the three regression models when the true data-generating
   process exhibits over-dispersion. In the simulation experiment, we
   observe that the bivariate generalized Poisson regression model performs
   better than the bivariate negative binomial regression model and the
   BPLR model.}},

Abstract = {{This chapter is dedicated to the presentation of examples of application
   of the Virtual Fields Method to soft materials like foams and elastomers
   and biological materials such as wood and biological tissues. These have
   been grouped together because they share some common features such as
   high deformability (often implying the measurement of large strains) and
   high material variability (for wood or tissues). In terms of measurement
   techniques, the large strain issue means that digital image correlation
   will be the ideal technique for full-field measurements, whereas medical
   imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance elastography can be used
   for tissues (particularly for in vivo studies). As far as the VFM is
   concerned, large deformations will imply the use of the principle of
   virtual work within the framework of the mechanics of large deformation,
   using adequate tensors in either the reference or deformed
   configurations. Hyperelasticity can then be used to describe the large
   strain behavior of foams or elastomer, as well as some biological
   tissues. In this section, the following applications are described:
   hyperelastic law identification on elastomers, tangent Poisson's ratio
   identification of a low density polymeric auxetic (negative Poisson's
   ratio) foams, and the use of magnetic resonance based measurements for
   biological tissues and phantoms (synthetic materials mimicking the
   behavior of tissues). Finally, some examples on wood are also be
   presented that share many common features with the examples in Chap. 6
   on composites.}},

Abstract = {{It has been shown that the coefficient of dynamic friction between two
   surfaces decreases when ultrasonic vibrations are super imposed on the
   macroscopic sliding velocity. Instead of longitudinal vibrations, this
   paper focuses on the lateral contractions and expansions of an object in
   and around the half wavelength node region. This lateral motion is due
   to the Poisson effect (ratio of lateral strain to longitudinal strain)
   present in all materials. We numerically and experimentally investigate
   the Poisson-effect ultrasonic lubrication. A motor effect region is
   identified in which the effective friction force becomes negative as the
   vibratory waves drive the motion of the interface. Outside of the motor
   region, friction lubricationis observed with between 30\% and 60\%
   friction force reduction. A ``stick-slip{''} contact model associated
   with horn kinematics is presented for simulation and analysis purposes.
   The model accurately matches the experiments for normal loads under 120

Abstract = {{Ecological momentary assessment is an emerging method of data collection
   in behavioral research that may be used to capture the times of repeated
   behavioral events on electronic devices and information on subjects'
   psychological states through the electronic administration of
   questionnaires at times selected from a probability-based design as well
   as the event times. A method for fitting a mixed-Poisson point-process
   model is proposed for the impact of partially observed, time-varying
   covariates on the timing of repeated behavioral events. A random frailty
   is included in the point-process intensity to describe the variation in
   baseline rates of event occurrence among subjects. Covariate
   coefficients are estimated using estimating equations constructed by
   replacing the integrated intensity in the Poisson score equations with a
   design-unbiased estimator. An estimator is also proposed for the
   variance of the random frailties. Our estimators are robust in the sense
   that no model assumptions are made regarding the distribution of the
   time-varying covariates or the distribution of the random effects.
   However, subject effects are estimated under gamma frailties using an
   approximate hierarchical likelihood. The proposed approach is
   illustrated using smoking data.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic (negative Poisson's ratio) configurations have recently been
   used to build prototypes of deployable structures using classical shape
   memory alloys (Nickel-Titanium-Copper). Chiral configurations, featuring
   three or more interconnected spiral-wound hubs, exploit efficient
   tensile-rotational mechanisms. These structures offer high deployability
   ratios in structural elements with load-bearing characteristics. Shape
   memory polymers have the potential to replace these shape memory alloys
   and other stored-energy actuators, and have the attractive properties of
   low mass, high actuation strain, easy fabrication and tuneable thermal
   properties. In this work we discuss how shape memory polymers (SMP)
   integrated into a chiral core could offer enhanced deployable
   characteristics and increase the efficiency of the auxetic deformations
   in these unusual cellular structures. We consider the spiral-wound
   fundamental component needed for SMP n-chiral prototypes and present
   test results showing actuation motion of expanding SMP deployable
   structures. Applications likely to benefit from these structures include
   lightweight elements for structural engineering applications, deployable
   structures for space applications and implantable medical devices.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Medications with anticholinergic and sedative effects carry
   significant risks in older people. Adverse events arising from the use
   of these medications may also lead to hospitalization and contribute to
   length of stay. The Drug Burden Index (DBI) is a tool that measures a
   person's total exposure to medications with anticholinergic and sedative
   properties, using the principles of dose response and maximal effect.
   Cumulative anticholinergic and sedative drug burden measured using the
   DBI has been associated with clinically important outcomes in older
   people. The association between the DBI and hospitalization still
   remains relatively unknown.
   Objective: The main aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship
   between DBI and hospitalization in a population-based sample of
   community-dwelling older Finns over a 1-year period.
   Methods: The health status and medication use of 339 community-dwelling
   >= 75-year-old Finns were assessed in 2004. Data on hospitalizations
   over the following year were obtained from the national discharge
   register. Two different measures were used to assess hospitalizations in
   the study sample: (i) the proportion of hospitalized participants; and
   (ii) the number of hospital days per person-year. Estimates for the
   number of hospital days per person-year and rate ratios (RRs) with 95\%
   confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using Poisson or negative
   binomial regression analysis.
   Results: A total of 127 participants (38\%) were exposed to DBI
   medications; 27\% had a low DBI (>0 to <1), and 11\% had a high DBI (>=
   1). The number of hospital days per person-year was 7.9 (95\% CI 7.6,
   8.3) for the unexposed participants (DBI = 0) and 13.4 (95\% CI 12.8,
   14.1) for the exposed participants (DBI >1); the age, gender and
   co-morbidity adjusted RR of hospital days per person-year between the
   exposed and unexposed participants was 1.26 (95\% CI 1.18, 1.35).
   Between the low and high DBI groups, the difference in the number of
   hospital days per person-year was insignificant (p = 0.42). In
   multivariate analyses, the number of regularly used medications (RR =
   1.12 {[}95\% CI 1.00, 1.26] per additional medication) and the measure
   of basic activities of daily living Barthel Index (RR = 0.94 {[}95\% CI
   0.88, 0.99] per increase) were independently associated with the use of
   hospital days.
   Conclusion: Exposure to DBI medications was associated with a greater
   use of hospital days, but a cumulative dose-response relationship
   between DBI and hospitalization was not observed. The number of
   regularly used medications and functioning in the basic activities of
   daily living predicted hospital care utilization.}},

Abstract = {{Cytokine ELISPOT assays have emerged as a powerful tool for the
   detection of rare antigen-specific T cells in freshly isolated cell
   material, such as blood. While ELISPOT assays allow one to directly
   visualize and count extremely low frequencies of cytokine-secreting T
   cells among millions of nonsecreting bystander cells, the interpretation
   of ELISPOT data can become ambiguous when (a) spot numbers in
   antigen-containing wells are low, (b) spot counts in negative control
   wells are elevated, and particularly (c) when both of the above occur
   simultaneously. Thus, the primary task, even before statistics are
   employed, must be the optimization of the basic assay parameters and
   reagents such that the assay yields low background signal in the
   negative-control wells and the maximal number of antigen-induced spots
   in test wells, i.e., the signal-to-noise ratio is maximized.
   Furthermore, the use of proper spot-size gating parameters for data
   analysis is indispensable for screening out irrelevant background spots,
   and thus increasing the signal-to-noise ratio. The goal of most ELISPOT
   experiments is to identify, positive T-cell responses as defined by a
   significantly elevated spot count in antigen-stimulated wells over the
   nonstimulated medium-control or negative-control antigen. In this
   chapter, we conclude that - with some limitations - the T-Test and
   related statistical methods which rely on the assumption of normal
   distribution are suitable for identifying positive ELISPOT results.}},

   Negative Binomial. The comparison between these two estimators took
   place using classical and bootstrap techniques for the construction of
   confidence intervals. Thus, these techniques are also subject to
   comparison. Simulation studies were also used for the relative
   efficiency and bias of the two estimators. Pearson's estimator performed
   slightly better than Spearman's.}},

Title = {{Influenza Vaccination Coverage Among US Nursing Home Nursing Assistants:
   The Role of Working Conditions}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To estimate influenza vaccination coverage among nursing
   assistants (NAs) working in US nursing homes, and to identify
   demographic and occupational predictors of vaccination status among NAs.
   Design, setting, and participants: Cross-sectional analysis of data on
   2873 NAs from the 2004 National Nursing Assistant Survey.
   Multivariable-adjusted vaccination coverage (prevalence) ratios for
   demographic and occupational characteristics were calculated using
   Poisson regression.
   Measurements: Outcome variable was NAs' influenza vaccination status,
   yes or no, based on the question, ``During the past 12 months, did you
   receive a flu shot?{''}
   Results: Coverage for all NAs working in US nursing homes was estimated
   to be 37.1\%. NAs 45 or older were more likely to be vaccinated than
   younger NAs (prevalence ratio {[}PR] 1.23, 95\% confidence interval
   {[}CI]: 1.07-1.41). Significant negative associations with vaccination
   status were found for NAs who were non-Hispanic blacks (PR 0.82, 95\%
   CI: 0.70-0.97), disagreed that they were respected/rewarded for their
   work (PR 0.85, 95\% CI: 0.71-1.00), worked at for-profit facilities (PR
   0.83, 95\% CI: 0.72-0.95), and reported receiving fewer than 7 of 15
   nonwage job benefits (PR 0.77, 95\% CI: 0.67-0.90).
   Conclusion: Influenza coverage among nursing home NAs appears to be
   similar to nationally reported coverage estimates among health care
   providers in the United States in general. In addition to individual
   characteristics, occupational characteristics reflective of working
   conditions are associated with vaccination status among NAs, suggesting
   that further research into these types of associations may be useful in
   identifying which institutions may benefit from outreach efforts and
   types of interventions to increase vaccination coverage. Published by

   screening system for protein engineering and directed evolution}},
Journal = {{LAB ON A CHIP}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{12}},

Pages = {{882-891}},
Abstract = {{In vitro screening systems based on the coupled transcription and
   translation of genes using cell-free systems have a number of attractive
   features for protein engineering and directed evolution. We present a
   completely in vitro ultrahigh-throughput screening platform using
   droplet-based microfluidics. Single genes are compartmentalized in
   aqueous droplets, dispersed in inert carrier oil, and amplified using
   the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). After amplification, the droplets,
   now containing 30 000 copies of each gene, are fused one-to-one with
   droplets containing a cell-free coupled transcription-translation (IVTT)
   system and the reagents for a fluorogenic assay. Fluorescence-activated
   electrocoalescence with an aqueous stream is then used to selectively
   recover genes from droplets containing the desired activity. We
   demonstrate, by selecting mixtures of lacZ genes encoding the enzyme
   beta-galactosidase and lacZmut genes encoding an inactive variant, that
   this system can sort at 2000 droplets s(-1): lacZ genes were enriched
   502-fold from a 1 : 100 molar ratio of lacZ : lacZmut genes. Indeed, the
   false positive and false negative error rates were both < 0.004 and the
   results indicate that enrichment is not limited by the sorting
   efficiency, but by the co-encapsulation of multiple genes in droplets,
   which is described by the Poisson distribution. Compared to screening
   using microtiter plate-based systems, the volume and cost of PCR and
   IVTT reagents are reduced by almost 10(5)-fold, allowing the screening
   of 10(6) genes using only 150 mu L of reagents.}},

Abstract = {{The low in-plane modulus of honeycombs may be used for compliant
   structures with a high elastic limit while maintaining a required
   modulus. Numerical and finite element (FE) studies for a functional
   design of honeycombs having a high shear strength, (tau(pl){*})(12) and
   a high shear yield strain, (gamma(pl){*})(12) are conducted with two
   material selections-mild-steel (MS) and polycarbonate (PC) and five
   honeycomb configurations, when they are designed to be a target shear
   modulus, G(12){*} of 6.5 MPa. A numerical study of cellular materials
   theory is used to explore the elastic limit of honeycombs. FE analysis
   is also employed to validate the numerical study. Cell wall thicknesses
   are found for each material to reach the target G(12){*} for available
   cell heights with five honeycomb configurations. Both MS and PC
   honeycombs can be tailored to have the G(12){*} of 6.5 MPa with 0.1-0.5
   mm and 0.3-2.2 mm cell wall thicknesses, respectively, depending on the
   number of vertical stacks, N. The PC auxetic honeycomb with theta= -20
   deg shows high shear flexibility, when honeycombs are designed to be the
   G(12)({*}) of 6.5 MPa; a 0.72 MPa (tau(pl){*})(12) and a 13\%
   (gamma(pl){*})(12). The authors demonstrate a functional design with
   cellular materials with a large design space through the control of both

Abstract = {{Objective: Obesity increases the risk of hypertension and other chronic
   diseases, which are little known in rural China. This study aimed to
   investigate the epidemiologic features and the association with
   hypertension of obesity in rural Chinese women.
   Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted during 2004 through
   2006, which used a multistage cluster sampling method to select a
   representative sample in Liaoning Province, China. In total 23 178 rural
   participants at least 35 y of age were examined (the percentage of
   subjects > 64 y old was 14.5\%). Data on demographic variables (age,
   sex, and race), smoking status, use of alcohol, physical activity, and
   education level were obtained by interview. Overweight and obesity were
   defined according to the World Health Organization classification.
   Hypertension was defined according to the criteria established by the
   Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee, and untreated
   hypertensive subjects were further classified into three subtypes:
   isolated systolic hypertension, isolated diastolic hypertension, and
   systolic and diastolic hypertension. Multivariable models and performed
   Poisson logistic regression analysis were used to determine associations
   among body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, and variables.
   Results: Overall, the prevalences of overweight and obesity were 24.4\%
   and 2.7\%, respectively, as defined by BMI, whereas the prevalences were
   48.6\% and 4.9\% as defined by waist circumference. Poisson regression
   revealed that high levels of physical activity (defined by BMI,
   moderate: prevalence ratio {[}PR] 0.976,95\% confidence interval {[}CI]
   0.965-0.988, high: PR 0.985,95\% CI 0.971-0.999; defined by waist
   circumference, moderate: PR 0.955, 95\% CI 0.944-0.965, high: PR 0.973,
   95\% CI 0.960-0.985) and current smoking status (defined by BMI. PR
   0.950, 95\% CI 0.938-0.962; defined by waist circumference, PR 0.966,
   95\% CI 0.954-0.978) were protective factors and ethnicity was a risk
   factor (defined by BMI. Mongolian nationality: PR 1.042, 95\% CI
   1.030-1.054; defined by waist circumference. PR 1.043,95\% CI
   1.033-1.054) for overweight or obese participants. There were other risk
   factors for overweight or obese participants such as high levels of
   education defined by BMI (PR 1.033, 95\% CI 1.010-1.058) and diet score
   defined by waist circumference (PR 1.004, 95\% CI 1.000-1.008). After
   adjustment, BMI and waist circumference were associated with the
   greatest likelihood of systolic and diastolic hypertension (for BMI >=
   30 kg/m(2), PR 2.455, 95\% CI 1.786-3.374; for waist circumference >= 88
   cm, PR 1.517, 95\% CI 1.133-2.031). BMI was more related to isolated
   diastolic hypertension than to isolated systolic hypertension, whereas
   waist circumference was more related to isolated systolic hypertension
   than to isolated diastolic hypertension.
   Conclusion: Although the prevalence of overweight and obesity as defined
   by BMI was low, it was relatively high as defined by waist circumference
   in rural Chinese women. High levels of physical activity and current
   smoking status had negative relations to overweight or obesity, whereas
   ethnicity, high levels of education, and diet score showed positive
   relations. Obese women defined by BMI or waist circumference had an
   increased risk of hypertension. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights

   ten negative elementary charges within a ``soft{''} version of the
   primitive model of electrolytes. The Brownian dynamics method was used
   to calculate the diffusion coefficients of mobile species. Simulations
   were complemented with the replica Ornstein-Zernike theory for
   partly-quenched systems to calculate the activity coefficients of
   individual ions and the Donnan exclusion coefficient. We study the
   influence of (i) the size of the pores, which varies with the
   concentration of quenched charged nanoparticles, and (ii) the presence
   of added salt on the mobility and thermodynamics of small ions. We show
   that for dilute matrices (low concentration of charged obstacles) the
   diffusion coefficient of counterions is smaller or equal to that of
   co-ions. The opposite is true for concentrated matrices: here
   counterions are considerably faster than co-ions. In dilute matrices,
   where obstacles are distributed at larger distances, the counterions are
   strongly attracted by fixed obstacles. As a consequence, they are slowed
   down in comparison with the co-ions. In concentrated matrices, where the
   average size of the pores is small, the counterions can take advantage
   of hopping from one obstacle to another, whereas the co-ions, repelled
   by the obstacles, need to diffuse in the space between the layers of
   counterions surrounding the obstacles. Thermodynamic calculations are
   consistent with the Brownian dynamics results.}},

Abstract = {{Fasteners are used in every industry, and in virtually every component.
   The ideal fastener would be relatively easy to insert or push into a
   hole, but take much more force to remove or pull out of the hole. Such
   fasteners would not require nuts screwed onto bolts, or other retaining
   rings. The current work attempts to develop a simple fastener with a low
   Insertion Force / Removal Force ratio by exploiting auxetic behavior.
   Auxetic materials or negative Poisson's Ratio materials have properties
   that are counter-intuitive. A rubber band, for example, becomes thinner
   in width when pulled lengthwise Auxetic materials, however, will expand
   in width, when pulled along their length, or when compressed along their
   length, will also contract in width. Hence, normal materials have
   positive Poisson's Ratios while auxetic materials are revealed to have
   negative Poisson's Ratio. By exploiting the theory behind negative
   Poisson's Ratios, a suitably designed fastener can exhibit auxetic
   behavior. Specifically, a properly designed fastener will decrease in
   diameter when pushed/compressed through a hole and increase in diameter
   when pulled out of the hole. Using previously developed theory, several
   cylindrical fasteners were fabricated that exhibited auxetic behavior.
   Aluminum sleeves were fabricated with holes of slightly different
   diameters, such that when the fasteners were inserted they must contract
   slightly. Insertion/Removal force ratios as low as 18\% were observed.
   The project is considered a success and could lead to patents and be a
   boon to the fastener industry.
   Based on the research experience a learning module to be implemented in
   an Algebra I class has been designed. The paper describes the learning
   module that is based on an active learning methodology known as Legacy
   Cycle. It will be implemented in the spring semester in Algebra I
   classes in a high school with majority of Hispanic students.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials having a network like structure are analyzed in terms
   of their deformation mechanisms and equivalent homogenized mechanical
   properties thanks to the discrete asymptotic homogenization method. This
   systematic and predictive methodology is exemplified for five different
   2D periodical lattices: the re-entrant hexagonal, hexachiral, cross
   chiral, rafters and the re-entrant square. The equivalent moduli and
   Poisson's ratio are expressed in closed form versus the microbeam
   geometrical parameters and rigidities. As a novel result, the predicted
   homogenized properties depend on the slenderness of the beam, hence
   providing more accurate results in comparison to the literature. The
   studied lattices allow to explore the two main mechanisms responsible
   for negative Poisson's ratio, the re-entrant and the rolling-up
   mechanism. Non-standard overall behaviors, such as traction-shear
   coupling occurring for the cross chiral lattice, are evidenced. Negative
   values of the Poisson's ratio are obtained in a certain range of the
   configuration parameter of each lattice. Comparisons of the obtained
   homogenized moduli with finite element simulations show a very good
   accuracy of the predicted effective mechanical behavior. (C) 2011

   dynamic characteristics of a flexible auxetic hexagonal lattice
   structure when it is used as the flexible spokes of a non-pneumatic
   tire. In this study, a modal analysis and the steady state vibration
   characteristics of NPTs with cellular spokes are investigated with a
   series of vertical loads and rolling speeds using a commercial finite
   element code, ABAQUS/Explicit. The angular velocity and the displacement
   at the hub center and the reaction force on the ground were investigated
   in the time and frequency domains for the steady state rolling condition
   for vehicle speeds of 60km/h and 80km/h. The orthotropic properties of
   the honeycomb spokes create different modal behaviors compared with
   those of pneumatic tires; e.g., the in-plane shear at the initial mode.
   The discrete spoke geometry induces a non-homogeneous mass
   (nonuniformity) distribution, which also causes local vibration effects.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials expand when stretched, and shrink when compressed.
   This is the result of a negative Poisson's ratio v. Isotropic
   configurations with v approximate to -1 have been designed and are
   expected to provide increased shear stiffness G. This assumes that
   Young's modulus and v can be engineered independently. In this article,
   a micropolar-continuum model is employed to describe the behavior of a
   representative auxetic structural network, the chiral lattice, in an
   attempt to remove the indeterminacy in its constitutive law resulting
   from v = -1. While this indeterminacy is successfully removed, it is
   found that the shear modulus is an independent parameter and, for
   certain configurations, it is equal to that of the triangular lattice.
   This is remarkable as the chiral lattice is subject to bending
   deformation of its internal members, and thus is more compliant than the
   triangular lattice which is stretch dominated. The derived micropolar
   model also indicates that this unique lattice has the highest
   characteristic length scale I of all known lattice topologies, as well
   as a negative first Lame constant without violating bounds required for
   thermodynamic stability. We also find that hexagonal arrangements of
   deformable rings have a coupling number N=1. This is the first lattice
   reported in the literature for which couple-stress or Mindlin theory is
   necessary rather than being adopted a priori. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Background. Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) is an important
   infection-related complication, whose mode of transmission remains
   uncertain.
   Methods. We investigated a nosocomial cluster of 14 PJP cases (11
   confirmed and 3 probable) in kidney transplant recipients using
   epidemiological and genotyping methods.
   Results. Poisson regression calculated an incidence density ratio of
   42.8 (95\% confidence interval {[}CI], 14.1-129.3) versus background
   0.64 cases of 1000 patient-years (P<0.001). All patients presented with
   respiratory failure, 10 required ventilation, two died, and six
   transplants failed, costing \$31,854 (+/- SD \$26,048) per patient.
   Four-locus multilocus sequence typing analysis using DNA extracts from
   11 confirmed cases identified two closely related genotypes, with 9 of
   11 sharing an identical composite multilocus sequence typing genotype.
   Contact tracing found colocalization of cases within clinic waiting
   areas, suggesting person-to-person transmission. Minimal and maximal PJP
   incubation periods were 124 +/- 83 to 172 +/- 71 days, respectively.
   Oropharyngeal washes from outpatient staff and ambient air samples were
   negative for P. jirovecii DNA. Cohort analysis (14 cases vs. 324
   unaffected clinic control patients) identified independent risk factors
   including previous cytomegalovirus infection (odds ratio {[}OR], 65.9;
   95\% CI, 7.9-550; P<0.001), underlying pulmonary disease (OR, 10.1; 95\%
   CI, 2.3-45.0; P=0.002), and transplant dysfunction (OR=1.61 per 10
   mL/min/1.73 m(2), 95\% CI, 1.15-2.25, P=0.006). The outbreak was
   controlled by reintroduction of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole
   prophylaxis to all potentially exposed clinic patients and its extension
   to 12 months in recent recipients.
   Conclusions. Nosocomial PJP clusters are likely due to interhuman
   transmission by airborne droplets to susceptible hosts. Prompt
   recognition and a strategy of early preemptive blanket PJP prophylaxis
   to all exposed transplant clinic recipients from the third confirmed
   case are recommended to limit outbreak escalation.}},

Abstract = {{Earlier studies suggest a protective association between vitamin K
   antagonist (VKA) anticoagulants and the incidence of cancer. The authors
   examined the associations between VKA therapy and incidence of 24
   site-specific cancers with a Danish population-based cohort study, using
   heart valve replacement as an instrumental variable. The authors
   enrolled 9,727 Danish residents who received a replacement heart valve
   between 1989 and 2006. The heart valve recipients were matched with
   95,481 unexposed individuals on age and sex. The authors used the heart
   valve replacement instrument to estimate rate ratios associating VKA
   therapy with incidence of the 24 site-specific cancers using Poisson
   regression models. Direct associations between VKA therapy and incidence
   of the 24 cancers were estimated in a prescription validation subset.
   The instrumental variable associations were plotted according to the
   inverse normal of rank percentile and subjected to semi-Bayes shrinkage
   adjustment for multiple comparisons. The pattern of associations was
   consistent with a null-centered Gaussian distribution. No individual
   cancer site showed a substantial positive or negative association with
   VKA therapy in the prescription validation subset, the instrumental
   variable analysis, or the analysis with semi-Bayes adjustment. These
   results do not support the existing hypothesis that VKA therapy is
   associated with reduced cancer risk.}},

Title = {{The relationship of oral health literacy with oral health-related
   quality of life in a multi-racial sample of low-income female caregivers}},
Journal = {{HEALTH AND QUALITY OF LIFE OUTCOMES}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Background: To investigate the association between oral health literacy
   (OHL) and oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) and explore the
   racial differences therein among a low-income community-based group of
   female WIC participants.
   Methods: Participants (N = 1,405) enrolled in the Carolina Oral Health
   Literacy (COHL) study completed the short form of the Oral Health Impact
   Profile Index (OHIP-14, a measure of OHRQoL) and REALD-30 (a word
   recognition literacy test). Socio-demographic and self-reported dental
   attendance data were collected via structured interviews. Severity
   (cumulative OHIP-14 score) and extent of impact (number of items
   reported fairly/very often) scores were calculated as measures of
   OHRQoL. OHL was assessed by the cumulative REALD-30 score. The
   association of OHL with OHRQoL was examined using descriptive and visual
   methods, and was quantified using Spearman's rho and zero-inflated
   negative binomial modeling.
   Results: The study group included a substantial number of African
   Americans (AA = 41\%) and American Indians (AI = 20\%). The sample
   majority had a high school education or less and a mean age of 26.6
   years. One-third of the participants reported at least one oral health
   impact. The OHIP-14 mean severity and extent scores were 10.6 {[}95\%
   confidence limits (CL) = 10.0, 11.2] and 1.35 (95\% CL = 1.21, 1.50),
   respectively. OHL scores were distributed normally with mean (standard
   deviation, SD) REALD-30 of 15.8 (5.3). OHL was weakly associated with
   OHRQoL: prevalence rho = -0.14 (95\% CL = -0.20, -0.08); extent rho =
   -0.14 (95\% CL = -0.19, -0.09); severity rho = -0.10 (95\% CL = -0.16,
   -0.05). ``Low{''} OHL (defined as < 13 REALD-30 score) was associated
   with worse OHRQoL, with increases in the prevalence of OHIP-14 impacts
   ranging from 11\% for severity to 34\% for extent. The inverse
   association of OHL with OHIP-14 impacts persisted in multivariate
   analysis: Problem Rate Ratio (PRR) = 0.91 (95\% CL = 0.86, 0.98) for one
   SD change in OHL. Stratification by race revealed effect-measure
   modification: Whites-PRR = 1.01 (95\% CL = 0.91, 1.11); AA-PRR = 0.86
   (95\% CL = 0.77, 0.96).
   Conclusions: Although the inverse association between OHL and OHRQoL
   across the entire sample was weak, subjects in the ``low{''} OHL group
   reported significantly more OHRQoL impacts versus those with higher
   literacy. Our findings indicate that the association between OHL and
   OHRQoL may be modified by race.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, the Timoshenko beam, and generalizations thereof, have been
   considered as models for the vibration of single and multiple walled
   carbon nanotubes. Further, it has been shown that, in some instances,
   carbon nanotubes and nanotube sheets possess the common property that
   their Poisson's ratio is negative. In these cases, the degenerate case
   of the Timoshenko beam problem, where E = k'G, becomes physically
   realizable. The asymptotic derivation of the vibration spectrum in this
   case is qualitatively different from that for the nondegenerate case. We
   performed such a derivation, and we compared the asymptotic results with
   numerical results. Further, we performed parameter studies based on the
   exact frequency equation for the undamped case for values of E/k'G on
   intervals including E/k'G = 1. The results show very interesting and
   complex behavior throughout a fairly large interval about E/k'G = 1.}},

Title = {{Role of Five-fold Twin Boundary on the Enhanced Mechanical Properties of

Journal = {{NANO LETTERS}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{5264-5273}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The role of 5-fold twin boundary on the structural and mechanical
   properties of fcc Fe nanowire under tension is explored by classical
   molecular dynamics. Twin-stabilized fcc nanowire with various diameters
   (6-24 nm) are examined by tension tests at several temperatures ranging
   from 0.01 to 1100 K. Significant increase in the Young's modulus of the
   smaller nanowires is revealed to originate from the central area of
   quinquefoliolate-like stress-distribution over the 5-fold twin, rather
   than from the surface tension that is often considered as the main
   source of such size-effects found in nanostructures. Because of the
   excess compressive stress caused by crossing twin-boundaries, the atoms
   in the center behave stiffer than those in bulk and even expand
   laterally under axial tension, providing locally negative Poisson's
   ratio. The yield strength of nanowire is also enhanced by the twin
   boundary that suppresses dislocation nucleation within a fcc
   twin-domain; therefore, the plasticity of nanowire is initiated by
   strain-induced fcc -> bcc phase transformation that destroys the twin
   structure. After the yield, the nucleated bcc phase immediately spreads
   to the entire area, and forms a multigrain structure to realize ductile
   deformation followed by necking. As temperature elevated close to the
   critical temperature between bcc and fcc phases, the increased stability
   of fcc phase competes with the phase transformation under tension, and
   hence dislocation nucleations in fcc phase are observed exclusively at
   the highest temperature in our study.}},

Abstract = {{A systematic study on the influence of the cell geometry of a
   cardiovascular stent on its radial compliance and longitudinal strain is
   presented. Eight stent cell geometries-based on common lattice cells-are
   compared using finite element analysis. It is found that, for a given
   strut thickness, the radial compliance depends on the shape of the cell
   and is intimately connected with the longitudinal strain through
   effective Poisson's ratio, which depends on the cell geometry. It is
   demonstrated experimentally that a hybrid stent containing both positive
   and negative Poisson's ratio cell lattice geometries exhibited very low
   values of longitudinal strain. This study indicates that cell geometries
   may be tailored to minimize longitudinal stresses imposed by the stent
   onto the artery wall. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4005226]}},

Abstract = {{Some problems of elasticity theory related to highly compressible
   two-dimensional elastic bodies are considered. Such problems arise in
   real elasticity and pertain to some materials having negative Poisson

   parameter epsilon. If epsilon > 0, the corresponding equations are
   elliptic and the boundary data obey the Shapiro-Lopatinsky condition. If
   epsilon = 0, this condition is violated and the problem may fail to be
   solvable in distribution spaces. The rather difficult passing to the

Abstract = {{A comprehensive review on the latest development of the
   antiferroelectric <-> ferroelectric phase transition is presented. The
   abrupt volume expansion and sudden development of polarization at the
   phase transition has been extensively investigated in PbZrO3-based
   perovskite ceramics. New research developments in these compositions,
   including the incommensurate domain structure, the auxetic behavior
   under electric fields in the induced ferroelectric phase, the
   ferroelastic behavior of the multicell cubic phase, the impact of radial
   compression, the unexpected electric field-induced
   ferroelectric-to-antiferroelectric transition, and the phase transition
   mechanical toughening effect have been summarized. Due to their
   significance to lead-free piezoelectric ceramics, compounds with
   antiferroelectric phases, including NaNbO3, AgNbO3, and
   (Bi1/2Na1/2)TiO3, are also critically reviewed. Focus has been placed on
   the (Bi1/2Na1/2)TiO3BaTiO3 solid solution where the electric
   field-induced ferroelectric phase remains even after the applied field
   is removed at room temperature. Therefore, the electric field-induced
   antiferroelectric-to-ferroelectric phase transition is a key to the
   poling process to develop piezoelectricity in morphotropic phase
   boundary (MPB) compositions. The competing phase transition and domain
   switching processes in 0.93(Bi1/2Na1/2)TiO30.07BaTiO3 are directly
   imaged with nanometer resolution using the unique in situ transmission
   electron microscopy (TEM) technique.}},

Abstract = {{This work investigates the possibility to predict the auxetic behavior
   of composites consisting of non-auxetic phases by means of
   micromechanical models based on Eshelby's inclusion concept. Two
   specific microstructures have been considered: (i) the three-layered
   hollow-cored fibers-reinforced composite and (ii) a microstructure
   imitating the re-entrant honeycomb micro-architecture. The
   micromechanical analysis is based on kinematic integral equations as a
   formal solution of the inhomogeneous material problem. The interaction
   tensors between the inhomogeneities are computed thanks to the Fourier's
   transform. The material anisotropy due to the morphological and
   topological textures of the inhomogeneities was taken into account
   thanks to the multi-site approximation of these tensors. In both cases,
   the numerical results show that auxetic behavior cannot be captured by
   such models at least in the case of elastic and isotropic phases. This
   conclusion is supported by corresponding finite element investigations
   of the second microstructure that indicate that auxetic behavior can be
   recovered by introducing joints between inclusions. Otherwise, favorable
   issues are only expected with auxetic components. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The presence of gas hydrate in the Ulleung Basin, East Sea (Japan Sea),
   inferred by various seismic indicators, including the widespread
   bottom-simulating reflector (BSR), has been confirmed by coring and
   drilling. We applied the standard AVO technique to the BSRs in
   turbidite/hemipelagic sediments crosscutting the dipping beds and those
   in debris-flow deposits to qualitatively assess the gas hydrate and gas
   concentrations. These BSRs are not likely to be affected by thin-bed
   tuning which can significantly alter the AVO response of the BSR. The
   BSRs crosscutting the dipping beds in turbidite/hemipelagic sediments
   are of low-seismic amplitude and characterized by a small positive
   gradient, indicating a decrease in Poisson's ratio in the gas-hydrate
   stability zone (GHSZ), which, in turn, suggests the presence of gas
   hydrate. The BSRs in debris-flow deposits are characterized by a
   negative gradient, indicating decreased Poisson's ratio below the GHSZ,
   which is likely due to a few percent or greater gas saturations. The
   increase in the steepness of the AVO gradient and the magnitude of the
   intercept of the BSRs in debris-flow deposits with increasing seismic
   amplitude of the BSRs is probably due to an increase in gas saturations,
   as predicted by AVO model studies based on rock physics. The reflection
   strength of the BSRs in debris-flow deposits, therefore, can be a
   qualitative measure of gas saturations below the GHSZ. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Oesophageal cancer is the ninth leading cause of malignant cancer death
   and its prognosis remains poor. Dysphagia which is an inability to
   swallow is a presenting symptom of oesophageal cancer and is indicative
   of incurability. The goal of this study was to design and manufacture an
   Auxetic structure film and to configure this film as an Auxetic stent
   for the palliative treatment of oesophageal cancer, and for the
   prevention of dysphagia. Polypropylene was used as a material for its
   flexibility and non-toxicity. The Auxetic (rotating-square geometry)
   structure was made by laser cutting the polypropylene film. This flat
   structure was welded together to form a tubular form (stent), by an
   adjustable temperature control soldering iron station: following this,
   an annealing process was also carried out to ease any material stresses.
   Poisson's ratio was estimated and elastic and plastic deformation of the
   Auxetic structure was evaluated. The elastic and plastic deformation
   behaviours of the Auxetic polypropylene film were evaluated by applying
   repetitive uniaxial tensile loads. Observation of the structure showed
   that it was initially elastically deformed, thereafter plastic
   deformation occurred. This research discusses a novel way of fabricating
   an Auxetic structure (rotating-squares connected together through
   hinges) on Polypropylene films, by estimating the Poisson's ratio and
   evaluating the plastic deformation relevant to the expansion behaviour
   of an Auxetic stent within the oesophageal lumen.}},

Abstract = {{The presence of anisotropy in earth materials has been widely accepted.
   Due to its high symmetry and relative simplicity in mathematical
   formulae, transversely isotropic (TI) medium has become one of the most
   important anisotropic media in seismology. In theoretical and practical
   studies, anisotropic parameters expressed in terms of elastic constants
   proposed by Thomsen in 1986 are widely adopted. Values of elastic
   constants and Thomsen's anisotropic parameters cannot be chosen freely.
   There are some constraints among those parameters. Unfortunately, such
   constraints were ignored by some authors. Sometimes improper parameters
   were selected and consequently physically meaningless and misleading
   results were generated. In this study, we proposed a set of simple
   inequalities for constraining the values of Thomsen's anisotropic
   parameters. The inequalities, given by 1/4 < f =1 -
   beta(2)(0)/alpha(2)(0)< 1, epsilon > - f/2, 1/2f-1 <delta < 2 (1/f - 1),
   and -1/2 <gamma < (1+ 2 epsilon)/4 (1 - f) - 1/2, were developed based
   upon the stability condition of material as well as theoretical and
   experimental investigations on anisotropic parameters. It was shown that
   epsilon, delta and gamma can be either positive or negative, and their
   ranges are mainly constrained by P-to-S velocity ratio beta(0)/alpha(o);
   delta, gamma and beta(0)/alpha(0) are bounded, while epsilon has no
   upper limit; gamma and epsilon are positively correlated, and the upper
   limit of gamma is related to epsilon; the links between epsilon and
   delta, and between gamma and delta are weak. It was also proved in this
   paper that the inequalities about five independent elastic constants of
   TI media derived from the stability condition are sufficient to
   guarantee that all the phase velocities of three body waves are
   non-negative. Constraints for some special TI media and physical
   phenomena were reviewed. For elliptical anisotropy, epsilon equals to
   delta and thus 1/2 f - 1 <epsilon < 2 (1/f - 1). For equivalent TI
   medium arising from periodic isotropic thin layers, we have epsilon >=
   max(0, delta) and gamma >= 0. For some directions called longitudinal
   directions, at which phase velocity of P waves reaches an extremum, the
   direction of P polarization is coincident with wavenormal and ray
   direction. The sufficient and necessary condition for the presence of
   longitudinal direction is given by epsilon/delta(L)< 1/2, where delta(L)
   = C-13 + 2C(55) - C-33)/C-33 is the linear definition of Thomsen's delta
   and C-ij, elastic constants. For the presence of SV triplications, the
   inequality delta - epsilon/f > (1- f)/2 is the condition for basal
   triplication, and delta - epsilon >(1 - f)/2 for axial triplication,
   (epsilon-delta)/(1+delta)> 2(1 - f)/3 for oblique triplication. The
   inequality for oblique triplication is simplified from the inequality
   proposed by Thomsen and Dellinger (2003). We also extend the constraints
   on elastic constants and anisotropic parameters of TI media to those of
   orthorhombic media.}},

   Heart Failure}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL CARE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{985-991}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background: Although hospice use may be increasing among heart failure
   patients, its association with both cost and intensity of care in this
   population has not been well examined.
   Objective: To assess the association of hospice care with resource
   utilization among a national sample of Medicare beneficiaries with heart
   failure during the last 6 months of life.
   Methods: We performed a cross-sectional analysis of the 5\% sample of
   Medicare claims data. Negative binomial regression models were used to
   compare expenditures, hospitalization rates, and intensive care unit
   (ICU) days between hospice and nonhospice beneficiaries. We used Poisson
   regression models to compare utilization of certain procedures between
   hospice and nonhospice beneficiaries.
   Results: Among 16613 Medicare beneficiaries who died with heart failure
   in 2007, 6436 (38.7\%) received hospice care during the last 6 months of
   life. The mean total medical expenditures were \$31,793 (SD 25,691)
   among decedents with hospice care, in comparison to \$34,067 (SD 40,561)
   among decedents without hospice care. However, after adjustments for
   covariates, hospice care was associated with 4\% higher expenditures
   (cost ratio, 1.04; 95\% confidence interval, CI: 1.01-1.07). Hospice use
   was associated with reduced hospitalizations (adjusted incidence rate
   ratio, 0.87, 95\% CI: 0.84-0.89), ICU days (adjusted incidence rate
   ratio, 0.68, 95\% CI: 0.63-0.73), and procedures, including cardiac
   catheterization, noninvasive ventilation, and mechanical ventilation.
   Conclusions: Despite lower rates of hospitalization, ICU days, and
   invasive procedures, hospice care was not associated with reduced
   expenditures in heart failure. Financial savings related to reduced
   intensive medical care seems to be offset by the expenditures related to
   hospice care itself.}},

Year = {{2011}},

Abstract = {{A helical spring that is constrained to no rotation has a compliance
   that is typically more than 95\% of the compliance of springs
   constrained to free rotation when restricted to symmetric wires made
   from materials with Poisson's ratio between 0 and 1/2. It is shown that
   the shape of the spring wire can be designed so the spring will not
   twist when it is extended nor extend when it is twisted. The constrained
   spring versus a freely rotating spring with the helix angle equal to
   pi/4 has the largest reduction in compliance in the limits of beam
   theory. Spring compliances for torsion and extension with quite complex
   helical spring geometries are found to be related by a dimensionless
   ratio of compliances in a very simple equation that only depends on
   Poisson's ratio and the helical, spring angle, psi. Springs made from
   materials with negative Poisson's ratio, however, can have a very
   substantial reduction in compliance; the no rotation compliance is zero
   when Poisson's ratio is -1. There are large changes in spring
   compliances for springs with geometric coils that are elongated
   rectangles or flattened ellipses.}},

Abstract = {{Background In Greenland, the prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen
   carriers, reflecting chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, is
   5\%-10\%. However, the incidence of cirrhosis and hepatocellular
   carcinoma in this population has been reported to be low. We
   investigated this discrepancy in a large population-based cohort study.
   Methods In total, 8879 Greenlanders (16\% of the population) were
   recruited for population-based surveys performed from May 5 to July 7,
   1987, and from November 1 to November 21, 1998, with follow-up until
   March 31, 2010. HBV status was based on serological testing,
   supplemented by data from all available HBV registries in Greenland to
   determine changes in HBV status over time. Information on morbidity and
   mortality was obtained from the Patient Discharge Registry, the Cancer
   Registry, and the Central Registration System. Sex, age, ethnicity, and
   period-adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were estimated using
   Poisson regression. World standardized rates were derived from these and
   World Health Organization data.
   Results The 650 chronically HBV-infected persons had higher rates of
   hepatocellular carcinoma (adjusted IRR = 8.70; 95\% CI = 2.06 to 36.7),
   liver disease (adjusted IRR = 5.73, 95\% CI = 3.52 to 9.34), and
   all-cause mortality (adjusted IRR = 1.47; 95\% CI = 1.21 to 1.79) than
   the 5160 HBV-negative persons. However, the world standardized incidence
   rates of hepatocellular carcinoma (38.5 cancers per 100 000
   person-years) and cirrhosis (24 cases per 100 000 person-years) among
   chronically HBV-infected persons were low compared with results from
   population-based studies from countries with low, intermediate, and high
   rates of endemic HBV infection.
   Conclusion The relatively low incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma and
   other HBV-related morbidity among chronic HBV-infected persons in
   Greenland suggest a more benign course of HBV among the Greenlandic
   Inuit than in populations in other parts of the world.}},

Abstract = {{In comparing a material's resistance to distort under mechanical load
   rather than to alter in volume, Poisson's ratio offers the fundamental
   metric by which to compare the performance of any material when strained
   elastically. The numerical limits are set by 1/2 and -1, between which
   all stable isotropic materials are found. With new experiments,
   computational methods and routes to materials synthesis, we assess what
   Poisson's ratio means in the contemporary understanding of the
   mechanical characteristics of modern materials. Central to these recent
   advances, we emphasize the significance of relationships outside the
   elastic limit between Poisson's ratio and densification, connectivity,
   ductility and the toughness of solids; and their association with the
   dynamic properties of the liquids from which they were condensed and
   into which they melt.}},

Abstract = {{A method for quantifying the overall Poisson's ratio of a rod undergoing

   auxetic core exhibit same effective Poisson's ratio signs but with
   greater magnitude under torsional loading than under axial loading.
   However, a concentric compound rod with auxetic shell exhibits a range
   of volume fraction whereby the overall auxeticity of the rod is loading
   mode dependent, i.e., it behaves as a conventional rod under axial
   loading but as an auxetic rod under torsional loading. Hence a compound
   rod with conventional core and auxetic shell can be used as a smart
   structure that gives different response depending on the type of loading
   imposed on it.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanical properties of 2D honeycomb-structured polymer sheets

   sinusoidal wave with a periodicity of 15 degrees. The amplitude of the
   fluctuation is proportional to the thickness of the HSPS, but the
   Young's modulus is independent of the thickness and the polar angle.
   Total and local Poisson's ratios of HSPS at the 30 degrees polar angle
   are lower than those obtained at the 0 degrees polar angle over the
   entire strain range, and the difference becomes smaller with increasing
   tensile strain. The experimentally observed structure-property
   relationship of the HSPS can provide important clues for understanding
   the deformation behavior of patterned polymeric materials.}},

   layers (EDLs) in nano-channels. Generic expressions for a variety of
   transport properties of long straight nano-channels are obtained in
   terms of quasi-equilibrium distribution coefficients of ions and
   functionals of quasi-equilibrium distribution of electrostatic
   potential. Further, the Poisson-Boltzmann approach is used to specify
   these expressions for long straight slit-like nano-channels. In the
   approximation of non-overlapped diffuse parts of double electric layers
   in nano-channels, simple analytical expressions are obtained for the
   apparent electrophoretic mobilities of (trace) analytes of arbitrary
   charge as well as for the salt reflection coefficient (osmotic
   pressure), salt diffusion permeability and electro-viscosity
   (electrokinetic energy conversion). The approximate solutions are
   compared with the results of rigorous solution of non-linearized
   Poisson-Boltzmann equation, and the accuracy of approximation is shown
   to be typically excellent when the nano-channel half-height exceeds ca.3
   Debye screening lengths. Due to non-negligible electrostatic adsorption
   of ions by nano-channels, the apparent electrophoretic mobilities of
   counter-ionic analytes in nano-channels are smaller than in
   micro-channels whereas those of co-ionic analytes are larger. This
   dependence on the charge is useful for the separation of analytes of
   close electrophoretic mobilities.
   The osmotic pressure is shown to be positive, negative or pass through
   maxima as a function of applied salt-concentration difference within a
   fairly narrow range of ratios of nano-channel height to the Debye
   screening length. The diffusion permeability of charged nano-channels to
   single salts is demonstrated (for the first time) to be typically larger
   than that of neutral nano-channels of the same dimensions due to
   electrical facilitation of salt diffusion. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Background: Fertility is high in rural Ethiopia. Women in the
   reproductive age group differed in various characteristics including
   access to food and encounter to drought which requisite the assessment
   of determinants of fertility.
   Methods: Reproductive age women were recruited from a DSS, the Butajira
   DSS database. A DHS maternity history questionnaire was administered on
   9996 participants. Data quality was assured besides ethical clearance.
   Poisson regression crude and adjusted Incidence Rate Ratio with 95
   Confidence Interval were used to identify determinants of fertility.
   Results: Delayed marriage, higher education, smaller family, absence of
   child death experience and living in food-secured households were
   associated with small number of children. Fertility was significantly
   higher among women with no child sex preference. However, migration
   status of women was not statistically significant.
   Conclusions: Policy makers should focus on hoisting women secondary
   school enrollment and age at first marriage. The community should also
   be made aware on the negative impact of fertility on household economy,
   environmental degradation and the country's socio-economic development

Abstract = {{Purpose Mental health problems are associated with sickness absence
   (SA). The present study aimed at establishing which symptoms-distress,
   depression, anxiety, or somatization-at which symptom levels were
   associated with SA frequency and duration. Moreover, a number of
   possible confounders or effect modifiers were taken into account.
   Methods A survey was completed by 3,678 employees of a large Dutch
   telecom company. Symptoms were measured using the Four-Dimensional
   Symptom Questionnaire (4DSQ). SA data were registered by the company's
   occupational health service during the 12 months' period following the
   survey. Poisson regression was used to analyze the number of SA spells
   (SA frequency). Negative binomial regression was used to analyze the
   total number of SA days (SA duration).
   Results In the bivariate analyses distress, depression, anxiety, and
   somatization impacted on SA frequency and duration. In the multivariate
   analyses, anxiety and depression turned out not to be directly
   associated with SA, suggesting that the effect of anxiety and depression
   was due to the association between anxiety/depression and
   distress/somatization. Regarding the SA frequency, the rate ratio for
   `subclinical' distress was 1.13 (95\% CI 1.03-1.25), for `clinical'
   distress 1.26 (1.08-1.47), for `subclinical' somatization 1.34
   (1.23-1.46), and for `clinical' somatization 1.69 (1.46-1.95). Regarding
   the SA duration, the count ratio for `subclinical' distress was 1.15
   (95\% CI 0.91-1.44), for `clinical' distress 1.50 (1.04-2.16), for
   `subclinical' somatization 1.34 (1.10-1.64), and for `clinical'
   somatization 1.45 (1.04-2.03).
   Conclusions Somatization and distress are key to understand why
   depression and anxiety are related to SA.}},

Abstract = {{We consider a problem of identification of nuclides from weak and poorly
   resolved spectra. A two stage algorithm is proposed and tested based on
   the principle of majority voting. The idea is to model gamma-ray counts
   as Poisson processes. Then, the average part is taken to be the model
   and the difference between the observed gamma-ray counts and the average
   is considered as random noise. In the linear part, the unknown
   coefficients correspond to if isotopes of interest are present or
   absent. Lasso types of algorithms are applied to find non-vanishing
   coefficients. Since lasso or any prediction error based algorithm is
   inconsistent with variable selection for finite data length, an estimate
   of parameter distribution based on subsampling techniques is added in
   addition to Lasso. Simulation examples are provided in which the
   traditional peak detection algorithms fail to work and the proposed two
   stage algorithm performs well in terms of both the False Negative and
   False Positive errors. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Morbidity in HIV-1-infected individuals before and after the
   introduction of antiretroviral therapy: a longitudinal study of a
   population-based cohort in Uganda}},
Journal = {{HIV MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{12}},

Pages = {{553-561}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Background
   We compared morbidities in HIV-1-infected patients before and after the
   introduction of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in a rural Ugandan cohort
   followed from 1990 to 2008. ART was introduced in 2004.
   Methods
   Random-effects Poisson regression models were used to estimate incidence
   rates of World Health Organization (WHO) stage-defining diseases in
   HIV-infected individuals aged 13 years or older with known
   seroconversion dates, and in an age-stratified sample of HIV-negative
   individuals.
   Results
   The most common morbid event was bacterial pneumonia, with an incidence
   of 7.4/100 person-years (pyr) among 309 HIV seroconverters and 1.3/100
   pyr among 348 HIV-negative participants {[}hazard ratio (HR) 5.64; 95\%
   confidence interval (CI) 3.6-8.8]. Among seroconverters, the incidence
   of the acquisition of any WHO stage-defining disease rose from 14.4/100
   pyr (95\% CI 11.1-18.6) in 1990-1998 to 46.0/100 pyr (95\% CI 37.7-56.0)
   in 1999-2003. Following the introduction of ART, the incidence among
   seroconverters declined to 36.4/100 pyr (95\% CI 27.1-48.9) in 2004-2005
   and to 28.3/100 pyr (95\% CI 21.2-37.8) in 2006-2008. At the individual
   level, a higher rate of acquiring any WHO stage-defining disease was
   independently associated with lower CD4 cell count, longer duration of
   HIV infection and older age. In addition, individuals who had been on
   ART for longer than 12 months had a substantially lower rate of any WHO
   stage disease than those not yet on ART (adjusted HR 0.35; 95\% CI
   0.2-0.6).
   Conclusion
   Morbidity in HIV-positive participants decreased following the
   introduction of ART, and this decline was more marked with increasing
   duration on ART. The benefits of decreased HIV-related morbidity from
   ART lend support to urgent efforts to ensure universal access to early
   diagnosis of HIV infection and to ART, especially in rural Africa.}},

Abstract = {{The structure and phase stability of binary tungsten-vanadium and
   tungsten-tantalum alloys are investigated over a broad range of alloy
   compositions using ab initio and cluster expansion methods. The alloys
   are characterized by the negative enthalpy of mixing across the entire
   composition range. Complex intermetallic compounds are predicted by ab
   initio calculations as the lowest energy structures for both alloys. The
   effect of atomic relaxation on the enthalpy of mixing is almost
   negligible in W-V, but is substantial in W-Ta alloys. Canonical Monte
   Carlo simulations are used for predicting the order-disorder transition
   temperatures for both alloys. Differences in the short-range order
   between the two alloys are explained by the opposite signs of the second
   nearest-neighbour cluster interaction coefficients for W-V and W-Ta.
   Using the predicted ground-state structures, we evaluate the monovacancy
   formation energies and show that in W-Ta alloys they are highly
   sensitive to the alloy composition and the local environment of a
   vacancy site, varying from 3 to 5 eV. In the dilute tungsten alloy
   limit, a < 111 > self-interstitial atom crowdion defect forms a
   configuration strongly bound to a vanadium solute atom, whereas
   interaction between the same defect and a tantalum solute atom is
   repulsive. Values of elastic constants computed for all the ground-state
   structures and several metastable cubic alloy structures are used for
   assessing the effect of alloying on mechanical properties. Values of the
   Young modulus and the Poisson ratio, as well as the empirical
   Rice-Thompson criterion, are applied to screening the alloys, to assess
   the effect of chemical composition on ductility.}},

Abstract = {{Background Indications for adjuvant endocrine treatment of breast cancer
   have gradually increased over the past several years. We aimed to define
   subgroups of patients who may or may not benefit from adjuvant endocrine
   therapy.
   Methods A population-based cohort of systemically untreated breast
   cancer patients (N = 3197) were identified within the registry of the
   Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group (DBCG). The patients were node
   negative and had estrogen receptor-positive and/or progesterone
   receptor-positive tumors (except medullary tumors) and were further
   characterized by the following risk factors: aged 35-74 years (grouped
   into 5-year categories) at surgery, tumor size (<= 20 mm), and
   histopathology (grade 1 ductal carcinoma, grade 1 or 2 invasive lobular
   carcinoma, other or unknown histopathology). Standardized mortality
   ratios (SMRs) were calculated based on the mortality rate (observed
   number of deaths per 100 000 person-years) among patients relative to
   the mortality rate in the general population of women (expected number
   of deaths per 100 000 person-years). The association between
   standardized mortality ratio and risk factors were analyzed in
   univariate and multivariable Poisson regression models. All findings
   were validated in a subsequent DBCG cohort of breast cancer patients (N
   = 2710).
   Results The median follow-up after surgery was 14.8 years. In the study
   population there were 970 deaths compared with expected death of 737
   women, which was an excess mortality of 233 deaths (SMR = 1.32, 95\% CI
   = 1.24 to 1.40). Mortality rates were 2356 per 100 000 person-years in
   the study population and 1790 per 100 000 person-years in the general
   population of women. The mortality rate was associated with larger tumor
   size (11-20 mm tumors vs 1-10 mm tumors, SMR = 1.42, 95\% confidence
   interval {[}CI] = 1.31 to 1.53 vs SMR = 1.12, 95\% CI = 1.00 to 1.26).
   The mortality rate was also associated with age (35-59 years, SMR > 1)
   compared with that in the general population of age-matched women,
   except for a small subgroup of patients (aged 60-74 years, tumors <= 10
   mm, grade 1 ductal carcinoma, and grade 1 or 2 lobular carcinoma:
   adjusted relative risk = 1.02, 95\% CI = 0.89 to 1.16.).
   Conclusions A small subgroup of breast cancer patients who were 60 years
   or older and had hormone-responsive early-stage tumors up to 10 mm, and
   received no systemic adjuvant therapy, were not at increased risk of
   mortality compared with women in this age-group in the general
   population.}},

   using the network simulation method. The great influence that the ratio

Abstract = {{Investigations into the changes of Poisson's ratio as well as other
   mechanical properties of selected types of refractories subjected to
   thermal shocks have been carried out. The investigations included
   several types of porous refractory materials e.g. magnesia,
   magnesia-spinel, magnesia-chrome, chrome-magnesia, mullite, silica and
   low cement chamotte castable. The Poisson's ratio value of the examined
   materials decreased after each thermal shock. Decreasing of Poisson
   ratio caused by a stronger drop in Young's modulus than that for shear
   modulus was explained.
   It was found that some tested materials were characterized by low values
   of Poisson's ratio, which after series of severe thermal shocks
   decreased even to negative values. In order to explain the observed
   phenomenon, an attempt to correlate the obtained results with the
   microstructure of materials before and after a series of thermal shocks
   was undertaken. A hypothetical model of the microstructure of a porous
   ceramic material with negative Poisson ratio was proposed. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{Considering the SD (strength differential) effect on compressive
   strength and tensile strength in zirconia ceramic material, a yield
   criterion with a special parameter is introduced. In addition, by
   analogy with associated flow rule, the constitutive model of phase
   transformation ceramic material has been established. Under generalized
   plane strain condition, the theoretical toughening expressions of
   mixed-mode I-III stationary cracks and steady-state growing cracks have
   been developed with the constitutive model. The crack toughening effect
   has been discussed in detail with the Poisson ratio, parameters k /
   alpha. (the ratio of nominal yield strength and SD effect factor) and.
   (the scale factor of mode I crack and mode III). The integral
   calculation shows that phase transformation toughening of stationary
   cracks is negative shielding effect and the toughening effect of the
   steady-state growing cracks change obviously with the increase of
   parameter k / alpha. Comparison between experimental data and
   theoretical data indicates that the yield criterion is in accord with
   the actual characteristics of the zirconia ceramic, when the expression
   of mixed-mode I-III crack is reduced to mode I crack. The results

Abstract = {{In previous work about axisymmetric adhesive contact on power-law graded
   elastic materials, the contact interface was often assumed to be
   frictionless, which is, however, not always the case in practical
   applications. In order to elucidate the effect of friction and the
   coupling between normal and tangential deformations, in the present
   paper, the problem of a rigid punch with a parabolic shape in
   non-slipping adhesive contact with a power-law graded half-space is
   studied analytically via singular integral equation method. A series of
   closed-form analytical solutions, which include the frictionless and
   homogeneous solutions as special cases, are obtained. Our results show
   that, compared with the frictionless case, the interfacial friction
   tends to reduce the contact area and the indentation depth during
   adhesion. The magnitude of the coupling effect depends on both the
   Poisson ratio and the gradient exponent of the half-space. This effect
   vanishes for homogeneous incompressible as well as for linearly graded
   materials but becomes significant for auxetic materials with negative
   Poisson's ratio. Furthermore, influence of mode mixity on the adhesive
   behavior of power-law graded materials, which was seldom touched in
   literature, is discussed in details. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a novel fibre structure known as the helical
   auxetic yarn (HAY). The geometry of the yarn is defined and the
   manufacturing process described. A range of HAYs have been manufactured
   that vary the geometric properties of the structure. A systematic study
   of the yarns has been completed to evaluate the effect on the auxetic
   behaviour of the geometry. We also characterise the component fibres and
   yarns and discuss the influence of geometric and material effects on the
   observed Poisson's ratio of the yarns.
   It can be shown that the starting wrap angle of the yarn has the
   greatest effect on auxetic behaviour both in terms of magnitude and the
   strain range over which it may be observed.
   The maximum negative Poisson's ratio observed for a yarn manufactured
   from conventionally available monofilaments with positive Poisson's
   ratio is -2.7. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Flat knitting is a widely used fabric manufacturing technology. Compared
   with warp knitting and circular knitting, flat knitting is characterized
   by its higher process flexibility and greater fabric structure variety.
   In this work, flat knitting technology was exploited to fabricate
   auxetic fabrics which laterally expand when stretched. Three kinds of
   geometrical structures, i.e. foldable structure, rotating rectangle and
   reentrant hexagon, were employed as basic reference structures for the
   development of these kinds of auxetic fabrics. The weft knitting
   processes based on these structures were specially developed and auxetic
   fabrics were fabricated using the computerized flat knitting machines.
   The Poisson's ratio-strain curves of the developed fabrics were plotted
   and compared with those calculated using existing models to demonstrate
   the variation trends of Poisson's ratio with the axial strain. The
   results reveal that except the folded fabric formed with the face loops
   and reverse loops in a rectangular arrangement, of which the auxetic
   effect firstly increases and then decreases with the axial strain, the
   auxetic effects of all other fabrics decrease with an increase of the
   axial strain. The work also shows that auxetic fabrics can be realized
   based on knitted structures and that flat knitting technology can
   provide a simple, but highly effective way of fabricating auxetic
   fabrics from conventional yarns.}},

Abstract = {{We make an attempt to identify factors that explain accidents on German

   findings are based on a set of 197 ramps, which we classify into three
   distinct types of ramps. For these ramps, accident data is available for
   a period of 3 years (January 2003 until December 2005). The negative
   binomial model with some random coefficients proved to be an appropriate
   model in our cross-sectional setting for detecting factors that are
   related to accidents. The most significant variable is a measure of the
   average daily traffic. For geometric variables, not only continuous
   effects were found to be significant, but also threshold effects

Abstract = {{In this study, a shape memory polymer (SMP) based syntactic foam was
   prepared and programmed by a two-dimensional (2-D) stress condition
   (tension in one direction and compression in a transverse direction).
   Thermomechanical properties and microstructures of the foam were
   characterized. The results show that the 2-D programming method leads
   the foam towards anisotropy from original isotropy. It is found that,
   depending on the strain levels in the post-programming uniaxial
   compression or uniaxial tension tests, the programmed foam exhibits
   negative Poisson's ratio in the two programmed directions, regardless of
   the loading direction during the uniaxial testing of the programmed
   foam. The negative Poisson's ratio may be beneficial for some
   applications such as sealant in expansion joint, car bumper, seat

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{110}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Current-voltage (I-V) characteristics and trap densities of organic
   bistable devices (OBDs) fabricated utilizing SnO2 nanoparticles embedded
   in a polymer layer in the framework of the space-charge limited current
   (SCLC) model were calculated in order to investigate the transition
   mechanisms of the states and to compare the values with the experimental
   I-V curves of the fabricated OBDs. The effect of the trap density and
   depth on the current bistability in OBDs with a single layer was
   simulated using the Poisson equation, the drift equation, and the
   single-level trap model. The slope of the current variation for OBDs in
   the low conductivity (OFF) state was between 2 and 3, and that for the
   devices in the high conductivity (ON) state was 2, indicative of the
   appearance of a SCLC. The ON/OFF conductivity ratio of the OBDs was
   approximately 10(2). Because the electron occupation probability
   increased with increasing trap depth, the number of electrons trapped in
   the organic layer increased, resulting in an increase in the ON/OFF
   ratio of the current bistability. The experimental I-V curves for OBDs
   were in reasonable agreement with the theoretical I-V curves obtained by
   using a simulation method. (C) 2011 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{The principal stress distributions in thick-wall cylinders due to
   variation in the Poisson's ratio are predicted using analytical and
   finite element methods. Analyses of appropriate brittle and ductile
   failure criteria show that under the isochoric pressure conditions
   investigated that auextic (i.e. those possessing a negative Poisson's
   ratio) materials act as stress concentrators; hence they are predicted
   to fail before their conventional (i.e. possessing a positive Poisson's
   ratio) material counterparts. The key finding of the work presented
   shows that for constrained thick-wall cylinders the maximum tensile
   principal stress can vanish at a particular Poisson's ratio and aspect
   ratio. This phenomenon is exploited in order to present an optimized
   design criterion for thick-wall cylinders. Moreover, via the use of a
   cogent finite element model, this criterion is also shown to be
   applicable for the design of micro-porous materials. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Pages = {{412-421}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Objectives
   The aim of the study was to estimate the rates of cardiovascular disease
   (CVD) events after stopping smoking in patients with HIV infection.
   Methods
   Patients who reported smoking status and no previous CVD prior to
   enrolment in the Data Collection on Adverse Events of Anti-HIV Drugs (D:
   A: D) study were included in this study. Smoking status is collected at
   each visit as current smoker (yes/no) and ever smoker (yes/no). Time
   since stopping smoking was calculated for persons who had reported
   current smoking during follow-up and no current smoking subsequently.
   Endpoints were: myocardial infarction (MI); coronary heart disease (CHD:
   MI plus invasive coronary artery procedure or death from other CHD); CVD
   (CHD plus carotid artery endarterectomy or stroke); and all-cause
   mortality. Event rates were calculated for never, previous and current
   smokers, and smokers who stopped during follow-up. Incidence rate ratios
   (IRRs) were determined using Poisson regression adjusted for age, sex,
   cohort, calendar year, family history of CVD, diabetes, lipids, blood
   pressure and antiretroviral treatment.
   Results
   A total of 27136 patients had smoking status reported, with totals of
   432, 600, 746 and 1902 MI, CHD, CVD and mortality events, respectively.
   The adjusted IRR of CVD in patients who stopped smoking during follow-up
   decreased from 2.32 within the first year of stopping to 1.49 after >3
   years compared with those who never smoked. Similar trends were observed
   for the MI and CHD endpoints. Reductions in risk were less pronounced
   for all-cause mortality.
   Conclusion
   The risk of CVD events in HIV-positive patients decreased with
   increasing time since stopping smoking. Smoking cessation efforts should
   be a priority in the management of HIV-positive patients.}},

Abstract = {{Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of a porous polymeric construct
   (scaffold) quantitatively describe how it supports and transmits
   external stresses to its surroundings. While Young's modulus is always
   non-negative and highly tunable in magnitude, Poisson's ratio can,
   indeed, take on negative values despite the fact that it is non-negative
   for virtually every naturally occurring and artificial material. In some
   applications, a construct having a tunable negative Poisson's ratio (an
   auxetic construct) may be more suitable for supporting the external
   forces imposed upon it by its environment. Here, three-dimensional
   polyethylene glycol scaffolds with tunable negative Poisson's ratios are
   fabricated. Digital micromirror device projection printing (DMD-PP) is
   used to print single-layer constructs composed of cellular structures
   (pores) with special geometries, arrangements, and deformation
   mechanisms. The presence of the unit-cellular structures tunes the
   magnitude and polarity (positive or negative) of Poisson's ratio.
   Multilayer constructs are fabricated with DMD-PP by stacking the
   single-layer constructs with alternating layers of vertical connecting
   posts. The Poisson's ratios of the single- and multilayer constructs are
   determined from strain experiments, which show (1) that the Poisson's
   ratios of the constructs are accurately predicted by analytical
   deformation models and (2) that no slipping occurrs between layers in
   the multilayer constructs and the addition of new layers does not affect
   Poisson's ratio.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Morbidity associated with cardiovascular disease is
   increasing in the HIV-infected population. We aimed to study the impact
   of HIV and of antiretrovirals on acute myocardial infarction (AMI).
   Methods: We performed a cohort and a nested case-control study using the
   dataset of the Regie de l'Assurance Maladie du Quebec. HIV-positive
   patients were identified using ICD-9 diagnostic codes and matched to
   HIV-negative patients. Within the HIV-positive cohort, cases of AMI were
   identified and matched to HIV-positive patients without AMI. The
   coprimary outcomes were the risk of AMI associated with HIV exposure in
   the cohort study and that associated with exposure to antiretrovirals in
   the case-control study. Data were analysed using Poisson and conditional
   logistic regression.
   Results: About 7053 HIV-positive patients were matched to 27,681
   HIV-negative patients. Incidence rates of AMI in the HIV+ cohort was
   3.88 95\% confidence interval (CI) (3.26 to 4.58) per 1000
   patient-years, compared to 2.21 95\% CI (1.93 to 2.52) per 1000
   patient-years in the HIV cohort. The adjusted incidence ratio of AMI for
   HIV-infected patients was 2.11 95\% CI (1.69 to 2.63). Among HIV+
   patients, 125 AMI cases were matched with 1084 HIV+ patients. We found
   increased odds ratio (95\% CI) of AMI associated with any exposure to
   abacavir 1.79 (1.16 to 2.76), P = 0.02, efavirenz 1.83 (1.21 to 2.76) P
   = 0.004, lopinavir 1.98 (1.24 to 3.16) P = 0.004, and ritonavir 2.29
   (1.48 to 3.54) P < 0.001.
   Conclusions: HIV+ individuals were at higher risk of AMI than the
   general population, and several antiretrovirals were associated with an
   increased risk of AMI. Results should be interpreted with caution in
   absence of data on smoking and HIV clinical status.}},

Abstract = {{Aims We examined whether a current major depressive episode (MDE) at
   baseline predicted crack use and arrests at follow-up among women
   enrolled in drug court. Design Primary analyses used zero-inflated
   Poisson (ZIP) and zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) regression
   analyses to predict both yes/no and number of (i) days of crack use and
   (ii) arrests at 4-month follow-up from current (30-day) MDE at baseline.
   Secondary analyses addressed risk conferred by current versus past MDE
   at baseline. Setting/Participants Participants were 261 women in drug
   court. Measurements MDE was assessed using the Diagnostic Interview
   Schedule. Days using crack and number of arrests were assessed using the
   Washington University Risk Behavior Assessment for Women. Findings
   Having a current MDE at baseline predicted likelihood of crack use at
   follow-up, but not days of crack use among those who used. Current MDE
   at baseline did not predict presence or number of arrests at the 4-month
   follow-up. Women with current MDE at baseline were more likely to be
   using crack at follow-up than were those with recent (31+ days to 12
   months) but not current MDE (odds ratio = 5.71); past MDE at baseline
   did not increase risk of crack use. Conclusions Predictors of any versus
   no crack use or arrests appear to differ from predictors of frequency of
   these behaviors. Current major depression, but not past major
   depression, appears to be associated with increased risk of crack use
   among women attending drug court.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Inconsistent findings in more than 100 studies have made it
   difficult to explain how variation in nurse staffing affects patient
   outcomes. Nurse dose, defined as the level of nurses required to provide
   patient care in hospital settings, draws on variables used in staffing
   studies to describe the influence of many staffing variables on
   outcomes.
   Objectives: The aim of this study was to examine the construct validity
   of nurse dose by determining its association with methicillin-resistant
   Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections and reported patient falls on a
   sample of inpatient adult acute care units.
   Methods: Staffing data came from 26 units in Ontario, Canada, and
   Michigan. Financial and human resource data were data sources for
   staffing variables. Sources of data for MRSA came from infection control
   departments. Incident reports were the data source for patient falls.
   Data analysis consisted of bivariate correlations and Poisson
   regression.
   Results: Bivariate correlations revealed that nurse dose attributes
   (active ingredient and intensity) were associated significantly with
   both outcomes. Active ingredient (education, experience, skill mix) and
   intensity (full-time employees, registered nurse {[}RN]:patient ratio,
   RN hours per patient day) were significant predictors of MRSA.
   Coefficients for both attributes were negative and almost identical.
   Both attributes were significant predictors of reported patient falls,
   and coefficients were again negative, but coefficient sizes differed.
   Discussion: By conceptualizing nurse and staffing variables (education,
   experience, skill mix, full-time employees, RN:patient ratio, RN hours
   per patient day) as attributes of nurse dose and by including these in
   the same analysis, it is possible to determine their relative influence
   on MRSA infections and reported patient falls.}},

Abstract = {{A new estimator for estimating the size of an elusive target population
   is presented using frequency counts from capture-recapture sampling. The
   proposed estimator is developed by extending the idea of Chaos estimator
   using monotonicity of ratios of neighbouring frequency counts under a
   specific Poisson mixture sampling framework, the Poisson-Gamma mixture
   or negative binomial. The new estimator is achieved using a simple
   linear model on the basis of the log-ratio of neighbouring frequency
   counts as dependent variable which is valid under the Poisson-Gamma
   mixture. A simulation study is provided to study the performance of the
   proposed estimator under a variety of heterogeneous Poisson capture
   probabilities. Confidence interval estimation is done by means of an
   approximating normal approach and a modified bootstrap method, and was
   found to perform well. A variety of real data sets were also examined in
   order to illustrate the use of the proposed method. (C) 2011 Elsevier

   Tibet}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH}},
Year = {{2011}},

Abstract = {{We discuss an innovation in traveltime tomography that combines
   wavelet-based, multiscale parameterization and finite-frequency theory
   to solve two outstanding issues that inevitably arise from uneven source
   station distributions and from the three-dimensional (3-D) nature of
   wavefront healing: how to objectively address the intrinsically
   multiscale nature of data coverage while simultaneously maintain model
   resolution at each scale level. We apply the new, integrated methodology
   to investigate 3-D variations of P and S wave speeds (delta InVP and
   delta InVS) beneath the Himalayan-Tibetan orogen. In particular, we are
   able to constrain variations in the Poisson's ratio via delta
   In(V-P/V-S). The formulation is naturally data adaptive, resolving
   features at each scale only if the required data converge is available.
   The very first, long-wavelength feature that emerges is a clear anomaly
   of high delta InV that extends over more than 500 km beyond the northern
   edge of the Lhasa terrane at places. Farther northward, a strong
   negative anomaly underlies the region where recent volcanism occurs in
   northern Tibet. Regions of negative delta In(V-P/V-S) delineate a
   slab-like, subhorizontal feature concentrated between depths of similar
   to 100-250 km. Such characteristics are consistent with the notion that
   chemically refractory, and therefore buoyant, mantle lithosphere of the
   Indian shield ({''}Greater India{''}) has advanced subhorizontally
   northward far beyond the surficial Bangong-Nujiang suture. In the crust,
   two isolated regions of low delta InV, each extending to depths near 100
   km, occur along the Lunggar and the Yadong-Gulu active rifts in southern
   Tibet. Deep penetrating rifts imply that only a limited amount of
   horizontal displacement is being accommodated on subvertical structures.}},

Abstract = {{It appears that most models for micro-structured materials with auxetic
   deformations were found by clever intuition, possibly combined with
   optimization tools, rather than by systematic searches of existing
   structure archives. Here we review our recent approach of finding
   micro-structured materials with auxetic mechanisms within the vast
   repositories of planar tessellations. This approach has produced two
   previously unknown auxetic mechanisms, which have Poisson's ratio v(ss)
   = -1 when realized as a skeletal structure of stiff incompressible
   struts pivoting freely at common vertices. One of these, baptized
   Triangle-Square Wheels, has been produced as a linear-elastic cellular
   structure from Ti-6Al-4V alloy by selective electron beam melting. Its
   linear-elastic properties were measured by tensile experiments and yield
   an effective Poisson's ratio v(LE) approximate to -0.75, also in
   agreement with finite element modeling. The similarity between the
   Poisson's ratios v(SS) of the skeletal structure and v(LE) of the
   linear-elastic cellular structure emphasizes the fundamental role of
   geometry for deformation behavior, regardless of the mechanical details
   of the system. The approach of exploiting structure archives as
   candidate geometries for auxetic materials also applies to spatial
   networks and tessellations and can aid the quest for inherently
   three-dimensional auxetic mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{Estimating the size of an elusive target population is of prominent
   interest in many areas in the life and social sciences. Our aim is to
   provide an efficient and workable method to estimate the unknown
   population size, given the frequency distribution of counts of repeated
   identifications of units of the population of interest. This counting
   variable is necessarily zero-truncated, since units that have never been
   identified are not in the sample. We consider several applications:
   clinical medicine, where interest is in estimating patients with
   adenomatous polyps which have been overlooked by the diagnostic
   procedure; drug user studies, where interest is in estimating the number
   of hidden drug users which are not identified; veterinary surveillance
   of scrapie in the UK, where interest is in estimating the hidden amount
   of scrapie; and entomology and microbial ecology, where interest is in
   estimating the number of unobserved species of organisms. In all these
   examples, simple models such as the homogenous Poisson are not
   appropriate since they do not account for present and latent
   heterogeneity. The Poisson-Gamma (negative binomial) model provides a
   flexible alternative and often leads to well-fitting models. It has a
   long history and was recently used in the development of the Chao-Bunge
   estimator. Here we use a different property of the Poisson-Gamma model:
   if we consider ratios of neighboring Poisson-Gamma probabilities, then
   these are linearly related to the counts of repeated identifications.
   Also, ratios have the useful property that they are identical for
   truncated and untruncated distributions. In this paper we propose a
   weighted logarithmic regression model to estimate the zero frequency
   counts, assuming a Gamma-Poisson distribution for the counts. A detailed
   explanation about the chosen weights and a goodness of fit index are
   presented, along with extensions to other distributions. To evaluate the
   proposed estimator, we applied it to the benchmark examples mentioned
   above, and we compared the results with those obtained through the
   Chao-Bunge and other estimators. The major benefits of the proposed
   estimator are that it is defined under mild conditions, whereas the
   Chao-Bunge estimator fails to be well defined in several of the examples
   presented; in cases where the Chao-Bunge estimator is defined, its
   behavior is comparable to the proposed estimator in terms of Bias and
   MSE as a simulation study shows. Furthermore, the proposed estimator is
   relatively insensitive to inclusion or exclusion of large outlying
   frequencies, while sensitivity to outliers is characteristic of most
   other methods. The implications and limitations of such methods are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{We describe the mechanical behavior of isotropic fibrin networks at the

   molecules that are its basic building blocks. We show that the
   remarkable extensibility and compressibility of fibrin networks have
   their origins in the unfolding of fibrin molecules. The force-stretch
   behavior of a single fibrin fiber is described using a two-state model
   in which the fiber has a linear force-stretch relation in the folded
   phase and behaves like a worm-like-chain in the unfolded phase. The
   nanoscale force-stretch response is connected to the macro-scale
   stress-stretch response by means of the eight-chain model. This model is
   able to capture the macroscopic response of a fibrin network in uniaxial
   tension and appears remarkably simple given the molecular complexity. We
   use the eight-chain model to explain why fibrin networks have negative
   compressibility and Poisson's ratio greater than 1 due to unfolding of
   fibrin molecules. (C) 2011 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier

Title = {{No excess mortality after prostate biopsy: results from the European

Journal = {{BJU INTERNATIONAL}},

Abstract = {{Level of Evidence 1b
   What's known on the subject? and What does the study add?
   Prostate biopsy can potentially have fatal outcome. This is, however,
   rare. In the literature a few fatal cases of septicaemia have been
   reported as well as life-threatening rectal bleeding.
   Prostate biopsy is not associated with excess mortality and fatal
   complications seem to be very rare in a screening setting.
   OBJECTIVE
   center dot To assess possible excess mortality associated with prostate
   biopsy among screening participants of the European Randomized Study of
   Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC).
   patientS AND METHODS
   center dot From three centres in the ERSPC (Finland, The Netherlands and
   Sweden) 50 194 screened men aged 50.2-78.4 years were prospectively
   followed. A cohort of 12 959 first-time screening-positive men (i.e.
   with biopsy indication) was compared with another cohort of 37 235
   first-time screening-negative men.
   center dot Overall mortality rates (i.e. other cause than prostate
   cancer mortality) were calculated and the 120-day and 1-year cumulative
   mortality were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method, with a log-rank
   test for statistical significance.
   center dot Incidence rate ratios (RR) and statistical significance were
   evaluated using Poisson regression analyses, adjusting for age, total
   PSA level, screening centre and whether a biopsy indication was present,
   or whether a biopsy was actually performed or not.
   RESULTS
   center dot There was no statistically significant difference in
   cumulative 120-day other cause mortality between the two groups of men:
   0.24\% (95\% CI, 0.17-0.34) for screening-positive men vs 0.24\% (95\%
   CI, 0.20-0.30) for screening-negative men (P = 0.96). This implied no
   excess mortality for screening-positive men.
   center dot Screening-positive men who were not biopsied (n = 1238) had a
   more than fourfold risk of other cause mortality during the first 120
   days compared to screening-negative men: RR, 4.52 (95\% CI, 2.63-7.74)
   (P < 0.001), adjusted for age, whereas men who were actually biopsied (n
   = 11 721) had half the risk: RR, 0.41 (95\% CI, 0.23-0.73) (P = 0.002),
   adjusted for age.
   center dot Only 14/31 (45\%) of the screening-positive men who died
   within 120 days were biopsied and none died as an obvious complication
   to the biopsy.
   CONCLUSION
   center dot Prostate biopsy is not associated with excess mortality and
   fatal complications appear to be very rare.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the study was to use state-wide health administrative data to
   assess the incidence, temporal trends, and external cause of burn
   injury-related hospital admissions and mortality in Western Australia
   from 1983 to 2008. Linked hospital morbidity and death data for all
   persons hospitalized with an index burn injury in Western Australia for
   the period 1983-2008 were identified. Annual age-specific incidence and
   age standardized rates were estimated. Poisson regression analyses were
   used to estimate temporal trends in hospital admissions and mortality.
   Zero-truncated negative binomial regression analysis was used to
   identify factors associated with hospital length of stay. From 1983 to
   2008, there were 23,450 hospitalizations for an index burn injury.
   Hospital admission rates declined by an average annual rate of 2\%
   (incidence rate ratio {[}IRR], 95\% confidence interval {[}CI] = 0.983,
   0.981-0.984), and burn-related mortality declined by an average annual
   rate of 2\% (IRR, 95\% CI = 0.98, 0.96-1.01). Aboriginal people while
   having significantly higher hospitalization rates than non-Aboriginal
   people experienced a greater 26-year decline in hospitalizations of 58\%
   (IRR, 95\% CI = 0.42, 0.37-0.48) compared with 32\% (IRR, 95\% CI =
   0.68, 0.65-0.71) for non-Aboriginal people. Children younger than 5
   years, 20- to 24-year-old men, and adults older than 65 years remain at
   high risk for burn injury, and males continue to be hospitalized twice
   as frequently as females. The results demonstrate declines in burn
   injury hospitalizations and mortality in both Aboriginal and
   non-Aboriginal populations. Continued research is required of the
   impacts of medical interventions and the burn pathway of identified
   high-risk populations. (J Burn Care Res 2011;32:379-386)}},

Abstract = {{The study of chiral materials is important for the investigation of
   carbon nanotubes, auxetic materials and bones. The chiral effects cannot
   be described within classical elasticity. In this paper, the problem of
   the circular tube under internal and external pressure is solved in the
   context of the linear theory of chiral Cosserat elasticity. The work is
   motivated by the recent interest in the using Cosserat elastic solid as
   model for auxetic materials, bones and chiral carbon nanotubes. First,
   the generalized plane strain of an isotropic chiral elastic material is
   investigated. Then, the solution of the pressure vessel problem is
   established. The salient feature of the solution is that, in the absence
   of body and surface moments, a pressure acting on the surface of a
   chiral tube produces a microrotation of the material particles. It is
   shown that the radial displacement and the radial stress are modified
   from the values predicted by the theory of achiral materials. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{Introducing hierarchy into structures has been credited with improving
   elastic properties and damage tolerance. Specifically, adding
   hierarchical sub-structures to honeycombs, which themselves have
   good-density specific elastic and energy-absorbing properties, has been
   proposed in the literature. An investigation of the elastic properties
   and structural hierarchy in honeycombs was undertaken, exploring the
   effects of adding hierarchy into a range of honeycombs, with hexagonal,
   triangular or square geometry super and sub-structure cells, via
   simulation using finite elements. Key parameters describing these
   geometries included the relative lengths of the sub- and
   super-structures, the fraction of mass shared between the sub- and
   super-structures, the co-ordination number of the honeycomb cells, the
   form and extent of functional grading, and the Poisson's ratio of the
   sub-structure. The introduction of a hierarchical sub-structure into a
   honeycomb, in most cases, has a deleterious effect upon the in-plane
   density specific elastic modulus, typically a reduction of 40 to 50\% vs
   a conventional non-hierarchical version. More complex sub-structures,
   e.g. graded density, can recover values of density specific elastic
   modulus. With careful design of functionally graded unit cells it is
   possible to exceed, by up to 75\%, the density specific modulus of
   conventional versions. A negative Poisson's ratio sub-structure also
   engenders substantial increases to the density modulus versus
   conventional honeycombs. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICS OF PLASMAS}},
Year = {{2011}},

Abstract = {{The formation and dynamics of fully nonlinear ion-acoustic solitary
   waves, which accompany electronegative plasmas composed of positive
   ions, two-negative ions, isothermal electrons, as well as a fraction of
   stationary charged (positive or negative) dust impurities are
   investigated. By using the hydrodynamic and Poisson equations, an
   energy-integral equation involving a Sagdeev pseudo-potential is
   derived. Using the latter, we have defined precisely the existence
   regions of the electrostatic localized pulses. The critical total
   negative ions concentration ac and critical second-negative ion density
   ratio mc thresholds, which indicate where the solitary pulses set in,
   have been determined for various regimes. Numerical calculations reveal
   that only supersonic pulses can exist. The total negative ions
   concentration, the second-to-total negative ions density ratio,
   electrons-to-positive ions temperature ratio, dust impurities
   concentration, positive-to-negative mass ratio, and Mach number have
   been investigated on the nonlinear wave profile. It is found that the
   total negative ion concentration as well as the dust particles
   concentration play the significant role in deciding the polarity of the
   propagating pulses. The results could be applied to investigate and
   predict the behavior of the nonlinear solitary structure in future

Abstract = {{Using density functional theory (DFT), we have studied the effect of
   carbon concentration Z on the shear modulus G, elastic constant c(ij),
   and Poisson ratio nu of carbides (W1/2Al1/2)C-Z while the most stable
   structures are determined by calculating the lowest formation energy. It
   is found that the maximal G value and the lowest Poisson ratio nu value
   are reached at Z = 3/4 due to atomic configuration changes,
   additionally, G values of (W1/2Al1/2) CZ should be lower than that of WC
   due to lower c(ij) values. The results of electronic analysis show that
   the increased covalent bonding of C-2p and W-5d contributes to
   anisotropic c(ij) and G positively and results in a lower nu value
   because the excess negative charge induced by the substitution of Al3+

Abstract = {{P>Enterobacter species are the fourth most common cause of Gram-negative
   bloodstream infection (BSI). We examined temporal changes and seasonal
   variation in the incidence rate of Enterobacter spp. BSI, estimated
   28-day and 1-year mortality, and determined in vitro antimicrobial
   resistance rates of Enterobacter spp. bloodstream isolates in Olmsted
   County, Minnesota, from 1 January 1998 to 31 December 2007.
   Multivariable Poisson regression was used to examine temporal changes
   and seasonal variation in incidence rate and Kaplan-Meier method was
   used to estimate 28-day and 1-year mortality. The median age of patients
   with Enterobacter spp. BSI was 58 years and 53\% were female. The
   overall age- and gender-adjusted incidence rate of Enterobacter spp. BSI
   was 3.3 per 100 000 person-years (95\% CI 2.3-4.4). There was a linear
   trend of increasing incidence rate from 0.8 (95\% CI 0-1.9) to 6.2 (95\%
   CI 3.0-9.3) per 100 000 person-years between 1998 and 2007 (p 0.002).
   There was no significant difference in the incidence rate of
   Enterobacter spp. BSI during the warmest 4 months compared to the
   remainder of the year (incidence rate ratio 1.06; 95\% CI 0.47-2.01).
   The overall 28-day and 1-year mortality rates of Enterobacter spp. BSI
   were 21\% (95\% CI 8-34\%) and 38\% (95\% CI 22-53\%), respectively. Up
   to 13\% of Enterobacter spp. bloodstream isolates were resistant to
   third-generation cephalosporins. To our knowledge, this is the first
   population-based study to describe the epidemiology and outcome of
   Enterobacter spp. BSI. The increase in incidence rate of Enterobacter
   spp. BSI over the past decade, coupled with its associated antimicrobial
   resistance, dictate the need for further investigation of this syndrome.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},

Number = {{3, 1}},
Month = {{MAR 31}},
Abstract = {{We investigate the properties of crystalline phantom membranes, at the
   crumpling transition and in the flat phase, using a nonperturbative
   renormalization group approach. We avoid a derivative expansion of the
   effective average action and instead analyze the full momentum
   dependence of the elastic coupling functions. This leads to a more
   accurate determination of the critical exponents and further yields the
   full momentum dependence of the correlation functions of the in-plane
   and out-of-plane fluctuation. The flow equations are solved numerically
   for D = 2 dimensional membranes embedded in a d = 3 dimensional space.
   Within our approach we find a crumpling transition of second order which
   is characterized by an anomalous exponent eta(c) approximate to 0.63(8)
   and the thermal exponent nu approximate to 0.69. Near the crumpling
   transition the order parameter of the flat phase vanishes with a
   critical exponent beta approximate to 0.22. The flat phase anomalous
   dimension is eta(f) approximate to 0.85 and the Poisson's ratio inside
   the flat phase is found to be sigma(f) approximate to -1/3. At the
   crumpling transition we find a much larger negative value of the
   Poisson's ratio sigma(c) approximate to -0.71(5). We discuss further in
   detail the different regimes of the momentum dependent fluctuations,
   both in the flat phase and in the vicinity of the crumpling transition,
   and extract the crossover momentum scales which separate them.}},

Abstract = {{The current-voltage characteristics of the Ni/InAlN/GaN Schottky diodes
   were measured at various temperatures in the range of 300-820 K. The
   experimental data were analyzed considering different current-transport
   mechanisms, such as thermionic emission, generation-recombination,
   tunneling and leakage currents. From the fitting of experimental data it
   follows that the tunneling current dominates in whole temperature range.
   The thermionic emission becomes comparable to the tunneling current only
   at highest temperatures used. The barrier height of the Ni/InAlN/GaN
   Schottky diodes, evaluated from the thermionic emission current, shows a
   slightly negative temperature coefficient and its value at 300 K is 1.47
   eV. Lower barrier heights were reported before, which follow from an
   incorrect evaluation of measured data without separation of individual
   current components. The dislocation density of about 2 x 10(9) cm(-2) is
   obtained assuming dislocation governed tunneling current mechanism. (c)

Abstract = {{This study deals with the traffic accident at the S-ramps of trumpet
   interchanges. The purposes of the study are to analyze the relations
   between the driving conditions of ramps and traffic accidents, and to
   develop the accident models. In pursuing the above, 142 trumpet
   interchange (AO, AU, BO and BU) are classified into 4 types; the
   characteristic data of ramp alignments are investigated; the expressway
   traffic accident records (the 720 case of traffic accidents from
   September 1, 1998. to December 31, 2003) are collected; and the data of
   expressway traffic volume are calculated (the average annual daily
   traffic of each ramp is calibrated by the expressway origin destination
   survey). In this study, the accident models, using by Poisson, Negative
   Binomial (NB) and Zero-Altered Model (ZAM) which are all statistically
   significant were developed. The likelihood ratio of Poisson model is
   0.1212 and that of Zero Inflated Poisson (ZIP) model is 0.2020. Also,
   the analysis shows that the likelihood ratio of Negative binominal
   regression model is 0.1918 and that of Zero Inflated Negative Binomial
   (ZINB) model is 0.1993. In summary, it is analyzed that NB model is the
   greatest among the above 4 models on the trumpet interchange S-type
   ramps.}},

Abstract = {{Mode structure maps for freely vibrating cylinders over a range of
   Poisson's ratio, nu, are desirable for the design and interpretation of
   experiments using resonant ultrasound spectroscopy (RUS). The full range
   of isotropic nu (-1 to +0.5) is analyzed here using a finite element
   method to accommodate materials with a negative Poisson's ratio. The
   fundamental torsional mode has the lowest frequency provided nu is
   between about -0.24 and +0.5. For any nu, the torsional mode can be
   identified utilizing the polarization sensitivity of the shear
   transducers. RUS experimental results for materials with Poisson's ratio
   +0.3, +0.16, and -0.3 and a previous numerical study for nu = 0.33 are
   compared with the present analysis. Interpretation of results is easiest
   if the length/diameter ratio of the cylinder is close to 1. Slight
   material anisotropy leads to splitting of the higher modes but not of
   the fundamental torsion mode. (C) 2011 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{We analyze a class of signal-to-interference-and-noise-ratio (SINR)
   random graphs. These random graphs arise in the modeling packet
   transmissions in wireless networks. In contrast to previous studies on
   SINR graphs, we consider both a space and a time dimension. The spatial
   aspect originates from the random locations of the network nodes in the
   Euclidean plane. The time aspect stems from the random transmission
   policy followed by each network node and from the time variations of the
   wireless channel characteristics. The combination of these random space
   and time aspects leads to fluctuations of the SINR experienced by the
   wireless channels, which in turn determine the progression of packets in
   space and time in such a network. In this paper we study optimal paths
   in such wireless networks in terms of first passage percolation on this
   random graph. We establish both `positive' and `negative' results on the
   associated time constant. The latter determines the asymptotics of the
   minimum delay required by a packet to progress from a source node to a
   destination node when the Euclidean distance between the two tends to
   infinity. The main negative result states that this time constant is
   infinite on the random graph associated with a Poisson point process
   under natural assumptions on the wireless channels. The main positive
   result states that, when adding a periodic node infrastructure of
   arbitrarily small intensity to the Poisson point process, the time
   constant is positive and finite.}},

Abstract = {{The radial stretching of a hollow thin membrane without compressive
   strength is considered within the framework of the small strain tension
   field theory. For each type of the uniform boundary conditions, the
   loading plane is partitioned into the domains of biaxial tension,
   tension field and buckling. The extent of these domains critically
   depends on the value of the Poisson's coefficient and on the aspect
   ratio of the membrane. The stress and displacement fields are determined
   at an arbitrary stage of loading, when the outer biaxially stressed
   (taut) annulus surrounds the inner (tension field) portion of the
   membrane, characterized by continuously distributed infinitesimal
   wrinkles. The growth of the tension field as the loading increases is
   analyzed. It is shown that, depending on the Poisson's coefficient and
   the aspect ratio of the membrane, the tension field may or may not
   spread throughout the whole membrane. For the fixed outer boundary, and
   the applied tension or a negative displacement at the inner boundary,
   and for a particular combination of the material and geometric
   parameters, the tension field instantly spreads to a specific depth
   within the membrane, dependent on the Poisson's ratio and the outer
   radius of the membrane, remaining constant during further increase of
   the loading.}},

Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{67}},
Number = {{1}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{As a major analytical method for outbreak detection, Kulldorff's
   space-time scan statistic (2001, Journal of the Royal Statistical
   Society, Series A 164, 61-72) has been implemented in many syndromic
   surveillance systems. Since, however, it is based on circular windows in
   space, it has difficulty correctly detecting actual noncircular
   clusters. Takahashi et al. (2008, International Journal of Health
   Geographics 7, 14) proposed a flexible space-time scan statistic with
   the capability of detecting noncircular areas. It seems to us, however,
   that the detection of the most likely cluster defined in these
   space-time scan statistics is not the same as the detection of localized
   emerging disease outbreaks because the former compares the observed
   number of cases with the conditional expected number of cases. In this
   article, we propose a new space-time scan statistic which compares the
   observed number of cases with the unconditional expected number of
   cases, takes a time-to-time variation of Poisson mean into account, and
   implements an outbreak model to capture localized emerging disease
   outbreaks more timely and correctly. The proposed models are illustrated
   with data from weekly surveillance of the number of absentees in primary
   schools in Kitakyushu-shi, Japan, 2006.}},

Volume = {{65}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Background Count outcomes are commonly encountered in many epidemiology
   applications, and are often characterised by a large proportion of
   zeros. Although linear or logistic regression models have often been
   used to analyse count outcomes, the resulting estimates are likely to be
   inefficient, inconsistent or biased.
   Methods Data were taken from the first wave of the English Longitudinal
   Study of Ageing (ELSA). The main outcome measure is difficulty (ranging
   from 0 to 6) with `Activities of Daily Living (ADL-s)', such as
   dressing, walking across a room, bathing, eating, getting in and out of
   bed and using the toilet. Four regression models specifically developed
   for count outcomes were fitted to the data: Poisson, negative binomial
   (NB), zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) and zero-inflated negative binomial
   (ZINB). The models were compared using the Likelihood Ratio (LR) test of
   overdispersion, the Vuong test and graphical methods.
   Results The plots of predictions showed that overall, the ZINB model fit
   best. Although the ZINB and the ZIP models showed similar fit, the LR
   test provided strong evidence that the ZINB had improved fit over the
   ZIP. Increasing difficulties with ADL-s were associated with fair/poor
   self-reported health, limiting longstanding illness and physical
   inactivity. The probability of not having any difficulty with ADL-s
   decreases with a limiting longstanding illness, increasing age, no
   education, fair/poor self-reported health and with not living with a
   partner.
   Conclusion Models specifically developed for count outcomes with excess
   zeros such as ZINB can provide better insights into the investigation of
   the factors associated with the difficulties with ADL-s.}},

Abstract = {{The linear bifurcation theory is used to investigate the stability of
   soft thin films bonded to curved substrates. It is found that such a
   film can spontaneously lose its stability due to van der Waals or
   electrostatic interaction when its thickness reduces to the order of
   microns or nanometers. We first present the generic method for analyzing
   the surface stability of a thin film interacting with the substrate and
   then discuss several important geometric configurations with either a
   positive or negative mean curvature. The critical conditions for the
   onset of spontaneous instability in these representative examples are
   established analytically. Besides the surface energy and Poisson's ratio
   of the thin film, the curvature of the substrate is demonstrated to have
   a significant influence on the wrinkling behavior of the film. The
   results suggest that one may fabricate nanopatterns or enhance the
   surface stability of soft thin films on curved solid surfaces by
   modulating the mechanical properties of the films and/or such
   geometrical properties as film thickness and substrate curvature. This
   study can also help to understand various phenomena associated with
   surface instability. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{GUT}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{60}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{318-324}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Objective Enteric pathogens have been implicated in the aetiology of
   inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but increased rates of stool testing
   of patients with unclear gastrointestinal symptoms might cause detection
   bias. Hence, the objective of this study was to analyse incidence rates
   of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis among patients with
   Salmonella- or Campylobacter-positive and negative stool tests and to
   study the incidence of positive and negative stool tests among patients
   already diagnosed with IBD.
   Methods The Danish population was followed for 94.3 million person-years
   during 1992-2008 using national registers to identify persons with
   positive and negative stool tests and patients with IBD. Using Poisson
   regression, incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for IBD after positive or
   negative stool tests and, conversely, IRRs for positive and negative
   stool tests following IBD, were calculated.
   Results IRRs for IBD were significantly high in the first year after
   Salmonella- or Campylobacter-positive stool tests (IRRs 5.4-9.8), and
   they remained moderately increased 1-10 years later (IRRs 1.6-2.2), and
   less so > 10 years later (IRRs 0.8-1.8). However, IRRs for IBD < 1 year
   after a negative stool test were several-fold higher (IRRs 53.2-57.5),
   and a decreasing incidence pattern over time was parallel to that
   following positive test results. Among patients with IBD, IRRs for
   subsequent positive and-most notably-negative stool test results were
   also significantly high.

Abstract = {{Methods. We characterized trends in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
   and HCV infection incidence and HCV infection prevalence among injection
   drug users (IDUs) recruited over 4 periods: 1988-1989, 1994-1995, 1998,
   and 2005-2008. We calculated HIV and HCV infection incidence within the
   first year of follow-up among IDUs whose test results were negative for
   these viruses at baseline (n = 2061 and n = 373, respectively). We used
   Poisson regression to compare trends across groups.
   Results. HIV infection incidence declined significantly from 5.5
   cases/100 person-years (py) in the 1988-1989 group to 2.0 cases/100 py
   in the 1994-1995 group to 0 cases/100 py in the 1998 and 2005-2008
   groups. Concurrently, HCV infection incidence declined but remained
   robust (22.0 cases/100 py in the 1988-1989 cohort to 17.2 cases/100 py
   in the 1994-1995 cohort, 17.9 cases/100 py in the 1998 cohort, and 7.8
   cases/100 py in the 2005-2008 cohort; P = .07). Likewise, HCV infection
   prevalence declined, but chiefly in younger IDUs. For persons aged < 39
   years, relative to the 1988-1989 cohort, all groups exhibited
   significant declines (adjusted prevalence ratio {[}PR] for the 2005-08
   cohort, .73; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI], .65-.81). However, for
   persons aged >= 39 years, only the 2005-2008 cohort exhibited declining
   prevalence compared with the 1988-1989 cohort (adjusted PR, .87; 95\%
   CI, .77-.99).
   Conclusions. Although efforts to reduce blood-borne infection incidence
   have had impact, this work will need to be intensified for the most
   transmissible viruses, such as HCV.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials exhibit the unusual property of becoming fatter when
   uniaxially stretched and thinner when uniaxially compressed (i.e. they
   exhibit a negative Poisson ratio; NPR), a property that may result in
   various enhanced properties. The NPR is the result of the manner in
   which particular geometric features in the micro- or nanostructure of
   the materials deform when they are subjected to uniaxial loads. Here, we
   propose and discuss a new model made from different-sized rigid
   rectangles, which rotate relative to each other. This new model has the
   advantage over existing models that it can be used to describe the
   properties of very different systems ranging from silicates and zeolites
   to liquid-crystalline polymers. We show that such systems can exhibit
   scale-independent auxetic behaviour for stretching in particular
   directions, with Poisson's ratios being dependent on the shape and
   relative size of different rectangles in the model and the angle between
   them.}},

Title = {{Random parameter models for accident prediction on two-lane undivided

Abstract = {{Introduction: Generalized linear modeling (GLM), with the assumption of
   Poisson or negative binomial error structure, has been widely employed
   in road accident modeling. A number of explanatory variables related to
   traffic, road geometry, and environment that contribute to accident
   occurrence have been identified and accident prediction models have been
   proposed. The accident prediction models reported in literature largely
   employ the fixed parameter modeling approach, where the magnitude of
   influence of an explanatory variable is considered to be fixed for any
   observation in the population. Similar models have been proposed for
   Indian highways too, which include additional variables representing
   traffic composition. The mixed traffic on Indian highways comes with a
   lot of variability within, ranging from difference in vehicle types to
   variability in driver behavior. This could result in variability in the
   effect of explanatory variables on accidents across locations. Random
   parameter models, which can capture some of such variability, are
   expected to be more appropriate for the Indian situation. Method: The
   present study is an attempt to employ random parameter modeling for
   accident prediction on two-lane undivided rural highways in India. Three
   years of accident history, from nearly 200 km of highway segments, is
   used to calibrate and validate the models. Results: The results of the
   analysis suggest that the model coefficients for traffic volume,
   proportion of cars, motorized two-wheelers and trucks in traffic, and
   driveway density and horizontal and vertical curvatures are randomly
   distributed across locations. Conclusions: The paper is concluded with a
   discussion on modeling results and the limitations of the present study.

Title = {{Accuracy of Anthropometric Indexes of Obesity to Predict Diabetes

Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HYPERTENSION}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{2}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND
   Anthropometric measurements and indexes that assess excess of adiposity
   are associated with cardiovascular risk factors, and predict diabetes
   mellitus.
   METHODS
   This cross-sectional study reported the performance of adiposity indexes
   to detect or turn diabetes unlikely in patients with hypertension.
   Patients with hypertension (blood pressure (BP) >= 140/90 mm Hg or
   antihypertensive drug use) aged 18-80 years, being 150 men and 332
   women, had weight, height, waist circumference (WC), hip circumference,
   body mass index (BMI), waist-hip ratio (WHR), waist-to-height ratio
   (WHtR), and waist-to-square height ratio (WHt(2)R) calculated. Diabetes
   was diagnosed by fasting blood glucose >= 126 mg/dl or antidiabetic drug
   use (23\% of the sample).
   RESULTS
   All anthropometric indexes were associated with diabetes in a modified
   Poisson regression, adjusting forage, smoking, and physical activity, in
   women, but not in men. In men, only the area under the
   receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) for WHR was statistically
   associated with diabetes (0.67,95\% confidence interval (Cl) 0.57-0.77).
   A cutoff of >= 0.95 had sensitivity of 84.6\% (73.3-95.9) and negative
   post-test probability of 12.8\% (3.2-22.4). Among women, WC >88 cm, WHR
   >= 0.85, and WHtR >0.54 had sensitivity >93\% and negative post-test
   probability <7.5\%.
   CONCLUSIONS
   WHR >= 0.85, WC>88.0cm, and WHtR>0.54 for women and WHR >= 0.95 for men
   are highly suggestive of diabetes among this population of hypertensive
   patients. Indexes below these cutoffs turn diabetes unlikely in this
   context. The investigation of reproducibility of this performance in
   other outpatient clinics is warranted.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present the high pressure studies of well known
   negative thermal expansion material ZrW2O8 on the basis of our density
   functional theory calculations. We reproduce the experimental alpha and
   gamma crystal structures of ZrW2O8. We calculate the transition pressure
   (from alpha to gamma) of this material to be approximate to 26 kbar. Our
   calculated positional and axial parameters are in an excellent agreement
   with the available experimental values for the both alpha and gamma
   phases of this material. Then we study the mechanical properties of this
   material. We calculate the elastic constants, bulk, shear and Young's
   moduli, Poisson's ratio, and Debye temperature of alpha-ZrW2O8. In our
   study, we find that the generalized gradient approximation method fails
   to obtain the correct values while the local density approximation (LDA)
   method successfully reproduces the experimental bulk modulus of ZrW2O8.
   Our calculated values of the shear and Young's moduli, Poisson's ratio,
   and Debye temperature of alpha-ZrW2O8 with LDA method are also in good
   agreement with the experimental results. Finally, we predict and analyze
   the optical properties of this material. c 2011 American Institute of

Abstract = {{Honeycombs, as cores in sandwich panels, are in wider use in transport
   applications where density-specific performance is critical. The ability
   of honeycombs to withstand through-thickness compression, and in
   particular resist buckling, is a key performance factor in many
   applications. However reports of the systematic study of buckling limits
   in such materials are scant. Honeycomb unit cells with a range of
   geometries, including conventional hexagonal, re-entrant hexagonal
   geometries, and modifications of both thereof, were tested mechanically
   and simulated via finite element modelling. The primary figure of merit
   was the density-specific peak compressive stress immediately prior to
   onset of buckling collapse. The conventional hexagonal honeycomb unit
   cell, as examined here, is not well optimised for density-specific peak
   stress; in comparison the re-entrant unit cell examined here had
   approximately 13\% higher density-specific peak stress. Modifications to
   these geometries, such as face stiffeners and fillets, increased
   absolute values of peak stress but in most cases were deleterious or at
   best neutral to density-specific peak stress due to the subsequent
   increase mass of the honeycombs. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Rationale In aging HIV-infected populations comorbid diseases are
   important determinants of morbidity and mortality. Pulmonary diseases
   have not been systematically assessed in the combination antiretroviral
   therapy (ART) era.
   Objectives: To determine the incidence of pulmonary diseases in
   HIV-infected persons compared with HIV-uninfected persons.
   Methods: We analyzed data from the Veterans Aging Cohort Study Virtual
   Cohort, consisting of 33,420 HIV-infected veterans and 66,840 age, sex,
   race and ethnicity, and site-matched HIV-uninfected veterans. Using
   Poisson regression, incidence rates and adjusted incidence rate ratios
   were calculated to determine the association of HIV with pulmonary
   disease. The Virtual Cohort was merged with the 1999 Veterans Large
   Health Survey to adjust for self-reported smoking in a nested sample
   (14\%).
   Measurements and Main Results: Incident chronic obstructive pulmonary
   disease, lung cancer, pulmonary hypertension, and pulmonary fibrosis, as
   well as pulmonary infections, were significantly more likely among
   HIV-infected patients compared with uninfected patients in adjusted
   analyses, although rates of asthma did not differ by HIV status.
   Bacterial pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were the
   two most common incident pulmonary diseases, whereas opportunistic
   pneumonias were less common. Absolute rates of most pulmonary diseases
   increased with age, although the relative differences between those with
   and without HIV infection were greatest in younger persons. Chronic
   obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma, as well as pulmonary
   infections, were less likely in those with lower HIV RNA levels and use
   of ART at baseline.
   Conclusions: Pulmonary diseases among HIV-infected patients receiving
   care within the Veterans Affairs Healthcare System in the combination
   ART era reflect a substantial burden of non AIDS-defining and chronic
   conditions, many of which are associated with aging.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FENO) is a marker of airway
   inflammation. Its role in assessing asthma burden in clinical practice
   needs more study. Objective. To determine whether higher FENO levels are
   associated with greater asthma burden. Methods. This was a multicenter
   cross-sectional retrospective study of atopic 12- to 56-year-old
   persistent asthmatics on inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). Questionnaire
   and 1-year retrospective administrative data were used to analyze by
   unadjusted and adjusted robust Poisson regression (relative risks) and
   negative binomial regression {[}incidence rate ratios (IRRs)] the
   associations of masked FENO levels (NIOXMINO (R)) to short-acting
   beta-agonist (SABA) dispensings and oral corticosteroid (OCS) use in the
   past year independent of spirometry and an asthma control tool {[}
   Asthma Control Test (ACT)]. Results. FENO levels ranged from 7-215 ppb
   (median 28 ppb) in 325 patients. Higher FENO levels significantly
   correlated with more SABA dispensings and OCS courses in the past year,
   lower FEV(1)\% predicted levels, but not ACT score. FENO highest (>= 48
   ppb) versus lowest (<= 19 ppb) quartile values were associated
   independently in the past year with >= 7 SABA canisters dispensed
   (relative risk = 2.40, 95\% CI = 1.25-4.62) and total number of SABA
   canisters dispensed (IRR = 1.46, 95\% CI = 1.12-1.99) and with = 1 OCS
   course (relative risk = 1.48, 95\% CI = 1.06-2.07) and total number of
   OCS courses (IRR = 1.71, 95\% CI = 1.09-2.66). The significant
   independent relationship of higher FENO levels to increasing SABA
   dispensings and OCS courses was confirmed by linear trend analyses.
   Conclusions. Independent and clinically meaningful associations between
   higher FENO levels and greater asthma burden during a prior year in
   persistent asthmatics on ICS suggest that FENO measurement may be a
   complementary tool to help clinicians assess asthma burden.}},

Abstract = {{Cellular structures having negative Poisson's ratios can be designed to
   have high shear flexure properties. In this paper, the elastic limits of
   hexagonal honeycombs including the ones having negative Poisson's ratios
   (NPR) are explored with various cell geometries under simple shear
   loading. While designing a shear modulus, e.g., G(12)(center dot) of 10
   MPa, of hexagonal honeycombs, corresponding meso-structures are designed
   with three constituent materials; an aluminum alloy (7075-T6). a
   titanium alloy (Ti-6Al-4V), and a high strength steel (ANSI 4340). The
   in-plane linear elastic honeycomb model is employed to achieve the shear
   moduli of the hexagonal honeycombs made of the three constituent
   materials. The shear strengths, (tau(center dot)(pl))(12) and shear
   yield strains, (gamma(center dot)(pl))(12) of hexagonal honeycombs are
   obtained from finite element analysis using ABAQUS. The titanium alloy
   honeycombs show a good shear flexure property having both high
   (tau(center dot)(pl))(12) and (gamma(center dot)(pl))(12) when it is
   designed to the target G(12)(center dot). The re-entrant geometry makes
   honeycombs flexible associated with a high effective bending length. (C)

   synthetic composite materials}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Nacre, the iridescent material in seashells, is one of many natural
   materials employing hierarchical structures to achieve high strength and
   toughness from relatively weak constituents. Incorporating these
   structures into composites is appealing as conventional engineering
   materials often sacrifice strength to improve toughness. Researchers
   hypothesize that nacre's toughness originates within its
   brick-and-mortar-like microstructure. Under loading, bricks slide
   relative to each other, propagating inelastic deformation over
   millimeter length scales. This leads to orders-of-magnitude increase in
   toughness. Here, we use in situ atomic force microscopy fracture
   experiments and digital image correlation to quantitatively prove that
   brick morphology (waviness) leads to transverse dilation and subsequent
   interfacial hardening during sliding, a previously hypothesized dominant
   toughening mechanism in nacre. By replicating this mechanism in a
   scaled-up model synthetic material, we find that it indeed leads to
   major improvements in energy dissipation. Ultimately, lessons from this
   investigation may be key to realizing the immense potential of widely
   pursued nanocomposites.}},

Abstract = {{The smaller-ion shell (SiS) model of strong binary electrolyte solutions
   extends the Debye-Huckel theory to the case of ions of unequal size; it
   is effective for many electrolytes of the various families in water at
   25 degrees C up to moderate concentrations, with ion-size parameters
   (ISPs) of co-ions being equal to the ionic diameters, and with a varying
   degree of ISP additivity. A SiS analysis is now provided for aqueous
   solutions of the acids HCl, HBr, HI, and HClO(4) at 25 degrees C; theory
   fits very well with experiment when the mean effective ionic diameter of
   the proton (H(3)O(+)) is chosen as similar to 1.1 angstrom and the mean
   anion size is the corresponding crystallographic diameter, as with other
   electrolytes having the same anion. The ISP nonadditivity is positive
   and large, apparently reflecting a strong polarizing effect of the small
   proton on the large anion. The SiS-derived single-ion activity
   coefficients of the proton allow calculation of the pH of the acids, and
   reliable values are obtained below the known limit of pH approximate to
   2, i.e., smaller and even negative values. The computed pH compares well
   with the experimentally derived Hammett acidity function, H(0), up to
   moderate concentration; differences between the two functions at higher
   concentration shed light on the activity coefficients of Hammett
   indicators and their response to increasing acid strength.}},

Abstract = {{The discovery of ferroelectrics induced by peculiar magnetic structures
   brought about extensive theoretical and experimental studies. The key
   driving force for these magnetic ferroelectrics appears to lie in the
   inverse Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction in magnets with
   long-wavelength ``noncollinear{''} spin structures. In this Brief
   Report, we report the magnetodielectric effect in dysprosium iron garnet
   which has a noncollinear spin structure within a single unit cell,
   through the same DM interaction. The distinct effects of magnetism on
   the lattice are also demonstrated by the unprecedented magnetostriction
   with a negative Poisson ratio. We attribute the observed
   magnetodielectric effects and the huge magnetostriction to the
   magnetic-field-induced spin reorientation from noncollinear to
   collinear, which possibly weakens the proposed antiferroelectric-type
   lattice distortion. Our results suggest an additional class of
   magnetodielectrics and enrich the theoretical understanding of phenomena
   related to peculiar magnetic structures.}},

Abstract = {{A precipitator section is modeled numerically in 3D to determine the
   collection efficiency for conductive diesel exhaust particulates. It
   consists of a circular tube and a wire electrode mounted at the center
   of the tube, supplied with a negative high dc voltage, while the tube is
   electrically grounded. The analytical solutions of Poisson and current
   continuity equations are implemented to obtain the ionic space charge
   density and electric potential distributions in the channel. Commercial
   CFD FLUENT software is used to solve the k-epsilon turbulent flow model,
   while also considering the electrical body forces. Particle charging and
   motion equations are solved using Discrete Phase Model (DPM) feature of
   the FLUENT and programming User Defined Functions (UDFs). Particles are
   assumed to be charged by combined field and diffusion charging
   mechanisms. Effects of some electrical characteristics of diesel exhaust
   particulates, such as charge-to-mass ratio and particle migration
   velocity, on collection efficiency are assessed. Patterns of particle
   deposition along the channel are evaluated and compared for different
   particle sizes. Numerical modeling of the 3D EHD flow pattern induced by
   corona discharge is demonstrated in the cross section of the tube when
   the corona wire is slightly off-center (eccentric) in an arbitrary
   direction.}},

Abstract = {{The in-plane flexible shear property of hexagonal honeycombs may be
   useful for the compliant structural applications. In this paper,
   hyperelastic strain energy functions are developed for a finite in-plane
   shear deformation of hexagonal honeycombs over a constituent material's
   elastic range. Effective shear stress-strain curves of hexagonal
   structures and local cell wall deformation are investigated using the
   finite element based homogenization method. The hyperelastic models,
   which are only related to the effective properties of a honeycomb, may
   not be good enough to capture the nonlinear behavior at a high
   macroscopic shear strain level. The primary microscopic cell wall
   deformation mode under macroscopic in-plane shear loading was identified
   to be the bending of the vertical cell wall h, which is perpendicular to
   the macroscopic loading direction. The re-entrant hexagonal structures
   having a negative Poisson's ratio shows a high macroscopic shear
   flexible property associated with the high h when the honeycombs are
   designed to have the same macroscopic shear modulus. {[}DOI:

   material properties of the specimens with protective coatings more
   slightly than those without any protective coatings. High temperature
   environment affects the material properties of specimens more obviously
   than low temperature environment does. Therefore, when designing the

Abstract = {{By using the hydrodynamic equations of positive and two negative ions,
   Boltzmann electron density distribution, and Poisson equation with
   immobile positive/negative dust particles, a cylindrical Korteweg-de
   Vries (CKdV) equation is derived for small but finite amplitude
   ion-acoustic waves. At the critical total negative ion concentration
   and/or the critical density rate of the second-negative ions, the pulses
   collapse at this limit as nonlinearity fails to balance dispersion. Then
   the CKdV equation is not appropriate to describe the system. Therefore,
   the modified CKdV (MCKdV) and extended CKdV (ECKdV) equations are
   derived at the critical plasma compositions and in the vicinity of the
   critical plasma compositions, respectively. The physical parameters of
   two plasma environments (e.g., Xe+-F--SF6- and Ar+-F--SF6- plasmas) are
   examined on the wave phase velocity and the nonlinear localized pulse
   profile. The latter should satisfy necessary condition to exist. The
   localized pulse of Ar+-F--SF6- plasma is much spiky than Xe+-F--SF6-
   plasma. Thus, the mass ratio of the negative-to-positive ions is focused
   upon and it emphasizes to play an important role on the pulse profile.
   Dependence of the geometrical divergence on the pulse profile is also
   investigated, which indicates that the localized pulse damps with time.
   The implications of our results agrees with the experimental
   observations.}},

   Northwest Atlantic seabirds}},
Journal = {{MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{425}},
Pages = {{261-268}},
Abstract = {{Many species of animals live in groups, but the mechanisms responsible
   for the formation and cohesion of groups are not well known and have not
   often been quantified. Different models of aggregations, all making
   unique assumptions about rates of arrivals to and departures from
   groups, produce different group size distributions. Fitting such models
   to empirical distributions of group sizes can provide insights into the
   mechanisms that underlie aggregations in animals. Four models predicting
   the distribution of group sizes (the power law, Poisson, exponential and
   negative binomial models) were tested in 7 species of Northwest Atlantic
   seabirds using maximum-likelihood estimation and a random factor to
   control for differences in mean group size among seabird surveys. Of the
   4 models tested, the power law ranked first in most species in terms of
   raw Akaike's information criterion values. Nevertheless,
   likelihood-ratio tests revealed that the power law and the negative
   binomial model, which ranked second in most species, often provided a
   statistically similar fit to the data. Goodness-of-fit tests revealed a
   rather good fit of these models to the data. The finding that
   aggregation models can apply to the distribution of group sizes offers
   the opportunity to examine quantitatively the mechanisms or underlying
   processes that give rise to aggregations in seabirds and possibly other
   animals.}},

   their auxetic characteristics. It is also shown that such changes do not
   occur if the foams are subjected to the high temperature or solvent
   exposure in a contained state which does not permit the expansion. This
   means that auxetic foams can still be used in such environments provided

Abstract = {{The growing interest in the field of negative Poisson's ratio materials
   is motivated by the attractive mechanical properties of these materials
   and the potential enhancements that might be derived from replacing a
   positive Poisson's ratio component with its auxetic counterpart. In this
   paper we report on preliminary results of an ongoing experimental study
   to test the hypothesis that an auxetic composite can be produced by
   embedding an auxetic fibre network within a conventional (positive
   Poisson's ratio) matrix. First we present results of tensile tests
   performed on samples of compressed mats of sintered stainless steel
   fibres which are known to have a negative Poisson's ratio out-of-plane.
   Next we present results of mechanical tests and imaging studies on
   composite samples made by infusing the stainless steel mats with a
   polymer. Finally we report on the auxetic behaviour observed in some
   polymer nanocomposites with a high loading of carbon nanofibers. We
   conjecture that the embedded nanofibers form an effective network and,
   like the stainless steel mats, the compression of the samples during
   fabrication renders the embedded networks auxetic. The compliance of the
   polymer matrix relative to the nanofiber network results in an auxetic
   composite. The results demonstrate the feasibility of the approach and
   the potential for developing new auxetic composites with auxetic fibre
   networks as the reinforcing phase. (C) 2010 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co.

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The global maximum and global minimum Poisson's ratio (PR) surfaces,
   regions of different auxetic behaviour and the domains of the different
   extreme directions of cubic materials are shown and discussed in terms
   of the elastic moduli ratios, X = G/K, Y = G/W, where K is the bulk
   modulus and G, W, are shear moduli. A straightforward way is given to
   classify any cubic material as being auxetic, nonauxetic and partially
   auxetic, as well as calculating its extreme PR values. A decomposition
   of the XY plane with the elastic constant ratio lambda = C-12/C-44 is
   introduced to facilitate the interpretation of cubic materials under
   hydrostatic pressure, P > 0, and isotropic tension, P < 0, which are two
   qualitatively different situations. Using this representation it is
   demonstrated that cubic materials with lambda > 0 can be auxetic only
   under `negative' pressure (P < 0). It is shown that the influence of
   pressure on the auxetic behaviour is different for the positive and
   negative X cases. In particular, a cubic material with 0 > lambda > 1
   may be auxetic at negative as well as positive pressure. The work
   demonstrates the crucial role of P in obtaining desired auxetic
   behaviour. Microscopic mechanisms which tune the cubic system to
   targeted regions in the XY plane are investigated with a fcc crystal of
   particles interacting via the pairwise spherically symmetric potential,
   phi(r). It is found that all fcc static models in which the range of
   interaction is only between nearest neighbour particles are placed on a
   universal curve in the XY plane. It is shown that auxetic behaviours can
   be achieved with simple static phi(r) analytic forms. The influence of
   the next neighbour interactions on the universal curve is also
   considered. In order to assess the role of thermal fluctuations,
   molecular dynamic simulations for two different phi(r) (the
   Lennard-Jones (LJ) and the tethered particle potentials) were performed.
   At low temperatures the studied systems are well represented by the
   universal curve and on increasing temperature a systematic departure
   from it is observed. (C) 2010 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA,

Abstract = {{Models for the nano/micro-structural deformation and mechanical
   properties of auxetic materials (i.e. materials with a negative
   Poisson's ratio) have been previously developed. However, most of these
   models have been two-dimensional, were usually designed specifically to
   describe some particular class of auxetic materials, and generally only
   described the behaviour of one particular plane whilst completely
   ignoring the out-of-plane behaviour of the material. A three-dimensional
   model has been developed which can be applied to several classes of
   auxetic materials, including microporous expanded polymers such as
   e-PTFE, e-UHMWPE and e-PA, body-centered cubic metals and foams. It is
   generalised that its underlying structure is not specific to a
   lengthscale or material as the previous list shows. The new model offers
   a better insight into the underlying principles behind the observed
   auxetic behaviour and offers a significant improvement in the agreement
   of the models with existing experimental data. It is shown that there
   are geometric limitations to the number of planes that can
   simultanesously display auxetic behaviour. This has ramifications on the
   design of ordered auxetic materials.}},

Abstract = {{Many articles have dealt with the loss formulas for determining the
   required number of circuits in a transit circuit group with overflow
   traffic. Traditionally, ERM (Equivalent Random Method) is used to
   determine number of circuits in a final circuit group with rough
   overflow traffic which has vmr (variance to mean ratio) greater than
   one. Recently, IPP (Interrupted Poisson Process) approximate method
   which represents the collective feature of the overflow have been
   introduced. The negative binomial loss formula can be applied to
   determine the required number of circuits. In this paper, we deal with
   the negative binomial loss formula and determination method of number of
   circuits. We also analyze and compare these three loss formulas. To
   apply these formulas to the capacity planning of circuit networks, we
   need more effective algorithm for the accurate numerical calculation.}},

Abstract = {{Phononic crystals (PCs) are a kind of acoustic composite materials which
   have periodic structures and exhibit elastic wave (EW) band gaps. Due to
   their unique properties the phononic crystals have potential
   applications in acoustic devices and noise control, etc. The effects of
   both positive and negative Poisson's ratios on the phononic band gaps
   (PBGs) due to either Bragg scattering or locally resonance in
   three-dimensional (3D) solid/solid phononic crystals with a simple-cubic
   (SC) lattice are studied. The band structures are obtained by the finite
   difference time domain (FDTD) method combined with the fast Fourier
   transform-(FFT-) based postprocessing method. The numerical results show
   that Poisson's ratio of the scatterer plays an important role in tuning
   the PBGs.}},

Abstract = {{Capsule Of 26 species of wintering waterbirds, 18 showed an increase in
   numbers, five showed a decrease and two showed no change.
   Aim To assess long-term trends in the numbers and distribution of the 26
   most abundant wintering waterbird species in the Czech Republic.
   Methods We used International Waterbird Census data from between 48 and
   639 wetland sites which had been counted annually in the Czech Republic
   from 1966 to 2008. From these data long-term changes in numbers and
   distributions were determined. Log-linear Poisson regression analysis
   was used to estimate missing data using TRIM software. The distribution
   of each species was described as the ratio of the number of sites
   occupied by that species to the total number of sites investigated.
   Results Increasing trends were found for 18 species, five species were
   found to be declining, one species was stable and two species were found
   with uncertain trends. Wintering distributions (the ratio of sites
   occupied by a given species to the total number of sites counted)
   increased in 16 species and decreased in two species, broadly correlated
   with the species changes in numbers.
   Conclusion In most species changes in numbers as well as changes in
   distribution followed the Western Palearctic population trends. Those
   species which increased were mainly piscivores and included geese, ducks
   and gulls. Scarcer species also exhibited an increase in numbers. The
   changes in numbers (both positive and negative) were more frequent among
   species associated with running water, whereas species which showed
   uncertain trends were more frequently recorded on standing water, which
   is more affected by variable weather conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: Gradual age-related cognitive deteriorations are common and
   are hypothesised to be partially attributable to declines in
   information-processing speed. The Iowa Healthy and Active Minds Study
   will evaluate the efficacy and effectiveness of a computerised visual
   processing speed training programme (Road Tour, Posit Science
   Corporation, San Francisco, California).
   Methods and analysis: Using a 3: 3: 4: 4 ratio within two age strata
   (50-64 vs >= 65 years old), 681 men and women attending family care
   clinics were randomised to four treatment groups: 10 h of on-site Road
   Tour training, 10 h of on-site Road Tour training with 4 h of booster
   training at 11 months postrandomisation, 10 h of on-site attention
   control using computerised crossword puzzles (Boatload of Crosswords,
   Boatload Puzzles, LLC, Yorktown Heights, New York) and 10 h of at-home
   Road Tour training using the participant's personal computer. The
   primary outcome, visual processing speed, was assessed at randomisation
   and post-training (6-8 weeks postrandomisation), and is being reassessed
   at 1-year postrandomisation using the Useful Field of View test. Five
   secondary outcomes (Symbol Digit Modalities Test, Trail Making Tests A
   and B, Controlled Oral Word Association Test, Digit Vigilance Test, and
   the Stroop Colour and Word Test) were assessed at randomisation and will
   be reassessed at 1-year postrandomisation. Seven hypotheses will be
   tested using intent-to-treat analyses involving multiple linear,
   logistic, Poisson and negative binomial regression.
   Ethics and dissemination: Ethics approval was provided by the University
   of Iowa Institutional Review Board (IRB-03 protocol 200908789). All
   participants completed signed informed consent prior to enrolment. Road
   Tour is commercially available from Posit Science Corporation, which
   provided it to Iowa Healthy and Active Minds Study at no cost. All
   participants will receive a free copy of Road Tour for unlimited
   perpetual use at study completion.}},

   which FDW was an original co-investigator (at the ACTIVE Indiana
   University site). The ACTIVE speed of processing intervention had been
   developed earlier by K Ball (ACTIVE site-PI at the University of
   Alabama-Birmingham) and D Roenker (at Western Kentucky University). In
   collaboration with K Ball and D Roenker, Posit Science subsequently
   developed the second-generation, value-added version of the visual speed
   of processing intervention known as Road Tour and used here in IHAMS.
   From December 2007 to March 2009, FDW had a limited, part-time

Abstract = {{Cellular solids, in particular hexagonal honeycombs have been the
   subject of numerous studies in the last decades in view of their
   extensive use in many applications. In particular, there have been
   various studies aimed at expressing the mechanical properties of
   honeycombs in terms of the geometrical parameters used to describe the
   structure of such honeycombs. Despite improvements over the first
   established model, finite element simulations performed in this work on
   honeycombs having ribs with a realistic thickness-to-length ratio
   suggest that the mechanical properties for such systems differ from
   those predicted by current models, sometimes to a very significant
   extent. In view of this, we analyse in detail the deformed structures in
   an attempt to gain insight into how and the extent to which the shape of
   the ligaments, in particular its thickness and mode of connection
   affects deformation in conventional and re-entrant hexagonal honeycombs.
   Based on these observations, we propose a modified version of the
   previous analytical models that take into consideration the finite
   thickness of the ligaments.}},

Volume = {{17}},

Abstract = {{Many studies in the field of haemophilia and other coagulation
   deficiencies require analyses of bleeding frequencies. In haemophilia,
   the association of bleeding frequency with factor VIII (FVIII) activity
   levels is known from experience, but significant results are lacking.
   Bleeding frequencies in haemophilia are highly skewed count data, with
   large proportions of zeros. Both the skewness and the high amount of
   zeros pose a problem for standard (linear) modelling techniques. This
   study investigated the optimal analysing strategy for bleeding data by
   using the association of residual clotting factor level and number of
   joint bleeds in moderate and mild patients treated on demand as example.
   In total, 433 patients with moderate (27\%) and mild (73\%) haemophilia
   A treated on demand were included in this study. One year of
   self-reported data on joint bleed frequency and baseline clotting factor
   activity were analysed using Poisson, negative binomial, zero-inflated
   Poisson, and zero-inflated negative binomial distributions. Multivariate
   regression analysis using negative binomial distribution provided the
   optimum data analytical strategy. This model showed 18\% reduction
   {[}Rate ratio (RR) 0.82; 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.77-0.86] of
   bleeding frequency with every IU dL(-1) increase in residual FVIII
   activity. The actual association is expected to be higher because of
   exclusion (30 out of 463 patients) of patients on prophylaxis (baseline
   FVIII levels 0.01-0.06 IU mL(-1)). The best way to analyse low frequency
   bleeding data is using a negative binomial distribution.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we derive explicit computable expressions for the

   both known and unknown parameters, respectively. Thereafter, the
   computational form of the asymptotic distribution of the change-point
   mle is derived for the case of known parameter situation only.
   Simulations show that the distribution for the known case applies very
   well to the case where the parameters are estimated. Further, it is seen
   from simulations that the derived unconditional mle shows better
   performance compared to the conditional solution of Cobb. Application of
   change detection methodology and the derived estimation methodology show

Abstract = {{Some exceptional materials become fatter when stretched and are
   described as auxetics or having negative Poisson's ratio. Auxetic
   textiles belong to this class of extraordinary materials that are

   textiles. We have sustained the efforts to fabricate auxetic fabric
   structures based on non-auxetic yarns. The focus is to combine our
   knowledge of geometry and fabric structural characteristics to engineer
   auxetic textiles and to determine the properties of such auxetic textile
   fabrics. To realize our objective, we designed and investigated
   hexagonal knit structures as auxetic textiles offering optimum
   performance. The factors that influence Poisson's ratio are identified
   as yarn type, number of chain courses and strain level. Also, a method
   has been developed for quantifying the geometrical structural unit cell
   of the auxetic structure based on measured parameters, namely a1, a2,
   b1, b2, h and c, as detailed in this paper.}},

   chiral elastic beams. First, we investigate the effects of a thermal
   field which is linear in the axial coordinate. It is shown that this
   temperature variation produces extension, bending, torsion, flexure and
   a plane deformation. Then, we study the deformation of the beam when the
   thermal field is a polynomial of degree m (m1) in the axial coordinate.
   The solution is reduced to the solving of some two-dimensional problems.

Abstract = {{The derivation of the effective mechanical properties of planar lattices
   made of articulated bars is herewith investigated, relying on the
   asymptotic homogenization technique to get closed form expressions of
   the equivalent properties versus the geometrical and mechanical
   microparameters. Considering lattice microrotations as additional
   degrees of freedom at both scales, micropolar equivalent continua are
   constructed from discrete lattices made of a repetitive unit cell, from
   an extension of the asymptotic homogenization technique. We will show
   that it is necessary to solve on two different orders a linear system of
   equations giving the kinematic variables, at both the first and second
   order. The effective strain and effective curvature appear respectively
   as the first and second order strain variables. In the case of a
   centrosymmetric unit cell, there is no coupling between couple stresses
   and strains nor between stress and curvature. The unknown kinematic
   variables are determined by solving the translational and rotational
   equilibrium for the whole lattice. This in turn leads to the expression
   of the stress vector and couple stress vector, allowing to construct the
   Cauchy stress and couple stress tensors. The homogenized behavior of the
   tetragonal and hexagonal lattices is determined in terms of homogenized
   micropolar moduli.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a modified manufacturing route involving a large
   change in density in auxetic negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) foams.
   Density change of auxetic foams after manufacturing is a common feature
   for this porous material. Samples of open cell PU-PE (i.e. the
   combination of polyurethane-polyethylene) foams with NPR are produced
   from two similar native materials using both the classical and the novel
   custom manufacturing methods. In the classical manufacturing route the
   cooling process is typically carried out with the foam in a confined
   state. Conversely, in the new manufacturing process it was substituted
   with a release process. Samples were subjected to both tensile and
   compressive loading, as well as density measurements. A thorough
   mechanical characterisation of the foams is described, linking the
   mechanical properties with their change in density after conversion into
   auxetic. (C) 2010 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA, Weinheim}},

Abstract = {{X-ray microtomography has been used to study in situ the uniaxial
   tensile response of low-density polyurethane foam. Two variants have
   been examined, one before and one after treatment to generate auxetic
   behaviour. For both variants, microstructurally faithful finite element
   (FE) models have been constructed from the initial tomographs. For each
   variant a series of tomographs have been collected during progressive
   straining. Poisson's ratios of 0.30 (conventional, non-auxetic) and
   -0.22 (auxetic) have been measured for the two variants by digital image
   correlation (DIC) between successive images. By comparison, the FE
   models exhibited Poisson's ratio's of 0.5 and -0.3, respectively. Key
   micromechanical mechanisms responsible for the auxetic effect have been
   observed during straining, such as the straightening of bent ribs and
   rotation of nodes (joints), compared to changes in the angles between
   essentially straight struts for the non-auxetic variant. The
   microstructurally faithful FE models confirm the mechanisms observed in
   the experiments and enable characteristic rib and node behaviour to be
   followed in greater detail. (C) 2010 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA,

Abstract = {{Auxetic foams possess negative Poisson's ratio, exhibiting unique

   quasi-three-dimensional model of Choi and Lakes is developed for auxetic
   foams and the formula of the volumetric compression ratio is also
   corrected in this study. Three deformation mechanisms of all cell ribs
   (i.e. stretching, shearing and bending) are incorporated. By applying
   the newly modified model, the theoretical results of Young's modulus and
   Poisson's ratio depend on the folded angle of the bent ribs, the
   relative density, the shape of the rib cross section and the Young's
   modulus and Poisson's ratio of the virgin material. The predicted values
   of the effective Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of auxetic foams
   compare favourably with experimental data. In addition, a finite element
   analysis model is proposed to predict the value of Poisson's ratio in
   this study. The two models can be reduced to predict the mechanical
   properties of conventional foams, and exhibit the process of the
   conversion of conventional foams into auxetic foams. (C) 2010 WILEY-VCH

Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},

Pages = {{59-67}},
Abstract = {{The Poisson-gamma (negative binomial or NB) distribution is still the
   most common probabilistic distribution used by transportation safety
   analysts to model motor vehicle crashes. Recent studies have shown that
   the Conway-Maxwell-Poisson (COM-Poisson) distribution also is promising
   for developing crash prediction models. The objectives of this study
   were to investigate and compare the estimation of crash variance
   predicted by the COM-Poisson generalized linear model (GLM) and the
   traditional NB model. The comparison analysis was carried out with the
   most commonly employed functional forms, which linked crashes to the
   entering flows and other explanatory variables at intersections or on
   segments. To accomplish the objectives of the study, several NB and
   COM-Poisson GLMs (including flow-only models and models with several
   covariates) were developed and compared by using two data sets. The
   first data set contained crash data collected at signalized, four-legged
   intersections in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The second data set included
   data collected on rural, four-lane, undivided highways in Texas. The
   results of this study show that the trend of crash variance prediction
   by COM-Poisson GLM is similar to that predicted by the NB model. The
   Spearman's rank correlation coefficients between the crash variance
   predicted by the COM-Poisson and the NB model confirmed that there was a
   perfect monotone increasing, and the values were highly correlated. This
   correlation means that a site characterized by a large variance would
   essentially be identified as such, whether the NB model or the
   COM-Poisson model was used.}},

Abstract = {{The article represents an example of modeling of cellular material
   stiffness of auxetic properties through changes in its internal
   structure of the skeleton. The aim of the study was to develop a model
   of an auxetic compression spring useful in seat constructions of office
   furniture. Real and numerical models of different structures of concave
   cell walls which were subjected to uniaxial compression were employed in
   the performed investigations. Changing the geometry of the internal
   structure, non-linear stiffness characteristics of the designed springs,
   negative Poisson's ratios as well as maximal deflection of the models in
   the elastic range were determined. On the basis of the results of
   numerical calculations, it was possible to select constructions which
   can be most suitable for the seat functionality of furniture intended

   design a system which can be tailor-made to exhibit particular values of
   the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) in the radial direction and
   also negative thermal expansion (NTE). In particular an analytical model
   to quantify the radial strain with changes in temperature is derived and

Abstract = {{Consequences of the well-known Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) continuum
   equations of charge motion in liquids or solids for ordinary or
   anomalous diffusion are investigated for an electrochemical cell with
   completely blocking electrodes. Previous work is summarized and much of
   it is shown to be independent of earlier published results and
   incomplete, with little comparison made between ordinary and anomalous
   diffusion. Such comparison is provided here and also includes variation
   of the mobility ratio of the mobilities of positive and negative charges
   from equality to charge of only one sign mobile. New
   generation-recombination effects are demonstrated for a range of
   mobility ratios, with particular attention given to those present for
   the case of charge of only one sign mobile. No previous analyses of
   experimental data with PNP models using complex-least-squares fitting
   have been published. Here such a model is found to fit frequency
   response data well for a hydrogel and to lead to estimates of physically
   meaningful parameters such as the diffusion constant and ionic
   concentration. PNP analysis of a synthetic data set derived from
   experimental results for liquid electrolytes refutes claims made in the
   original publication dealing with it, but verifies and extends an
   interesting analysis equation proposed there. PNP fitting of data for
   solids, including ones showing colossal low-frequency-limiting
   dielectric constants, suggests that they may often be well described as
   arising from simple diffuse-charge double-layer effects, and that
   continuum microscopic models such as the PNP, in series with a
   conducting Debye response model, may be sufficient for fitting well an
   appreciable amount of data involving ion hopping and trapping behavior.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},

Volume = {{82}},
Number = {{23}},
Month = {{DEC 9}},
Abstract = {{There exist three conformers of hydrogenated graphene, referred to as
   chair-, boat-, or washboard-graphane. These systems have a perfect
   two-dimensional periodicity mapped onto the graphene scaffold but they
   are characterized by a sp(3) orbital hybridization, have different
   crystal symmetry, and otherwise behave upon loading. By first-principles
   calculations we determine their structural and phonon properties, as
   well as we establish their relative stability. Through continuum
   elasticity we define a simulation protocol addressed to measure by a
   computer experiment their linear and nonlinear elastic moduli and we
   actually compute them by first principles. We argue that all graphane
   conformers respond to any arbitrarily oriented extension with a much
   smaller lateral contraction than the one calculated for graphene.
   Furthermore, we provide evidence that boat-graphane has a small and
   negative Poisson ratio along the armchair and zigzag principal
   directions of the carbon honeycomb lattice (axially auxetic elastic
   behavior). Moreover, we show that chair-graphane admits both softening
   and hardening hyperelasticity, depending on the direction of applied
   load.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores the comparative advantage of auxetic membranes over
   non-auxetic ones by geometrical analysis. It is herein demonstrated
   that, unlike non-auxetic sieves, the auxetic sieve exhibits an almost
   linear correlation with the applied strain, thereby demonstrating the
   higher tunability of auxetic sieves. Further investigation on the
   performance of auxetic sieves by varying the initial inclination angle
   shows that the sieving sensitivity is inversely proportional to the
   initial inclination angle. Finally a calculation based on
   (1,4)-reflexyne as a molecular auxetic sieve reveals that such as filter
   can block out impurities of sub-nanoscale size, while enabling the
   transport of biochemicals. The obtained results suggest the use of
   auxetic molecular sieves as high performance bandage, filters and other
   devices that require ultra-clean environment with biochemical
   permeability.}},

Abstract = {{The ambient structure and pressure-induced structural changes of a
   synthetic sodium aluminogermanate with a natrolite (NAT) framework
   topology (Na-AlGe-NAT) were characterized by using Rietveld refinements
   of high-resolution synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction data at ambient
   and high pressures. Unlike a previously established model for
   Na8Al8Ge12O40 center dot 8H(2)O based on a single-crystal study, the
   ambient structure of the Na-AlGe-NAT is found to adopt a monoclinic
   space group Cc (or Fd) with a ca. 6\% expanded unit cell. The refined
   ambient structure of Na8Al8Ge12O40 center dot 12H(2)O indicates an
   increased water content of 50\%, compared to the single-crystal
   structure. The unit-cell volume and water-content relationships observed
   between the to the Na-AlGe-NAT structures at ambient conditions with 8
   and 12 H2O respectively seem to mirror the ones found under hydrostatic
   pressure between the Na8Al8Si12O40 center dot 8H(2)O and the
   parantrolite phase Na8Al8Si12O40 center dot 12H(2)O. Under hydrostatic
   pressures mediated by a pore-penetrating alcohol and water mixture, the
   monoclinic Na-AlGe-NAT exhibits a gradual decrease of the unit-cell
   volume up to ca. 2.0 GPa, where the unit-cell volume then contracts
   abruptly by ca. 4.6\%. This is in marked contrast to what is observed in
   the Na-AlSi-NAT and Na-GaSi-NAT systems, where one observes a
   pressure-induced hydration and volume expansion due to the auxetic
   nature of the frameworks. Above 2 GPa, the monoclinic phase of
   Na-AlGe-NAT transforms into a tetragonal structure with the unit-cell
   composition of Na8Al8Ge12O40 center dot 16H(2)O. revealing
   pressure-induced hydration and a unit cell volume contraction. Unlike in
   the Na-Al,Si-paranatrolite phase. however, the sodium cations in the
   Na-AlGe-NAT maintain a 6-fold coordination in the monoclinic structure
   and only become 7-fold coordinated at higher pressures in the tetragonal
   structure. When comparing, the pressure-induced hydration in the
   observed natrolite-type zeolites, Na-AlGe-NAT appears to have a
   nonauxetic framework and reveals the highest onset pressure for complete
   superhydration.}},

Title = {{Adverse psychosocial working conditions and minor psychiatric disorders
   among bank workers}},
Journal = {{BMC PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{NOV 10}},
Abstract = {{Background: In most countries, the financial service sector has
   undergone great organizational changes in the past decades, with
   potential negative impact on bank workers' mental health. The aim of
   this paper is to estimate the prevalence of minor psychiatric disorders
   (MPD) among Brazilian bank workers and to investigate whether they are
   associated with an adverse psychosocial working environment.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study of a random sample of 2,500 workers in
   a Brazilian state bank in 2008. The presence of MPD was determined by
   the General Health Questionnaire.(GHQ). Psychosocial work conditions
   were assessed by means of the Effort-Reward Imbalance (ERI) and Job
   Content Questionnaire (JCQ). The presence and magnitude of the
   independent associations between MPD and adverse psychosocial working
   conditions were determined by Prevalence Ratios, obtained by Poisson
   regression.
   Results: From 2,337 eligible workers, 88\% participated. The prevalence
   of MPD was greater among women (45\% vs. 41\%; p > 0.05). In the
   multivariate analysis, the prevalence of MPD was twice as high among
   bank workers exposed to high psychological demand and low control at
   work and under high effort and low reward working conditions. The lack
   of social support at work and the presence of over-commitment were also
   associated with higher prevalence of MPD. A negative interaction effect
   was found between over-commitment and effort-reward imbalance.
   Conclusion: The prevalence of MPD is high among bank workers. The
   results reinforce the association between MPD and adverse psychosocial
   working conditions, assessed by the JCQ and ERI models. The direction of
   the interaction observed between over-commitment and ERI was contrary to
   what was expected.}},

Abstract = {{The relationship between elastic anisotropy and extreme Poisson's ratio
   behaviour (either positive or negative) in single-crystalline materials
   has been investigated using experimentally determined single-crystal
   elastic constants for a wide range of solid materials. This makes use of
   a recently proposed elastic anisotropy index that is applicable to all
   crystal symmetries. For many real materials we find a striking
   correlation between the value of the elastic anisotropy index and the
   magnitudes of maximum and minimum Poisson's ratios this is independent
   of crystal symmetry. This structure property relationship provides new
   examples of auxetics and shows that negative Poisson's ratios are
   actually not uncommon among many classes of inorganic (and organic)
   materials, including elemental metals, alloys, ionic solids, molecular
   solids and giant covalent networks. (C) 2010 Acta Materialia Inc.

Abstract = {{Background Infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 or HPV18 elicits
   an antibody response, but whether the elicited antibodies protect women
   against subsequent infection by a homologous HPV type compared with
   seronegative women is unknown.
   Methods Study participants were women aged 18-25 years at enrollment in
   the control group of the ongoing National Cancer Institute-sponsored,
   community-based, randomized HPV16/18 Costa Rica Vaccine Trial. At
   enrollment, 2813 participants were negative for cervical HPV16 DNA and
   2950 for HPV18 DNA. Women were interviewed regarding sociodemographic
   data and medical and health history. Medical and pelvic examinations
   were conducted for all consenting sexually experienced women. Serum
   samples taken at enrollment were tested for total HPV16/18 antibodies
   with a polyclonal enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and cervical
   specimens were tested for type-specific HPV DNA over 4 years of
   follow-up. Using Poisson regression, we compared rate ratios of newly
   detected cervical HPV16 or HPV18 infection among homologous
   HPV-seropositive and HPV-seronegative women, adjusting for age,
   education, marital status, lifetime number of sexual partners, and
   smoking.
   Results There were 231 newly detected HPV16 infections during 5886
   person-years among HPV16-seronegative women compared with 12 newly
   detected HPV16 infections during 581 person-years among
   HPV16-seropositive women with the highest HPV16 sero-levels. There were
   136 newly detected HPV18 infections during 6352 person-years among
   HPV18-seronegative women compared with six new infections detected
   during 675 person-years among HPV18 seropositives with the highest
   sero-levels. After controlling for risk factors associated with newly
   detected HPV infection, having high HPV16 antibody titer at enrollment
   was associated with a reduced risk of subsequent HPV16 infection (women
   in the highest tertile of HPV16 antibody titers, adjusted rate ratio =
   0.50, 95\% confidence interval = 0.26 to 0.86 vs HPV16-seronegative
   women). Similarly, having high HPV18 antibody titer at enrollment was
   associated with a reduced risk of subsequent HPV18 infection (women in
   the highest tertile of HPV18 antibody titers, adjusted rate ratio =
   0.36, 95\% confidence interval = 0.14 to 0.76 vs HPV18-seronegative
   women).
   Conclusion In this study population, having high antibody levels against
   HPV16 and HPV18 following natural infection was associated with reduced
   risk of subsequent HPV16 and HPV18 infections.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents and examines the concept of flexible skins for
   morphing aircraft applications comprising of a cellular honeycomb core
   covered by a compliant face-sheet. The overall properties of the
   flexible skins are then largely governed by the characteristics of the
   cellular honeycomb core, which are in turn dependent on the cell
   parameters. The results of this study showed that the cellular cores
   could easily undergo global strains over 10 times greater than the
   virgin material of which they were built. The in-plane stiffness of the
   cellular cores is generally several orders of magnitude lower than the
   virgin material. Using cores that are thicker than isotropic sheet
   skins, the out-of-plane stiffness can be many times greater than the
   sheet skin for comparable mass (due to porosity of the cellular core).
   In general, honeycomb cores with positive cell angles (as opposed to
   auxetic cores) produce a higher out-of-plane stiffness. For cellular
   cores made from high-strain capable materials and undergoing large
   strains, geometric and material non-linearities need to be considered.
   When the cores are stretched along the principle axes they geometrically
   stiffen, thereby reducing the maximum global strains achievable. When
   material softening is considered, the forces required to deform the
   cellular core to large global strains are reduced.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Many methods have previously been devised to estimate the relative
   amounts of chemicals present in a measured Raman spectrum. However,
   relatively little work has been done on developing physics-based
   probabilistic models for the measurement system. Drawing from previous
   work in astronomical image restoration, we model the acquired data based
   on the physics of two key components in our Raman instrumentation: the
   spectrometer and the charge-coupled device detector. Under this model,
   we derive Cramer-Rao lower bounds for the mixing coefficients of the
   target spectra. This bound is compared against the performance of
   several classification algorithms. The non-negative iteratively
   reweighted least-squares algorithm is seen to give performance that is
   nearly identical to the more computationally demanding
   expectation-maximization approach; this is true even at weak signal
   levels. (C) 2010 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.

   complex variable method considering conformal mapping of the elastic
   region onto a circular ring. The problem of an elastic half plane with a
   circular cavity was investigated, regarding the case that along the
   boundary of the cavity, the surface tractions were prescribed. The
   computer program (ground loss) was used. The program worked
   interactively, on the basis of values of Poisson's ratio and the ratio
   of the radius of the cavity to its depth (r/h). It was investigated
   whether certain problems of stresses and deformations caused by
   deformation of a tunnel in an elastic half plane could be solved by the
   complex variable method. For this purpose, two elementary boundary value
   problems were considered in detail. These include the problem of a half
   plane with a circular cavity loaded by a uniform radial stress, and the
   problem in which a uniform radial displacement is imposed on the cavity
   boundary (this is usually called the ground loss problem). It was
   concluded that the displacement of the bottom of the tunnel was always
   smaller than the value, u(o) (the displacement of the cavity). For large
   values of r/h, the displacement may even be negative, that is, downward.
   The displacement of the bottom was always equal to the average
   displacement of the tunnel plus a constant value Mo which is the imposed
   radial displacement.}},

Abstract = {{Methods. The frequency, predictors, treatment and clinical outcomes of
   CNS peritonitis were examined by multivariate logistic regression and
   multilevel Poisson regression in all adult PD patients in Australia
   between 2003 and 2006.
   Results. A total of 936 episodes of CNS peritonitis (constituting 26\%
   of all peritonitis episodes) occurred in 620 individuals. The observed
   rate of CNS peritonitis was 0.16 episodes per patient-year. Lower rates
   of CNS peritonitis were independently predicted by Asian racial origin
   (adjusted odds ratio {[}OR], 0.52; 95\% CI, 0.35-0.79), renovascular
   nephrosclerosis (OR, 0.40; 95\% CI, 0.18-0.86), early referral to a
   renal unit prior to dialysis commencement (OR, 0.38; 95\% CI, 0.19-0.79)
   and treatment with automated PD at any time during the PD career (OR,
   0.79; 95\% CI, 0.66-0.96). The majority of CNS peritonitis episodes were
   initially treated with intraperitoneal vancomycin or cephazolin in
   combination with gentamicin. This regimen was changed in 533 (57\%)
   individuals after a median period of 3 days, most commonly to vancomycin
   monotherapy. The median total antibiotic course duration was 14 days.
   Compared with other forms of peritonitis, CNS episodes were
   significantly more likely to be cured by antibiotics alone (76 vs 64\%,
   P < 0.001) and less likely to be complicated by hospitalization (61 vs
   73\%, P < 0.001), catheter removal (10 vs 26\%, P < 0.001), temporary
   haemodialysis (2 vs 5\%, P < 0.001), permanent haemodialysis transfer (9
   vs 21\%, P < 0.001) and death (1.0 vs 2.7\%, P = 0.002). CNS peritonitis
   was also associated with a shorter duration of hospitalization, a longer
   time to catheter removal and a shorter duration of temporary
   haemodialysis. Catheter removal and permanent haemodialysis transfer
   were independently predicted by polymicrobial peritonitis and initial
   empiric administration of vancomycin (compared with cephalosporins). CNS
   peritonitis was associated with a higher relapse rate (17 vs 13\%, P =
   0.003) and relapsed CNS peritonitis was associated with a higher
   catheter removal rate (22 vs 7\%, P < 0.001). Repeat peritonitis
   occurred in 194 (31\%) individuals and the highest risk was in the
   second month after completion of antibiotic treatment for CNS
   peritonitis (OR, 1.87; 95\% CI, 1.39-2.51 compared with > 2 months).
   Conclusions. CNS peritonitis is a common complication with a relatively
   benign outcome compared with other forms of PD-associated peritonitis.
   Relapsed and repeat peritonitis are relatively common and are associated
   with worse outcomes.}},

   the bulk modulus B. shear modulus G, Young's modulus E and Poisson's
   ratio v of polycrystalline aggregates were derived. The ductility and
   plasticity of the MgZn2 and ScZn2 phases were further discussed. The
   elastic anisotropy of the two phases was also analyzed. Finally, the

Abstract = {{In view of their potential applications in sandwich structures, there
   has been increasing interest in honeycomb networks. Several different
   types of honeycomb systems have been proposed each exhibiting different
   mechanical properties. Here we propose a new hexagonal honeycomb
   structure composed of two different geometrical features: a re-entrant
   feature which is known to generate auxetic behavior, and a non
   re-entrant feature found in regular hexagonal honeycombs which leads to
   conventional behavior. This results in a ``semi re-entrant honeycomb''
   built of alternate conventional and auxetic layers. Finite element
   analysis and analytical modeling of these honeycombs show that they
   exhibit a zero Poisson ratio in one direction and a higher than normal
   Young's modulus in the orthogonal direction. We also show that by virtue
   of its zero Poisson's ratio, this honeycomb has a natural tendency to
   form cylindrical shaped curvatures, something which is very difficult to
   achieve with conventional or auxetic honeycombs.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this work is to numerically investigate the
   elastic-plastic deformation of closed-cell foams incorporating the
   effect of inner gas pressure. Both body-centered cubic (BCC) and

   effect on the plastic deformation of closed-cell foams, which is
   different for the foams with different microstructures and is discussed
   in detail. The inner gas pressure results in the asymmetry of uniaxial
   tensile-compressive stress-strain curves and the nominal Poisson's
   ratio. It is shown that the inner gas pressure makes the yield surface
   move to the negative direction of the hydrostatic axis in the plane of
   equivalent and hydrostatic stresses, and the moving distance is equal to
   the magnitude of inner gas pressure in the foams. Moreover, a new yield
   function incorporating the effect of inner gas pressure is developed for
   closed-cell foams. The material constants in the yield function depend

Abstract = {{Examples of chiral materials include some auxetic materials, carbon

   composites. The chiral effects cannot be described by means of the
   classical theories of continua. In the context of the linear theory of
   Cosserat thermoelasticity we investigate the behaviour of a chiral rod
   subjected to a thermal field independent of the axial coordinate. The
   work is motivated by the recent interest in the using of the Cosserat
   solid as model for auxetic materials, carbon nanotubes, and bones. It is
   shown that the temperature field produces torsion, extension, bending,
   and a plane strain. The results are used to investigate the case of a
   circular cylinder subjected to a uniform temperature field. The salient
   feature of the solution is that a constant temperature field in an
   isotropic chiral circular rod produces a twist around its axis. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{In this note it is shown that the combination of conventional laminas
   (possessing positive Poisson's ratio) and auxetic laminas (possessing
   negative Poisson's ratio) gives rise to effective in-plane composite
   laminate Young's modulus that surpasses the rule-of-mixture formula. To
   enable comparison between the developed model with the rule-of-mixture,
   the former is presented in such a way that two correction functions
   exist distinctively for multiplication into the two terms of the
   rule-of-mixture formula. Each of the two correction functions reduces to
   a minimum of 1 when all laminas possess equal Poisson's ratio, and the
   correction functions are greater than one when there exists mismatch in
   the Poisson's ratios among the laminas in the laminate. Plotted results
   show that the overshooting of the laminate's effective in-plane modulus
   is significant for semiauxetic laminates but not for conventional and
   fully auxetic materials.}},

Abstract = {{Examples of chiral materials include some auxetic materials, bones, some
   honeycomb structures, as well as composites with inclusions. The chiral
   effects cannot be described within classical elasticity. In the context
   of the linear theory of Cosserat elastic solids, we investigate the
   deformation of a chiral rod subjected to tractions on the lateral
   surface, to body loads, and to resultant forces and moments on the ends.
   The work is motivated by the recent interest in the using of the
   Cosserat elastic solid as model for auxetic composites, carbon nanotubes
   and bones. The three-dimensional problem is reduced to the study of some
   generalized plane strain problems. New chiral effects are presented. In
   the case of cylinders of arbitrary cross-section, the flexure produced
   by a transversal force, in contrast with the case of achiral materials,
   is accompanied by extension and bending by terminal couples. The body
   loads and the tractions on the lateral surface produce extension,
   flexure, torsion, bending by terminal couples and a plane strain. It is
   shown that a uniform pressure acting on the lateral surface of a chiral
   circular cylinder does not produce bending effects. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Objectives To estimate exposures to asbestos fibres of specific sizes
   among asbestos textile manufacturing workers exposed to chrysotile using
   data from transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and to evaluate the
   extent to which the risk of lung cancer varies with fibre length and
   diameter.
   Methods 3803 workers employed for at least 1 day between 1 January 1950
   and 31 December 1973 in any of three plants in North Carolina, USA that
   produced asbestos textile products and followed for vital status through
   31 December 2003 were included. Historical exposures to asbestos fibres
   were estimated from work histories and 3578 industrial hygiene
   measurements taken in 1935-1986. Exposure-response relationships for
   lung cancer were examined within the cohort using Poisson regression.
   Results Indicators of fibre length and diameter obtained by TEM were
   positively and significantly associated with increasing risk of lung
   cancer. Exposures to longer and thinner fibres tended to be most
   strongly associated with lung cancer, and models for these fibres fit
   the data best. Simultaneously modelling indicators of cumulative mean
   fibre length and diameter yielded a positive coefficient for fibre
   length and a negative coefficient for fibre diameter.
   Conclusions The results support the hypothesis that the risk of lung
   cancer among workers exposed to chrysotile asbestos increases with
   exposure to longer fibres. More research is needed to improve the
   characterisation of exposures by fibre size and number and to analyse
   the associated risks in a variety of industries and populations.}},

Abstract = {{Transformation optics is a powerful concept for designing novel optical
   components such as high transmission waveguides and cloaking devices.
   The selection of specific transformations is a non-unique problem. Here
   we reveal that transformations which allow for all dielectric and
   broadband optical realizations correspond to minimizers of elastic
   energy potentials for extreme values of the mechanical Poisson's ratio
   v. For TE (H-z) polarized light an incompressible transformation v = 1/2
   is ideal and for TM (E-z) polarized light one should use a compressible
   transformation with negative Poissons's ratio v = -1. For the TM
   polarization the mechanical analogy corresponds to a modified Liao
   functional known from the transformation optics literature. Finally, the
   analogy between ideal transformations and solid mechanical material
   models automates and broadens the concept of transformation optics. (c)

Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{This paper discusses a helical auxetic structure which has a diverse
   range of practical applications. The mechanical properties of the system
   can be determined by particular combinations of geometry and component
   material properties; finite element analysis is used to investigate the
   static behavior of these structures under tension. Modeling criteria are
   determined and design issues are discussed. A description of the
   different strain-dependent mechanical phases is provided. It is shown
   that the stiffnesses of the component fibers and the initial helical
   wrap angle are critical design parameters, and that strain-dependent
   changes in cross-section must be taken into consideration: we observe
   that the structures exhibit nonlinear behavior due to nonzero component
   Poisson's ratios. Negative Poisson's ratios for the helical structures
   as low as -5 are shown. While we focus here on the structure as a yarn
   our findings are, in principle, scaleable. (C) 2010 American Institute

Abstract = {{Natrolite (NAT) is a zeolite which exhibits negative Poisson's ratios
   (auxetic) in its (001) plane (i.e. expands laterally when uniaxially
   stretched and becomes narrower when compressed), a property which has
   now been verified experimentally. It was recently shown that the empty
   SiO2 equivalent of the NAT framework is more auxetic if it is tested in
   conditions of positive external hydrostatic pressures. Here, we report
   results of additional simulations which show that the extent of auxetic
   behaviour of NAT having the standard composition (i.e.
   Na-2(Al2Si3O10)center dot 2H(2)O) is also highly dependent on the
   magnitude of external pressure where it is tested. However, in contrast
   with the behaviour of its empty silica equivalent, NAT exhibits maximum
   auxetic behaviour at negative external hydrostatic pressures (i.e.
   partial vacuum conditions). This is very significant as it highlights
   the fact that auxetic behaviour may be more prominent in materials if
   they are tested at non-ambient pressure conditions. An attempt is made
   to explain this behaviour. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Elastic properties of soft, three-dimensional dimers, interacting
   through site-site n-inverse-power potential. are determined by computer
   simulations at zero temperature. The degenerate crystal of dimers
   exhibiting (Gaussian) size distribution of atomic diameters - i.e. size
   polydispersity - is studied at the molecular number density 1/root 2;
   the distance between centers of atoms forming dimers is considered as a
   length unit. It is shown that, at the fixed number density of the
   dimers, increasing polydispersity causes, typically, an increase in
   pressure, elastic constants and Poisson's ratio; the latter is positive
   in most directions. A direction is found, however, in which the size
   polydispersity causes a substantial decrease in Poisson's ratio, down to
   negative values for large n. Thus, the system is partially auxetic for
   large polydispersity and large n. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In this paper, a discovery is reported that carbon nanotube (CNT) films
   can change in-plane Poisson's ratios from negative to positive during a

   the novel phenomenon for changing Poisson's ratio from negative to

   rise to segregation of vacancies toward the lateral surfaces and, as a

Abstract = {{An important component of any CO2 sequestration project is seismic
   monitoring for tracking changes in subsurface physical properties such
   as velocity and density. Reservoir conditions and CO2 injection
   quantities govern whether such changes may be observable as a function
   of time. Here we investigate surface seismic response to CO2 injection
   at the Ketzin site, the first European onshore CO2 sequestration pilot
   study dealing with research on geological storage of CO2. First, a
   rock-physics model was built to evaluate the effect of injected CO2 on
   the seismic velocity. On the basis of this model, the seismic response
   for different CO2 injection geometries and saturation was studied using
   1D elastic modeling and 2D acoustic finite difference modeling.
   Rock-physics models show that CO2 injected in a gaseous state, rather
   than in a supercritical state, will have a more pronounced effect on
   seismic velocity, resulting in a stronger CO2 response. However,
   reservoir heterogeneity and seismic resolution, as well as random and
   coherent seismic noise, are negative factors that need to be considered
   in a seismic monitoring program. In spite of these potential
   difficulties, our seismic modeling results indicate that the CO2 seismic
   response should be strong enough to allow tracking on surface seismic
   data. Amplitude-related attributes (i.e., acoustic impedance versus
   Poisson's ratio cross-plots) and time-shift measurements are shown to be
   suitable methods for CO2 monitoring. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The structural and elastic properties of BiMnO3 with monoclinic (C2/c)
   and orthorhombic (Pnma) ferromagnetic (FM) structures have been studied
   by first-principles calculations within LDA + U and GGA + U approaches.
   The equilibrium volumes and bulk moduli of BiMnO3 phases are evaluated
   by equation of state (EOS) fittings, and the bulk properties predicted
   by LDA + U calculations are in better agreement with experiment. The
   orthorhombic phase is found to be more stable than the monoclinic phase
   at ambient pressure. A monoclinic to monoclinic phase transition is
   predicted to occur at a pressure of about 10 GPa, which is ascribed to
   magnetism versus volume instability of monoclinic BiMnO3. The
   single-crystal elastic stiffness constants c(ij)s of the monoclinic and
   orthorhombic phases are investigated using the stress-strain method. The
   c(46) of the monoclinic phase is predicted to be negative. In addition,
   the polycrystalline elastic properties including bulk modulus, shear
   modulus, Young's modulus, bulk modulus-shear modulus ratio, Poisson's
   ratio, and elastic anisotropy ratio are determined based on the
   calculated elastic constants. The presently predicted phase transition
   and elastic properties open new directions for investigation of the

Abstract = {{We consider the thermal expansion, change in sound velocity with
   pressure and temperature, and the Poisson ratio of lattices which have
   rigid units (polyhedra very large stiffness to change in bond-length and
   to bond-angle variations) connected to other such units through
   relatively compressible polyhedra. We show that in such a model, the
   potential energy for rotations of the rigid units can occur only as a
   function of the combination Theta(i) equivalent to {[}theta(i)-(del x
   u(i))/2], where theta(i) are the orthogonal rotation angles of the rigid
   unit i and u(i) is its displacement. Given such invariants in the theory
   of elasticity and the hierarchy of force constants of the model, a
   negative thermal-expansion coefficient as well as a decrease in the
   elastic constants of the solid with temperature and pressure is shown to
   follow. These are consistent with the observations.}},

Journal = {{NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{JUL 6}},
Abstract = {{By using the hydrodynamic equations of positive and negative ions, the
   Boltzmann electron density distribution and the Poisson equation with
   stationary dust, a three-dimensional (3D) Zakharov-Kuznetsov (ZK)
   equation is derived for small but finite amplitude ion-acoustic waves.
   However, the ZK equation is not appropriate to describe the system
   either at critical plasma compositions or in the vicinity of the
   critical plasma compositions. Therefore, the modified ZK (MZK) and
   extended ZK (EZK) equations are derived. The generalized expansion
   method is used to analytically solve the ZK, MZK and EZK equations. A
   new class of solutions that admits a train of well-separated bell-shaped
   periodic pulses is obtained. In certain conditions, the latter
   degenerates to either solitary or shock wave solutions. The effects of
   the physical parameters on the nonlinear structures are examined in many
   plasma environments having different negative ion species, such as D-
   and F-regions of the Earth's ionosphere, as well as in laboratory plasma
   experiments. Numerical analysis of the solutions revealed that the
   profile of the nonlinear pulses suffers amplitude and width
   modifications due to enhancement of the dust practices, negative ions,
   positive-to-negative ion mass ratio and positive/negative ion cyclotron
   frequency. Furthermore, the necessary conditions for both solitons and
   shocks propagation as well as their polarity are examined.}},

Title = {{Intimate partner violence, relationship power inequity, and incidence of
   HIV infection in young women in South Africa: a cohort study}},
Journal = {{LANCET}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{376}},
Number = {{9734}},

Month = {{JUL 3}},
Abstract = {{Background Cross-sectional studies have shown that intimate partner
   violence and gender inequity in relationships are associated with
   increased prevalence of HIV in women. Yet temporal sequence and
   causality have been questioned, and few HIV prevention programmes
   address these issues. We assessed whether intimate partner violence and
   relationship power inequity increase risk of incident HIV infection in
   South African women.
   Methods We did a longitudinal analysis of data from a previously
   published cluster-randomised controlled trial undertaken in the Eastern
   Cape province of South Africa in 2002-06. 1099 women aged 15-26 years
   who were HIV negative at baseline and had at least one additional HIV
   test over 2 years of follow-up were included in the analysis. Gender
   power equity and intimate partner violence were measured by a sexual
   relationship power scale and the WHO violence against women instrument,
   respectively. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of HIV acquisition at 2 years
   were derived from Poisson models, adjusted for study design and herpes
   simplex virus type 2 infection, and used to calculate population
   attributable fractions.
   Findings 128 women acquired HIV during 2076 person-years of follow-up
   (incidence 6.2 per 100 person-years). 51 of 325 women with low
   relationship power equity at baseline acquired HIV (8.5 per 100
   person-years) compared with 73 of 704 women with medium or high
   relationship power equity (5.5 per 100 person-years); adjusted
   multivariable Poisson model IRR 1-51, 95\% CI 1.05-2.17, p=0.027. 45 of
   253 women who reported more than one episode of intimate partner
   violence at baseline acquired HIV (9.6 per 100 person-years) compared
   with 83 of 846 who reported one or no episodes (5.2 per 100
   person-years); adjusted multivariable Poisson model IRR 1.51, 1.04-2-21,
   p=0.032. The population attributable fractions were 13.9\% (95\% CI
   2.0-22-2) for relationship power equity and 11.9\% (1.4-19.3) for
   intimate partner violence.
   Interpretation Relationship power inequity and intimate partner violence
   increase risk of incident HIV infection in young South African women.
   Policy, interventions, and programmes for HIV prevention must address
   both of these risk factors and allocate appropriate resources.}},

Abstract = {{Four novel cylinder-ligament honeycombs are described, where each
   cylinder has 3 tangentially-attached ligaments to form either a
   hexagonal or re-entrant hexagonal cellular network. The re-entrant
   cylinder-ligament honeycombs are reported for the first time. The
   in-plane linear elastic constants and out-of-plane bending response of
   these honeycombs are predicted using finite element (FE) modelling and
   comparison made with hexagonal and re-entrant hexagonal honeycombs
   without cylinders. A laser-crafted re-entrant cylinder-ligament
   honeycomb is manufactured and characterized to verify the FE model. The
   re-entrant honeycombs display negative Poisson's ratios and synclastic
   curvature upon out-of-plane bending. The hexagonal and `trichiral'
   honeycombs possess positive Poisson's ratios and anticlastic curvature.
   The `anti-trichiral' honeycomb (short ligament limit) displays negative
   Poisson's ratios when loaded in the plane of the honeycomb, but positive
   Poisson's ratio behaviour (anticlastic curvature) under out-of-plane
   bending. These responses are understood qualitatively through
   considering deformation occurs via direct ligament flexure and cylinder
   rotation-induced ligament flexure. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   for each configuration have been manufactured using rapid prototyping

Abstract = {{The Directionally Reinforced Integrated Single-yarn (DIRIS) architecture
   is a novel, patented concept of creating directionally reinforced

   high-strength honeycomb cores of triangular isogrid geometry with
   impressive results in all constitutive parameters both in-plane and
   out-of-plane. In this paper the application of the DIRIS technology on
   creating high-strength auxetic triangular cores is presented. The
   mechanical behaviour of the resulting core and panel was numerically
   investigated using FEA and testing on manufactured prototypes confirmed
   the high strength of the proposed design. In fact the shear modulus of
   the DIRIS auxetic cores was found superior to that of existing
   mass-produced honeycomb cores despite the inherent complexity of the
   geometrical configuration and the non-standardized manufacturing method.

Abstract = {{In this work we present concepts and prototypes of a novel class of
   chiral honeycomb core with embedded sensing characteristics for
   potential structural health monitoring (SHM) and other multifunctional
   applications. The cellular structure concepts, all having negative
   Poisson's ratio behaviour, have piezoelectric sensors and their hardware
   support embedded on the surface, or within the unit cell plates. Both
   the sensors and the infrastructure provide not only the capability of
   detecting signals proportional to the external mechanical loading, but
   act also as load-bearing units. The honeycombs have been produced using
   vacuum-casting techniques and resin transfer moulding methods, with
   micro fibre composites (MFCs) embedded in their cell walls. The sensing
   and mechanical performance of the prototypes are evaluated using finite
   element simulations, static tests, broadband vibration excitation and
   impact at low kinetic energy levels using an airgun. (C) 2009 Elsevier

Abstract = {{An auxetic material is one with a negative Poisson's ratio and has the
   property of widening when stretched or narrowing when compressed in
   contrast to conventional materials. Typical auxetic materials include
   modified polymeric foams (Lakes, 1987), regular honeycombs,
   polypropylene fibres and certain crystal structures. Auxetic materials
   benefit from enhanced mechanical properties. These benefits include
   improved indentation resistance, enhanced shear moduli and fracture
   toughness Evans and Alderson (2000).
   While modelling granular materials, Bathurst and Rothenburg (1988a,b)
   noted the theoretical possibility of a negative Poisson's ratio if the
   constitutive grains had unconventional interactive properties. These
   unconventional interactive properties are that the tangential
   interaction should be stiffer than the normal interaction. In this work,
   a 2D unit cell has been designed with just such an unconventional
   interaction so that a 2D granular material can be constructed with
   negative Poisson's ratio. Theoretical calculations of such a granular
   assembly are made using mean strain assumptions and first order
   heterogeneity calculations. These are compared to 2D discrete element
   simulations, finite element simulations and Bathurst and Rothenburg's
   original result. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In the present paper, we analyze uniaxial deformation of crystals of
   different systems with negative Poisson's ratios, known as auxetics. The
   behavior of auxetic crystals is studied on the basis of extensive
   knowledge on the experimental values of elastic constants of different
   crystals, gathered in the well-known Landolt-Bornstein tables. The
   competition between the anisotropy of crystal structures and the
   orientation of deformable samples results in the dependence of the
   elastic characteristics of deformation, such as Young's modulus and
   Poisson's ratio, on the orientation angles. In the special case of a
   single angle, a large number of auxetics were found among crystals of
   cubic, hexagonal, rhombohedral, tetragonal, and orthorhombic systems and
   the character of variations in their response due to changes in

Abstract = {{Poisson's ratio is the measure of the extent by which the lengthening of
   a rod induces its thinning and vice versa. Prismanes are the only
   molecular system that exhibits a negative Poisson's ratio (Auxetic
   effect). On the basis of the Thorpe-Ingold effect, which underlines the
   auxetic effect in prismanes, it is expected that silicon-based prismane
   will manifest a smaller Poisson's ratio than carbon-based prismanes and
   that fluorine substitution on the terminal rings will also diminish the
   effect. Stretching and compressing experiments show that indeed the
   auxetic effect is significantly reduced upon going from carbon to
   silicon and moreover that fluorine substitution reverts the behavior of
   silicon-based prismancs from showing a negative Poisson's ratio to a
   positive one. This is probably the first example of a
   substituent-induced reversal of the mechanical property of a chemical
   system.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the success of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) in
   reducing the incidence of Kaposi sarcoma, HIV-infected individuals who
   have responded to treatment continue to be diagnosed with Kaposi
   sarcoma. We examine factors associated with the incidence of Kaposi
   sarcoma among cART-treated HIV-infected homosexual men and changes in
   their survival after its diagnosis over calendar time.
   Data were from HIV-infected homosexual men with well-estimated dates of
   HIV seroconversion (ie, change in status from being HIV negative to
   having HIV antibodies detected). Incidence of Kaposi sarcoma was
   calculated. We used Kaplan-Meier methods to determine survival after
   Kaposi sarcoma diagnosis in three calendar periods: before 1996,
   1996-2000, and 2001-2006. Poisson models were used to examine the effect
   of risk factors such as current and nadir CD4 cell count (ie, the lowest
   CD4 cell count ever recorded for a person), duration of infection, and
   age at diagnosis for Kaposi sarcoma incidence in cART-treated men. All
   statistical tests were two-sided.
   Among the 9473 men, 555 were diagnosed with Kaposi sarcoma in the period
   1986-2006, of whom 319 died. The percentage surviving 24 months after
   Kaposi sarcoma diagnosis rose statistically significantly during the
   study period from 35\% (95\% confidence interval {[}CI] = 29\% to 42\%)
   before 1996 to 84\% (95\% CI = 76\% to 90\%) in 1996-2000 and to 81\%
   (95\% CI = 70\% to 88\%) in 2001-2006 (P < .001). Seventy men were
   diagnosed with Kaposi sarcoma after starting cART. Current (ie, within 6
   months) CD4 cell count was associated with incidence of Kaposi sarcoma
   among cART-treated men (rate ratios {[}RRs] = 18.91, 95\% CI = 8.50 to
   42.09, for CD4 level category < 200 cells per cubic millimeter; RR =
   3.55, 95\% CI = 1.40 to 9.00, for 200-349 cells per cubic millimeter;
   and RR = 4.11, 95\% CI = 1.74 to 9.70, for 350-499 cells per cubic
   millimeter; all compared with >= 500 cells per cubic millimeter). After
   adjustment for current CD4 cell count, HIV infection duration, age, or
   nadir CD4 cell count was not associated with Kaposi sarcoma incidence.
   Among cART-treated HIV-infected homosexual men, current CD4 cell count
   was the factor most strongly associated with the incidence of Kaposi
   sarcoma. Survival estimates after Kaposi sarcoma diagnosis have improved
   over time.}},

Abstract = {{For several pairs (P, Q) of classical distributions on No, we show that

   extreme tail ordering equivalent to P(\{k({*})\})/Q(\{k({*})\}) >= 1 >=
   limk -> k{*} P(\{k\})/Q(\{k\}), with k({*}) and k({*}) denoting the
   minimum and the supremum of the support of P + Q, and with the limit to
   be read as P((k{*}))/Q(\{k{*}\}) for finite k{*}. This includes in
   particular all pairs where P and Q are both binomial (b(n1, p1) <=(st)
   b(n2,) (p2) if and only if n(1) <= n(2) and (1-p(1))(n1) >=

   >= p(2)(r2)), or both hypergeometric with the same sample size
   parameter. The binomial case is contained in a known result about
   Bernoulli convolutions, the other two cases appear to be new. The
   emphasis of this paper is on providing a variety of different methods of
   proofs: (i) half monotone likelihood ratios, (ii) explicit coupling,
   (iii) Markov chain comparison, (iv) analytic calculation, and (v)
   comparison of Levy measures. We give four proofs in the binomial case
   (methods (i) (iv)) and three in the negative binomial case (methods (i),
   (iv), and (v)). The statement for hypergeometric distributions is proved
   via method (i).}},

Abstract = {{We investigate temporal variations in teleseismic receiver functions
   using 11 yr of data at station PKD near Parkfield, California, by
   stacking power spectral density (PSD) functions within 12-month windows.
   We find that PSD levels for both radial and transverse components drop
   by similar to 5 dB following the 2003 San Simeon (M 6.5) earthquake,
   with a persistent reduction in background levels of similar to 2 dB,
   relative to the pre-2003 levels, after the 2004 Parkfield (M 6)
   earthquake, corresponding to an estimated decrease in shear-wave
   velocity of similar to 0.12 and similar to 0.06 km/sec, respectively, or
   equivalent negative changes in Poisson's ratio of similar to 0.02 and
   similar to 0.01. Our results suggest that the perturbation originates at
   middle to lower crustal levels, possibly caused by the redistribution of
   crustal pore fluids, consistent with increased and sustained tremor
   activity near Parkfield following both earthquakes. This study shows
   that we can resolve temporal variations in crustal scattering structure
   near a major seismogenic fault using the receiver function method.}},

Abstract = {{In this work we show that a structure consisting of a network of bending
   beams can exhibit a negative Poisson's ratio. We have shown that the
   negative Poisson's ratio behaviour is driven by the (bcc analogous) type
   Ill beams, the type II (fcc like) beams result in a structure with a
   Poisson's ratio of around zero and type I (simple cubic configuration)
   beams result in a Poisson's ratio of nearly +1. The tensile and shear
   strengths of the type III beams are augmented by addition of type II and
   type III beams. By tailoring the relative stiffness of the component
   beams within the structure it is possible to design an auxetic truss
   structure with specific Poisson's ratio, tensile and shear moduli.
   This validates the hypothesis that crystal structures can provide
   inspiration for macro structures with tailored mechanical properties
   where the mechanism for negative Poisson's ratio (auxetic) behaviour at
   the atomic scale in cubic crystals is replicated by bending beams. (C)

Abstract = {{CPU time and memory usage are two vital issues that any numerical
   solvers for the Poisson-Boltzmann equation have to face in biomolecular
   applications. In this study, we systematically analyzed the CPU time and
   memory usage of five commonly used finite-difference solvers with a
   large and diversified set of biomolecular structures. Our comparative
   analysis shows that modified incomplete Cholesky conjugate gradient and
   geometric multigrid are the most efficient in the diversified test set.
   For the two efficient solvers, our test shows that their CPU times
   increase approximately linearly with the numbers of grids. Their CPU
   times also increase almost linearly with the negative logarithm of the
   convergence criterion at very similar rate. Our comparison further shows
   that geometric multigrid performs better in the large set of tested
   biomolecules. However, modified incomplete Cholesky conjugate gradient
   is superior to geometric multigrid in molecular dynamics simulations of
   tested molecules. We also investigated other significant components in
   numerical solutions of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation. It turns out that
   the time-limiting step is the free boundary condition setup or the
   linear systems for the selected proteins if the electrostatic focusing
   is not used. Thus, development of future numerical solvers for the
   Poisson-Boltzmann equation should balance all aspects of the numerical
   procedures in realistic biomolecular applications. (C) 2010 Wiley

   honeycombs are structures defined by cylinders connected by four tangent

   the plane due to combined cylinder rotation and bending of the ribs. A
   Bloch wave approach is applied to the representative unit cell of the

   surfaces varying the geometric parameters of the unit cell. The modal
   density of the tetrachiral lattice and of a sandwich panel having the
   tetrachiral as core is extracted from the integration of the phase

Abstract = {{This paper presents a study of using weft-knitting technology to
   fabricate negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) knitted fabrics, which exhibit
   the unusual property of becoming wider when stretched. Based on a
   geometrical analysis of a three-dimensional NPR structure constructed
   with parallelogram planes of the same shape and size, a new kind of NPR
   weft-knitted fabric was firstly designed and fabricated on a
   computerized flat-knitting machine. Then the NPR values of these fabrics
   were evaluated and compared with those from the theoretical
   calculations. The results show that all knitted fabrics have the NPR
   effect, which decreases with increased strain in the course direction.
   This variation trend is consistent with the theoretical prediction. The
   results also show that the main structure parameter affecting the NPR
   effect of a fabric is the opening angle at its initial state. Fabric
   with a smaller opening angle will have higher NPR values. This paper
   demonstrates the feasibility of fabricating NPR-knitted fabrics by using
   weft-knitting technology if a suitable structure and parameters are
   selected.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic polymeric materials are a special kind of materials that exhibit
   negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) effect. They get fatter when stretched
   and thinner when compressed. Auxetic behavior is a scale-independent
   property which can be achieved at different structural levels from
   molecular to macroscopic levels. The internal structure of material
   plays an important role in obtaining auxetic effect. Because of NPR
   effect, auxetic polymeric materials demonstrate a series of particular
   characteristics when compared with conventional materials. In recent
   years, a variety of auxetic polymeric materials have been designed and
   fabricated for diverse applications. This article presents a review on
   advances in this area. The emphasis is focused on the geometrical
   structures and models, particular properties and applications of auxetic

   the intervention arm (70 cases per 355.8 PYs) and 29.4 cases per 100 PYs
   (125 cases per 424.8 PYs) in the control arm (RR, 0.67; 95\% CI,
   0.51-0.89; P = .006). The incidence of multiple HR-HPV infections was
   6.7 cases per 100 PYs in the intervention arm and 14.8 cases per 100 PYs
   in the control arm (RR, 0.45; 95\% CI, 0.28-0.73), but there was no
   significant effect on single infections (RR, 0.89; 95\% CI, 0.60-1.30).
   HR-HPV incidence was lower in the intervention arm for all genotypes and
   demographic/behavioral subgroups. The clearance of preexisting HR-HPV
   infections was 215.8 cases per 100 PYs (205 cases per 95 PYs) in the
   intervention arm and 159.1 cases per 100 PYs (255 cases per 160.25 PYs)
   in the control arm (adjusted RR, 1.39; 95\% CI, 1.17-1.64).
   Conclusions. Male circumcision reduces the incidence of multiple HR-HPV
   infections and increases clearance of HR-HPV infections in
   HIV-uninfected men.}},

Abstract = {{Exact solution for long orthotropic tube under internal pressure and
   axial load suggests the existence of very dangerous combinations of
   elastic properties. We demonstrate that such elastic properties can be
   thermodynamically stable. Close to a dangerous combination, stress
   components change very rapidly in radial direction, resulting in huge
   peak stresses exceeding the membrane theory predictions by several
   orders of magnitude, even for relatively thin-walled tubes. Another
   manifestation of this effect is extreme sensitivity of peak stresses to
   variations in elastic properties. Away from the critical condition the
   anomaly in stress distribution disappears and this can be the key point
   in the design of related structures. The rapid change of stresses in
   thickness direction is attributed to the auxetic property (negative
   Poisson's ratio) of highly anisotropic material of the tube. As an
   example, we consider the filament wound tube with closed ends under
   internal pressure and demonstrate that, for highly anisotropic
   fiber-reinforced plastic, winding with angle close to 45A degrees is
   potentially dangerous.}},

Abstract = {{Spatial autocorrelation is problematic for classical hierarchical
   cluster detection tests commonly used in multidrug resistant
   tuberculosis (MDR-TB) analyses as considerable random error can occur.
   Therefore, when MDR-TB clusters are spatially autocorrelated the
   assumption that the clusters are independently random is invalid. In
   this research, a product moment correlation coefficient (i.e. the
   Moran's coefficient) was used to quantify local spatial variation in
   multiple clinical and environmental predictor variables sampled in San
   Juan de Lurigancho, Lima, Peru. Initially, QuickBird (spatial resolution
   = 0.61 m) data, encompassing visible bands and the near infra-red bands,
   were selected to synthesize images of land cover attributes of the study
   site. Data of residential addresses of individual patients with
   smear-positive MDR-TB were geocoded, prevalence rates calculated and
   then digitally overlaid onto the satellite data within a 2 km buffer of
   31 georeferenced health centres, using a 10 m(2) grid-based algorithm.
   Geographical information system (GIS)gridded measurements of each health
   centre were generated based on preliminary base maps of the
   georeferenced data aggregated to block groups and census tracts within
   each buffered area. A three-dimensional model of the study site was
   constructed based on a digital elevation model (DEM) to determine
   terrain covariates associated with the sampled MDR-TB covariates.
   Pearson's correlation was used to evaluate the linear relationship
   between the DEM and the sampled MDR-TB data. A SAS/GIS(R) module was
   then used to calculate univariate statistics and to perform linear and
   non-linear regression analyses using the sampled predictor variables.
   The estimates generated from a global autocorrelation analyses were then
   spatially decomposed into empirical orthogonal bases, using a negative
   binomial regression with a non-homogeneous mean. Results of the DEM
   analyses indicated a statistically non-significant, linear relationship
   between georeferenced health centres and the sampled covariate
   elevation. The data exhibited positive spatial autocorrelation and the
   decomposition of Moran's coefficient into uncorrelated, orthogonal map
   pattern components which revealed global spatial heterogeneities
   necessary to capture latent autocorrelation in the MDR-TB model. It was
   thus shown that Poisson regression analyses and spatial eigenvector
   mapping can elucidate the mechanics of MDR-TB transmission by
   prioritizing clinical and environmental-sampled predictor variables for
   identifying high risk populations.}},

Abstract = {{In statistical analyses, metabolic syndrome as a dependent variable is
   often utilized in a binary form (presence/absence) where the logistic
   regression model is used to estimate the odds ratio as the measure of
   association between health-related factors and metabolic syndrome. Since
   metabolic syndrome is a common outcome the interpretation of odds ratio
   as an approximation to prevalence or risk ratio is questionable as it
   may overestimate its intended target. In addition, dichotomizing a
   variable that could potentially be treated as discrete may lead to
   reduced statistical power. In this paper, the authors treat metabolic
   syndrome as a discrete outcome by defining it as the count of syndrome
   components. The goal of this study is to evaluate the usefulness of
   alternative generalized linear models for analysis of metabolic syndrome
   as a count outcome and compare the results with models that utilize the
   binary form. Empirical data were used to examine the association between
   depression and metabolic syndrome. Measures of association were
   calculated using two approaches; models that treat metabolic syndrome as
   a binary outcome (the logistic, log-binomial, Poisson, and the modified
   Poisson regression) and models that utilize metabolic syndrome as
   discrete/count data (the Poisson and the negative binomial regression).
   The method that treats metabolic syndrome as a count outcome
   (Poisson/negative binomial regression model) appears more sensitive in
   that it is better able to detect associations and hence can serve as an
   alternative to analyze metabolic syndrome as count dependent variable
   and provide an interpretable measure of association.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus requires continuous medical care and
   patient self-management in order to prevent short-term complications and
   decrease the risk of long-term complications, which can result in
   substantial increases in the total economic burden of the disease.
   Findings from randomized clinical trials have shown that improved
   glycemic control may reduce the risk of long-term complications as long
   as a target for hemoglobin A1c is not set below 7\% for intensive
   glycemic control. However, limited data from clinical practice are
   available regarding the relationship between glycemic control and
   medical costs associated with diabetes care
   OBJECTIVE. To assess the potential relationships between glycemic
   levels, diabetes-related hospitalizations, and hospital costs among
   adult patients with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus who were
   assigned to a primary care provider (PCP) in a clinic that was
   affiliated with a managed care organization (MCO).
   METHODS: A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted using data from
   approximately 200,000 members of the Fallon Clinic Health Plan who were
   assigned to a clinic PCP at any time during a 5-year study period
   beginning January 1, 2002, and ending December 31, 2006. Patients aged
   30 years or older with at least 2 medical claims with any listed
   diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (ICD-9-CM code 250.xx) during the study
   period and 2 or more A1c values within 1 year of each other during the
   study period (mean 7.6 tests over 39 months; median=6.8), were
   identified and stratified into 1 of 5 groups defined by 1\% increments
   of A1c, based on their mean A1c values during the entire study period.
   A1c data were available only for tests ordered by a clinic provider,
   tests ordered by other specialists in the MCO's network were absent from
   the database. The study follow-up period started with each patient's
   first A1c test (index date) and continued until plan disenrollment,
   death, or December 31, 2006, whichever was earlier (end date),
   regardless of when the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus was made. Study
   measures included the proportion of patients with 1 or more
   diabetes-related hospitalizations, number of diabetes-related inpatient
   stays, and the associated estimated hospitalization costs over the
   follow-up period Diabetes-related hospitalizations were identified based
   on a diagnosis, in any of 10 diagnosis fields, for 1 of 16 selected
   complications of diabetes identified by the authors. Hospital costs were
   estimated using discharge data (diagnoses and costs calculated from
   cost-to-charge ratios) contained in the 2004 Healthcare Cost and
   Utilization Project (HCUP) database and inflated to 2007 dollars using
   the medical care component of the Consumer Price Index. Multivariate
   models controlled for age, sex, number of A1c tests, diagnosis of
   cancer, and follow-up time A multivariate logistic regression analysis
   was conducted with the occurrence of at least 1 diabetes-related
   hospital admission as the dependent variable In the logistic regression
   analysis, follow-up time was defined as time from the index date to the
   date of the first diabetes-related hospitalization, plan disenrollment,
   death, or the study end date, whichever occurred first. A generalized
   linear model with a Poisson distribution and a log link was employed to
   estimate the rate of hospital admissions In the Poisson regression
   analysis, follow-up time was defined as duration of the entire study
   follow-up period and was an offset variable. Costs were estimated using
   a 2-part model. first, we calculated the probability of having a
   hospitalization, as determined by the logistic regression above; second,
   a generalized linear model with a negative binomial distribution and a
   log link was used to predict the mean cost of diabetes-related
   hospitalizations only for patients with an inpatient stay, with the
   duration of the entire study follow-up period as an offset variable. We
   calculated the mean per patient cost of diabetes-related
   hospitalizations by multiplying the probability of having a
   hospitalization (as determined by the first part of the model) by the
   mean costs for patients who had such admissions (as determined by the
   second part of the model).
   RESULTS: 9,887 patients met study selection criteria Mean A1c level was
   <7\% for 5,649 (57.1\%) patients, 7\% to <8\% for 2,747 (27 8\%), 8\% to
   <9\% for 1,002 (10.1\%), 9\% to <10\% for 312 (3.2\%), and 10\% or more
   for 177 (1 8\%). Over a mean (median) 40 (40) months of follow-up
   (interquartile range= 30-50 months), 287\% (n=2,838) of patients had 1
   or more diabetes-related hospital admissions In the logistic regression
   analysis, odds of having at least 1 diabetes-related hospital stay did
   not significantly differ for patients with mean A1c of <7\% compared
   with patients in most higher mean A1c categories (7\% to <8\%, 8\% to
   <9\%, or 9\% to <10\%), however, odds of having a diabetes-related
   hospitalization were significantly higher for patients with mean A1c of
   10\% or more compared with patients with mean A1c of <7\% (odds
   ratio=2.13, 95\% confidence interval =1.36-3.33). In the negative
   binomial regression analysis of those with at least 1 hospital
   admission, estimated costs per hospitalized patient increased by mean
   A1c level. In the Poisson regression analysis, the rate of
   diabetes-related hospitalizations significantly increased by A1c level
   (13 per 100 patient-years for patients with mean A1c of <7\% vs. 30 per
   100 patient-years for mean A1c of 10\% or more when covariates were held
   at mean levels, P<0.001) In the 2-part model results, adjusted mean
   estimated costs of diabetes-related hospitalizations per study patient
   were \$2,792 among those with mean A1c of <7\% and \$6,759 among those
   with mean A1c of 10\% or more.
   CONCLUSIONS. In this managed-care plan, the odds of having at least 1
   diabetes-related hospitalization were not significantly associated with
   higher mean A1c except for patients with mean A1c of at least 10\%.
   However, higher mean A1c levels were associated with significantly
   higher estimated hospitalization costs among those with at least 1
   hospitalization and with higher rates of diabetes-related hospital
   utilization per 100 patient-years.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, we propose a simple method of constructing confidence
   intervals for a function of binomial success probabilities and for a
   function of Poisson means. The method involves finding an approximate
   fiducial quantity (FQ) for the parameters of interest. A FQ for a
   function of several parameters can be obtained by substitution. For the
   binomial case, the fiducial approach is illustrated for constructing
   confidence intervals for the relative risk and the ratio of odds.
   Fiducial inferential procedures are also provided for estimating
   functions of several Poisson parameters. In particular, fiducial
   inferential approach is illustrated for interval estimating the ratio of
   two Poisson means and for a weighted sum of several Poisson means.
   Simple approximations to the distributions of the FQs are also given for
   some problems. The merits of the procedures are evaluated by comparing
   them with those of existing asymptotic methods with respect to coverage
   probabilities, and in some cases, expected widths. Comparison studies
   indicate that the fiducial confidence intervals are very satisfactory,
   and they are comparable or better than some available asymptotic
   methods. The fiducial method is easy to use and is applicable to find
   confidence intervals for many commonly used summary indices. Some
   examples are used to illustrate and compare the results of fiducial
   approach with those of other available asymptotic methods. (C) 2009

Abstract = {{Background Countries with a similar expenditure on healthcare within
   Europe exhibit differences in lung cancer survival. Survival in lung
   cancer was studied in 2001-2004 in England, Norway and Sweden.
   Methods Nationwide cancer registries in England, Norway and Sweden were
   used to identify 250 828 patients with lung cancer from England, 18 386
   from Norway and 24 886 from Sweden diagnosed between 1996 and 2004,
   after exclusion of patients registered through death certificate only or
   with missing, zero or negative survival times. 5-Year relative survival
   was calculated by application of the period approach. The excess
   mortality between the countries was compared using a Poisson regression
   model.
   Results In all subcategories of age, sex and follow-up period, the
   5-year survival was lower in England than in Norway and Sweden. The
   age-standardised survival estimates were 6.5\%, 9.3\% and 11.3\% for men
   and 8.4\%, 13.5\% and 15.9\% for women in the respective countries in
   2001-2004. The difference in excess risk of dying between the countries
   was predominantly confined to the first year of follow-up. The relative
   excess risk ratio during the first 3 months of follow-up comparing
   England with Norway 2001-2004 varied between 1.23 and 1.46, depending on
   sex and age, and between 1.56 and 1.91 comparing England with Sweden.
   Conclusion Access to healthcare and population awareness are likely to
   be major reasons for the differences, but it cannot be excluded that
   diagnostic and therapeutic activity play a role. Future improvements in
   lung cancer management may be seen early in follow-up.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, there has been growing interest in utilizing electrical fields
   to position and separate rod-shaped particles such as DNA molecules,
   actin filaments, microtubules, viruses, bacteria, nanotubes. and
   nanorods. The polarization of the electrical double layer, enveloping
   the rod, plays a critical role in determining the magnitude and
   direction of the rod's dipole moment. We consider noninteracting,
   rod-shaped (spherocylinder) particles and calculate the induced dipole
   moment as a function of the electrical field frequency, the rod's aspect
   ratio (length/radius), the rod's free surface charge, and the
   double-layer thickness. To this end, we solve the Poisson Nernst Planck
   (PNP) equations for the ions' migration, diffusion, and convection. When
   the surface charge is small and the rod is short, the dipole moment is
   negative. As the rod's length increases, the dipole moment increases and
   eventually changes sign from negative to positive. The dipole
   coefficient of a rod, whose length is greater than some critical value,
   increases linearly with length. This latter observation simplifies the
   estimation of the dipole moment of particles with large aspect ratios
   (length/radius). The theoretical predictions are compared and favorably
   agree with experimental data for double-stranded, short DNA molecules.}},

Abstract = {{Anelastic anomalies (sharp variations in modulus and damping with
   temperature) were observed in tetragonal BaTiO3 via broadband
   viscoelastic spectroscopy after aging at 50 degrees C for 15 h. The
   effect was most pronounced under electrical short circuit condition, at
   low frequency and under small excitation strain (10(-6)). Softening in
   bulk modulus and negative Poisson's ratio were observed near 60 degrees
   C. Effects are attributed to an oxygen vacancy mechanism. A relaxational
   model cannot account for sharp response at smaller strains.
   Heterogeneity of negative stiffness is considered as a cause.}},

Abstract = {{Wildfire prevention education efforts involve a variety of methods,
   including airing public service announcements, distributing brochures,
   and making presentations, which are intended to reduce the occurrence of
   certain kinds of wildfires. A Poisson model of preventable Florida
   wildfires from 2002 to 2007 by fire management region was developed.
   Controlling for potential simultaneity biases, this model indicated that
   wildfire prevention education efforts have statistically significant and
   negative effects on the numbers of wildfires ignited by debris burning,
   campfire escapes, smoking, and children. Evaluating the expected
   reductions in wildfire damages given a change in wildfire prevention
   education efforts from current levels showed that marginal benefits
   exceed marginal costs statewide by an average of 35-fold. The benefits
   exceeded costs in the fire management regions by 10- to 99-fold,
   depending on assumptions about how wildfire prevention education
   spending is allocated to these regions. FOR. SCI. 56(2):181-192.}},

Abstract = {{We consider statistically homogeneous two-phase random piezoactive

   of a coupled stochastic boundary value problem of electroelasticity for
   the representative domain of a matrix piezocomposite with a random
   structure in the generalized singular approximation of the method of
   periodic components; the singular approximation is based on taking into
   account only the singular component of the second derivative of the
   Green function for the comparison media. We obtain an analytic solution
   for the tensor of effective properties of the piezocomposite in terms of
   the solution for the tensors of effective properties of a composite with
   an ideal periodic structure or with the ``statistical mixture{''}
   structure and with the periodicity coefficient calculated for a given
   random structure with its specific characteristics taken into account.
   The effective properties of composites with auxiliary structures
   (periodic and ``statistical mixture{''}) are also determined in the
   generalized singular approximation by varying the properties of the
   comparisonmedium. We perform numerical computations and analyze the
   effective properties of a quasiperiodic piezocomposite with reciprocal
   polarization of oriented ellipsoidal inclusions and the matrix, the
   layered structures with reciprocal polarization of the layers {[}1] of a

   the Poisson ratio under extension along the normal, and an increase in
   the absolute values of the basic piezomoduli.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Properties of small amplitude nonlinear ion-acoustic solitary waves in a
   warm magneto plasma with positive-negative ions and nonthermal electrons
   are investigated. For this purpose, the hydrodynamic equations for the
   positive-negative ions, nonthermal electron density distribution, and
   the Poisson equation are used to derive the corresponding nonlinear
   evolution equation; Zkharov-Kuznetsov (ZK) equation, in the small
   amplitude regime. The ZK equation is analyzed to examine the existence
   regions of the solitary pulses. It is found that compressive and
   rarefactive ion-acoustic solitary waves strongly depend on the mass and
   density ratios of the positive and negative ions as well as the
   nonthermal electron parameter. Also, it is found that there are two
   critical values for the density ratio of the negative-to-positive ions
   (upsilon), the ratio between unperturbed electron-to-positive ion
   density (mu), and the nonthermal electron parameter (beta), which decide
   the existence of positive and negative ion-acoustic solitary waves. The
   present study is applied to examine the small amplitude nonlinear
   ion-acoustic solitary excitations for the (H+, O-2(-)) and (H+, H-)
   plasmas, where they are found in the D- and F-regions of the Earth's
   ionosphere. This investigation should be helpful in understanding the
   salient features of the nonlinear ion-acoustic solitary waves in space
   and in laboratory plasmas where two distinct groups of ions and
   non-Boltzmann distributed electrons are present.}},

Abstract = {{We consider zero-inflated Poisson and zero-inflated negative binomial
   regression models to analyze discrete count data containing a
   considerable amount of zero observations. Analysis of current data could
   be empirically feasible if we utilize similar data based on previous
   studies. Ibrahim and Chen (2000) proposed the power prior to incorporate
   certain information from the historical data available from previous
   studies. The power prior is constructed by raising the likelihood
   function of the historical data to the power a(0). where 0 <= a(0) <= 1.
   The power prior is a useful informative prior in Bayesian inference. We
   estimate regression coefficients associated with several safety
   countermeasures. We use Markov chain and Monte Carlo techniques to
   execute some computations. The empirical results show that the
   zero-inflated models with the power prior perform better than the
   frequentist approach. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{A common technique used for the calibration of collision prediction
   models is the Generalized Linear Modeling (GLM) procedure with the
   assumption of Negative Binomial or Poisson error distribution. In this
   technique, fixed coefficients that represent the average relationship
   between the dependent variable and each explanatory variable are
   estimated. However, the stationary relationship assumed may hide some
   important spatial factors of the number of collisions at a particular
   traffic analysis zone. Consequently, the accuracy of such models for
   explaining the relationship between the dependent variable and the
   explanatory variables may be suspected since collision frequency is
   likely influenced by many spatially defined factors such as land use,
   demographic characteristics, and traffic volume patterns. The primary
   objective of this study is to investigate the spatial variations in the
   relationship between the number of zonal collisions and potential
   transportation planning predictors, using the Geographically Weighted
   Poisson Regression modeling technique. The secondary objective is to
   build on knowledge comparing the accuracy of Geographically Weighted
   Poisson Regression models to that of Generalized Linear Models. The
   results show that the Geographically Weighted Poisson Regression models
   are useful for capturing spatially dependent relationships and generally
   perform better than the conventional Generalized Linear Models. (C) 2009

Abstract = {{To assess interchangeability of estimates of bacterial abundance by
   different epifluorescence microscopy methods, total bacterial numbers
   (TBNs) determined by most widely accepted protocols were statistically
   compared. Bacteria in a set of distinctive samples were stained with
   acridine orange (AO), 4'-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), and BacLight
   and enumerated by visual counting (VC) and supervised image analysis
   (IA). Model II regression and Bland-Altman analysis proved general
   agreements between IA and VC methods, although IA counts tended to be
   lower than VC counts by 7\% on a logarithmic scale. Distributions of
   cells and latex beads on polycarbonate filters were best fitted to
   negative binomial models rather than to Poisson or log-normal models.
   The fitted models revealed higher precisions of TBNs by the IA method
   than those by the VC method. In pairwise comparisons of the staining
   methods, TBNs by AO and BacLight staining showed good agreement with
   each other, but DAPI staining had tendencies of underestimation.
   Although precisions of the three staining methods were comparable to one
   another (intraclass correlation coefficients, 0.97 to 0.98), accuracy of
   the DAPI staining method was rebutted by disproportionateness of TBNs
   between pairs of samples that carried 2-fold different volumes of
   identical cell suspensions. It was concluded that the TBN values
   estimated by AO and BacLight staining are relatively accurate and
   interchangeable for quantitative interpretation and that IA provides
   better precision than does VC. As a prudent measure, it is suggested to
   avoid use of DAPI staining for comparative studies investigating
   accuracy of novel cell-counting methods.}},

Abstract = {{Background: This study aimed to characterize self-rated health and to
   investigate associations between that variable and socio-demographic and
   health conditions in older men in a medium-sized Brazilian city.
   Methods: Subjects eligible for this cross-sectional study included older
   males residing in the municipality who were interviewed during the
   influenza immunisation campaign in 2006. A descriptive analysis of the
   variables was performed, exploring associations between self-rated
   health and a number of co-variables, using prevalence ratios (PR).
   Multivariate analysis used Poisson regression.
   Results: The study population consisted of 2,876 men with a mean age of
   70.01 years (standard deviation = 7.21), the majority were married and
   with low schooling. A major portion reported having a regular physician,
   using public health care services, and making regular use of medication.
   Fair to poor health was reported by nearly 40\% of these older men. In
   the bivariate analysis, different factors were associated with negative
   self-rated health, whilst in the multivariate model the following
   remained associated with fair or poor self-rated health: number of
   chronic conditions, regular use of medication (PR = 1.67, 95\%
   confidence interval (Cl) = 1.43-1.94), recent hospitalization (PR =
   1.48, 95\% Cl = 1.33-1.65), not currently working (PR = 1.34, 95\% Cl =
   1.17-1.52), low schooling (PR = 1.29, 95\% Cl = 1.13-1.48), and being a
   user of the public health care system (PR = 1.37, 95\% Cl = 1.21-1.54).
   Conclusion: These findings corroborate the hypothesis that various
   issues are related to self-rated health in the elderly. Considering that
   self-rated health is a good indicator of objective health conditions in
   this age group, health services should develop strategies to capture
   older men with a risk profile for poor self-rated health. (C) 2009 WPMH

Journal = {{MEASUREMENT SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{We construct uncertainty intervals for weak Poisson signals in the
   presence of background. We consider the case where a primary experiment
   yields a realization of the signal plus background, and a second
   experiment yields a realization of the background. The data acquisition
   times, for the background-only experiment, T-bg, and the primary
   experiment, T, are selected so that their ratio, T-bg/T, varies from 1
   to 25. The upper choice of 25 is motivated by an experimental study at
   the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The expected
   number of background counts in the primary experiment varies from 0.2 to
   2. We construct 90\% and 95\% confidence intervals based on a
   propagation-of-errors method as well as two implementations of a Neyman
   procedure where acceptance regions are constructed based on a
   likelihood-ratio criterion that automatically determines whether the
   resulting confidence interval is one-sided or two-sided. In one of the
   implementations of the Neyman procedure due to Feldman and Cousins (FC),
   uncertainty in the expected background contribution is neglected. In the
   other implementation, we account for random uncertainty in the estimated
   expected background with a parametric bootstrap implementation of a
   method due to Conrad. We also construct minimum length Bayesian
   credibility intervals. For each method, we test for the presence of a
   signal based on the value of the lower endpoint of the uncertainty
   interval. In general, the propagation-of-errors method performs the
   worst compared to the other methods according to frequentist coverage
   and detection probability criteria, and sometimes produces nonsensical
   intervals where both endpoints are negative. The Neyman procedures
   generally yield intervals with better frequentist coverage properties
   compared to the Bayesian method except for some cases where T-bg/T = 1.
   In general, the Bayesian method yields intervals with lower detection
   probabilities compared to Neyman procedures. One of the main conclusions
   is that when T-bg/T is 5 or more and the expected background is 2 or
   less, the FC method outperforms the other methods considered. For T-bg/T
   = 1, 2 we observe that the Neyman procedure methods yield false
   detection probabilities for the case of no signal that are higher than
   expected given the nominal frequentist coverage of the interval. In
   contrast, for T-bg/T = 1, 2, the false detection probability of the
   Bayesian method is less than expected according to the nominal
   frequentist coverage.}},

Title = {{Social network types and functional dependency in older adults in Mexico}},
Journal = {{BMC PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{FEB 27}},
Abstract = {{Background: Social networks play a key role in caring for older adults.
   A better understanding of the characteristics of different social
   networks types (TSNs) in a given community provides useful information
   for designing policies to care for this age group. Therefore this study
   has three objectives: 1) To derive the TSNs among older adults
   affiliated with the Mexican Institute of Social Security; 2) To describe
   the main characteristics of the older adults in each TSN, including the
   instrumental and economic support they receive and their satisfaction
   with the network; 3) To determine the association between functional
   dependency and the type of social network.
   Methods: Secondary data analysis of the 2006 Survey of Autonomy and
   Dependency (N = 3,348). The TSNs were identified using the structural
   approach and cluster analysis. The association between functional
   dependency and the TSNs was evaluated with Poisson regression with
   robust variance analysis in which socio-demographic characteristics,
   lifestyle and medical history covariates were included.
   Results: We identified five TSNs: diverse with community participation
   (12.1\%), diverse without community participation (44.3\%); widowed
   (32.0\%); nonfriends-restricted (7.6\%); nonfamily-restricted (4.0\%).
   Older adults belonging to widowed and restricted networks showed a
   higher proportion of dependency, negative self-rated health and
   depression. Older adults with functional dependency more likely belonged
   to a widowed network (adjusted prevalence ratio 1.5; 95\% CI: 1.1-2.1).
   Conclusion: The derived TSNs were similar to those described in
   developed countries. However, we identified the existence of a diverse
   network without community participation and a widowed network that have
   not been previously described. These TSNs and restricted networks
   represent a potential unmet need of social security affiliates.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Shape memory is the property of a material to remember its original
   shape despite subsequent plastic deformation. The exposure to specific
   temperature profiles induces a shape memory effect on auxetic (negative
   Poisson's ratio) foam specimens, returning them to their initial
   dimensions. This behaviour is a one-way effect, and it is a property of
   the polyurethane (PU) constituent of the foam. The foam specimens were
   transformed from conventional Poisson's ratio to auxetic, returned to
   conventional and once again to auxetic under multiple mechanical and
   thermal loading. At each stage the foams were mechanically characterized
   under cyclic tensile and compressive loading. The manufacturing route
   adopted for the auxetic PU specimens involved a multiaxial compression
   of the native foam, heating of the compressed specimens above the T-g of
   the foam polymer, and cooling under running water. Twenty specimens,
   divided equally between two varieties of PU-based foam, were fabricated.
   Two different compression ratios were used during auxetic conversion for
   both kinds of foam, and the same final temperature of 135 degrees C was
   adopted. Tensile and compressive cyclic tests were performed in order to
   measure the tangent modulus (i.e. stiffness), Poisson's ratios and
   energy dissipated per unit volume. Remarkable differences before and
   after the memory effect took place were found, showing mechanical
   behaviour unique to each of these phases. The shape memory effect plays
   an important role in the mechanical behaviour of the auxetic foams. (C)

Abstract = {{The use of negative thermal expansivity (NTE) particles as composite
   fillers is relatively new and the particle-matrix interface is not well
   studied. This lack of understanding of the particle-matrix interface is
   further complicated as in many engineering applications, such as
   microchip packaging, the composite is constrained by its surroundings
   and is not free to expand upon heating; an important consideration that
   is often not taken into account. This paper presents a systematic
   theoretical study of the behaviour at the particle-matrix interface
   under varying particle coefficient of thermal expansivity (CTE),
   Poisson's ratios (including negative Poisson's ratios), Young's moduli,
   boundary conditions and particle separation distances via finite element
   modelling, and describes how to optimise composite formulation for
   problems of thermal mismatch through tailoring of particle-matrix
   interaction. The effects of reduced CTE are explored via models of
   electronic chip package assembly. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND \& AIMS: Although gastric cancer forms part of the Lynch
   syndrome tumor spectrum, the risk of developing gastric cancer in Lynch
   syndrome families is unknown, resulting in a lack of clear guidelines
   for surveillance. The aim of this study was to evaluate incidence trends
   and risk of developing gastric cancer among Lynch syndrome mutation
   carriers in a Western population. METHODS: Lynch syndrome mutation
   carriers were selected from the Dutch Hereditary Cancer Registry. The
   gastric cancer incidence in Lynch syndrome mutation carriers was
   compared to the gastric cancer incidence in the Dutch population between
   1970 and 2003. Standardized incidence ratios were calculated by a
   Poisson model. Cumulative risks were calculated by Kaplan-Meier
   analysis. RESULTS: Overall, 2014 Lynch syndrome mutation carriers were
   identified. Gastric cancer was diagnosed in 32 (1.6\%) subjects
   (male/female: 21/11), 22 (69\%) of them had a negative family history of
   gastric cancer. The standardized incidence ratios of gastric cancer was
   3.4 (95\% confidence interval, 2.1-5.2) and showed a nonsignificant
   decline between 1970 and 2003 (P = .30). Absolute risk of developing
   gastric cancer also showed no significant change over time (P = .51).
   Lifetime risk of developing gastric cancer was 8.0\% in males vs 5.3\%
   in females (P = .02), and 4.8\% and 9\% for MLH1 and MSH2 carriers,
   respectively. None of the 378 MSH6 carriers developed gastric cancer (P
   = .002 vs MLH1 and MSH2 combined lifetime risk). CONCLUSIONS: Lynch
   syndrome mutation carriers have a substantial risk for gastric cancer,
   in particular patients with an MLH1 or MSH2 mutation. Family history for
   gastric cancer is a poor indicator for individual risk. Surveillance
   gastroscopy for Lynch syndrome patients carrying an MLH1 or MSH2
   mutation should therefore be considered.}},

Abstract = {{Hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) seroconversion in chronic hepatitis B
   virus infection confers a favorable prognosis, but untoward outcomes may
   develop in some patients. The impact of the age of HBeAg seroconversion
   on prognosis is not clearly known. HBeAg-positive patients with
   biopsy-proven chronic hepatitis B were followed up long-term. Follow-up
   studies included liver biochemistry, alpha-fetoprotein, and
   ultrasonography every 3 to 6 months or more frequently if clinically
   indicated. Of the patients who underwent spontaneous HBeAg
   seroconversion, the incidences of HBeAg-negative hepatitis, cirrhosis,
   hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and hepatitis B surface antigen
   seroclearance were compared between patient groups with different ages
   at the time of HBeAg seroconversion using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis
   and Poisson regression model. Spontaneous HBeAg seroconversion was
   documented in 508 patients. Of the 483 patients who had no evidence of
   cirrhosis or HCC at the time of HBeAg seroconversion, HBeAg
   seroconversion occurred before age 30 in 218 patients (group A), between
   age 31 and 40 in 199 patients (group B), and after age 40 in 66 patients
   (group Q. The 15-year cumulative incidences of HBeAg-negative hepatitis,
   cirrhosis, and HCC increased with increasing age of HBeAg
   seroconversion, the lowest being in group A (31.2\%, 3.7\%, and 2.1\%,
   respectively) and highest being in group C (66.7\% {[}P < 0.0001],
   42.9\% {[}P < 0.0001], and 7.7\% {[}P = 0.29], respectively). The hazard
   ratio of HBeAg-negative hepatitis, cirrhosis, and HCC was 2.95, 17.6,
   and 5.22, respectively, in group C compared with group A. Conclusion:
   Patients with HBeAg seroconversion before age 30 have excellent
   prognosis, whereas patients with delayed HBeAg seroconversion after age
   40 have significantly higher incidences of HBeAg-negative hepatitis,
   cirrhosis, and HCC. (HEPATOLOGY 2010;51:435-444.)}},

Abstract = {{Consider a compound Poisson surplus process of an insurer with debit
   interest and tax payments. When the portfolio is in a profitable
   situation, the insurer may pay a certain proportion of the premium
   income as tax payments. When the portfolio is below zero, the insurer
   could borrow money at a debit interest rate to continue his/her
   business. Meanwhile, the insurer will repay the debts from his/her
   premium income. The negative surplus may return to a positive level
   except that the surplus is below a certain critical level. In the latter
   case, we say that absolute ruin occurs. In this paper, we discuss
   absolute ruin quantities by defining an expected discounted penalty
   function at absolute ruin. First, a system of integro-differential
   equations satisfied by the expected discounted penalty function is
   derived. Second, closed-form expressions for the expected discounted
   total sum of tax payments until absolute ruin and the Laplace-Stieltjes
   transform (LST) of the total duration of negative surplus are obtained.
   Third, for exponential individual claims, closed-form expressions for
   the absolute ruin probability, the LST of the time to absolute ruin, the
   distribution function of the deficit at absolute ruin and the expected
   accumulated discounted tax are given. Fourth, for general individual
   claim distributions, when the initial surplus goes to infinity, we show
   that the ratio of the absolute ruin probability with tax to that without
   tax goes to a positive constant which is greater than one. Finally, we
   investigate the asymptotic behavior of the absolute ruin probability of
   a modified risk model where the interest rate on a positive surplus is
   involved. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To determine Incidence rate, seasonal variation, and short-
   and long-term outcomes of Klebsiella species bloodstream infection (BSI)
   In a population-based setting.
   PATIENTS AND METHODS: We identified 127 unique patients In Olmsted
   County, Minnesota, from January 1, 1998, to December 31, 2007, who had
   Klebsiella spp BSI. Multivarlable Poisson regression was used to examine
   temporal change and seasonal variation in incidence rate, and Cox
   proportional hazards regression was used to determine predictors of
   mortality.
   RESULTS: The age-adjusted incidence rate of Klebsiella spp BSI per
   100,000 person-years was 15.4 (95\% confidence interval {[}CI],
   11.6-19.2) in men and 9.4 (95\% CI, 7.0-11.8) in women. There was no
   linear increase in incidence rate of Klebsiella spp BSI during the study
   period (P=.55). The incidence rate of Klebsiella spp BSI increased at
   quadratic rate with age (P=.005). No significant difference was noted in
   incidence rate of Klebsiella spp BSI during the warmest 4 months
   compared to the rest of the year (incidence rate ratio, 0.97; 95\% CI,
   0.66-1.38; P=.95). The overall 28-day and 1-year all-cause mortality
   rates of Klebsiella spp BSI were 14\% (95\% CI, 9\%22\%) and 35\% (95\%
   CI, 27\%-44\%), respectively. Respiratory source of BSI was associated
   with a higher 28-day mortality (hazard ratio, 4.90; 95\% CI, 1.73-13.84;
   P=.003).
   CONCLUSION: The Incidence rate of Klebsiella spp BSI increased with age.
   There was no temporal change or seasonal variation in Incidence rate of
   Klebsiella spp BSI during the past decade. The 28-day all-cause
   mortality rate of Klebsiella spp BSI was relatively low; however, a
   respiratory source of BSI was associated with a poorer outcome.}},

Abstract = {{The vector generalized linear and additive model (VGLM/VGAM) classes of
   statistical regression models implement general maximum likelihood
   estimation and smoothing. The VGLM/VGAM framework is very general and is
   shown to include many popular fisheries regression models such as GLMs
   and GAMs, the negative binomial (NB), the zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP)
   and ZINB, the zero-altered Poisson (ZAP) and ZANB as special cases. The
   primary purpose of this article is to introduce the VGLM/VGAM
   methodology into fisheries science. To this end, data from the 2008
   FIPS-MOUCHE World Fly Fishing Championships is used to illustrate the
   chief advantages of the framework, viz. its large size and its ability
   to fit each model in a very flexible manner. Having a large framework
   leads to greater efficiencies in the practical modelling of data. The
   specific questions examined fall under two categories: (i) what
   distribution do the fish lengths have in each of the sectors? (ii) can
   fish catch reduction be detected and if so, how can the effects be
   ameliorated? As well as the above models, the utility of several other
   seemingly disparate regression models to fisheries research are
   presented, such as the bivariate odds-ratio model, the generalized
   extreme value distribution, and several quantile regression techniques.

Abstract = {{In modern technologies searching materials of peculiar features is of a
   fundamental interest for many researchers and engineers. Negative
   Poisson's ratio materials and structures expand transversely when
   stretching axially. Nowadays, there is an increasing interest in the
   development of these novel materials called auxetics. We are interested
   not only in their mechanical properties, but also in their interaction
   with external physical fields, e. g. electromagnetic field. It is
   expected that magnetoelastic surface waves propagation has essential
   meaning in many other physical and biomechanical applications. The paper
   aims at investigating propagation of magnetoelastic surface waves along
   an auxetic elastic halfspace in the presence of an external magnetic
   field of various orientations related to the limiting plane. Dispersion
   and existence conditions of those waves have been calculated and
   analyzed in order to present new features of described interactions. It
   has occurred that the dispersion properties in the case of the
   Rayleigh-like magnetoelastic surface waves are significantly different
   for the auxetic material compared to materials of positive Poisson's
   ratio.}},

Abstract = {{This paper models a multibody collision in the impulse space as a state
   transition diagram, where each state represents a phase during which
   impacts are ``active{''} at only a subset of the contact points. A state
   transition happens whenever an active impact finishes restitution, or an
   inactive impact gets reactivated, depending on whether the two involved
   bodies are instantaneously penetrating into each other or not. The
   elastic energy due to an impact is not only affected by the impulse at
   the corresponding contact point, but also by other impulses exerted on
   the two involved bodies during the impact. Consequently, Poisson's
   impulse-based law of restitution could result in negative energy. A new
   law governing the loss of elastic energy during restitution is
   introduced. Convergence of the impulse sequence generated by the state
   transition diagram is established. The collision outcome depends on the
   ratios of the contact stiffnesses rather than on their individual
   values. The collision model is then applied in an analysis of billiard
   shooting in which the cue stick impacts the cue ball, which in turn
   impacts the pool table. The system is driven by the normal impulses at
   the two contacts with the tangential impulses determined via a contact
   mode analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Quantification of selective pressures on regulatory sequences is a
   central question in studying the evolution of gene regulatory networks.
   Previous methods focus primarily on single sites rather than motif
   sequences. We propose a method of evaluating the strength of natural
   selection of a motif from a family of aligned sequences. The method is
   based on a Poisson process model of neutral sequence substitutions and
   derives a birth-death process of the motif occurrence frequencies. The
   selection coefficient is treated as a penalty for the motif death rate.
   We demonstrate that the birth-death model closely approximates
   statistics generated from simulated data and the Poisson process
   assumption holds in mammalian promoter sequences. Furthermore, we show
   that a considerably higher portion of known transcription factor binding
   motifs possess high selection coefficients compared to negative controls
   with high occurrence frequencies on promoters. Preliminary analysis
   supports the potential applications of the model to identify regulatory
   sequences under selection.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Data on a link between HCV or HBV infection and the
   development of cardiovascular disease among HIV-negative and
   HIV-positive individuals are conflicting. We sought to investigate the

   HIV-infected individuals.
   Methods: The prospective observational database of the D:A:D
   collaboration of 11 cohorts of HIV-infected individuals, including 212
   clinics in Europe, the United States and Australia was used.
   Multivariate Poisson regression was used to assess the effect of HCV or
   HBV infection on the development of myocardial infarction after
   adjustment for potential confounders, including cardiovascular risk
   factors, diabetes mellitus and exposure to antiretroviral therapy.
   Results: 01 33,347 individuals, 517 developed a myocardial infarction
   over 157,912 person-years, with an event rate of 3.3 events/1,000
   person-years (95\% confidence interval {[}CI] 3.0-3.6). Event rates
   (95\% CIs) per 1,000 person-years in those who were HCV-seronegative and
   HCV-seropositive were 3.3 (3.0-3.7) and 2.7 (2.2-3.3), respectively, and
   for those who were HBV-seronegative, had inactive infection or had
   active infection were 3.2 (2.8-3.5), 4.2 (3.1-5.2) and 2.8 (1.8-3.9),
   respectively. After adjustment, there was no association between HCV
   seropositivity (rate ratio 0.86 {[}95\% CI 0.62-1.19]), inactive HBV
   infection (rate ratio 1.07 {[}95\% CI 0.79-1.43]) or active HBV
   infection (rate ratio 0.78 {[}95\% CI 0.52-1.15]) and the development of
   myocardial infarction.
   Conclusions: We found no association between HBV or HCV coinfection and
   the development of myocardial infarction among HIV-infected individuals.}},

   Whether daughters of mothers with a diagnosis of diabetes have an
   increased risk of breast cancer is not known.
   Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study of daughters of
   mothers with diabetes by linkage of the Swedish Multigeneration,
   Cause-of-Death and Patient Register between 1952 and 2005. Breast cancer
   cases were ascertained by linkage with the Swedish Cancer Register
   between 1958 and 2005. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) of breast
   cancer were calculated assuming a Poisson distribution for the observed
   cases.
   Results: We identified 291,360 daughters of mothers with a diagnosis of
   diabetes before or after birth between 1952 and 2005. Among the
   daughters, 7,956 cases of breast cancer were diagnosed between 1964 and
   2005. The total time of follow-up was 12,173,821 person years. The
   expected number of breast cancer cases was 9,204, resulting in an SIR of
   0.86 (95\% CI, 0.85 to 0.88). The decrease in risk associated with
   maternal diabetes was stronger for premenopausal (< 55 years of age)
   than postmenopausal (>= 55 years of age) breast cancer (SIR 0.83 and
   0.91, respectively). Among daughters of mothers with diabetes, a history
   of breast cancer in the mother increased the risk of breast cancer in
   the daughter (SIR 1.43, 1.32 to 1.54).
   Conclusions: Daughters of mothers with a lifetime history of diabetes
   were at a decreased risk of breast cancer. The strongest negative
   association was found among premenopausal breast cancer.}},

Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{2008-2030}},
Abstract = {{The negative binomial (NB) model and the generalized Poisson (GP) model
   are common alternatives to Poisson models when overdispersion is present
   in the data. Having accounted for initial overdispersion, we may require
   further investigation as to whether there is evidence for zero-inflation
   in the data. Two score statistics are derived from the GP model for
   testing zero-inflation. These statistics, unlike Wald-type test
   statistics, do not require that we fit the more complex zero-inflated
   overdispersed models to evaluate zero-inflation. A simulation study
   illustrates that the developed score statistics reasonably follow a 2
   distribution and maintain the nominal level. Extensive simulation
   results also indicate the power behavior is different for including a
   continuous variable than a binary variable in the zero-inflation (ZI)
   part of the model. These differences are the basis from which
   suggestions are provided for real data analysis. Two practical examples
   are presented in this article. Results from these examples along with
   practical experience lead us to suggest performing the developed score
   test before fitting a zero-inflated NB model to the data.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of comparing some known distributions in various types of
   stochastic orderings has been of interest to many authors. In
   particular, several authors have been recently concerned with the
   comparison of Poisson, binomial, and negative binomial distributions
   with their respective mixtures. Incidentally, these distributions are
   among the four well-known distributions of the family of generalized
   power series distributions (GPSD's). The remaining distribution is the
   logarithmic series distribution. In this paper, we shall be concerned
   with comparing this remaining distribution of the class GPSD with its
   mixture in terms of various types of stochastic orderings such as the
   simple stochastic, likelihood ratio, uniformly more variable, convex,
   hazard rate and expectation orderings. Derivation of the results in this
   case prove to be computationally trickier than the other three. The
   special case when the means of the two distributions are the same is
   also discussed. Finally, an illustrative explicit example is provided.}},

Abstract = {{Design optimization of seat cushions is associated with the need to
   investigate their softness using, for this purpose, various kinds of
   loading pads. The aim of the investigation was: to determine seat
   cushion stiffness of a chair selected from a set of dining-room

   the seat surface caused by loading pad of different hardness, numerical
   calculation of contact strains between the seat cushion and the loading
   pad and to verify the results of these calculations with the results of
   laboratory experiments. The performed tests showed that the assessment
   of the seat cushion stiffness and the evaluation of contact stresses on
   their surface should be carried out using an equally stiff loading pad.
   In numerical calculations, polyurethane foams should be modeled as
   hyperfoam bodies of sigma=f(epsilon) characteristics determined in an
   axial compression test. Contact stresses between the seat cushion and
   the user's body should be reduced as a result of application of a
   frictionless connection of thin layers of polyurethane foams with foam
   forming the proper elastic layer of the seat.}},

Abstract = {{Endpoints in aquatic toxicity tests can be measured using a variety of
   measurement scales including dichotomous (survival), continuous (growth)
   and count (number of young). A distribution is assumed for an endpoint
   and analyses proceed accordingly. In certain situations, the assumed
   distribution may be incorrect and this may lead to incorrect statistical
   inference. The present study considers the analysis of count effects,
   here motivated by the Ceriodaphnia dubia reproduction study. While the
   Poisson probability model is a common starting point, this distribution
   assumes that the mean and variance are the same. This will not be the
   case if there is some extraneous source of variability in the system,
   and in this case, the variability may exceed the mean. A computer
   simulation study was used to examine the impact of overdispersion or
   outliers on the analysis of count data. Methods that assumed Poisson or
   negative binomially distributed outcomes were compared to methods that
   accommodated this potential overdispersion using quasi-likelihood (QL)
   or generalized linear mixed models (GLMM). If the data were truly
   Poisson, the adjusted methods still performed at nominal type I error
   rates. In the cases of overdispersed counts, the Poisson assumed methods
   resulted in rejection rates that exceeded nominal levels and standard
   errors for regression coefficients that were too narrow. The negative
   binomial methods worked best in the case when the data were, in fact,
   negative binomial but did not maintain nominal characteristics in other
   situations. In general, the QL and GLMM methods performed reasonably
   based on the present study, although all procedures suffered some impact
   in the presence of potential outliers. In particular, the QL is arguably
   preferred because it makes fewer assumptions than the GLMM and performed
   well over the range of conditions considered. Environ. Toxicol. Chem.

   linearly elastic rod when subjected to a longitudinal extension, has a
   long and interesting history. For isotropic bodies, it can theoretically
   range from + 1/2 to -1; the experimental gamut for anisotropics is even
   larger. The ratio is positive for all combinations of directions in most
   crystals. But as far back as the 1800s, Voigt and others found that
   negative values were encountered for some materials, a property now
   called auxeticity. Here we examine this property from the point of view

Abstract = {{When designing a flexible structure consisting of cellular materials, it
   is important to find the maximum effective strain of the cellular
   material resulting from the deformed cellular geometry and not leading
   to local cell wall failure. In this paper, a finite in-plane shear
   deformation of auxtic honeycombs having effective negative Poisson's
   ratio is investigated over the base material's elastic range. An
   analytical model of the in-plane plastic failure of the cell walls is
   refined with finite element (FE) micromechanical analysis using periodic
   boundary conditions. A nonlinear constitutive relation of honeycombs is
   obtained from the FE micromechanics simulation and is used to define the
   coefficients of a hyperelastic strain energy function. Auxetic
   honeycombs show high shear flexibility without a severe geometric
   nonlinearity when compared to their regular counterparts.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{157}},

Pages = {{A558-A566}},
Abstract = {{Density functional theory (DFT) is used to reveal that the
   polycrystalline Young's modulus (E) of graphite triples as it is
   lithiated to LiC6. This behavior is captured in a linear relationship
   between E and lithium concentration suitable for continuum-scale models
   aimed at predicting diffusion-induced deformation in battery electrode
   materials. Alternatively, Poisson's ratio is concentration-independent.
   Charge-transfer analyses suggest simultaneous weakening of carbon-carbon
   bonds within graphite basal planes and strengthening of interlayer
   bonding during lithiation. The variation in bond strength is shown to be
   responsible for the differences between elasticity tensor components,
   C-ij, of lithium-graphite intercalation (Li-GIC) phases. Strain
   accumulation during Li intercalation and deintercalation is examined
   with a core-shell model of a Li-GIC particle assuming two coexisting
   phases. The requisite force equilibrium uses different Young's moduli
   computed with DFT. Lithium-poor phases develop tensile strains, whereas
   Li-rich phases develop compressive strains. Results from the core-shell
   model suggest that elastic strain should be defined relative to the
   newest phase that forms during lithiation of graphite, and Li
   concentration-dependent mechanical properties should be considered in
   continuum level models.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic textiles belong to a class of extraordinary materials that
   become fatter when stretched. Sustained efforts to fabricate auxetic
   fabric structures are limited. Indeed, several geometrical
   configurations have been previously proposed but none has been
   engineered into functional auxetic textile fabrics. The use of auxetic
   materials has been limited because of problems with deploying them in
   their fabricated forms. Our thrust in this research is to combine our
   knowledge of geometry and fabric structural characteristics to engineer
   auxetic textiles and to determine the properties of such auxetic textile
   fabrics. In this paper, we have presented the technique we developed for
   producing several knit structures in which filling yarn inlays are used
   to effect compound repeating units. In these productions, the chain is
   used as a base structure and a minimum of two guide bars and maximum of
   six guide bars are deployed to produce such warp knit auxetic fabrics.}},

Abstract = {{To determine the viscoelasticity of wood three-dimensionally, a
   longitudinal tensile creep test was conducted on 12 species of wood to
   examine the change in the rate of volume increase (Delta V/V) with time.
   Immediately after the beginning of creep, Delta V/V was positive, and
   during creep, Delta V/V decreased rapidly, then more gradually. The
   decrease in tangential strain was considered to mainly contribute to the
   decrease in Delta V/V during creep. Immediately after the removal of the
   load, Delta V/V decreased to a negative value; thereafter, it decreased
   slowly and finally reached a certain value. The value of Delta V/V
   during creep tended to decrease with increasing density of wood. Also,
   there was a negative correlation between wood density and the rate of
   increase in Delta V/V.}},

Abstract = {{The paper deals with the numerical analysis of foam materials. Open cell
   foam is investigated. Numerical simulations enable prediction of failure
   process and assessment of effective properties of the modeled foam
   structures {[}1]. Metal as well as polyurethane foams exhibit
   interesting properties. They are light, possess good acoustic and/or
   magnetic isolation, have ability to absorb energy of vibration and
   impacts {[}2]. They are used for sandwich panels, hit absorbers (i.e. as
   elements of buffer constructions in rail vehicles), fillers of
   construction parts, bodies of vehicles (i.e. floating combat vehicles),
   dividing walls on vessels and others. Specially prepared open cell foams
   demonstrate auxetic properties {[}3] and shape memory effect {[}4]. Such
   materials are very good for seats in aircrafts, which may protect pilots
   and passengers during crashes and restrict heavy backbone injuries.
   Foams are also applied for filtering purposes. Foams themselves or in
   combination with different types of fillers (i.e. elastomers) or ceramic
   reinforcement may be used for impact energy absorbing panels for
   military purposes (protection against explosion shock wave and
   splinters).}},

Abstract = {{Shanbhag (J Appl Probab 9:580-587, 1972; Theory Probab Appl 24:430 433,

   elements. In addition, we calculate the 5 x 5 Bhattacharyya matrix for
   inverse Gaussian distribution and evaluated different Bhattacharyya
   bounds for the variance of estimator of the failure rate, coefficient of

Abstract = {{Recently, the Timoshenko beam, and generalizations thereof, have been
   considered as models for the vibration of single and multiple walled
   carbon nanotubes. Further, it has been shown that, in some instances,
   nanotubes and nanotube sheets possess the remarkable property that their
   Poisson's ratio is negative. In these cases, the degenerate case of the
   Timoshenko beam problem, where E = k'G, becomes physically realizable.
   The asymptotic derivation of the vibration spectrum in this case is
   qualitatively different from that for the non-degenerate case. We
   perform such a derivation, and we compare the asymptotic results with
   numerical results for values of the parameters for which E approaches
   k'G. The results suggest that the degenerate case is robust, in an
   asymptotic sense.}},

Abstract = {{Experimental study on the damage of hexagonal honeycombs under in plane
   shear loading does not appear to be available in the literature. In this
   paper, shear damage behaviors of five different hexagonal mesostructures
   are investigated with rapid prototyped polycarbonate (PC) honeycomb
   coupon samples and proper design of a fixture for shear loading.
   Effective shear stress-strain curves of PC honeycomb coupons are
   generated for each shear test and the corresponding local cell wall
   failure is investigated. Two different failure modes of PC honeycombs
   were observed primarily depending on the cell wall thickness: The PC
   honeycombs having a lower cell wall thickness induce the plastic post
   buckling, resulting in preventing propagation of initial cracks through
   the cell wall end up with higher plastic load bearing. On the other
   hand, the failure mode of the honeycombs having a high cell wall
   thickness is the cell wall fracture by crack propagation through wall
   without severe buckling.}},

Abstract = {{Motivated by the authors' previous study on flexible honeycomb design
   with negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) often called `auxetic' {[}1], more
   geometric options of hexagonal honeycomb meso-structures are explored
   with various ratios of the vertical cell length, h to the inclined
   length, 1. While designing an effective shear modulus, e.g., G(12){*} of
   1 OMPa, of hexagonal honeycombs, we are searching honeycomb geometries.
   Using an aluminum alloy (7075-T6) as the constituent material, the
   in-plane linear elastic honeycomb model is employed to get effective
   shear moduli, effective shear yield strengths and effective shear yield
   strains of hexagonal honeycombs. The numerical parametric study based on
   the linear cellular theory is combined with honeycomb design to get the
   optimal cell geometry associated with a manufacturing limitation. The
   re-entrant geometry makes 7075-T6 NPR honeycombs flexible, resulting in
   an effective shear yield strength, (tau(pl){*})12 of 1.7MPa and an

Abstract = {{This paper presents the analytical model to predict the effective
   in-plane shear modulus G12{*} for auxetic honeycomb mesostructure with
   sinusoidal re-entrant wall. Also, a comparative study is conducted on
   the ability of the sinusoidal mesostructure over auxetic mesostructure
   for high shear flexure. In an effort to design components with high
   shear flexure, the re-entrant wall of the auxetic honeycomb is replaced
   with a sinusoidal wall. Existing analytical models that predict the
   effective in-plane elastic properties for auxetic honeycomb
   mesostructure are limited to straight re-entrant wall. In order to
   predict the effective in plane shear modulus, G12{*}, for conceptual
   design study, an analytical model is needed. The principle of energy
   methods is used to determine the effective in-plane shear modulus and is
   verified with the solution in ABAQUS. The analytical model is in
   agreement with the computational model with a 10\% maximum error over a
   wide range of cell wall thickness and shear strain. The two structures
   are designed to possess the same equivalent shear modulus and the degree
   of shear flexure is measured computationally in terms of yield shear
   strain. The sinusoidal structure introduces nonlinearity with increase
   in cell wall thickness and shear strain. This nonlinearity causes the
   sinusoidal auxetic mesostructure to have low shear flexure at a high
   shear modulus which is higher than about 1 OMPa. However, it is
   marginally better than auxetic mesostructure at a low shear modulus
   which is 10MPa and less.}},

   targeting flexible shear properties (about 6.5MPa effective shear

   material selections polycarbonate (PC) and mild-steel (MS), and five
   honeycomb configurations. Cell wall thicknesses are found for each
   material to reach the target shear modulus for available cell heights

   tailored with 0.4 to 1.3mm cell wall thicknesses to attain the 6.5MPa

Abstract = {{Purpose - Digital materials are composed of many discrete voxels placed
   in a massively parallel layer deposition process, as opposed to
   continuous (analog) deposition techniques. The purpose of this paper is
   to explore the wide range of material properties attainable using a
   voxel-based freeform fabrication process, and demonstrate in simulation
   the versatility of fabricating with multiple materials in this manner.
   Design/methodology/approach - A representative interlocking voxel
   geometry was selected, and a nonlinear physics simulator was implemented
   to perform virtual tensile tests on blocks of assembled voxels of
   varying materials. Surface contact between tiles, plastic deformation of
   the individual voxels, and varying manufacturing precision were all
   modeled.
   Findings - By varying the precision, geometry, and material of the
   individual voxels, continuous control over the density, elastic modulus,
   coefficient of thermal expansion, ductility, and failure mode of the
   material is obtained. Also, the effects of several hierarchical voxel
   ``microstructures{''} are demonstrated, resulting in interesting
   properties such as negative Poisson's ratio.
   Research limitations/implications - This analysis is a case study of a
   specific voxel geometry, which is representative of 2.5D interlocking
   shapes but not necessarily all types of interlocking voxels.
   Practical implications - The results imply that digital materials can
   exhibit widely varying and tunable properties in a single desktop
   fabrication process.
   Originality/value - The paper explores the vast potential of tunable
   materials, especially using the concept of voxel microstructure,
   applicable primarily to 3D voxel printers but also to other
   multi-material freeform fabrication processes.}},

Abstract = {{(Symbolic calculus and integral calculus, from Lagrange to Cauchy)
   In a paper published in the year 1774, Lagrange used methods which were
   based on the analogy of positive powers and differences, and negative
   powers and integrals, which enabled him to obtain various formulae of
   integration. Then other authors entered into this way. Problems of
   integral calculus played an important part in the development of various
   methods of symbolical calculus and this one proved his efficiency in
   this matter: it made it possible to generalize or to quickly re-find
   former results, it introduced clarity into practices of numerical
   integration, it unified procedures of integration of different types of
   linear equations, it led to the solving of new partial differential
   equations. However the notations and the foundations themselves of the
   new processes remained for a long time subjects of interrogations. In
   the 1820s, Cauchy provided an answer in accordance with his conception
   of rigour: by using Fourier's integral formula, he gave the symbols of
   operation a precise meaning, and thus he dealt with the different types
   of linear equations with constant coefficients.}},

Abstract = {{The present paper deals with the implementation of an optimization
   algorithm for periodic problems which alternates shape and topology
   optimization; the theoretical background about shape and topological
   derivatives was developed in Part I (Barbarosie and Toader, Struct
   Multidiscipl Optim, 2009). The proposed numerical code relies on a
   special implementation of the periodicity conditions based on
   differential geometry concepts: periodic functions are viewed as
   functions defined on a torus. Moreover the notion of periodicity is
   extended and cases where the periodicity cell is a general parallelogram
   are admissible. This approach can be adapted to other frameworks (e.g.
   Bloch waves or fluid dynamics). The numerical method was tested for the
   design of periodic microstructures. Several examples of optimal
   microstructures are given for bulk modulus maximization, maximization of
   rigidity for shear response, maximization of rigidity in a prescribed
   direction, minimization of the Poisson coefficient.}},

Title = {{What statistical method should be used to evaluate risk factors
   associated with dmfs index? Evidence from the National Pathfinder Survey
   of 4-year-old Italian children}},
Journal = {{COMMUNITY DENTISTRY AND ORAL EPIDEMIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2009}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{P>Background:
   Traditional approaches to the analysis of dmfs/DMFS count data pose
   analytical challenges, considering the increasing proportion of zeroes
   in the distribution. The aim of this paper was to predict the
   probability of `caries-free' subjects and the dependence of dmfs index
   on the influence of childhood sociodemographic factors, through the
   application of regression models.
   Methods:
   Data were gathered as part of the National Pathfinder Survey of
   4-year-old Italian children. Clinical data on caries disease (dmfs) and
   childhood sociodemographic factors were collected. The predicted
   probability for Poisson, negative binomial and zero-inflated models
   (Poisson and negative binomial) were estimated using STATA commands for
   count outcomes. The outcome variable in the regression models was the
   severity of the disease (dmfs index), while statistically significant
   variables on bivariate analysis were considered as covariates.
   Results:
   Out of 5538 children, 4344 (78.44\%) had a dmfs = 0. The mean dmfs index
   was 1.36 (range: 0-104). The statistical significance of the dispersion
   parameter (O = 141.6, P < 0.0001) showed the inappropriateness of the
   Poisson model when compared with the negative binomial model. Vuong's
   test indicated that the zero-inflated models (ZIP and ZINB) fitted the
   data significantly better than the others (P < 0.001). A significative
   likelihood ratio statistic indicates that the ZINB regression model
   fitted better than ZIP model (P < 0.0001). The father's educational
   level was significant in both parts of the ZINB regression model (P <
   0.05), implying that the degree of caries experience increases in
   children whose fathers have a low level of education, while the excess
   of caries-free children decreases. Moreover, the increase of
   coefficients in the zero-inflated part of ZINB regression model implies
   that the excess of caries-free subjects increases with the later age of
   tooth eruption. The observed underestimation of the frequencies of zero
   dmfs counts by the Poisson model is a common result when a dual-group
   process is not taken into account.
   Conclusions:
   These regression models provide a useful approach to handling count
   outcomes as dmfs/DMFS index in caries epidemiology.}},

Title = {{Use of injectable progestin contraception and risk of STI among South
   African women}},
Journal = {{CONTRACEPTION}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{80}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{555-560}},

Abstract = {{Objective: This study was conducted to determine the association between
   the use of injectable progestin contraception (IPC) and the risk of
   infection with Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC), Chlamydia trachomatis (CT),
   bacterial vaginosis (BV) and Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) among women in
   South Africa.
   Methods: From August 1999 through May 2001, 643 HTV-1-negative women
   were recruited from family planning clinics in Orange Farm, South
   Africa. IPC {[}norethisterone enanthate (NET-EN) and depot
   medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA)] users and nonhormonal contraception
   users were recruited in approximately equal numbers. Eligible
   participants were seen at enrolment and on four follow-up visits over a
   12-month period; 567 returned for at least one follow-up visit.
   Multivariable Poisson regression models with generalized estimating
   equations were used to compute the incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for
   infections with GC, CT, BV and TV by use of NET-EN or DMPA relative to
   nonuse during follow-up.
   Results: In multivariable models, the use of DMPA slightly increased the
   risk of infection with CT {[}IRR=1.24; 95\% confidence interval (95\%
   CI=0.80-1.94] and GC (IRR=1.30; 95\% CI=0.58-2.98), although these
   associations were not statistically significant. In contrast, DMPA
   appeared to be protective for TV (IRR=0.35; 95\% CI=0.12-1.01), although
   this estimate was very imprecise. The use of both DMPA and NET-EN was
   associated with a decreased risk of BV.
   Conclusions: The use of DMPA among women in this study population was
   associated with an increased - but not statistically significant risk of
   cervical infection with chlamydia and gonorrhea, and a decreased risk of
   TV and BV. Given the inconsistencies and limitations of the data
   describing an increased risk of CT and GC with IPC use, the potential
   risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) must be balanced against
   the risk of unintended pregnancy and its health consequences, especially
   in developing countries. Women opting to use IPC should be counseled to
   use condoms to protect against STIs and HIV. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All

   Poisson regression adjusting for characteristics of index HIV-positive
   and HIV-negative partners.
   Results: Adjusting for index HIV-positive partners' age, viral load,
   stage of disease, genital ulcer disease, and HIV-negative partners'
   genital ulcer disease and nonuse of condoms, subtype A viruses were
   associated with a higher rate of transmission than subtype D {[}adj.IRR
   1.98, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.17-3.34], but no differences in
   transmission were observed between recombinant viruses and subtype D
   (aIRR 1.53, P=0.25). Index-positive partners' age less than 30 years
   (adj.IRR 3.44, 95\%. Cl 1.75-6.78) and viral load (adj.IRR 2.37, 95\% Cl
   1.75-3.21), and index-negative partners' genital ulcer disease (adj.IRR
   1.71, 95\% Cl 1.08-2.70) and nonuse of condoms (adj.IRR 1.94, 95\% Cl
   1.15-3.28) were significant determinants of HIV transmission.
   Conclusion: In Rakai, Uganda, subtype A viruses have a significantly
   higher rate of heterosexual transmission than subtype D viruses.
   Differential subtype transmission efficiency may be important for HIV
   vaccine evaluation and could contribute to subtype-specific HIV
   epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa. (C) 2009 Wolters Kluwer Health |

Abstract = {{An epidemiological cohort study of Cryptosporidium scophthalmi in
   cultured turbot Psetta maxima L of Northwestern Spain was conducted
   along a four-year period. Four different ongrowing cohorts were
   monitored monthly from introduction into the ongrowing tanks (10-50 g)
   until reaching market size (400-1400 g). The association of host and
   environmental factors with five categories of parasite abundance was
   assessed using a multivariable regression framework. Epidemiological
   factors assessed here were water temperature. weight, length, month of
   collection, season, age, origin, condition factor, water filtration. and
   status to the myxozoan Enteromyxum scophthalmi infection. E scophthalmi
   was included into the analysis because it targets the same organ than C
   scophthalmi and it was prevalent in the studied population The
   multivariable analysis demonstrated the statistically significant
   association between several factors and parasite abundance. C.
   scophthalmi abundance was associated (P < 0.05) with age, condition
   factor, season, and status to E scophthalmi infection. Young animals.
   with poor condition factor, during spring or summer. and not infected
   with the myxozoan were most likely to be highly infected by C
   scophthalmi. Inclusion of these four variables significantly (P < 0.05)
   improved the model, compared to the model that did not include any of
   these epidemiological factors. Increasing levels of C scophthalmi
   abundance were associated (P < 0.01) with higher severity of C
   scophthalmi-compatible lesions. The frequency of distribution of C
   scophthalmi abundance was clearly right-skewed and fitted a negative
   binomial distribution, whereas the intensity of infection fitted a
   Poisson distribution. The quantification of the variance-to-mean ratio
   stratified by age demonstrated over-dispersion for 8-16 months old fish,
   although this bivariate association is likely affected by several other
   factors, as suggested by the results of the multivariable analysis. The
   negative relation between C scophthalmi abundance and status to E
   scophthalmi infection suggests differences in the transmission. onset.
   and course of both infections The coarse filtration used in some cohorts
   did not significantly affect the levels of infection. C scophthalmi was
   probably introduced into the ongrowing tanks mainly with carrier fish,
   though the involvement of infective oocysts from the water supply cannot
   be disregarded. Infection prevalence and mean intensity decreased with
   fish age and a seasonal distribution was found. Results presented here
   will help to understand the epidemiology of C scophthalmi in turbot, to
   estimate the expected levels of infection associated with presence or
   absence of epidemiological factors, and to quantify the impact that the
   disease may have on susceptible turbot populations. The multivariable
   model used here is more powerful than the visual inspection of graphics
   for exploring associations in cooperative processes and can be easily
   extended to the assessment of epidemiological associations in other
   population and parasitic diseases. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper presents a study of the laminar flow in a channel with
   longitudinal moving bars arrayed along the channel width. The governing
   equations describing the fluid, which flows along the direction of the
   bar's length, are expressed with double Poisson equations and are solved
   by eigenfunction-expansion and point-match method. The result shows that
   when the solid bars move forward, the fluid flow will move in the same
   direction, and the f Re decreases as the positive velocity of bars
   increases. However, when the bars move backward, a reverse flow will
   occur in the channel, and the f Re is higher at larger negative velocity
   of bars. For a channel flow with moving bars, the f Re value is not a
   constant, such as a classical one without moving bars, in which the f Re
   value is a constant. Furthermore, when the area of the cross section of
   the bar is fixed, both the mean velocities and the f Re values of the
   fluid can be obtained under different velocities and aspect ratios of
   the bars.}},

Abstract = {{Concentration of molecules within the tips of nanopipettes when applying
   a DC voltage is herein investigated using finite-element simulations.
   The ion concentrations and fluxes due to diffusion, electro-migration,
   and electro-osmotic flow, and the electric potential are determined by
   the simultaneous solution of the Nernst-Planck, Poisson, and
   Navier-Stokes equations within the water solution containing sodium and
   chloride ions and negatively charged molecules. The electric potential
   within the pipette glass wall is at the same time determined by the
   Poisson equation together with appropriate boundary conditions and
   accounts for a field effect through the wall. Fixed negative surface
   charge on both the internal and external glass surfaces of the
   nanopipette is included together with the field effect through the glass
   wall to account for the electric double layer and the electro-osmosis.
   The inclusion of the field effect through the pipette wall is new
   compared to previous modeling of similar structures and is shown to be
   crucial for the behavior at the tip. It is demonstrated that the
   concentration of molecules is a consequence of ionic charge accumulation
   at the tip screening the electric field, thereby slowing down the
   electrophoretic motion of the molecules, which is further slowed down or
   stopped by the oppositely directed electro-osmosis. It is also shown
   that the trapping is very sensitive to the properties of the molecule,
   that is, its electrophoretic mobility and diffusion coefficient, the
   properties of the pipette, the ionic strength of the solution, and the
   applied electric field.}},

Title = {{Some Alternatives in the Statistical Analysis of Sickness Absence}},
Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{52}},
Number = {{10}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Purpose Sickness absence (SA) is a commonly used outcome in occupational
   health cohort studies. Without the use of statistical techniques that
   take into account that SA is a recurrent event, the probability of
   obtaining biased estimates of the effects related to SA is very high.
   The objective of this article is to examine the application of marginal
   models, comparing them to count-based models, when the outcome of
   interest is SA.
   Methods By re-sampling the data of a reference study, 1,000 samples of
   1,200 individuals were generated. In each of these samples, the
   coefficients of two factors were estimated by fitting various models:
   Poisson, Negative Binomial, standard Cox model for a first occurrence,
   Andersen-Gill and Prentice-Williams-Peterson.
   Results In general, differences among the models are observed in the
   estimates of variances and coefficients, as well as in their
   distribution. Specifically, the Poisson model estimates the greatest
   effect for both coefficients (IRR = 1.17 and IRR = 1.60), and the
   Prentice-Williams-Peterson the least effect (HR = 1.01 and HR = 1.26).
   Conclusions Whenever possible, the instantaneous form of analysis should
   be used for occurrences of a recurrent event. Collection of study data
   should be organized in order to permit recording of the most complete
   information possible, particularly regarding event occurrences. This
   should allow the presence of within-individual heterogeneity and/or
   occurrence dependency to be studied, and would further permit the most
   appropriate model to be chosen. When there is occurrence dependence, the
   choice of a model using the specific baseline hazard seems to be
   appropriate. Am. J. Ind. Med. 52:811-816, 2009. (C) 2009 Wiley-Liss,

Abstract = {{P>Seasonal variation in the rates of infection with certain
   Gram-negative organisms has been previously examined in tertiary-care
   centres. We performed a population-based investigation to evaluate the
   seasonal variation in Escherichia coli bloodstream infection (BSI). We
   identified 461 unique patients in Olmsted County, Minnesota, from 1
   January 1998 to 31 December 2007, with E. coli BSI. Incidence rates (IR)
   and IR ratios were calculated using Rochester Epidemiology Project
   tools. Multivariable Poisson regression was used to examine the
   association between the IR of E. coli BSI and average temperature. The
   age- and gender-adjusted IR of E. coli BSI per 100 000 person-years was
   50.2 (95\% CI 42.9-57.5) during the warmest 4 months (June through
   September) compared with 37.1 (95\% CI 32.7-41.5) during the remainder
   of the year, resulting in a 35\% (95\% CI 12-66\%) increase in IR during
   the warmest 4 months. The average temperature was predictive of
   increasing IR of E. coli BSI (p 0.004); there was a 7\% (95\% CI 2-12\%)
   increase in the IR for each 10-degree Fahrenheit (c. 5.5 degrees C)
   increase in average temperature. To our knowledge, this is the first
   study to demonstrate seasonal variation in E. coli BSI, with a higher IR
   during the warmest 4 months than during the remainder of the year.}},

Abstract = {{Associated to a square matrix all of whose entries are real Laurent
   polynomials in several variables with no negative coefficients is an
   ordered ``dimension{''} module introduced by Tuncel, with additional
   structure, which acts as an invariant for topological Markov chains, and
   is also an invariant for actions of tori on AF C{*}-algebras. In
   describing this invariant, we are led naturally to eventually positivity
   questions, which in turn lead to descriptions of the Poisson boundaries
   ( of random walks affiliated with these processes). There is an
   interplay between the algebraic, dynamical, and probabilistic aspects,
   for example, if the ( suitably defined) endomorphism ring of the
   dimension module is noetherian, then the boundary is more easily
   described, the asymptotic behaviour of powers of the matrix is
   tractible, and the order-theoretic aspects of the dimension module are
   less difficult to deal with than in general. We also show that under
   relatively modest conditions, the largest eigenvalue function is a
   complete invariant for finite equivalence ( early results of Marcus and
   Tuncel showed that it is not a complete invariant in general, but is so
   if the large eigenvalue is a polynomial).}},

Abstract = {{Patients that are exposed to biotechnology-derived therapeutics often
   develop antibodies to the therapeutic, the magnitude of which is
   assessed by measuring antibody titers. A statistical approach for
   analyzing antibody titer data conditional on seroconversion is
   presented. The proposed method is to first transform the antibody titer
   data based on a geometric series using a common ratio of 2 and a scale
   factor of 50 and then analyze the exponent using a zero-inflated or
   hurdle model assuming a Poisson or negative binomial distribution with
   random effects to account for patient heterogeneity. Patient specific
   covariates can be used to model the probability of developing an
   antibody response, i.e., seroconversion, as well as the magnitude of the
   antibody titer itself. The method was illustrated using antibody titer
   data from 87 male seroconverted Fabry patients receiving Fabrazyme (R).
   Titers from five clinical trials were collected over 276 weeks of
   therapy with anti-Fabrazyme IgG titers ranging from 100 to 409,600 after
   exclusion of seronegative patients. The best model to explain
   seroconversion was a zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) model where cumulative
   dose (under a constant dose regimen of dosing every 2 weeks) influenced
   the probability of seroconversion. There was an 80\% chance of
   seroconversion when the cumulative dose reached 210 mg (90\% confidence
   interval: 194-226 mg). No difference in antibody titers was noted
   between Japanese or Western patients. Once seroconverted, antibody
   titers did not remain constant but decreased in an exponential manner
   from an initial magnitude to a new lower steady-state value. The
   expected titer after the new steady-state titer had been achieved was
   870 (90\% CI: 630-1109). The half-life to the new steady-state value
   after seroconversion was 44 weeks (90\% CI: 17-70 weeks). Time to
   seroconversion did not appear to be correlated with titer at the time of
   seroconversion. The method can be adequately used to model antibody
   titer data.}},

Abstract = {{To address the fundamental question, ``How is the thickness of an
   embryonic epithelium determined?{''} equations of force equilibrium are
   derived and used to construct a theory applicable to embryonic epithelia
   and other labile monolayers, including confluent cultured cells. Under
   typical physiological conditions, the underlying mathematical
   relationships can be reworked into one simple algebraic equation. The
   theory shows that sheet thickness is determined by mechanical
   interactions between microfilaments, microtubules, cell adhesion systems
   and in-plane loading. It also explains the perplexing negative in-plane
   Poisson's ratio observed in some uniaxial tensile tests of embryonic
   epithelia. Thickness anomalies can affect phenotype, and the equations
   make it possible to calculate the degree to which gene expression,
   signalling pathways or other factors must alter the forces at work in
   order to produce a specified change in sheet thicknesses. Key findings
   are confirmed using a cell-based finite element model. Crown Copyright

Volume = {{80}},
Number = {{13}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{A long-standing question is why Poisson's ratio v nearly always exceeds
   0.2 for isotropic materials, whereas classical elasticity predicts v to
   be between -1 to 1/2. We show that the roots of quadratic relations from
   classical elasticity divide v into three possible ranges: -1<v >= 0, 0
   <= v <= 1/5, and 1/5 <= v<1/2. Since elastic properties are unique there
   can be only one valid set of roots, which must be 1/5 <= v<1/2 for
   consistency with the behavior of real materials. Materials with
   Poisson's ratio outside of this range are rare, and tend to be either
   very hard (e.g., diamond, beryllium etc.) or porous (e.g., auxetic
   foams); such substances have more complex behavior than can be described
   by classical elasticity. Thus, classical elasticity is inapplicable
   whenever v<1/5, and the use of the equations from classical elasticity
   for such materials is inappropriate.}},

Title = {{A heteroskedastic error covariance matrix estimator using a first-order
   conditional autoregressive Markov simulation for deriving asympotical
   efficient estimates from ecological sampled Anopheles arabiensis aquatic
   habitat covariates}},
Journal = {{MALARIA JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{SEP 21}},
Abstract = {{Background: Autoregressive regression coefficients for Anopheles
   arabiensis aquatic habitat models are usually assessed using global
   error techniques and are reported as error covariance matrices. A global
   statistic, however, will summarize error estimates from multiple habitat
   locations. This makes it difficult to identify where there are clusters
   of An. arabiensis aquatic habitats of acceptable prediction. It is
   therefore useful to conduct some form of spatial error analysis to
   detect clusters of An. arabiensis aquatic habitats based on uncertainty
   residuals from individual sampled habitats. In this research, a method
   of error estimation for spatial simulation models was demonstrated using
   autocorrelation indices and eigenfunction spatial filters to distinguish
   among the effects of parameter uncertainty on a stochastic simulation of
   ecological sampled Anopheles aquatic habitat covariates. A test for
   diagnostic checking error residuals in an An. arabiensis aquatic habitat
   model may enable intervention efforts targeting productive habitats
   clusters, based on larval/pupal productivity, by using the asymptotic
   distribution of parameter estimates from a residual autocovariance
   matrix. The models considered in this research extends a normal
   regression analysis previously considered in the literature.
   Methods: Field and remote-sampled data were collected during July 2006
   to December 2007 in Karima rice-village complex in Mwea, Kenya. SAS
   9.1.4 (R) was used to explore univariate statistics, correlations,
   distributions, and to generate global autocorrelation statistics from
   the ecological sampled datasets. A local autocorrelation index was also
   generated using spatial covariance parameters (i.e., Moran's Indices) in
   a SAS/GIS (R) database. The Moran's statistic was decomposed into
   orthogonal and uncorrelated synthetic map pattern components using a
   Poisson model with a gamma-distributed mean (i.e. negative binomial
   regression). The eigenfunction values from the spatial configuration
   matrices were then used to define expectations for prior distributions
   using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. A set of posterior
   means were defined in WinBUGS 1.4.3 (R). After the model had converged,
   samples from the conditional distributions were used to summarize the
   posterior distribution of the parameters. Thereafter, a spatial residual
   trend analyses was used to evaluate variance uncertainty propagation in
   the model using an autocovariance error matrix.
   Results: By specifying coefficient estimates in a Bayesian framework,
   the covariate number of tillers was found to be a significant predictor,
   positively associated with An. arabiensis aquatic habitats. The spatial
   filter models accounted for approximately 19\% redundant locational
   information in the ecological sampled An. arabiensis aquatic habitat
   data. In the residual error estimation model there was significant
   positive autocorrelation (i.e., clustering of habitats in geographic
   space) based on log-transformed larval/pupal data and the sampled
   covariate depth of habitat.
   Conclusion: An autocorrelation error covariance matrix and a spatial
   filter analyses can prioritize mosquito control strategies by providing
   a computationally attractive and feasible description of variance
   uncertainty estimates for correctly identifying clusters of prolific An.
   arabiensis aquatic habitats based on larval/pupal productivity.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrogels have been used as substrates for studying the cellular
   processes by many researchers. The stiffness of such gels was also
   characterized previously. However, in most of the cases, these soft
   Poisson's ratio was assumed incompressible and Poisson's ratio is
   assumed to be one-half. This may not be true in many cases, and might
   alter the calculation of the stiffness of the gels. In this study, we
   present equations for the complete characterization of soft media, i.e.,
   calculation of Young's modulus, shear modulus, and Poisson's ratio. The
   method involves the individual measurement of either the displacement or
   rotation of cylindrical rods embedded in the soft media, under the
   application of an external force or torque. Equations involving shear
   modulus and Poisson's ratio for rotation of the rod and Young's modulus
   and Poisson's ratio for the displacement of the rod are independently
   derived. In addition, the displacement and rotation of the rods embedded
   in an elastic medium, under the application of either a force or a
   torque, respectively, were also calculated using finite element
   analysis. These values compared well with the displacements and
   rotations obtained using closed form equations. (C) 2009 American

Abstract = {{We describe a density-based hierarchical group finding algorithm capable
   of identifying structures and substructures of any shape and density in
   multidimensional data sets where each dimension can be a numeric
   attribute with arbitrary measurement scale. This has applications in a
   wide variety of fields from finding structures in galaxy redshift
   surveys, to identifying halos and subhalos in N-body simulations and
   group finding in Local Group chemodynamical data sets. In general,
   clustering schemes require an a priori definition of a metric (a
   non-negative function that gives the distance between two points in a
   space) and the quality of clustering depends upon this choice. The
   general practice is to use a constant global metric which is optimal
   only if the clusters in the data are self-similar. For complex data
   configurations even the most finely tuned constant global metric turns
   out to be suboptimal. Moreover, the correct choice of metric also
   becomes increasingly important as the number of dimensions increase. To
   address these problems, we present an entropy-based binary space
   partitioning algorithm which uses a locally adaptive metric for each
   data point. The metric is employed to calculate the density at each
   point and a list of its nearest neighbors, and this information is then
   used to form a hierarchy of groups. Finally, the ratio of maximum to
   minimum density of points in a group is used to estimate the
   significance of the groups. Setting a threshold on this significance can
   effectively screen out groups arising due to Poisson noise and helps
   organize the groups into meaningful clusters. For a data set of N
   points, the algorithm requires only O(N) space and O(N(logN)(3)) time
   which makes it ideally suitable for analyzing large data sets. As an
   example, we apply the algorithm to identify structures in a simulated
   stellar halo using the full six-dimensional phase space coordinates.}},

Abstract = {{We study generalized linear models for time series of counts, where
   serial dependence is introduced through a dependent latent process in

   the observation is modelled by a negative binomial distribution. To
   estimate the regression coefficients, we maximize the pseudolikelihood
   that is based on a generalized linear model with the latent process
   suppressed. We show the consistency and asymptotic normality of the
   generalized linear model estimator when the latent process is a
   stationary strongly mixing process. We extend the asymptotic results to
   generalized linear models for time series, where the observation
   variable, conditional on covariates and a latent process, is assumed to
   have a distribution from a one-parameter exponential family. Thus, we
   unify in a common framework the results for Poisson log-linear

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: The objective of the present study was to describe the
   epidemiology of reportable enteric illness in Ontario's Waterloo region,
   including comparing calculated incidence rates with published rates, and
   adjusting for under-reporting to determine the number of community
   cases, where published data were available.
   METHODS: Descriptive analyses were performed on reportable disease data
   for 13 enteric diseases collected in the Waterloo region from 1990 to
   2004. Poisson and negative binomial regression analyses were used to
   investigate differences in incidence rates among age, sex, the 15 years
   of data and seasons. Disease-specific incidence rates were calculated
   and compared with the literature, where possible. Under-reporting ratios
   from the literature were applied to estimate the number of cases of
   campylobacteriosis, nontyphoidal salmonellosis and verotoxigenic
   Escherichia coli infection at the community level.
   RESULTS: Over the study period, the average annual age- and sex-adjusted
   incidence rates per 100,000 population were highest for
   campylobacteriosis (49.69 cases), followed by giardiasis (31.87 cases)
   and nontyphoidat salmonellosis (25.97 cases). The incidence of most
   enteric illnesses peaked in the summer. The highest incidence occurred
   in young children, followed by adults in their 20s. Diarrhea (85.4\%)
   was the most frequently reported symptom, food (57.4\%) was the most
   commonly reported probable source, and home (41.7\%) and travel (37.0\%)
   were the two most frequently reported risk settings.
   CONCLUSIONS: Enteric illness was a significant health burden in the
   Waterloo region from 1990 to 2004. Because reportable disease data are
   subject to under-reporting, it is likely that the true burden is greater
   than estimated in the present study.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the static noise margin (SNM) of ultrathin-body
   (UTB) SOI SRAM 6T/8T cells operating in the subthreshold region using
   analytical solutions of Poisson's equation validated with TCAD
   simulations. An analytical framework to calculate the SNM for UTB SOI
   SRAMs operating in the subthreshold region is presented. Our results
   indicate that for improving both read SNM (RSNM) and write SNM (WSNM),
   the back-gating technique is more effective in the subthreshold region
   than in the superthreshold region. The 6T UTB SOI subthreshold SRAM cell
   with the back-gating technique by increasing the strength of the pull-up
   transistors and decreasing the strength of the pass-gate transistors
   shows comparable RSNM with the 10T bulk subthreshold SRAM and an
   improvement in RSNM variation. Due to better electrostatic integrity,
   the back-gating technique (pull-up transistors with positive back-gate
   bias, pull-down/pass-gate transistors with negative back-gate bias)
   mitigates the 6T UTB SOI SRAM RSNM variation significantly with some
   improvement in RSNM. Increasing cell beta-ratio shows a limited
   improvement on RSNM and has no benefit on the SNM variability for the
   subthreshold operation. The UTB SOI 8T SRAM cell exhibits RSNM 2 x
   larger than the 6T SRAM cell in the subthreshold region. Both negative
   bit-line voltage (VBL) and boosted word-line voltage (VWL) are more
   effective than lower cell supply voltage to improve WSNM, and negative
   VBL shows a larger improvement in WSNM than boosted VWL.}},

Abstract = {{Compliant cellular structures with an internal contact mechanism are
   described in this paper. Contact during deformation reduces
   failure-causing bending stresses through stress relief, thereby enabling
   such cellular structures to be stretched more than the corresponding
   structures without contact. Finite element analysis (FEA) is carried out
   to simulate the structure. An analytical model is developed to get
   results quicker than FEA and to develop insight into the mechanics of
   the deformation process. The error in prediction of the maximum
   stretching capacity using the analytical model is less than 7\% when
   compared with finite element simulations. Several materials are
   investigated for such structures. Although the allowable strain of all
   these materials is small, the overall strain of the contact-aided
   cellular structures is at least an order of magnitude greater than that
   of the constitutive material. The contact mechanism and the induced
   stress relief increase the stretching capacity of the contact-aided
   cellular structures by as much as 100\%. Experiments are conducted to
   validate the models, and good agreement is found. A high-strain morphing
   aircraft skin is examined as an application of these mechanisms. The
   results indicate that the proposed skin structure not only increases the
   morphing capacity but also decreases the structural mass by 13\% as
   compared with a cellular skin without contact.}},

Abstract = {{Morphing wings are desired for their ability to reduce drag, to change
   flight characteristics, and perhaps to reduce weight by eliminating
   flap/aileron mechanisms. Development of two generations of a morphing
   wing project is documented. The work shows how a relatively low cost but
   realistic morphing wing test-bed can be fabricated. Wing skin, actuator,
   and actuator attachment development are discussed, as well as possible
   auxetic skin behavior. Aerodynamic characterization of the wing will be
   discussed in another paper. A very simple morphing wing was fabricated
   in generation one. The nose was able to elastically camber down
   approximately 25 deg and the tail 20 deg. Actuation was provided by
   three pneumatic ``rubber muscle actuators{''} that produce high
   contractive/tensile forces. Upper and lower wing skins were fabricated
   from carbon fiber/polyurethane elastomer laminates. Lower skin buckling,
   actuator air leaks, and actuator attachment problems were resolved in
   the second generation. A finite element model of the second wing was
   developed and is being used to refine the morphing wing test-bed. The
   second wing fabrication methodology enabled smooth elastic cambering
   with no buckling or waviness in the skins. The nose cambered down 14 deg
   and the tail cambered down to 13 deg, and is capable of larger
   deformations. Improved leak-free biomimetic actuators and attach points
   now include no metal parts and have higher actuation forces due to new
   braided sheaths and functionally gradient matrix properties.}},

Abstract = {{The zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) model is used to account for
   commonly occurring overdispersion detected in data that are initially
   analyzed under the zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) model. Tests for
   overdispersion (Wald test, likelihood ratio test {[}LRT], and score
   test) based on ZINB model for use in ZIP regression models have been
   developed. Due to similarity to the ZINB model. we consider the
   zero-inflated generalized Poisson (ZIGP) model as an alternate model for
   overdispersed zero-inflated count data. The score test has an advantage
   over the LRT and the Wald test in that the score test only requires that
   the parameter of interest be estimated under the null hypothesis. This
   paper proposes score tests for overdispersion based on the ZIGP model
   and illustrates that the derived score statistics are exactly the same
   as the score statistics under the ZINB model. A simulation study
   indicates the proposed score statistics are preferred to other tests for
   higher empirical power. In practice, based on the approximate
   mean-variance relationship in the data. the ZINB or ZIGP model can be
   considered, and a formal score test based on asymptotic standard normal
   distribution can be employed for assessing overdispersion in the ZIP
   model. We provide an example to illustrate the procedures for data
   analysis. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanical properties of an open-framework structure constructed of
   joints and beam members are strongly influenced by both its geometrical
   configuration and joint flexibility. This paper clarifies the
   relationship between joint flexibility and Poisson's ratio, which is a
   mechanical criterion for solid deformation. and discusses two types of
   in-plane anisotropic structures made Lip of four-coordinate flexible
   joints and elbowed beam members. Uniaxial tensile analyses estimate the
   linear and nonlinear elastic properties of these frameworks by applying
   straightforward joint modeling with multi-rotational degrees of freedom.
   The numerical results show that these proposed frameworks produce a
   variety of deformability dependent on the joint flexibility in auxetic
   deformation with a negative Poisson's ratio, the folding mechanics under
   kinematic indeterminacy, and the transition of Poisson's ratio between
   the positive and negative values. The geometrical and topological
   aspects of the obtained mechanical behaviors are discussed. (C) 2009

Abstract = {{Examples of auxetic fused fibrous assemblies can be found among both
   natural and synthetic materials. In theory, fibrous network materials
   can exhibit negative Poisson's ratios, yet the deformation mechanisms
   and parameters which give rise to a negative Poisson's ratio in
   disordered fibrous materials are not well understood, and this class of
   auxetic materials remains largely under-explored. The potential
   applications of auxetic fibre networks include their use as
   reinforcement in composites. The process of embedding auxetic random
   fibrous networks in a polymer matrix is an attractive alternate route to
   the manufacture of auxetic composites; however, before such an approach
   can be developed, a methodology for designing fibrous networks with the
   desired negative Poisson's ratios must first be established. This
   requires an understanding of the factors which bring about negative
   Poisson's ratios in these materials. In this work, we present a
   modelling approach to study the auxetic behaviour of compressed fused
   fibrous networks, Finite element analyses of three-dimensional
   stochastic fibre networks were performed to gain insight into the
   effects of parameters such as network anisotropy, network density and
   degree of network compression on the out-of-plane Poisson's ratio. The
   simulation results suggest that compression and anisotropy are the
   critical parameters that give rise to auxetic behaviour in these
   materials. We comment on the use of this model to inform the design of
   fibrous auxetic materials across different length scales, and on the
   feasibility of developing auxetic composites by using auxetic fibrous
   networks as the reinforcing phase. Preliminary experimental results
   indicate that this approach is a promising route in the pursuit of
   negative Poisson's ratio composites. (C) 2009 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \&

Abstract = {{Materials with negative Poisson's ratio (auxetic) exhibit an unusual
   property of expanding when stretched in the direction normal to an
   applied uniaxial tension and vice versa when compressed, a phenomenon
   which is known to result in many beneficial effects in the performance
   of materials in various practical situations. In particular, it has long
   been suggested that spherical shells made from isotropic materials
   having Poisson's ratio less than -0.5 exhibit enhanced resistance to
   buckling as a result of externally applied normal pressure. This work
   uses finite elements (FEs) modelling to assess the behaviour of various
   spherical, torispherical and ellipsoidal shells when they are subjected
   to external (in all cases) or internal (in the case of torispherical and
   ellipsoidal-shells) pressures. We find that to a first approximation the
   critical buckling pressures scale lineraly with (1 - nu(2))(-1/2) thus
   suggesting that the critical buckling pressures tends to infinity as nu
   tends to -1, this being in accordance to what was known for spherical
   shells. We also find that the Poisson ratio has an effect on the
   amplitude and the number of buckling wavelengths that occur when the
   shells buckle. (C) 2009 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA, Weinheim}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic systems have the anomalous property of becoming wider when
   uniaxially stretched, i.e. exhibit a negative Poisson's ratio. One of
   the mechanisms which can give rise to this property is based on rotating
   rigid units, in particular 2D rigid polygons which are connected
   together at their corners through hinges and rotate relative to each
   other when uniaxially stretched. This work extends earlier preliminary
   work on connected rigid parallelograms and presents expressions for the
   mechanical properties for all the types of planar systems that can be
   constructed from rigid parallelograms of equal size connected at their
   vartices through flexible hinges. In particular, we drive and discuss
   the mechanical properties for the Type 1 alpha, 1 beta and 1 beta
   rotating parallelograms which were not previously analysed and compare
   them with the properties of the Type II alpha systems. We show that
   despite being rather similar to each other, the different types of
   `rotating parallelograms' have very different mechanical properties and
   different abilities to exhibit auxetic behaviour. (C) 2009 WILEY-VCH

Abstract = {{Auxeticity (i.e., negative Poisson's ratios) is associated with
   particular geometrical features and deformation mechanisms occuring
   within a system. Among the models which have been shown to exhibit such
   behaviour are the `rotating rigid unit' models, in particular
   two-dimensional systems constructed from connected squares. In this work
   we consider such a system which deforms through simultaneous stretching
   and rotation of the squares. We derive the analytical model describing
   its mechanical behaviour to show that the mechanical properties depend
   on the relative magnitude of the stretching and hinging constants, the
   square dimensions and the angle between the squares. In particular we
   show that the mechanical properties of the combined model are dependent
   on the relative contribution of the individual mechanisms and that by
   changing the relative magnitude of the force constants and/or the
   geometric parameters describing the system, the contribution from each
   of the two mechanisms and thus the Poisson's ratio, can be set to
   predesired values. (C) 2009 WILE-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA, Weinheim}},

Abstract = {{In this work, the mechanical and dielectric properties of a novel
   centresymmetric honeycomb structure (SILICOMB) are evaluated using
   finite element (FE) and finite difference time domain (FDTD) models as
   well as experimental results. The numerical analysis of the in-plane
   mechanical properties has been carried out on the full scale and on the
   representative volume element (RVE) model. The FE model results are
   compared with the outcome of a series of experimental compressive tests
   carried out on core structures manufactured using fused deposition
   modelling (FDM) technique. The comparison with the set of results
   highlights the specific deformation mechanism of the repetitive cell
   geometry. Full-wave FDTD analysis as well as quasi-electrostatic
   calculations have been run to investigate in-plane dielectric
   properties. Electromagnetic simulations, over a wide frequency band,
   allow the characterisation of the SILICOMB structure by two effective
   permitivity functions. Effective permitivity functions are frequency,
   polarisation and geometry dependent. Multiple geometry parameters to be
   used to design the honeycomb configurations for multifunctional
   applications are thus identified and discussed in the paper. (C) 2009

Abstract = {{A general expression for the directionally anisotropic Poisson's ratio
   (PR) of cubic materials under external pressure is discussed. It is
   expressed in terms of the elastic moduli ratios, X=G/K, Y=G/W, where K
   is the bulk modulus and G, W are shear moduli, and where the mechanical
   stability criteria are taken into account. The global maximum and global
   minimum PR surfaces are shown. In the X, Y-plane, regions of different
   auxetic behavior are identified, and a straightforward way of
   classifying any cubic material as auxetic, nonauxetic, and completely
   auxetic is given. The domains of the different extreme directions, for
   which the PR shows either a global maximum or a global minimum for given
   X-Y are identified and discussed. There are three extreme directions:
   {[}100], {[}110], and a novel, noncrystallographic one denoted as the
   V3-direction. The main features of the V3 extreme direction and
   corresponding XY-regions are described. It is found that the most
   extreme PR values can be achieved exclusively in the very limited domain
   of the X, Y-plane, corresponding to the V3-direction and for X, Y -> 0,
   the absolute value of the PR becomes unbounded. Analysis of literature
   data on real materials demonstrates that the great majority of cubic
   materials are nonauxetics or auxetics (with the {[}110] extreme
   direction). The materials possessing very large (i.e., PR > 2) and very
   small (i.e., PR < -1) PR values are identified. (C) 2009 WILEY-VCH

Abstract = {{The wave propagation through a material with a granular microstructure
   is investigated. The simplest such medium is the granular, medium of
   equal spheres. The theory demonstrates that for long wavelengths the
   micro-structured material exhibits modes of wave motion that are also
   found for a traditional medium (that is, a medium that satisfies simple
   continuum stress equilibrium laws and no consideration for particle spin
   and moment of inertia of the particles is accounted for). However an
   extra shear wave and rotational oscillatory particle motion are also
   found. The limit of a traditional material is obtained by letting
   tangential contact stiffnesses vanish. Towards higher wave number the
   micro-structure reveals itself in the shear wave speeds by displaying
   strongly anomalous behaviour compared to traditional isotropic-elastic
   medium. An expansion in terms of structural sums (these are sums over
   the contact interaction weighed with a string of branch vectors) is
   explored. The lowest order non-trivial terms (second order structural
   sums) yield basic behaviour, but a higher order expansion (including
   fourth order sums) shows a more pronounced anomaly for wave numbers
   approaching the inverse particle diameter. Yet higher order terms
   capture more information than can possibly be present in a granular
   medium and it is senseless to examine these. The theory is relevant to
   granular materials and granular auxetics. In the latter case the
   tangential contact stiffness needs to exceed the normal stiffness, which
   is not possible for ordinary solid contacts, but can be achieved with
   special arrangements. (C) 2009 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA,

Abstract = {{Elastic meta-materials or meta-composites can be designed to have a
   negative effective mass density at certain vibration frequencies, thus
   blocking wave propagation through the material within that frequency
   band. The negative mass behaviour is generated by resonant structures
   within the material that oscillate 180 degrees out of phase with the
   acoustic pressure waves applied to the surface. As this research is in
   its initial stages this paper describes work in progress in both the
   experimental and numerical domains, and some early results from solids
   containing geometrically, simple spring-mass resonant structures.
   Behaviour is characterized experimentally by dynamic tests of individual
   resonators as well as impedance tube measurements of panel-like
   structures containing multiple resonant elements. The experimental
   results exhibit clear evidence of the expected resonances, and partial
   band gap behaviour. Finite element models of both single resonant
   elements and impedance tube specimens are being developed, and the
   current status of these models is described. Their results to date show
   good agreement with the mass law and qualitative agreement with the

Abstract = {{Stress-strain results are reported for two series of smectic C main
   chain liquid crystalline elastomers (MCLCEs). The structural variable in
   one series is crosslink density; in the other, transverse rod content.
   With increasing crosslinker content, the LCEs exhibit increased modulus,
   a shorter polydomain-to-monodomain (P=M) plateau, and a lower elongation
   at break. Increasing transverse rod content leads to lower clearing
   temperatures and lower modulus. For each series, stress-strain
   measurement was made simultaneously with Poisson's ratio determination.
   For the variable crosslinker series, typical behavior showed the
   Poisson's ratio increased at small strain, rose to a maximum about 50\%
   strain, then decreased with greater strain. For the transverse rod
   series, typical behavior also showed the Poisson's ratio increased at
   small strain, rose to a maximum about 50\% strain, then decreased with
   greater strain. In both series, the maximum in the Poisson's ratio
   corresponded to the onset of the P=M transition. Possible deformation
   mechanisms are presented. (C) 2009 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA,

Abstract = {{The structural and elastic properties as well as phonon-dispersion
   relations of the Heusler-type alloys Fe2VAl and Fe2VGa are computed
   using density functional and density-functional perturbation theory
   within the generalized-gradient approximation. The calculated

   The elastic constants of Fe2VAl and Fe2VGa are predicted. From the
   elastic constants the shear modulus, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio,
   sound velocities, and Debye temperatures are obtained. By analyzing the
   ratio between the bulk and shear moduli, we conclude that both Fe2VAl
   and Fe2VGa are brittle in nature. The computed phonon-dispersion
   relation shows that both compounds are dynamically stable in the L2(1)
   structure without any imaginary phonon frequencies. The isomer shifts in
   Fe in the two compounds are discussed in terms of the Fe s partial
   density of states, which reveal larger ionicity/less hybridization in
   Fe2VGa than in Fe2VAl. For the same reason the Cauchy pressure is
   negative in Fe2VAl but positive in Fe2VGa.}},

   current versus bias voltage behaviour within the negative-differential

Abstract = {{We analyze the steady-state behavior of a general mathematical model for
   reversible galvanic cells, such as redox flow cells, reversible solid
   oxide fuel cells, and rechargeable batteries. We consider not only
   operation in the galvanic discharging mode, spontaneously generating a
   positive current against an external load, but also operation in two
   modes which require a net input of electrical energy: (i) the
   electrolytic charging mode, where a negative current is imposed to
   generate a voltage exceeding the open-circuit voltage, and (ii) the
   ``super-galvanic{''} discharging mode, where a positive current
   exceeding the short-circuit current is imposed to generate a negative
   voltage. Analysis of the various (dis-) charging modes of galvanic cells
   is important to predict the efficiency of electrical to chemical energy
   conversion and to provide sensitive tests for experimental validation of
   fuel cell models. In the model, we consider effects of diffuse charge on
   electrochemical charge-transfer rates by combining a generalized
   Frumkin-Butler-Volmer equation for reaction kinetics across the compact
   Stern layer with the full Poisson-Nernst-Planck transport theory,
   without assuming local electroneutrality. Since this approach is rare in
   the literature, we provide a brief historical review. To illustrate the
   general theory, we present results for a monovalent binary electrolyte,
   consisting of cations, which react at the electrodes, and non-reactive
   anions, which are either fixed in space (as in a solid electrolyte) or
   are mobile (as in a liquid electrolyte). The full model is solved
   numerically and compared to analytical results in the limit of thin
   diffuse layers, relative to the membrane thickness. The spatial profiles
   of the ion concentrations and electrostatic potential reveal a complex
   dependence on the kinetic parameters and the imposed current, in which
   the diffuse charge at each electrode and the total membrane charge can
   have either sign, contrary perhaps to intuition. For thin diffuse
   layers, simple analytical expressions are presented for galvanic cells
   valid in all three (dis-)charging modes in the two subsequent limits of
   the ratio delta of the effective thicknesses of the compact and diffuse
   layers: (i) the ``Helmholtz limit{''} (delta ->infinity) where the
   compact layer carries the double layer voltage as in standard
   Butler-Volmer models, and (ii) the opposite ``Gouy-Chapman limit{''}
   (delta -> 0) where the diffuse layer fully determines the
   charge-transfer kinetics. In these limits, the model predicts both
   reaction-limited and diffusion-limited currents, which can be surpassed
   for finite positive values of the compact layer, diffuse layer and
   membrane thickness. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Clay minerals are specified by permanent negative surface charge. In
   solutions of sodium salts, the Surface of clay is covered by
   exchangeable sodium ions. In an acidic field (pH < 4-6), sodium ions are
   displaced from the surface. This apparent H/Na exchange is conditioned
   by dissolution of alumina, followed by Al/Na exchange. Two kinds of
   published experimental data were considered in order to follow Al/Na
   exchange: the first is direct measurement of exchangeable sodium and
   aluminum in clay, and the second is exchange sorption of trace metal.
   Because of the equivalency of ionic exchange, trace metal acts as a
   probe, indicating the sodium content in clay. These experimental data
   were successfully modeled with use of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation,
   with the assumption that all exchange cations are located in the diffuse

   an isolated true surface wave (ITSW). The ITSW manifests itself by a

   a material exposed to uniaxial tension or compression. The longitudinal
   strain occurs in the load direction, whereas the transverse strain is
   found normal to this axis. Typically, the Poisson's ratio is greater
   than zero, i.e. in tension a material's volume can increase or remain
   constant while the behaviour in compression is vice versa. However, some
   materials can exhibit negative values between -1 and 0 meaning that they
   show unexpected behaviour by expanding transversely under tensile forces
   and vice versa under compression.
   This circumstance can be exploited in applications where parts are
   subject to compressive deformation but which are not allowed to expand
   laterally in order to not cause damage in adjacent components. Examples
   are crash impact absorbers and artificial intervertebral discs, etc.
   Experimental results were obtained from new honeycomb structures that
   were manufactured with Selective Laser Melting from stainless steel
   powder and tested in a universal testing machine under elastic,
   compressive deformation. Thus rules for successful design of honeycomb
   structures with negative Poisson's ratio were derived.}},

   of expanding laterally when uniaxially stretched and becoming narrower

   natrolite (NAT), a zeolite which is auxetic in its (001) plane. Here, we
   examine the effect of external hydrostatic pressure on the crystal
   structure of hypothetical silicates equivalent to frameworks in the NAT
   group. We show that the crystal structure and mechanical properties of
   the SiO2 equivalents of the NAT, THO (thomsonite) and EDI (edingtonite)
   frameworks are highly pressure dependent and that these systems are most
   auxetic at non-ambient conditions, in particular at positive external
   hydrostatic pressures which are predicted to be approximately 2-8\% of
   the bulk modulus. An attempt is made to explain this pressure dependency
   of the Poisson's ratio in terms of the framework geometry and the

Volume = {{57}},

Abstract = {{Background. - Researchers often use the Poisson regression model to
   analyze count data. Overdispersion can occur when a Poisson regression
   model is used, resulting in an underestimation of variance of the
   regression model parameters. Our objective was to take overdispersion
   into account and assess its impact with an illustration based on the
   data of a study investigating the relationship between use of the
   Internet to seek health information and number of primary care
   consultations.
   Methods. - Three methods, overdispersed Poisson, a robust estimator, and
   negative binomial regression, were performed to take overdispersion into
   account in explaining variation in the number (Y) of primary care
   consultations. We tested overdispersion in the Poisson regression model
   using the ratio of the sum of Pearson residuals over the number of
   degrees of freedom (chi(2)/df). We then fitted the three models and
   compared parameter estimation to the estimations given by Poisson
   regression model.
   Results. - Variance of the number of primary care consultations
   (Var{[}Y] = 21.03) was greater than the mean (E{[}Y] = 5.93) and the
   chi(2)/df ratio was 3.26, which confirmed overdispersion. Standard
   errors of the parameters varied greatly between the Poisson regression
   model and the three other regression models. Interpretation of estimates
   from two variables (using the Internet to seek health information and
   single parent family) would have changed according to the model
   retained, with significant levels of 0.06 and 0.002 (Poisson), 0.29 and
   0.09 (overdispersed Poisson), 0.29 and 0.13 (use of a robust estimator)
   and 0.45 and 0.13 (negative binomial) respectively.
   Conclusion. - Different methods exist to solve the problem of
   underestimating variance in the Poisson regression model when
   overdispersion is present. The negative binomial regression model seems
   to be particularly accurate because of its theorical distribution; in
   addition this regression is easy to perform with ordinary statistical
   software packages. (C) 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the equivalent homogeneous uniaxial mechanical
   properties of defective single-wall carbon nanotubes. In particular,
   non-reconstructed defects that can be produced by ion or electronic
   irradiation have been considered. A discrete nonlinear finite-element
   approach based on the mechanical properties of individual carbon-carbon
   ( C-C) bonds has been used. The individual C-C bonds in turn were
   simulated as beam structural elements. Extensive Monte Carlo based
   numerical simulation has been reported in the paper. The results show
   that the homogeneous elastic properties of the defective nanotubes can
   be qualitatively and quantitatively different from the pristine
   configurations. The defective nanotubes show a slight reduction in axial
   stiffness ( Young's modulus), but large variations of Poisson's ratio
   outside the elastic bounds for isotropic materials, depending on the
   locations of the vacancies. The large fluctuations of Poisson's ratio
   can lead to extreme positive transversal contractions or to auxetic
   behaviour when the nanotubes are subjected to tensile loading.}},

Abstract = {{Developing sound or reliable statistical models for analyzing motor
   vehicle crashes is very important in highway safety studies. However, a
   significant difficulty associated with the model development is related
   to the fact that crash data often exhibit over-dispersion. Sources of
   dispersion can be varied and are usually unknown to the transportation
   analysts. These sources could potentially affect the development of
   negative binomial (NB) regression models, which are often the model of
   choice in highway safety. To help in this endeavor, this paper documents
   an alternative formulation that could be used for capturing
   heterogeneity in crash count models through the use of finite mixture
   regression models. The finite mixtures of Poisson or NB regression
   models are especially useful where count data were drawn from
   heterogeneous populations. These models can help determine
   sub-populations or groups in the data among others. To evaluate these
   models, Poisson and NB mixture models were estimated using data
   collected in Toronto, Ontario. These models were compared to standard NB
   regression model estimated using the same data. The results of this
   study show that the dataset seemed to be generated from two distinct
   sub-populations, each having different regression coefficients and
   degrees of over-dispersion. Although over-dispersion in crash data can
   be dealt with in a variety of ways, the mixture model can help provide
   the nature of the over-dispersion in the data. It is therefore
   recommended that transportation safety analysts use this type of model
   before the traditional NB model, especially when the data are suspected
   to belong to different groups. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Materials that possess negative Poisson's ratio are termed ``auxetic
   solids{''}. The out-of-plane modulus of a laminate consisting of
   alternating positive and negative isotropic laminas (semi-auxetic
   laminate) is investigated in this paper. It is herein shown that the use
   of the inverse rule-of-mixture for obtaining the out-of-plane Young's
   modulus of a laminate is valid only for conventional laminates and fully
   auxetic laminates. The Young's modulus by inverse rule-of mixture
   significantly underestimates the out-of-plane Young's modulus of a
   semi-auxetic laminate. It is also shown that under certain conditions,
   the out-of-plane Young's modulus of a semi-auxetic laminate exceeds even
   the direct rule-of-mixture. A correction term is developed herein for
   incorporation into the inverse rule-of-mixture. (c) 2009 Elsevier Masson

Title = {{The relationship between nurse staffing and patient outcomes: A case
   study}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NURSING STUDIES}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{7, SI}},
Pages = {{986-992}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Background: Research has shown a direct relationship between staffing
   levels and patient outcomes for specific nurse-sensitive indicators,
   with lower patient to nurse ratios (i.e. less patients per nurse)
   associated with better outcomes.
   Objectives: To explore the relationship between nurse staffing
   characteristics (the nursing hours worked by permanent and temporary
   staff and nurse hours per patient day) and patient outcomes: pressure
   sores, patient falls, upper gastrointestinal bleed, pneumonia, sepsis,
   shock and deep vein thrombosis.
   Design: A case study using retrospective hospital data, at ward level.
   Setting: A tertiary cardio-respiratory NHS Trust in England, comprising
   two hospitals.
   Participants: All patients, including day cases, who were admitted to
   either hospital as an in-patient over 12 months.
   Methods: Data were extracted from corporate hospital systems. The
   clinical areas were categorised as lower dependency, i.e. wards, or
   critical care which included ICU and high dependency units. The
   relationship between nurse staffing characteristics and patient outcomes
   was assessed using either a Poisson or negative binomial regression
   model as appropriate. We sought to establish whether the outcomes were
   affected by the nurse hours per patient day, the permanent nurse hours
   worked as a percentage of the total hours, and the permanent nurse hours
   worked as a percentage of the permanent and bank hours combined.
   Results: In the lower dependency category wards there was only a weak
   association demonstrated between nurse staffing and the majority of the
   outcomes. The results from the high dependency critical care areas
   showed few significant results with only the rate of sepsis being
   significantly reduced as the ratio of permanent staff hours increased.
   Conclusions: The study demonstrated the possibility of using existing
   hospital data to examine the relationship between nurse staffing and
   patient outcomes, however the associations found were weak and did not
   replicate reliably the findings from previous work. (C) 2008 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials with large negative Poisson's ratios are fabricated by
   highly oriented carbon nanotube structures. The Poisson's ratio can be
   obtained down to -0.50. Furthermore, negative Poisson's ratios can be
   maintained in the carbon nanotube/polymer composites when the nanotubes
   are embedded, while the composites show much better mechanical
   properties including larger strain-to-failure (similar to 22\%) compared
   to the pristine nanotube thin film (similar to 3\%). A theoretical model
   is developed to predict the Poisson's ratios. It indicates that the
   large negative Poisson's ratios are caused by the realignment of curved
   nanotubes during stretching and the theoretical predictions agree well
   with the experimental results.}},

Abstract = {{Elasticity tensor components, C-ij, the crystallographic dependence of
   Poisson's ratio, the phase stability, and vibrational spectra are
   computed for nonmagnetic and magnetic CeMg (1:1 Ce:Mg) structures using
   density functional theory. Results from both the generalized gradient
   approximation (GGA), and the GGA + U, based upon an effective on-site
   Coulomb potential, U-eff, are investigated. The GGA low energy
   structure, with wavevector along {[}110], disagrees with experiment,
   while the {[}100] structure from experiment is predicted as the 0 K
   structure in the GGA + U. Accurate estimation of the 20 K Neel
   temperature can only be achieved with small Ueff, which suggests that
   CeMg is not a strongly correlated system. For all CeMg structures
   investigated, we find C-11 approximate to C-44; this is consistent with
   the near equivalency of transverse and longitudinal sound speeds. The
   origin of this behavior is the negative stretching force constants for
   the interaction between the second- and third-nearest-neighbor Mg and Ce
   ions, respectively. Results are compared with neutron scattering

   Comorbid diseases were also significantly increased according to smoking
   status and pack-years. Current smoking is associated with poor outcomes;
   even lower levels of exposure appear to be detrimental in HIV-infected

Title = {{Is the historical war against wildlife over in southern Europe?}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{12}},

Abstract = {{Most southern European regions have experienced a rapid economical
   change during the last decades, moving from a historical economy based
   on agriculture to a society based on industry and technology. We test
   here whether causes of admission of birds admitted to a large southern
   European rehabilitation centre, during a 14-year period (1994-2007),
   reflect these socio-economical changes. Specifically, we estimated the
   trends in the number of birds admitted to the centre by shooting (S)
   over the number of birds admitted due to impacts caused by
   infrastructures (I), for the 10 most commonly admitted species with
   complete time series available. Species were grouped in three groups
   following ecological traits: raptors (diurnal and nocturnal) and aquatic
   birds. Trends were estimated by means of the slope of a linear
   regression of the log-transformed S/I ratio over time, which provided
   the finite population growth rate (lambda) and its 95\% confidence
   intervals. We used the ratio to prevent possible biases caused by
   changes in wild population densities over the years. We conclude that
   the overall trend in the S/I ratio, as well as the trends for all three
   bird groups considered, were negative, and indicated a c. 10\% annual
   reduction in the number of birds admitted by shooting in relation to
   those admitted by infrastructure-related injuries. Causal relationships
   were analysed by means of Poisson regressions on absolute numbers.
   Importantly we show that despite the direct historical war against
   wildlife seems to be coming to an end in southern Europe, impact to
   wildlife continues in an indirect way, as collateral damages caused by
   our post-industrial way of life. So the overall scenario is most likely
   not one of improved conservation status in southern Europe, but rather
   one of shifting ways of impacting wildlife in parallel with
   socio-economic changes.}},

   are validated by computation and experimental analysis of the harmonic
   responses of a finite structure with 11 x 11 unit cells. The flexural
   wave is localized at the point of excitation in band gaps, while the
   directional behaviour occurs at particular frequencies in pass bands.

Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{14}},

Pages = {{403-420}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{For a crystalline material, Poisson's ratio depends upon two orthogonal
   directions, one corresponding to the applied uniaxial stress and another
   for the resulting transverse strain. Interest in directions that yield a
   negative value leads to a consideration of extreme values and associated
   directions. Another indicator of a negative Poisson's ratio is the Lame
   compliance, defined as the transverse strain response to a unit uniaxial
   stress. Where this quantity is positive, Poisson's ratio is negative and
   it is natural to associate a near minimum value of the ratio with a
   maximum of the Lame compliance. Moreover, the stationary directions
   associated with the compliance bear a clearer relationship to the
   crystallographic directions than those of the ratio. Indeed, many of
   these directions are not dependent upon the elastic constants within a
   given crystal symmetry class. In the case of alpha-cristobalite, the
   maximum value of the Lame compliance is associated with such invariant
   stationary points. In the present work, we describe the invariant
   stationary directions and touch on a few of the simplest
   material-dependent stationary points.}},

Abstract = {{The computational design of a composite where the properties of its
   constituents change gradually within a unit cell can be successfully
   achieved by means of a material design method that combines topology
   optimization with homogenization. This is an iterative numerical method,
   which leads to changes in the composite material unit cell until desired
   properties (or performance) are obtained. Such method has been applied
   to several types of materials in the last few years. In this work, the
   objective is to extend the material design method to obtain functionally
   graded material architectures, i.e. materials that are graded at the
   local level (e.g. microstructural level). Consistent with this goal, a
   continuum distribution of the design variable inside the finite element
   domain is considered to represent a fully continuous material variation
   during the design process. Thus the topology optimization naturally
   leads to a smoothly graded material system. To illustrate the
   theoretical and numerical approaches, numerical examples are provided.
   The homogenization method is verified by considering one-dimensional
   material gradation profiles for which analytical solutions for the
   effective elastic properties are available. The verification of the
   homogenization method is extended to two dimensions considering a
   trigonometric material gradation, and a material variation with
   discontinuous derivatives. These are also used as benchmark examples to
   verify the optimization method for functionally graded material cell
   design. Finally the influence of material gradation on extreme materials
   is investigated, which includes materials with near-zero shear modulus,
   and materials with negative Poisson's ratio.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Injection drug users (IDUs) have estimated mortality rates
   over 10 times higher than the general population; much of this excess
   mortality is HIV-associated. Few mortality estimates among IDUs from
   developing countries, including India, exist.
   Methods: IDUs (1158) were recruited in Chennai from April 2005 to May
   2006; 293 were HIV positive. Information on deaths and causes was
   obtained through outreach workers and family/network members. Mortality
   rates and standardized mortality ratios were calculated; multivariate
   Poisson regression was used to identify predictors of mortality.
   Results: We observed 85 deaths over 1998 person-years (p-y) of follow-up
   {[}mortality rate (MR) 4.25 per 100 p-y; 95\%. confidence interval (CI)
   = 3.41-5.23]. The overall standardized mortality ratio was 11.1; for
   HIV-positive IDUs, the standardized mortality ratio was 23.9. Mortality
   risk among HIV-positive IDUs (MR: 8.88 per 100 p-y) was nearly three
   times that of negative IDUs (MR: 3.03 per 100 p-y) and increased with
   declining immune status (CD4 cells > 350: 5.44 per 100 p-y vs. CD4 cells
   <= 200: 34.5 per 100 p-y). This association persisted after adjustment
   for confounders. The leading causes of mortality in both HIV negative
   and positive IDUs were overdose (n = 22), AIDS (n = 14), tuberculosis (n
   = 8) and accident/trauma (n = 9).
   Conclusion: Substantial mortality was observed in this cohort with the
   highest rates among HIV-positive IDUs with CD4 counts of less than 350
   cells/mu l. Although, in these 2 years, non-AIDS deaths outnumbered
   AIDS-related deaths, the relative contribution of AIDS-associated
   mortality is likely to increase with advancing HIV disease progression.
   These data reinforce the need for interventions to reduce the harms
   associated with drug use and increase HAART access among IDUs in
   Chennai. (C) 2009 Wolters Kluwer Health vertical bar Lippincott Williams
