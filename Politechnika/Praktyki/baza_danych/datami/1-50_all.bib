Title = {{Vibration control based metamaterials and origami structures: A
   state-of-the-art review}},
Journal = {{MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2021}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Vibration and sound control is critical to many practical engineering
   systems in order to minimise the detrimental effects caused by
   unavoidable vibrations and noises. Metamaterials and origami-based
   structures, which have attracted increasing interests in
   interdisciplinary research fields, possess many peculiar physical
   properties, including negative Poisson's ratios, bi- or multi-stable
   states, nonlinear and tuneable stiffness features, and thus offer
   promising applications for vibration and sound control. This paper
   presents a review of metamaterials and origami-based structures as well
   as their applications to vibration and sound control. Metamaterials are
   artificially engineered materials having extremal properties which are
   not found in conventional materials. Metamaterials with abnormal
   features are firstly discussed on the basis of the unusual values of
   their elastic constants. Recent advances of auxetic, band gap and
   pentamode metamaterials are reviewed together with their applications to
   vibration and sound mitigations. Origami, as the ancient Japanese art of
   paper folding, has emerged as a new design paradigm for different
   applications. Origami-based structures can be adopted for vibration
   isolation by using their multi-stable states and desirable stiffness
   characteristics. Different origami patterns are reviewed to show their
   configurations and base structures. Special features, such as bi- or
   multi-stable states, dynamic Poisson's ratios, and nonlinear
   force-displacement relationships are discussed for their applications
   for vibration control. Finally, possible future research directions are
   elaborated for this emerging and promising interdisciplinary research
   field. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Reconfiguring graphene to achieve intrinsic negative Poisson's ratio and
   strain-tunable bandgap}},
Journal = {{NANOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{32}},

Month = {{OCT 8}},
Abstract = {{A new two-dimensional carbon-based material consisting of pentagonal and
   hexagonal elements is identified by numerical experiments, which is
   called phgraphene and possesses not only a tunable semimetallic feature
   but also a direction-dependent even sign-changed Poisson's ratio. The
   structural stability of such a new material is first checked
   systematically. It is found that phgraphene has a similar energy as the
   gamma-graphyne, a thermally stable structure from the room temperature
   to 1500 K, and elastic constants satisfying the Born-Huang criterion.
   Both the band structure and density of states are further verified with
   different techniques, which demonstrate a Dirac semimetallic
   characteristic of phgraphene. A more interesting finding is that the
   band structure can be easily tuned by an external loading, resulting in
   the transition from semimetal to semiconductor or from type I to type
   III. As a new material that may be applied in the future, the mechanical
   property of phgraphene is further evaluated. It shows that phgraphene is
   a typically anisotropic material, which has not only direction-dependent
   Young's moduli but also direction-dependent even sign-changed Poisson's
   ratios. The microscopic mechanisms of both the electrical and mechanical
   properties are revealed. Such a versatile material with tunable band
   structure and auxetic effect should have promising applications in the
   advanced nano-electronic field in the future.}},

Title = {{A nonlinear molecular mechanics model for graphene subjected to large
   in-plane deformations}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{167}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{In this paper we present a fully nonlinear stick-and-spring model for
   graphene subjected to in-plane deformations. The constitutive behaviors
   of sticks and springs are defined, respectively, by the modified Morse
   potential and a nonlinear bond angle potential. The equilibrium
   equations of the representative cell are written considering large
   displacements of the nodes (atoms) and the stability of the solutions is
   assessed using an energy criterion. The solutions for the uniaxial load
   cases along armchair and zigzag directions show that graphene is
   isotropic for small deformations, while it exhibits anisotropy when
   subjected to large deformations. Moreover, graphene shows a negative
   Poisson's ratio after a critical value of deformation. In the case of
   equibiaxial load, multiple solutions of the equilibrium are found and
   graphene can experience asymmetric deformations despite the symmetry of
   the external loads. The nonlinear formulation of the equilibrium is then
   linearized by introducing the hypothesis of small displacements. The
   expressions of Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio are derived. (c) 2021

Title = {{Effect of negative Poisson's ratio on the postbuckling behavior of
   pressure-loaded FG-GRMMC laminated cylindrical shells}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{243}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic materials have emerged to be a new type of novel engineering
   materials with unique material properties. This paper reports the
   postbuckling behaviors of pressure loaded graphene-reinforced metal
   matrix composite (GRMMC) laminated cylindrical shells under the
   influence of in-plane negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) in temperature
   environments. The GRMMCs have temperature-dependent material properties
   which can be determined using an extended micromechanical model of
   Halpin-Tsai type. A cylindrical shell is made of GRMMC layers of
   different graphene volume fractions to achieve a piece-wise functionally
   graded (FG) pattern. The postbuckling equations for the pressure-loaded
   GRMMC laminated cylindrical shells are derived using the Reddy's third
   order shear deformation shell theory with the effects of von K ` arm `
   an-type kinematic nonlinearity and temperature variation being included.
   Applying the singular perturbation technique in conjunction with a
   two-step perturbation approach, the governing equations for the shell
   postbuckling problem are solved. The results show that the postbuckling
   behaviors of pressure-loaded GRMMC laminated cylindrical shells are
   affected substantially by the in-plane NPR.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the in-plane negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) effect
   on the thermal postbuckling of graphene-reinforced metal matrix
   composite (GRMMC) laminated beams subjected to a uniform temperature

   modeling. Numerical investigations are carried out for
   (10/-10/10/-10/10)S and (10/-10/10)S GRMMC beams with in-plane NPR. The
   results show that the buckling temperature of (10/10/10)S UD beam is
   slightly higher than that of (10/-10/10/-10/10)S UD beam. The thermal

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED MECHANICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{88}},

Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{Metamaterials are man-made materials engineered to possess certain
   desired and often counterintuitive properties. It is well-known that
   elastic metamaterials may exhibit unusual bulk elastic properties when
   subject to dynamic loads at certain frequencies, such as negative
   Poisson's ratio, negative modulus, and/or negative mass density. This
   paper focuses on the modeling of a one-dimensional micropolar-type
   elastic metamaterial subject to transient dynamic loading. The
   metamaterial consists of unit cells that support both translational and
   rotational motion and can be modeled as a micropolar-type continuum.
   Interestingly, the equations governing the dynamics of the new
   micropolar-type continuum possess remarkable similitude with those
   governing the transient response of an elastic bar with elastic
   supports. The resulting governing equation is solved using the Fourier
   transform technique. The transient dynamic response of the metamaterial
   subject to an axial impact is then studied based on both the developed
   continuum model and the original discrete model. Finite element analysis
   of the equivalent bar model is also conducted. The results from the
   developed continuum model is compared with the discrete model and the
   finite element analysis to evaluate its suitability. This work presents
   a novel micropolar-type model for a specific metamaterial and
   investigates its transient response using both continuum modeling and
   discrete unit cell modeling. The results indicate that the
   micropolar-type model can accurately capture the transient behavior of
   the propagation of the strain pulse in the metamaterial}},

Abstract = {{The auxetic cellular structures with two different chiral geometries
   (tetrachiral and hexachiral) were fabricated using laser powder bed
   fusion (LPBF) technology from two different materials (aluminium alloy
   AlSi10Mg and stainless steel AISI 316L). The specimen's microstructure,
   porosity and surface texture were observed by X-ray diffraction, optical
   and electron microscopy and micro-computed tomography. The mechanical
   properties of all specimens were determined experimentally with a simple
   tensile test. The results show that hexachiral and tetrachiral auxetic
   structures have similar initial stiffness, whereas the former provides a
   more ductile response with more than four times larger failure strain.
   The AISI316L steel provides for a much more ductile response than
   AlSi10Mg at comparable normalised load-carrying capability. The samples'
   deformation behaviour was analysed with the digital image correlation
   and tracking method, where it was shown that hexachiral samples exhibit
   a lower Poisson's ratio. The experimental results were used to validate
   the corresponding computational models, providing a more detailed
   analysis of deformation behaviour. They allow for cost-effective
   parametric studies and the development of new optimised chiral
   geometries.}},

Title = {{An isogeometric approach to topological optimization design of auxetic
   composites with tri-material micro-architectures}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{271}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic composites, which can be viewed as a type of rationally man-made
   meta-composites with Negative Poisson's Ratios (NPRs), have received
   widespread discussions and applications because of the promising,
   multifunctional and advanced properties. Micro-architectures work as
   building blocks of unit cells to make up composites, which possess
   complex topologies of auxetic multi-material. However, it should be
   noted that a computational design approach with the reasonability and
   powerful capability of optimizing auxetic composites cells-by-cells is
   still in need, particularly for composites with three or more materials.
   In this study, the main focus is to develop an effective and efficient
   computational design framework for auxetic composites with the
   tri-material using Isogeometric Topology Optimization (ITO) method, in
   which a tri-material topology representation model is constructed by
   non-uniform rationally B-splines (NURBS) to effectively represent
   microstructural topology with clear and smooth boundaries. Numerical
   examples are discussed to present the effectiveness of the computational
   design framework, where a series of novel and interesting auxetic
   microarchitectures with the re-entrant or chiral deformation mechanisms
   can be found. The significance of the current work contributes to
   developing a platform that enables a scientific design of auxetic
   composites, rather than heavily depending on human intuition.}},

Title = {{Electro-induced shape memory effect of 4D printed auxetic composite
   using PLA/TPU/CNT filament embedded synergistically with continuous
   carbon fiber: A theoretical \& experimental analysis}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITES PART B-ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{220}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{A novel strategy is proposed to fabricate continuous fiber-reinforced
   electro-induced shape memory auxetic composites (CFRSMCs) by combining
   conductive filaments and continuous carbon fiber through 3D printing
   technology. In the first step, the conductive filaments were
   manufactured based on Poly-lactic-acid/
   Thermoplastic-urethane/Carbon-nanotube (PLA/TPU/CNT) blend
   nanocomposite, and the CFRSMCs were then prepared, composing different
   carbonaceous fiber content with a variety of extrusion width. The main
   aim of the present work is to evaluate the mechanical, electrical, and
   thermal properties as well as the shape memory effect (SME). With regard
   to this, the negative Poisson's ratio effect of the printed CFRSMCs was
   precisely assessed through tensile measurement, and a well-adjusted
   theoretical model was employed for further predictions. Accordingly, as
   compared to free-fiber printed samples, the CFRSMCs exhibited superb
   mechanical properties and rapid electro-induced SME (a recovery ratio of
   94\% under 10 V within 25 s). Moreover, due to tailoring coconductive
   networks by the CNTs and carbon fibers in the printed composites, a
   great deal of activation capability in the auxetic CFRSMCs could be
   revealed by various stimuli and for smart applications. This advanced
   strategy indicates a great potential to fabricate various auxetic
   electro-induced CFRSMCs used in small scale of deployable trusses or
   other lightweight smart components like adaptive energy absorption
   devices and humanscale orthopedic materials.}},

   material with a negative Poisson's ratio}},

Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{559}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{Motivated by the recent experimental exfoliation of tellurium thin film,
   and the amazing physical and chemical properties of various
   theoretically tellurene allotropes, we design a novel and stable
   pentagonal structure of tellurene (SP-type Te), and make a detailed
   comparison with other possible Te allotropes, related to their
   mechanical, electronic and thermoelectric properties. SP-type Te shows
   the higher expandability than other Te allotropes, due to its lower
   layer modulus and Young's modulus. More interestingly its Poisson's
   ratio along x (y) direction is unusually negative (similar to -0.01)
   which can be further decreased by applying coaxial strain. Three-layers
   SP-type Te can turn into a topological insulator (TI) with a nontrivial
   band gap similar to 0.03 eV when uniaxial compressional strain sigma(x)
   = 7\%. Moreover the higher the number of layers in SP-type Te, the lower
   sx inducing its topological transition requires. At room temperature,
   lattice thermal conductivity k(L) of SP-type Te is the lowest in all Te
   allotropes, and meanwhile its peak ZT for n-type doping even can reach
   up to 2.84. Thus if SP-type Te can be synthesized in future, these
   extraordinary properties would promote it with great potential in
   designing low-dimensional mechanical, spintronic and thermoelectric
   devices.}},

Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{270}},
Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{In this study, wave propagation characteristics of the Star-3/6
   structures are studied, and the effects of geometric parameters on the
   wave propagation are analyzed. Especially, Poisson's ratio is studied
   based on the long wavelength approximation of band structure. The
   Star-3/6 structures are assembled to be hexagonal and triangular
   topologies with re-entrant angles. By using the finite element method
   and Bloch's theorem, the dynamic models of the Star-3/6 structures are
   established, and the elastic wave behaviors are calculated. The effects
   of geometric parameters on distribution of band gaps are studied in
   detail. By applying the long wavelength approximation of band structure,
   the Poisson's ratio of the macrostructure is predicted, which is also
   obtained by the commercial finite element software for the comparisons.
   This paper confirms that the Star-3/6 structures have a positive
   Poisson's ratio rather than the visual negative Poisson's ratio.
   Additionally, the isotropic features of the Star-3/6 structures are
   evaluated by the group velocity. The Star-3/6 structures show effective
   isotropic features in the low frequency range. As the frequency of
   elastic waves increases, the propagation speed of elastic waves
   decreases, and the wave propagation gradually becomes anisotropic.}},

Abstract = {{Two dimensional (2D) auxetic materials with large negative Poisson's

   40.50 N/m and the moderate critical strain ranging from 0.06 to 0.16
   guarantee its extraordinary flexibility and moderate ductility. Owing to
   its unique crystal structure, the anisotropy of basic mechanical
   parameters, electrical conductance, and optical absorption are
   concentrated on the CaAs3 monolayer. Moreover, the electric
   field-induced tunability of optical absorption also emerged in the CaAs3

Title = {{Design and development of auxetic structure using a two-step hybrid
   optimization technique}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN MATERIALS AND PROCESSING TECHNOLOGIES}},
Abstract = {{Structures that possess Negative Poisson's Ratio are known as auxetics.
   The successful application of auxetics requires appropriate design
   optimisation. Hence, in the present work, customised auxetics namely
   re-entrant honeycomb, missing rib and anti-tri-chiral has been developed
   using a two-step hybrid optimisation technique. The technique is based
   on the amalgamation of multiobjective optimisation and topological
   optimisation. A combined objective is set as maximum elastic moduli and
   minimum Poisson's ratio with prioritised objective as maximum elastic
   moduli and mass as the response constraint. Initially, an optimal shape
   of a unit cell based on the Pareto front has been chosen considering the
   prioritised objective. Thereafter, finite element simulation was
   performed to evaluate the auxetic behaviour followed by topological
   optimisation using the density-based method. Using the developed model,
   the morphological and mechanical properties of the designed auxetics
   have been compared. The re-entrant honeycomb structure has been found as
   the most reliable auxetics with the highest elastic modulus and auxetic
   behaviour. The induced maximum stress in the array and structure of
   re-entrant honeycomb was 320.7 MPa and 168.77 MPa respectively. The
   results revealed that the developed methodology can be utilised as an
   advanced tool for achieving topologically optimised auxetics with
   desired properties.}},

Title = {{A review of fused deposition modelling for 3D printing of smart
   polymeric materials and composites}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN POLYMER JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{156}},
Month = {{AUG 5}},
Abstract = {{Over the last 10 years, a dispersion of applications of additive
   manufacturing (AM) into various fields has emerged. One area in which AM
   has created a surge of research interest and innovation in recent years
   relates to the fabrication of smart materials, which is fueled by the
   ever-broadening scope of deployment of functional devices. As
   researchers embrace this new paradigm, the spread merits a careful
   appraisal of the trends to understand the dynamics of evolution of this
   technology in different sub-fields. In light of the aforesaid, this
   paper chronicles the recent progress and presents a snapshot of reported
   resources and processing considerations enabling the accelerated
   adoption of fused deposition modelling (FDM) for polymeric smart
   structures. Sections of the review capture reported processing
   conditions and properties of components fabricated with FDM using either
   piezoelectric poly(vinylidene fluoride) polymer along with its
   composites or shape memory polymers/ composites. The review highlights
   applications that range from simple planar structures, lattice/auxetic
   structures, energetic composites, adaptive/shape-morphing metamaterials,
   to thermo-/optical-/hydro-sensitive components. It is surmised that
   while the adoption of FDM in this area has been rapid, more concerted
   efforts are needed concerning the synthesis of smart polymer feedstocks,
   process simulation for defect minimization, tuning of the FDM process,
   and standardization of tests for characterizations of fabricated
   samples.}},

Abstract = {{Pristine germanene is a zero-gap semi-metal, which may hinder its
   practical application in semiconducting devices. Here, on the basis of
   the structural characteristics of digermyl ether, we theoretically
   design a two-dimensional crystal, namely germanether. Germanether
   exhibits excellent dynamical and thermal stability. It possesses an
   indirect band gap of 1.37 eV and a high electron mobility of 2.32 x
   10(3) cm(2) V-1 s(-1). The uniaxial strain and layer stacking order can
   trigger an indirect-to-direct band gap transition. More interestingly,
   germanether has remarkable in-plane negative Poisson's ratios with the
   largest one (similar to-0.2) five times of borophenes and three times of
   penta-graphene. The negative Poisson's ratio arises from the interplay
   of Ge-O tetrahedron symmetry and Ge-4d orbitals involvement, which is
   different from previously reported auxetic materials. All these findings
   render germanether is a competitive material for the future application
   in nanomechanics and nanoelectronics.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the noticeable structural similarity and being neighborhood in
   periodic table of group-IV and -V elemental monolayers, whether the
   combination of group-IV and -V elements could have stable nanosheet
   structures with optimistic properties has attracted great research
   interest. In this work, we performed first-principles simulations to
   investigate the elastic, vibrational and electronic properties of the
   carbon nitride (CN) nanosheet in the puckered honeycomb structure with
   covalent interlayer bonding. It has been demonstrated that the
   structural stability of CN nanosheet is essentially maintained by the
   strong interlayer sigma bonding between adjacent carbon atoms in the
   opposite atomic layers. A negative Poisson's ratio in the out-of-plane
   direction under biaxial deformation, and the extreme in-plane stiffness
   of CN nanosheet, only slightly inferior to the monolayer graphene, are
   revealed. Moreover, the highly anisotropic mechanical and electronic
   response of CN nanosheet to tensile strain have been explored.}},

Title = {{The effect of pore shape on the Poisson ratio of porous materials}},

Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{8, SI}},
Pages = {{1191-1203}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{A brief review is given of the effect of porosity on the Poisson ratio
   of a porous material. In contrast to elastic moduli such as K, G, or E,
   which always decrease with the addition of pores into a matrix, the
   Poisson ratio nu may increase, decrease, or remain the same, depending
   on the shape of the pores, and on the Poisson ratio of the matrix phase,
   nu o . In general, for a given pore shape, there is a unique critical
   Poisson ratio, nu c , such that the addition of pores into the matrix
   will cause the Poisson ratio to increase if nu o < nu c , decrease if nu
   o > nu c , and remain unchanged if nu o = nu c . The critical Poisson
   ratio for spherical pores is 0.2, for prolate spheroidal pores is close
   to 0.2, and tends toward zero for thin cracks. For two-dimensional
   materials, nu c = 1 / 3 for circular pores, 0.306 for squares, 0.227 for
   equilateral triangles, and again approaches 0 for thin cracks. The
   presence of a ``trapped{''} fluid in the pore space tends to cause nu c
   to increase, and for the range of parameters that may occur in rocks or
   concrete, this increase is more pronounced for thin crack-like pores
   than for equi-dimensional pores. Measurements of the Poisson ratio
   therefore may allow insight into pore geometry and pore fluid. If the
   matrix phase is strongly auxetic, small amounts of porosity will
   generally not cause the Poisson ratio to become positive.}},

Title = {{Comparison of Pediatric Otolaryngology clinical and operative case
   volume among surgical specialties in the COVID-19 pandemic}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{147}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: To report changes in clinical and surgical volume impacting
   a Pediatric Otolaryngology division one year prior to and following the
   onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in comparison to five other pediatric
   surgical subspecialties. Methods: The number of clinical visits and
   surgical cases per month for six pediatric surgical specialties
   (Otolaryngology, Orthopedic Surgery, Urology, Neurosurgery, Plastic
   Surgery, and General Surgery) for 12 months prior to the pandemic and 12
   months following the onset of the pandemic was collected. Poisson
   regression analysis was performed for the number of visits and cases per
   season adjusting for specialty, season, staffing changes, and the
   pandemic to determine adjusted rate ratios (aRR) post-pandemic for the
   surgical fields compared to Otolaryngology. Results: A percentage
   decrease in median visits per paired month (-15.63\%, IQR = -23.01,
   -1.66) and operative cases (-19.86\%, IQR = -29.39, -10.17) was seen for
   Pediatric Otolaryngology. Regression analysis showed a significant
   negative effect on the number of visits (aRR = 0.74, 95\% CI =
   0.70-0.77) and cases (aRR = 0.65, 95\% CI = 0.60-0.71) due to the
   pandemic. While many of the other specialties had predicted reductions
   in volume (notably Orthopedics), they all experienced significant
   predicted increases in productivity following the pandemic compared to
   Otolaryngology. Conclusions: These findings suggest that Pediatric
   Otolaryngology is particularly vulnerable to this change in clinical
   pattern, which could be due to a decline in community infections from
   mask wearing and social distancing, and may result in a longer-term
   volume deficit when compared to other pediatric surgical subspecialties.}},

Abstract = {{Oblique impact loading conditions are common in automobile collision
   accidents, which strongly influence the energy absorption performance of
   thin-walled structures. In this paper, a novel three-dimensional (3-D)
   hexagonal structure-filled crash box with better comprehensive
   crashworthiness under multiple working conditions is proposed. First,
   the finite element models of four 3-D typical cellular structures
   (hexagon structure, re-entrant hexagon structure, star-shape structure,
   double arrow structure) are established. The dynamic responses of four
   structures under different impact angles (from 0 degrees to 30 degrees)
   and impact velocities (from 5 to 15 m/s) are discussed. The results
   reveal that the 3-D hexagonal structure has great advantages in terms of
   the energy absorption at varying inclination angles. Second, the 3-D
   hexagonal structure is filled in the crash box in the form of gradient
   distribution. The multi-island genetic algorithm (MIGA) based on the
   response surface model (RSM) is utilized to explore the optimal design
   of crash box. Compared with the traditional crash box, the optimal 3-D
   hexagonal structure-filled crash box increases 18.9\% in specific energy
   absorption and decreases 21.7\% in maximum peak force, which
   demonstrates great potential for applications in impact engineering.}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel lattice structure for energy absorption
   application is proposed that is modified from the traditional
   face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice by introducing a cross-rod at the
   center of the cell. A thorough study is carried out to investigate the
   quasi-static crushing behavior of the proposed lattice through
   theoretical modeling, numerical simulation and experimental tests. The
   experimental specimens are fabricated via additive manufacturing
   technique of selective laser melting (SLM). The plateau stress and
   energy absorption obtained from the theoretical, numerical and
   experimental approaches are consistent with each other. It indicates
   that the new lattice structures have larger plateau stress and better
   energy absorption performance than the traditional FCC structure. Both
   2D and 3D configurations are examined and show the same tendency. A
   numerical parametric study is carried out to investigate the effect of
   the geometric parameters, which indicates that the proposed lattice
   structures with appropriate length coefficient have larger energy
   absorption capacity compared with the traditional FCC lattice. In

Abstract = {{Due to the noticeable structural similarity and being neighborhood in
   periodic table of group-IV and -V elemental monolayers, whether the
   combination of group-IV and -V elements could have stable nanosheet
   structures with optimistic properties has attracted great research
   interest. In this work, we performed first-principles simulations to
   investigate the elastic, vibrational and electronic properties of the
   carbon nitride (CN) nanosheet in the puckered honeycomb structure with
   covalent interlayer bonding. It has been demonstrated that the
   structural stability of CN nanosheet is essentially maintained by the
   strong interlayer sigma bonding between adjacent carbon atoms in the
   opposite atomic layers. A negative Poisson's ratio in the out-of-plane
   direction under biaxial deformation, and the extreme in-plane stiffness
   of CN nanosheet, only slightly inferior to the monolayer graphene, are
   revealed. Moreover, the highly anisotropic mechanical and electronic
   response of CN nanosheet to tensile strain have been explored.}},

Title = {{In-plane compression behaviors of the auxetic star honeycomb:
   Experimental and numerical simulation}},
Journal = {{AEROSPACE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{115}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{In this study, two types of star honeycombs with different cell-wall
   angles were fabricated by additive manufacturing technology for in-plane
   compression tests. Experiment results show that the cell-wall angle has
   no evident effect on the deformation modes, but the small cell-wall
   angle can improve the energy absorption capacity of star honeycombs. In
   addition, the unilateral horizontal maximum strain (UHMS) is proposed to
   evaluate the deformation stability of the honeycomb. Subsequently,
   numerical simulations are conducted to further investigate the
   influences of macro and micro geometric parameters on the in-plane
   compression behavior of star honeycombs. The results show that reducing
   the orthogonal array ratio and length of the ligament can significantly
   enhance the deformation stability and energy absorption capacity.
   Moreover, in accordance with the deformation mechanisms of a typical
   cell, a theoretical model is established to predict the plateau stress
   of star honeycomb under quasi-static loading. The theoretical results
   are in good agreement with the simulation results. Finally, three types
   of improved star honeycombs (ISH) are constructed by adjusting the
   ligament length, which improved the specific energy absorption by 30\%
   compared with the classic star honeycomb. Besides, the ISH-II exhibits a
   stable deformation mode with a significant NPR effect. The results are
   expected to provide references for designing and optimizing the star
   honeycomb structure. (C) 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The double V-wing honeycomb can be applied in many fields because of its
   lower mass and higher performance. In this study, the volume, in-plane
   elastic modulus and unit cell area of the double V-wing honeycomb were
   analytically derived, which became parts of the theoretical basis of the
   novel equivalent method. Based on mass, plateau load, in-plane elastic
   modulus, compression strain and energy absorption of the double V-wing
   honeycomb, a novel equivalent method mapping relationship between the
   thickness-width ratio and the basic parameters was established. The
   various size factor of the equivalent honeycomb model was denoted as n
   and constructed by the explicit finite element analysis method. The
   mechanical properties and energy absorption performance for equivalent
   honeycombs were investigated and compared with hexagonal honeycombs
   under dynamic impact. Numerical results showed a well coincidence for
   each honeycomb under dynamic impact before 0.009 s. Honeycombs with the
   same thickness-width ratio had similar mechanical properties and energy
   absorption characteristics. The equivalent method was verified by
   theoretical analysis, finite element analysis and experimental testing.
   Equivalent honeycombs exceeded the initial honeycomb in performance
   efficiency. Improvement of performance and weight loss reached 173.9\%
   and 13.3\% to the initial honeycomb. The double V-wing honeycomb
   possessed stronger impact resistance and better load-bearing capacity
   than the hexagonal honeycomb under impact in this study. The equivalent
   method could be applied to select the optimum honeycomb based on
   requirements and improve the efficiency of the double V-wing honeycomb.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To evaluate a low-cost multimodal intervention on the
   acquisition of carbapenem-non-susceptible Acinetobacter baumannii,
   Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa by patients in
   low-resource intensive care units. Materials and methods: We performed a
   quasi-experimental study in a referral hospital in Jakarta, Indonesia:
   pre intervention phase 1 (2013-2014), intervention phase 2 (2014-2015)
   and post-intervention phase 3 (2015-2016). The intervention was hand
   hygiene promotion and environmental cleaning and disinfection combined
   with patient disinfection and cohorting. The primary outcome was
   acquisition of resistant bacteria per 100 patient-days at risk, which
   was assessed by active microbiological surveillance and analysed with a
   multilevel Poisson segmented regression model. Results: In phase 1 (387
   patients), the acquisition rate was 4.3/100 days for
   carbapenem-non-susceptible A. baumannii versus 1.1/100 days for both K.
   pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa. There was a significant step change from
   phase 1 to phase 3 (361 patients) in the acquisition of
   carbapenem-non-susceptible strains, the incidence rate ratio (IRR) was
   0.343 (99\%CI: 0.164-0.717). This significant change was mainly due to
   reduced acquisitions of resistant A. baumannii (IRR 0.4, 99\%CI:
   0.181-1.061). Negative confounding was observed. Conclusion: A
   multimodal intervention to prevent acquisition of resistant pathogens is
   feasible and may be effective in ICUs in lower-middle income countries.

Abstract = {{In order to efficiently evaluate and design honeycomb structures with
   excellent energy-absorbing ability, inplane dynamic response and
   multi-objective optimization of negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) honeycomb
   structures with sinusoidal curve are performed in this work. By
   establishing the in-plane impact finite element model, the deformation
   modes and in-plane dynamic responses of the sinusoidal NPR honeycomb
   structures under different impact velocities are detailed studied. And
   the geometric parameters (e.g., the amplitude and period) of the
   sinusoidal curve that affect the energy absorption performance of the
   structure are analyzed. Combining the optimal latin hypercube design
   method with the double-points infilling criterion, the highprecision
   adaptive Kriging models of the peak crush force (PCF) and the specific
   energy absorption (SEA) with respect to the amplitude and period are
   constructed. And then, a multi-objective crashworthiness optimization is
   carried out by non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II). The
   Pareto optimal solution set is gained and the final compromise solution
   is then obtained based on the fitness function. The optimized results
   show the PCF of the sinusoidal NPR honeycomb structure decreases by
   30.53\%, while the SEA increases by 38.55\%. It indicates that the
   optimized sinusoidal honeycomb structure has better energy absorption
   performance than the conventional concave hexagonal honeycomb. The
   results can provide some important design guidance for other honeycomb
   energy-absorbing structures.}},

Title = {{MXene/polyurethane auxetic composite foam for electromagnetic
   interference shielding and impact attenuation}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITES PART A-APPLIED SCIENCE AND MANUFACTURING}},
Year = {{2021}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Lightweight electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding and impact
   attenuating materials are vital to protect delicate components in
   portable electronics. While conductive foams are intriguing for
   lightweight EMI shielding, their impact attenuating properties remain
   unexplored. Herein, a MXene/auxetic polyurethane (MX/ APU) composite
   foam is developed for multifunctional EMI shielding and impact
   attenuation. The MX/APU composite presents a superior EMI shielding
   effectiveness (SE) of 76.2 dB, 31.2\% higher than its non-auxetic
   counterpart at the same density owing to the larger specific surface
   area arising from the auxetic structure. Given its ultralow density of
   0.063 g cm-3, it yields a specific SE of 1210 dB cm3 g-1, placing it
   among the best candidates for lightweight applications. The negative
   Poisson's ratio of MX/APU composite foam also delivers
   multifunctionalities of impact attenuation, reducing the peak force by
   51.4\% compared to a non-auxetic foam. This work provides a conceptually
   new approach to design lightweight multifunctional materials using
   auxetic structures.}},

   harvesting at low-frequency excitation}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{295}},
Month = {{AUG 1}},
Abstract = {{Here, we utilize the auxetic concept to improve output electrical power
   and reduce resonance frequency for the piezoelectric vibration energy
   harvesting. An energy harvester consists of a proof mass and two
   supporter beams with piezoelectric patches, is proposed. Presented
   energy harvester prototype is appropriate for applications with limited
   allowable displacement. Three different auxetic structures are proposed
   and their performances are compared to the conventional plain system.
   Finite element (FE) modelling is provided to evaluate these structures
   and optimize their geometrical parameters and electrical resistance to
   achieve the best energy harvesting performance. The FE model is
   validated through experimental tests in which the energy harvesters with
   optimized parameters are excited by an electrodynamic shaker in
   different frequencies. It is shown that the proposed designs are able to
   remarkably enhance the harvested electrical power with respect to the
   plain structure. The experimental tests show that the Auxetic-I, II and
   III could enhance the output electrical power with a magnification
   factor of 10, 6.7 and 6.1 respectively, compared to the conventional
   structure. The resonant working frequency reduced up to 30.45\%, 19.55\%
   and 27.53\% for different designs.}},

Title = {{Mechanotropism of single cells adhering to elastic substrates subject to
   exogenous forces}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICS AND PHYSICS OF SOLIDS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{153}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Adherent cells are able to actively generate internal forces, channelled
   by cytoskeletal protein filaments and transmitted through transmembrane
   receptors to the surrounding environment by means of focal adhesions.
   Cells also dynamically interact with extracellular matrix by sensing
   external chemo-mechanical stimuli and then inducing formation of stress
   fibres mediated by polymerization/de-polymerization processes which
   continuously redesign the interplay between structural organization and
   contractility activities in the cytoskeleton, so orchestrating selected
   signal pathways at the basis of many important cell's physiological
   functions like adhesion, migration and division. Despite chemo- and
   duro-taxis have been intensively studied in the last years to understand
   how cells move on a substrate, their polarization and reorientation -
   observed during gastrulation, wound healing and morphogenesis - are only
   partially understood. By starting from the evidence highlighted in some
   recent studies that cells reorient in response to substrata deformation
   by essentially obeying a pure mechanical interaction, we propose to
   interpret the seeming overall cells' rotation resulting from the
   reconfiguration of their cytoskeleton - here named mechanotropism - as a
   nonlinear optimization problem in which the adherent cell aims to align
   along directions leading it to minimize a physically coherent measure of
   work spent to deform the elastic substrate while retaining a prescribed
   level of homeostatic contractile force. To do this, the single-cell is
   simply modelled as a finite size contractile force dipole that acts on
   the boundary of a half-space perturbed by applied point loads. The
   effects of fences of forces acting orthogonally and tangentially on the
   boundary of the adhesion medium and encircling the cell are then
   investigated, so obtaining solutions that predict multiple non-trivial
   cell polarizations as functions of number, direction, relative magnitude
   and distance from the cell-dipole of the forces, as well as of the
   substrate's Poisson ratio, with unprecedented outcomes under the
   hypothesis of auxetic (i.e. negative Poisson ratio) materials. The
   results lead to envisage that the proposed theoretical model might
   contribute to unveil the mechanobiological principles ruling in vivo
   cells orientation processes by guiding the design of novel experimental
   strategies and to conceive new mechanics-based markers for guessing
   cells' pathological conditions from their mechanotropism.}},

Month = {{AUG 1}},
Abstract = {{A discrete Lagrangian approach is the basis for modelling the macroscale
   elastic response of a solid material, which can be homogeneous as well
   as a periodic composite. The basic topology is a square ``heuristic
   molecule{''} that is an assemblage of four rigid bodies with a definite
   shape bonded by elastic springs. This is the minimum unit cell, UC, that
   contains all the macroscopic mechanical properties of the solid
   material, object of study. The paper presents 4 unit cells, in
   progression from a basic molecule bonded by 2 types of central forces,
   to a refined ``Cosserat-auxetic{''} molecule that is connected by 4
   types of shear and central bond-springs. The emphasis is given to the
   isotropic response in relation to the value of the macroscopic Poisson
   ratio, and the four examples of UC topologies are presented showing
   their relationship to different materials at the macro-scale: from a
   ``rari-constant{''} continuum, through a standard isotropic Cauchy
   continuum, up to an isotropic centre-symmetric auxetic Cosserat solid.

Abstract = {{The importance of cellular materials continues to increase in
   lightweight structural applications as more industries realize these
   materials are becoming more reliable, repeatable and allowing for lower
   production costs. Among all the common structural applications of
   cellular architected materials, cores for sandwich panels may perhaps be
   the most important one, and therefore, were the focus of this work. On
   the other hand, the fast-paced growth of computational power, in
   combination with the development of software and numerical methods such
   as Meshless Methods provide the necessary conditions to study intricate
   topologies which may offer improved mechanical properties for each
   different application. In this work, two periodic cellular topologies
   which are typically used in the cores of sandwich structures were
   designed, namely conventional honeycombs and re-entrant honeycombs, for
   7 different values of relative density, and tested in two different
   in-plane directions in the linear-elastic domain. The Radial Point
   Interpolation Method (RPIM) is used in this study, for the first time in
   the literature, to simulate the elasto-static behaviour of honeycomb
   structures and provides advantages over the Finite Element Method (FEM)
   in this field.}},

Abstract = {{In this work we present a three-dimensional extension of pantographic

   displacement, as the semi-auxetic property is effectively described by
   first-order stiffness terms. For a homogenization technique, discrete
   asymptotic expansion is used. The material shows two positive (0 <=
   nu(yx) , nu(yz) <= 1) and one negative Poisson's ratios (-1 >= nu(xz) >=

Journal = {{ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS}},
Abstract = {{Kirigami, the ancient paper art of cutting, has recently emerged as a
   new approach to construct metamaterials with novel properties imparted
   by cuts. However, most studies are limited to thin sheets-based 2D
   kirigami metamaterials with specific forms and limited reconfigurability
   due to planar connection constraints of cut units. Here, 3D modular
   kirigami is introduced by cutting bulk materials into spatially
   closed-loop connected cut cubes to construct a new class of 3D kirigami
   metamaterials. The module is transformable with multiple degrees of
   freedom that can transform into versatile distinct daughter building
   blocks. Their conformable assembly creates a wealth of reconfigurable
   and disassemblable metamaterials with diverse structures and unique
   properties, including reconfigurable 1D column-like materials, 2D
   lattice-like metamaterials with phase transition of chirality, as well
   as 3D frustration-free multilayered metamaterials with 3D auxetic
   behaviors and programmable deformation modes. This study largely expands
   the design space of kirigami metamaterials from 2D to 3D.}},

Title = {{Technical note: A preliminary study of dual-tracer PET image
   reconstruction guided by FDG and/or MR kernels}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Abstract = {{Purpose Clinically, single radiotracer positron emission tomography
   (PET) imaging is a commonly used examination method; however, since each
   radioactive tracer reflects the information of only one kind of cell, it
   easily causes false negatives or false positives in disease diagnosis.
   Therefore, reasonably combining two or more radiotracers is recommended
   to improve the accuracy of diagnosis and the sensitivity and specificity
   of the disease when conditions permit. Methods This paper proposes
   incorporating F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) as a higher-quality PET
   image to guide the reconstruction of other lower-count C-11-methionine
   (MET) PET datasets to compensate for the lower image quality by a
   popular kernel algorithm. Specifically, the FDG prior is needed to
   extract kernel features, and these features were used to build a kernel
   matrix using a k-nearest-neighbor (kNN) search for MET image
   reconstruction. We created a 2-D brain phantom to validate the proposed
   method by simulating sinogram data containing Poisson random noise and
   quantitatively compared the performance of the proposed FDG-guided
   kernelized expectation maximization (KEM) method with the performance of
   Gaussian and non-local means (NLM) smoothed maximum likelihood
   expectation maximization (MLEM), MR-guided KEM, and multi-guided-S KEM
   algorithms. Mismatch experiments between FDG/MR and MET data were also
   carried out to investigate the outcomes of possible clinical situations.
   Results In the simulation study, the proposed method outperformed the
   other algorithms by at least 3.11\% in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
   and 0.68\% in the contrast recovery coefficient (CRC), and it reduced
   the mean absolute error (MAE) by 8.07\%. Regarding the tumor in the
   reconstructed image, the proposed method contained more pathological
   information. Furthermore, the proposed method was still superior to the
   MR-guided KEM method in the mismatch experiments. Conclusions The
   proposed FDG-guided KEM algorithm can effectively utilize and compensate
   for the tissue metabolism information obtained from dual-tracer PET to
   maximize the advantages of PET imaging.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JUL 27}},
Abstract = {{We demonstrate that the consideration of material uncertainty can
   dramatically impact the optimal topological micro-structural
   configuration of mechanical metamaterials. The robust optimization
   problem is formulated in such a way that it facilitates the emergence of
   extreme mechanical properties of metamaterials. The algorithm is based
   on the bi-directional evolutionary topology optimization and
   energy-based homogenization approach. To simulate additive manufacturing
   uncertainty, combinations of spatial variation of the elastic modulus
   and/or, parametric variation of the Poisson's ratio at the unit cell
   level are considered. Computationally parallel Monte Carlo simulations
   are performed to quantify the effect of input material uncertainty to
   the mechanical properties of interest. Results are shown for four
   configurations of extreme mechanical properties: (1) maximum bulk
   modulus (2) maximum shear modulus (3) minimum negative Poisson's ratio
   (auxetic metamaterial) and (4) maximum equivalent elastic modulus. The
   study illustrates the importance of considering uncertainty for topology
   optimization of metamaterials with extreme mechanical performance. The
   results reveal that robust design leads to improvement in terms of (1)
   optimal mean performance (2) least sensitive design, and (3) elastic
   properties of the metamaterials compared to the corresponding
   deterministic design. Many interesting topological patterns have been
   obtained for guiding the extreme material robust design.}},

   concrete-A review}},
Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{292}},
Month = {{JUL 19}},
Abstract = {{Plastic due to its versatility, lighter weight and durability properties
   has become an essential part of human lives. The global plastic
   production is growing significantly every year; while the amount of
   plastic being effectively recycled is comparatively low, imposing
   negative impacts on the environment and sustainability. Recently many
   efforts have been made to develop effective means for the consumption of
   plastic waste to diminish its environmental impact. In this regard, the
   incorporation of plastic waste, as received or shredded plastic
   particles (direct) or plastic-based synthetic aggregates (indirect) in
   concrete as a replacement for natural aggregate has been studied
   extensively in last few decades.
   The current paper put forwards a comprehensive and detailed review of
   the previous studies conducted to evaluate the effect of sustainable
   synthetic aggregate replacement on the fresh, hardened, physical and
   durability related properties of the resulting concrete. The difference
   in the direct and indirect replacement of plastic on the workability,
   fresh and dry density, mechanical strengths, modulus of elasticity,
   Poisson's ratio, failure mechanism, abrasion resistance, micro structure
   analysis, drying shrinkage, creep, fire resistance, thermal
   conductivity, water absorption and chloride ion penetration are
   presented in the current paper.

Year = {{2021}},

Month = {{JUL 15}},
Abstract = {{The work describes the out-of-plane properties of a curved wall
   honeycomb structure evaluated using analytical models and finite
   elements techniques. Out-of-plane properties are calculated using a
   theoretical approach based on energy theorems and validated using a
   full-scale finite element technique to simulate transverse shear tests.
   The effects of the curvature of the walls and the depth of the honeycomb
   cells on the out-of-plane elastic constants are evaluated and excellent
   agreement is observed between theoretical and numerical models. These
   curved cell wall honeycombs feature specific (i.e., relative density
   weighted) highly tailorable upper shear bounds that shift their maximum
   values with the radiuses of the curved cell walls at different internal
   cell angles. Finally, it is also shown that these honeycombs exhibit a
   particular topology with a specific upper boundary independent of the
   non-zero curvature cell wall adopted and only dependent upon the

Abstract = {{Miniaturizing piezoelectric devices calls for the rational design of

   anisotropic in its mechanical properties with a negative Poisson's ratio
   in the {[}1 1 0] direction. Due to its non-centrosymmetric geometry and
   semiconducting characteristic, penta-CNP possesses a large spontaneous
   polarization of 4.33 x 10(-10) C/m and significant intrinsic
   piezoelectric response with d(16) = 1.80 pm/V, surpassing the previously

Abstract = {{We propose a novel two-dimensional SnS allotrope (monolayer delta-SnS)
   based on an auxetic delta-phosphorene configuration using
   first-principles calculations. This monolayer appears to have
   outstanding stability as revealed by its energetic, kinetic,
   thermodynamic, and mechanic calculations, and it can withstand
   temperatures as high as 900 K. Monolayer delta-SnS is a wide
   direct-bandgap (2.354 eV) semiconductor, and its electron mobility is as
   high as similar to 1.25 x 10(3) cm(2) V-1 s(-1), higher than that of
   monolayer KTlO (similar to 450 cm(2) V-1 s(-1)) and MoS2 (similar to 200
   cm(2) V-1 s(-1)). Optical absorption spectra, reaching up to the order
   of similar to 10(5) cm(-1), are obviously excellent in the visible-light
   region, suggesting efficient harvesting of solar radiation. Because of
   its unique atomic motif, monolayer delta-SnS presents an unusual
   bidirectional auxetic effect: a high negative in-plane Poisson's ratio
   (-0.048 and -0.068), which is larger than those for many recently
   reported two-dimensional auxetic materials, e.g., black phosphorene
   (-0.027), borophene (-0.04), and monolayer penta-B2N4 (-0.02). The
   bandgap and band edge can be substantially manipulated under strain to
   meet the requirement of the water-splitting reaction. Particularly, when
   pH = 7, suitable band-edge alignments and small overpotentials of the
   photocatalytic OER (oxygen evolution reaction) and HER (hydrogen
   evolution reaction) appear, endowing monolayer delta-SnS with great
   potential as an efficient visible-light-driven bifunctional
   photocatalyst for water splitting.}},

Title = {{Acceptability of an mHealth App That Provides Harm Reduction Services
   Among People Who Inject Drugs: Survey Study}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 14}},
Abstract = {{Background: Harm reduction services reduce the negative consequences of
   drug injection and are often embedded within syringe service programs
   (SSPs). However, people who inject drugs (PWID) suboptimally engage with
   such services because of stigma, fear, transportation restrictions, and
   limited hours of operation. Mobile health (mHealth) apps may provide an
   opportunity to overcome these barriers and extend the reach of SSPs
   beyond that of the traditional brick-and-mortar models.
   Objective: This study aims to assess the prevalence of smartphone
   ownership, the level of comfort in providing the personal information
   required to use mHealth apps, and interest in using an mHealth app to
   access harm reduction services among PWID to guide the development of an
   app.
   Methods: We administered a survey to 115 PWID who were enrolled via
   respondent-driven sampling from July 2018 to July 2019. We examined the
   extent to which PWID had access to smartphones; were comfortable in
   providing personal information such as name, email, and address; and
   expressed interest in various app-based services. We measured
   participant characteristics (demographics, health status, and behaviors)
   and used binary logistic and Poisson regressions to identify independent
   correlates of mHealth-related variables. The primary regression outcomes
   included summary scores for access, comfort, and interest. The secondary
   outcomes included binary survey responses for individual comfort or
   interest components.
   Results: Most participants were White (74/105, 70.5\%), male (78/115,
   67.8\%), and middle-aged (mean=41.7 years), and 67.9\% (74/109) owned a
   smartphone. Participants reported high levels of comfort in providing
   personal information to use an mHealth app, including name (96/109,
   88.1\%), phone number (92/109, 84.4\%), email (85/109, 77.9\%), physical
   address (85/109, 77.9\%), and linkage to medical records (72/109,
   66.1\%). Participants also reported strong interest in app-based
   services, including medication or sterile syringe delivery (100/110,
   90.9\%), lab or appointment scheduling (90/110, 81.8\%), medication
   reminders (77/110, 70\%), educational material (65/110, 59.1\%), and
   group communication forums (64/110, 58.2\%). Most participants were
   comfortable with the idea of home delivery of syringes (93/109, 85.3\%).
   Homeless participants had lower access to smartphones (adjusted odds
   ratio {[}AOR] 0.15, 95\% CI 0.05-0.46; P=.001), but no other participant
   characteristics were associated with primary outcomes. Among secondary
   outcomes, recent SSP use was positively associated with comfort with the
   home delivery of syringes (AOR 3.29, 95\% CI 1.04-10.3 P=.04), and being
   older than 50 years was associated with an increased interest in
   educational materials (AOR 4.64, 95\% CI 1.31-16.5; P=.02) and group
   communication forums (AOR 3.69, 95\% CI 1.10-12.4; P=.04).
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that aside from those experiencing
   homelessness or unstable housing, PWID broadly have access to
   smartphones, are comfortable with sharing personal information, and
   express interest in a wide array of services within an app. Given the
   suboptimal access to and use of SSPs among PWID, an mHealth app has a
   high potential to address the harm reduction needs of this vulnerable
   population.}},

Title = {{Discrimination experienced by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
   males in Australia: Associations with suicidal thoughts and depressive
   symptoms}},
Journal = {{AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Globally, Indigenous populations have higher rates of
   suicidal behavior and psychological distress compared to non-Indigenous
   populations. Indigenous populations also report high rates of exposure
   to discrimination, which could potentially contribute to poor mental
   health outcomes. The objectives of this paper were to estimate the
   prevalence of discrimination among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
   males in Australia and to examine the role of discrimination in the
   association between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander status and
   suicidal thoughts and depressive symptoms. Methods: We used
   cross-sectional data on 13,697 males aged 18-55 years from the
   Australian Longitudinal Study on Male Health. We undertook a Poisson
   regression with robust standard error analyses to examine Aboriginal and
   Torres Strait Islander status and self-perceived exposure to
   discrimination in the past 2 years as correlates of recent suicidal
   ideation. We used zero-inflated negative binomial regression to assess
   Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander status and self-perceived exposure
   to discrimination as correlates of recent depressive symptoms. Results:
   Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander males have a twofold higher
   prevalence of self-perceived discrimination (39.2\% vs 19.3\%, p <
   0.001), suicidal ideation (21.8\% vs 9.4\%, p < 0.001) and moderate or
   worse depressive symptoms (24.0\% vs 12.2\%, p < 0.001) as compared to
   their non-Indigenous counterparts. After adjusting for sociodemographics
   and substance use, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander status was
   significantly associated with suicidal thoughts (odds ratio = 1.49, p =
   0.019) and depressive symptoms (prevalence rate ratio = 1.19, p =
   0.018). About 15.3\% and 28.7\% of the association between Aboriginal
   and Torres Strait Islander status and suicidal thoughts and depressive
   symptoms, respectively, was explained by discrimination. Conclusion: Our
   analyses add to evidence that discrimination is a contributor to mental
   health disparities between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander and
   non-Indigenous populations in Australia. Reducing discrimination ought
   to be considered as part of strategies to improve the social and
   emotional well-being of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.}},

Title = {{Evolution of twinning during cyclic loading of magnesium alloy examined
   by quasi-in-situ EBSD}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES
   MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{820}},
Month = {{JUL 13}},
Abstract = {{Most complex engineering components experience varied loading in use. We
   conducted successive experiments of cyclic tensile deformation followed
   by electron-backscattered diffraction imaging of the same area on each
   of several magnesium alloy (ZM) sample to investigate the microstructure
   and texture evolution during cyclic loading. In this way we correlated
   the evolving deformed microstructure of cyclically loaded magnesium to
   the initial grain orientations. To investigate the effects of the strain
   path, the behaviour of samples with and without pre-compression was
   compared. Twins can propagate from grain to grain and twin chains will
   form in the material without any pre-deformation. Twin chains are a
   result of twin transmission at grain boundaries and twin transmission
   frequency decreases with increasing grain boundary angles. In the
   absence of pre-compression, the extension twin fraction rises from 0.003
   to 0.019 after two cycles of tensile loading to a strain of 0.03, after
   which it changes only slightly as strain is increased. Twin chains in
   the pre-compressed specimen are activated without any obvious dependence
   on the matrix orientation. The fraction of extension twinning is 0.2 for
   the precompressed specimen. After a cycle of tensile loading to a total
   plastic strain of 0.015, 90\% of the extension twins undergo detwinning.
   The detwinning starts just after reverse loading. Secondary twins
   forming within primary twin interfaces start to nucleate in the
   microstructure of the pre-compressed material at an early stage (at
   plastic strain values of 0.056). This is different from the nucleation
   of secondary twins in the material without pre-compression that occurs
   at a strain of 0.104. The early formation of secondary twinning is due
   to the presence of residual primary twins in the microstructure of the
   pre-compressed material as a result of detwinning of the initial twins.}},

Abstract = {{Honeycomb is considered an excellent structural material because of its
   high strength and shear rigidity, excellent energy absorbing property,
   high impact strength, lower weight, high crushing stress, and almost
   constant crushing force. Honeycomb being a cellular solid is a
   well-known core used to build a sandwich structure while making
   structural composites. Because of this excellent mechanical performance,
   honeycombs are frequently used in the aircraft industry as a core of
   sandwich panels and in the automotive industry as efficient impact
   attenuators. The hollow spaces in the honeycomb structure reduce weight
   but also ensure required strength, provided they are designed correctly.
   3D woven honeycomb composite has a promising future in the lightweight
   application areas and can be the real substitutes for aluminum and other
   metal alloys as these structures provide structural integrity. In this
   review, the basic concept of textile-based 3D woven honeycomb
   composites, engineering design, manufacturing process,
   structure-properties relationship, and applications of 3D woven
   honeycomb fabrics and their composites are discussed in detail.
   Geometrical modeling of 3D woven honeycomb fabric and theoretical
   analysis of impact, flexural, and compression behavior of their
   composites are summarized to appreciate the potential advantages of
   textile-based honeycomb structural composites.}},

Journal = {{TRANSPORT IN POROUS MEDIA}},
Abstract = {{This work proposes a novel two-dimensional (2D) graded core with
   anti-tetrachiral cells and evaluates the numerical vibroacoustic
   response of sandwich panels with these particular cores. First, a
   homogenization scheme is utilized to model the sandwich structure,
   followed by a modal analysis of the homogenized model in the frequency
   range of 0-200 Hz. The results have been compared with those obtained
   from an exact and full-scale finite element model of the sandwich
   structure. A general good agreement has been observed for the first six
   natural frequencies. Next, the radiated sound power level in the
   frequency band of 0-200 Hz is calculated and minimized for different
   geometry parameters of the sandwich structure. A hybrid design
   optimization approach using method of moving asymptotes and genetic
   algorithm is used. The optimized 2D gradient configurations show a
   significant 78\% reduction of the normalized radiated sound power level
   and a 15\% increase of the fundamental frequency, compared to the

Journal = {{MECCANICA}},
Abstract = {{A homogenization methodology for the construction of effective Cosserat
   substitution media for heterogeneous materials is proposed, combining a
   variational principle in linear elasticity with the extended Hill-Mandel
   lemma accounting for the introduced generalized kinematics. A general
   methodology is proposed which can be applied to a wide class of
   architected materials exhibiting such micropolar chiral effects. The
   tensors of effective micropolar moduli are formulated as integrals over
   a representative unit cell utilizing of the displacement localization
   operators, solution of classical and higher-order unit cell problems.
   The proposed method delivers size-independent higher-order effective
   moduli. The effective micropolar moduli of periodic lattice materials
   endowed with chirality and non-centrosymmetry are computed as an
   application of the developed homogenization method. The homogenized
   model is validated by comparing the local and global mechanical
   responses of fully resolved networks with those of plates and macrobeams
   architected with tetrachiral or anti-tetrachiral lattices.}},

Abstract = {{A novel negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) foam-filled corrugated tube, made
   up of a corrugated tube and NPR isotropic foam core, is established by
   the finite element method. The 3D NPR isotropic foam core is achieved by
   using the triaxial compression method on a cubic Voronoi model, which is
   created based on the Voronoi tessellation technique. The triaxial
   compression ratio is defined as eta. The Poisson's ratio of Voronoi foam
   decreases sharply and then increases gradually with an increasing eta. A
   minimum Poisson's ratio, -0.076, is obtained when eta = 0.2. Moreover,
   the Voronoi foam-filled corrugated tube with minimum Poisson's ratio
   foam core exhibits the highest energy absorption capacity, which is
   10.8\% higher than that of the Voronoi foam-filled corrugated tubes with
   uncompressed foam core.}},
