Title = {{Multipolar resonance and bandgap formation mechanism of star-shaped
   lattice structure}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{193}},
Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{The star-shaped lattice structure is recognized as a typical auxetic
   metamaterial. Unlike the most research focused on the negative Poisson's
   ratio, in this paper the wave propagation behaviour and vibration
   attenuation mechanism of the periodic star-shaped lattice structure are
   studied based on the analytical 16 degrees of freedom (DOF) discrete
   mass-spring model. The dispersion relation and bandgaps of the 16 DOF
   mass-spring model are derived based on lattice dynamics. The dependence
   of the bandgap boundaries on the parameters of configuration angle,
   stiffness, and mass are studied accordingly. It is noteworthy that the
   eigenstate modes investigation reveals that the bandgaps attribute to
   the hybridization of the monopole, dipole, quadrupole, and rotational
   resonance, which is only noticed in multiphase hybrid metamaterials
   before. Most importantly, though examining the eigenstate modes of the
   degeneration points, the low-frequency bandgap between the acoustic and
   optical dispersion curves is opened by tuning the dominant parameters.
   The response of the finite periodic star-shaped lattice shows the
   frequency ranges with high attenuation agree well with complete bandgaps
   predicted by dispersion relation. The star-shaped lattice shows a very
   unique anisotropic solid when the slope of the dispersion curve is
   negative.}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic chiral structures consisting of circular ring nodes and
   tangentially connected ligaments are engineered systems that exhibit
   excellent flexibility, vibration attenuation, impact resistance
   performances. In this paper, the out-of-plane dynamic crash behaviors of
   anti-tetrachiral, hexachiral and hierarchical chiral structures are
   studied. The energy absorption efficiency, plateau stress, peak stress
   of chiral structures with different ligament length, node radius,
   ligament thickness and level of structural hierarchy under different
   external crashing conditions are compared, and identical mass per area
   of different unit cell configurations are assumed. It is found that
   anti-tetrachiral structure is able to generate higher plateau stress and
   better energy absorption efficiency than hexachiral structures. Making
   use of the mechanical benefits of structural hierarchy, novel
   hierarchical chiral structures are proposed for improving the crash
   energy absorption abilities of chiral structures, and relations between
   crash energy absorption performances and unit cell geometries are
   explored, such as: energy absorption efficiency, plateau stress of
   chiral structures. Based on systematical analysis, optimized chiral and
   hierarchical chiral cellular structure can be designed for impact energy
   absorption in protective sandwich structures.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper considers a particular generalized inverse trinomial
   distribution which may be regarded as the convolution of binomial and
   negative distributions for the statistical analysis of count data. This
   distribution has the flexibility to cater for under-, equi- and
   over-dispersion in the data. Some basic and probabilistic properties and
   tail approximation of the distribution have been derived. Conditions for
   the numerical stability of the two-term probability recurrence formula
   have also been examined to facilitate computation. For the purpose of
   statistical analysis, test of hypothesis for equi-dispersion by the
   score and likelihood ratio tests and simulation study of their power,
   parameter estimation by maximum likelihood and a probability generating
   function based methods have been considered. The versatility of the
   distribution is illustrated by its application to real biological data
   sets which exhibit under and over dispersion. It is shown that the
   distribution fits better than the well-known generalized Poisson and
   COM-Poisson distributions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We present an analytical model to investigate the mechanics of
   2-dimensional lattices composed of elastic beams of non-uniform
   cross-section. Our approach is based on reducing a lattice to a single
   beam subject to the action of a set of linear and torsional springs,
   thus allowing the problem to be solved through a transfer matrix method.
   We show a non-trivial region of design space that yields materials with
   short wavelength modes (closely associated with auxetic behaviour) for
   strains greater than that required to trigger elastic instability. The
   critical loading required to make this transition from long to short
   wavelength buckling modes is calculated. Furthermore, we present lattice
   parameters that provide direction-dependent deformation modes offering
   great tailorability of the mechanical properties of finite size
   lattices. Not only is our analytical formulation in good agreement with
   the finite element simulation results, but it provides an insight into
   the role of the interplay between structure and elastic instability, and
   gives an efficient methodology to pursue questions of rational design in
   the field of mechanical metamaterials. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Volume = {{28}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Based on previous research results, this paper investigated the
   influence of fracture morphology on mechanical properties and failure
   modes of rock mass with two diagonal intersected fractures. This study
   carried out a series of triaxial compression tests on rock-like
   specimens with two crossed fractures under negative temperature,
   concluded the following conclusions. The strength and failure modes of
   rock mass are significantly influenced by the dips of two crossed
   fractures. The strength of rock mass with two fractures cannot simply be
   estimated using the method that was developed for the rock mass with a
   single fracture. When the intersecting angle is less than 30 degrees,
   the failure plane initiates at the tip of ``artificial ruptures{''} and
   extends to the upper and lower ends of the specimen. In case of a higher
   dip and intersecting angle ranging from 30 degrees to 60 degrees, the
   failure plane propagates along one of these two fractures. The
   mechanical parameters of rock mass are not only related to the trace
   length, but also depend on the trace length ratio. One could roughly
   calculate the strength parameters using the approximation proposed in
   this paper. For the rock mass with a trace length ratio <0.3 (short
   trace length/long trace length), the failure mode is dependent on the
   fracture with a longer trace length. When the trace length becomes
   significant and the trace length ratio approximates to 1, the failure
   plane propagates along two fractures, where an X-shaped failure pattern
   is presented. For the rock mass with moderate fractures and a trace
   length ratio of approximately 1, the failure mode is independent on
   fractures, which is similar to the damage pattern of intact rock. The
   strength and elastic modulus of rock mass decrease with the increase of
   spacing between fractures, while Poisson's ratio is independent on the
   spacing. The failure mode can be determined by the area of triangle
   created by two fractures. Damage occurs at the smaller triangle area
   first, and propagates with the two sides of the larger triangle. (C)

Title = {{Experiments on ageing effect of gypsum rock induced by water}},
Journal = {{ROCK AND SOIL MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{2124+}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{To investigate the water-induced ageing effect on gypsum rock, different
   water environment conditions were simulated in the laboratory, including
   different air humidity conditions and saturated groundwater conditions
   which may exist in the gypsum mines. Mechanical parameters of gypsum
   rock specimens were obtained under the pre-set conditions for different
   times. Meanwhile, the variation of pore structure in gypsum rock
   specimens was measured by nuclear magnetic resonance equipment. Then,
   the water-induced ageing mechanism of the gypsum rock was revealed. The
   results showed that the effect of water on the ageing of gypsum rock was
   obvious. Firstly, the ageing extent of gypsum rock increased with time,
   whereas mechanical parameters including uniaxial compressive strength,
   Brazilian tensile strength and elastic modulus decreased with time in a
   negative exponential relation. However, the Poisson's ratio of gypsum
   rock had no clear relation with time. Secondly, the ageing extent and
   ageing rate of gypsum rock were closely related to the state of water.
   The higher the relative humidity was, the more pronounced the ageing
   extent was and the faster the ageing rate was. In particular, the ageing
   extent of gypsum rock was the most significant and its ageing rate was
   also the fastest when fully submerged in water. Generally, the
   water-induced ageing mechanism of gypsum rock was caused by the coupling
   of physical and chemical effects of water, and the chemical effect was
   the primary cause for the ageing effect. When the gypsum rock was
   exposed to water, the continuous dissolution and recrystallisation of
   the gypsum rock changed the mineral composition of the gypsum rock. As a
   result, the rock structure became loose, the porosity increased, and
   mechanical properties gradually weakened. The research results provide
   references for designing the gypsum mining and the evaluation of the
   long-term stability of gypsum goaf.}},

Abstract = {{With the consideration of the randomness of complex geologic parameters
   for ultra-deep wells, an uncertainty analysis method is presented for
   the extrusion load on casing in ultra-deep wells through complex
   formation at a certain confidence level. Based on the extrusion load
   model for casing in ultra-deep wells and the prerequisite of integrity
   of formation-cement ring-casing, the probability and statistics theory
   are introduced and the sensitivity analysis on the uncertainty of
   extrusion load on casing is conducted. The distribution types of each
   formation parameters are determined statistically. The distribution type
   and distribution function of the extrusion load on casing are derived.
   Then, the uncertainty analysis of the extrusion load on casing is
   carried out on several ultra-deep wells in Shanqian block as case study.
   Several conclusions are made regarding to the field trial result. The
   randomness of formation elasticity modulus and formation Poisson's ratio
   are the main influence factors. The equivalent density profile of
   extrusion load on casing in ultra-deep wells is a confidence interval
   with a certain confidence level, rather than a single curve; the higher
   the confidence level is, the larger the bandwidth of the confidence
   interval of equivalent density profile becomes, and the larger the range
   of uncertainty interval becomes. Compared with the result of uncertainty
   analysis, an error exists in the result of traditional single valued
   calculation method. The error varies with different casing program and
   can be either positive or negative. The application of uncertainty
   analysis of extrusion load on casing provides proof for the accurate
   determination of casing collapse safety factor. Thus, the over
   engineering design or under engineering design as a result of tradition
   casing design will be avoided.}},

Abstract = {{The observed variability between mortality or morbidity rates in
   epidemiologic studies is partly due to random fluctuations. The same is
   true for rate ratios relative to reference rates. A method for
   estimating the distribution of true rate ratios is applied to a data set
   of perinatal mortality in 515 small areas in the North West Thames
   Health Region, England, in the period 1986-1990. Combining the random
   Poisson variability with the assumption that the true rate ratios are
   drawn from a gamma distribution (a family of positive unimodal
   distributions) produces a negative binomial lag-likelihood for the
   dispersion parameter of the gamma. The maximum likelihood estimate of
   this parameter and its confidence interval are then found via direct
   numerical methods; alternatively, the hypothesis of no heterogeneity is
   tested by a likelihood ratio. The standardized mortality ratios (SMRs)
   for the data have an empirical distribution with 5th percentile at 0 and
   95th percentile at 1.92, but their true variability, as described by the
   5th to 95th percentiles of the fitted gamma distribution, is from 0.72
   to 1.32. The likelihood ratio test confirmed this result, rejecting the
   hypothesis that the true rates are homogeneous (p = 0.015). The method
   requires only modest computing resources and is useful when assessing
   the need for more detailed study.}},

Title = {{A finite strain non-parametric hyperelastic extension of the classical
   phenomenological theory for orthotropic compressible composites}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITES PART B-ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{212}},
Month = {{MAY 1}},
Abstract = {{The phenomenological linear theory of orthotropic compressible materials
   is employed systematically in the engineering and scientific analysis of
   a large scope of bulk and composite materials. However, at finite
   elastic strains, multiscale and fiber-based parametric models are
   typically employed, which material parameters are fitted to macroscopic
   experimental data using optimization procedures. Phenomenological
   extensions of the linear theory capable of effectively modelling such a
   large scope of materials are not available. What we present in this work
   is a simple extension of the linear theory to finite strains such that
   at every deformation level, the infinitesimal theory is fully recovered.
   The model is based in non-parametric spline complementary energies
   employing an energy decomposition compatible with the classical
   infinitesimal expression at all strain levels. No material parameter is
   explicitly involved because the spline-based stress energies are
   numerically computed (not fitted) directly from experimental data. We
   show the applicability of the model to capture (1) the behavior of
   orthotropic bimodulus materials consistent with hyperelasticity (a novel
   formulation also presented herein), (2) orthotropic auxetic foams, and
   (3) composites at finite strains.}},

   elastic constants were found to be similar to values obtained for
   typical monomers, albeit with a slightly enhanced ratio K-33/K-11 and
   reduced ratio K-11/K-22 especially near the transition temperature. The

   (68.5\%) reported experiencing homelessness. Homeless PWID were more
   likely than those who were not to be younger age, white, unemployed,

Title = {{Enhanced compressive plasticity in a Cu-Zr-Al - Based metallic glass
   composite}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{782}},
Pages = {{59-68}},
Month = {{APR 25}},
Abstract = {{One possible key to improve plasticity in a CuZrAl bulk metallic glass
   is to introduce soft metallic crystalline particles. Tantalum particles
   with two different geometries were chosen in the present work: (i)
   irregularly shaped particles of equivalent average diameter of 45 mu m
   (Ta-1) and (ii) spherical particles of average size 25 microns (Ta-2).
   When the volume fraction of tantalum goes from 0\% to 50\%, the modulus
   increases (from 95 GPa to 140 GPa), the Poisson's ratio decreases only
   slightly (from 0.37 to 0.35) and the hardness decreases regularly (from
   485 HV30 to about 300 HV30), whatever the particles size. All these
   results are in agreement with simple laws of mixtures, involving only
   the volume fraction of the second phase. The results obtained during the
   compression tests are more complicated. The yield strength decreases
   when the Ta content exceeds 20\% in volume. This evolution is identical
   for both types of particles. Similarly, an increase in plasticity is
   always observed when the tantalum content exceeds about 10\% in volume.
   For the highest values of this content, a significant damage of the
   sample follows this plastic deformation before rupture. But a large
   dispersion of the values is observed, more particularly for small
   particles of tantalum. This is due to a problem of heterogeneity of the
   particles dispersion and the presence of clusters; this difficulty in
   dispersing the particles is more marked for small spherical particles.
   An image analysis was performed to characterize this clustering effect.
   Clusters have a negative effect because they facilitate the propagation
   of cracks through Ta-Ta weak interface instead of deflecting it. An
   optimal content to combine a high elastic limit, a good hardness and a
   high plasticity seems to exist near 30\% vol. of crystalline particles.

Abstract = {{Underreporting is a well-known issue in crash frequency research.
   However, statistical methods that can account for underreporting have
   received little attention in the published literature. This paper
   compares results from underreporting models to models that account for
   unobserved heterogeneity. The difference in the elasticities between the
   negative binomial underreporting model and random parameters negative
   binomial models, which accounts for unobserved heterogeneity in crash
   frequency models, are used as the basis for comparison. The paper also
   includes a comparison of the predicted number of unreported PDO crashes
   based on the negative binomial underreporting model with crashes that
   were reported to police but were not considered reportable to PennDOT to
   assess the ability of the underreporting models to predict
   non-reportable crashes.
   The data used in this study included 21,340 segments of two-lane rural
   highways that are owned and maintained by PennDOT. Reported accident
   frequencies over an eight year period (2005-2012) were included in the
   sample, producing a total of 170,468 segment-years of data. The results
   indicate that if a variable impacts both the true accident frequency and
   the probability of accidents being reported, statistical modeling
   methods that ignore underreporting produce biased regression
   coefficients. The magnitude of the bias in the present study (based on
   elasticities) ranged from 0.00-16.79\%. If the variable affects the true
   accident frequency, but not the probability of accidents being reported,
   the results from the negative binomial underreporting models are
   consistent with analysis methods that do not account for underreporting.

Abstract = {{Many studies in the field of haemophilia and other coagulation
   deficiencies require analyses of bleeding frequencies. In haemophilia,
   the association of bleeding frequency with factor VIII (FVIII) activity
   levels is known from experience, but significant results are lacking.
   Bleeding frequencies in haemophilia are highly skewed count data, with
   large proportions of zeros. Both the skewness and the high amount of
   zeros pose a problem for standard (linear) modelling techniques. This
   study investigated the optimal analysing strategy for bleeding data by
   using the association of residual clotting factor level and number of
   joint bleeds in moderate and mild patients treated on demand as example.
   In total, 433 patients with moderate (27\%) and mild (73\%) haemophilia
   A treated on demand were included in this study. One year of
   self-reported data on joint bleed frequency and baseline clotting factor
   activity were analysed using Poisson, negative binomial, zero-inflated
   Poisson, and zero-inflated negative binomial distributions. Multivariate
   regression analysis using negative binomial distribution provided the
   optimum data analytical strategy. This model showed 18\% reduction
   {[}Rate ratio (RR) 0.82; 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.77-0.86] of
   bleeding frequency with every IU dL(-1) increase in residual FVIII
   activity. The actual association is expected to be higher because of
   exclusion (30 out of 463 patients) of patients on prophylaxis (baseline
   FVIII levels 0.01-0.06 IU mL(-1)). The best way to analyse low frequency
   bleeding data is using a negative binomial distribution.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the effects of magnetic field, Joule heating and
   volumetric heat generation on the heat transfer and fluid flow in a
   Cu-Water nanofluid filled lid driven cavity using enhanced
   streamfunction velocity method are investigated. The cavity is heated by
   a uniform volumetric heat density and side walls have constant
   temperature. The top wall moves with constant velocity in +x direction,
   while no-slip boundary conditions are imposed on the other walls of the
   cavity. An inclined fixed magnetic field is applied to the left side
   wall of the cavity. The dimensionless governing equations are solved
   numerically for the stream function and temperature using finite
   difference method for various Richardson(Ri), Reynolds(Re), Hartmann
   (Ha), Eckert(Ec)numbers, magnetic field angle(alpha) and solid volume
   fraction of the nanofluid(phi) in MATLAB software. To discretize the
   streamfunction-velocity formulation, a five point constant coefficient
   second-order compact finite difference approximation which avoids
   difficulties inherent in the conventional streamfunction vorticity and
   primitive variable formulations is used. The stream function equation is
   solved using fast Poisson's equation solver on a rectangular grid
   (POICALC function in MATLAB) and the temperature equation is solved
   using Jacobi bi-conjugate gradient stabilized (BiCGSTAB) method. The
   heat transfer within the cavity is characterized by Nusselt number
   (N-ui). The results show that N-ui is significantly increased by
   increasing Ri and phi and increasing the Reynolds number enhances
   convective cooling. The heat transfer within the cavity is decreased by
   increasing Hartmann number which improves conduction heat transfer and
   reduces N-ui. Joule heating has a negative effect on the convection
   within the cavity and convection is decreased by increasing the value of
   Ec. It can be investigated that N-ui is decreased by increasing Ec due
   to the strong distortion effect of Joule heating on convection current
   of heat transfer}},

Abstract = {{The paper discusses the problem of manufacturability of the minimum
   compliance designs of the structural elements made of two kinds of
   inhomogeneous materials: the isotropic and cubic. In both the cases the
   unit cost of the design is assumed as equal to the trace of the Hooke
   tensor. The Isotropic Material Design (IMD) delivers the optimal
   distribution of the bulk and shear moduli within the design domain. The
   Cubic Material Design (CMD) leads to the optimal material orientation
   and optimal distribution of the invariant moduli in the body made of the
   material of cubic symmetry. The present paper proves that the varying
   underlying microstructures (i.e., the representative volume elements
   (RVE) constructed of one or two isotropic materials) corresponding to
   the optimal designs constructed by IMD and CMD methods can be recovered
   by matching the values of the optimal moduli with the values of the
   effective moduli of the RVE computed by the theory of homogenization.
   The CMD method leads to a larger set of results, i.e., the set of pairs
   of optimal moduli. Moreover, special attention is focused on proper
   recovery of the microstructures in the auxetic sub-domains of the
   optimal designs.}},

Abstract = {{The transmission and current-voltage characteristics of Ga1-xAlxAs
   superlattice electron-wave quantum-interference filter/emitter negative
   differential resistance devices are analyzed with and without the
   self-consistency requirement. The analysis neglects the scattering
   effects within the superlattice since it is assumed that it is very thin
   (less than the electron coherence length). Thus, the calculated
   characteristics correspond to the ballistic component of the current.
   For the non-self-consistent calculation the single-band effective-mass
   time-independent Schroedinger equation is solved. For the
   self-consistent calculation, the Schroedinger and Poisson equations are
   solved iteratively until a self-consistent electron potential energy and
   electron density are obtained. It is shown that suitably designed
   electron-wave quantum-interference filter/emitters can exhibit strong
   negative differential resistance in the current-voltage characteristics,
   similar to those of resonant tunneling diodes. For low-to-moderate (2-30
   meV) Fermi energies in the conduction band of Ga1-xAlxAs (Si doping
   concentration less or equal to 2 x 10(18) cm-3) and temperatures near 30
   K (in the ballistic transport regime), it is shown that space-charge
   effects are relatively small and result in a slight shift of the
   current-voltage and transmission characteristics toward higher bias
   voltages. In a fashion similar to that occurring in resonant tunneling
   diodes, the self-consistent field in electron-wave filter/emitter
   negative differential resistance devices partially screens the positive
   applied bias. Designs of Ga1-xAlxAs resonant devices with current
   peak-to-valley ratios of approximately 50 as well as nonresonant (not
   exhibiting negative differential resistance) devices are analyzed. The
   corresponding electron charge density distributions are also presented.
   Superlattice electron-wave filter/emitter negative differential
   resistance devices can be used as high-speed switches, oscillators, and
   as monoenergetic emitters in electroluminescent devices and
   photodetectors.}},

Abstract = {{Complex mechanical behaviours are generally met in macroscopically
   homogeneous media as effects of inelastic responses or as results of
   unconventional material properties, which are postulated or due to
   structural systems at the meso/micro-scale. Examples are strain
   localization due to plasticity or damage and metamaterials exhibiting
   negative Poisson's ratios resulting from special porous, eventually
   buckling, sub-structures. In this work, through ad hoc conceived
   mechanical paradigms, we show that several non-standard behaviours can
   be obtained simultaneously by accounting for kinematical
   discontinuities, without invoking inelastic laws or initial voids. By
   allowing mutual sliding among rigid tesserae connected by pre-stressed
   hyperelastic links, we find several unusual kinematics such as localized
   shear modes and tensile buckling-induced instabilities, leading to
   deck-of-cards deformations-uncapturable with classical continuum
   models-and unprecedented `bulky' auxeticity emerging from a densely
   packed, geometrically symmetrical ensemble of discrete units that deform
   in a chiral way. Finally, after providing some analytical solutions and
   inequalities of mechanical interest, we pass to the limit of an infinite
   number of tesserae of infinitesimal size, thus transiting from discrete
   to continuum, without the need to introduce characteristic lengths. In
   the light of the theory of structured deformations, this result
   demonstrates that the proposed architectured material is nothing else
   than the first biaxial paradigm of structured continuum-a body that
   projects, at the macroscopic scale, geometrical changes and
   disarrangements occurring at the level of its sub-macroscopic elements.}},

Abstract = {{This manuscript investigates the flexural wave propagation behavior of a
   foldable metamaterial structure. Origami inspired foldable structures
   are making inroads into many engineering applications-deployable solar
   cell arrays, foldable telescope lenses, foldable automotive airbags, to
   name a few; driven primarily by some of the remarkable mechanical
   properties (high stiffness, negative Poisson's ratio, bistability etc.)
   of these structures. The chief motivation of this research is a
   comprehensive analysis of flexural wave propagation in such foldable
   structures. The repeating unit cell of the structure consists of an
   Euler-Bernoulli beam and a torsion spring. Transfer Matrix (TM) method
   is used to analyze the vibration attenuation properties of the structure
   and it is shown that the structure exhibits bandgap behavior. The
   obtained bandgaps are validated using Finite Element Analysis (FEA).
   Using the characteristic equation of the transfer matrix, we derive a
   transcendental equation for the bandgap edge frequencies. We show that
   for the nth band gap, the second band edge frequency is always equal to
   the natural frequency of the nth modeshape of the constituent beam under
   the simply supported condition. This frequency, therefore, is
   independent of the torsion spring constant. In addition, a detailed
   parametric study of the variation in band edge frequencies when the
   geometric and material parameters of the structure (Young's modulus of
   beam, torsional spring constant, width and thickness of beam etc.) are
   varied is conducted. It is concluded that the ratio of flexural rigidity
   of the beam to the torsion spring constant (EI/k(t)) is an important
   parameter affecting the width of the bandgap. For low values of the
   ratio, i.e., low beam flexural rigidity and high torsional stiffness,
   the first band edge frequency is almost equal to the second band edge
   and, effectively, no bandgap exists. As the stiffness ratio increases,
   i.e. high flexural rigidity (El of the beam) and low torsional stiffness
   k(t), the first band edge frequency assumes progressively lower values
   relative to the second band edge and we obtain a relatively large
   bandgap over which no flexural waves propagate. This has important
   ramifications for the design of foldable metamaterial structures}},

Abstract = {{The class of anti-tetrachiral cellular materials is phenomenologically
   characterized by a strong auxeticity of the elastic macroscopic
   response. The auxetic behavior is activated by rolling-up deformation
   mechanisms developed by the material microstructure, composed by a
   periodic pattern of stiff rings connected by flexible ligaments. A
   linear beam lattice model is formulated to describe the free dynamic
   response of the periodic cell, in the absence of a soft matrix. After a
   static condensation of the passive degrees-of freedom, a general
   procedure is applied to analyze the wave propagation in the
   low-dimensional space of the active degrees-of-freedom. The exact
   dispersion functions are compared with explicit - although approximate -
   dispersion relations, obtained from asymptotic perturbation solutions of
   the eigenproblem governing the Floquet-Bloch theory. A general
   hierarchical scheme is outlined to formulate and solve the perturbation
   equations, taking into account the dimension of the perturbation vector.
   Original recursive formulas are presented to achieve any desired order
   of asymptotic approximation. For the anti-tetrachiral material, the
   fourth-order asymptotic solutions are found to approximate the
   dispersion curves with fine agreement over wide regions of the parameter
   space. The asymptotic eigensolutions allow an accurate sensitivity
   analysis of the material spectrum under variation of the key physical
   parameters, including the cell aspect ratio, the ligament slenderness
   and the spatial ring density. Finally, the explicit dependence of the
   dispersion functions on the mechanical parameters may facilitate the
   custom design of specific spectral properties, such as the wave
   velocities and band gap amplitudes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{To investigate the applicability of the pulsed neutron source method
   using a pulsed spallation neutron source for an on-line subcriticality
   monitoring system of an accelerator-driven system, a subcritical
   experiment is conducted using the Kyoto University Critical Assembly in
   combination with the fixed-field alternating gradient accelerator.
   Reactivity values obtained from different traditional techniques, the
   area-ratio method and the -fitting method, are discussed with respect to
   the applicability to on-line subcriticality monitoring. The results show
   that the area-ratio method robustly and accurately monitors
   subcriticality in shallow subcritical states with negative reactivity of
   up to a few dollars; however, this method faces problems with temporal
   fluctuations, spatial dispersion, and sensitivity to the proton-beam
   current with increasing depth of subcriticality. On the other hand, it
   is shown that the -fitting method alleviates such problems in deep
   subcritical states. Moreover, a proposed fitting technique using the
   maximum-likelihood estimation method based on the Poisson distribution
   is robust enough to be applicable to on-line subcriticality monitoring
   for negative reactivity levels of up to roughly nine dollars.}},

Title = {{Chromatin Compaction, Auxeticity, and the Epigenetic Landscape of Stem
   Cells}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW X}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{OCT 28}},
Abstract = {{When embryonic stem cells differentiate, the mechanical properties of
   their nuclei evolve en route to their terminal state. Measurements of
   the deformability of cell nuclei in the transitional state that
   intervenes between the embryonic stem-cell state and the differentiation
   primed state of mouse stem cells indicate that such nuclei are auxetic;
   i.e., they have a negative Poisson's ratio. We show, using a theoretical
   model, how this remarkable mechanical behavior results from the coupling
   between chromatin compaction states and nuclear shape. Our biophysical
   approach, which treats chromatin as an active polymer system whose
   mechanics is modulated by nucleosome binding and unbinding, reproduces
   experimental results. It provides testable predictions for changes in
   chromatin compaction as a function of applied force, for the
   correlations of chromatin compaction and nuclear shape, and for the
   in-phase and out-of-phase response of these quantities to an applied
   uniaxial oscillatory force. Our model yields a biophysical
   interpretation of the epigenetic landscape of stem cells, also
   suggesting how this landscape might be probed experimentally.}},

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{50}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{We have estimated P-wave velocities (V-P) and thicknesses from
   traveltimes data, and S-wave velocities (V-S) and densities (rho) from
   amplitudes versus offset (AVO) data by constraining the V-P for a set of
   seismic reflection data including a bottom simulating reflector or BSR
   (marker for gas hydrates) in the Mahanadi offshore. The elastic
   parameters (V-P, V-S and.) of the whole-layered model have been derived
   simultaneously using the genetic algorithm global optimization technique
   that converges into a global minimum. The result shows a low velocity
   (1506 m/s) free-gas zone below the BSR that lies at 241 m below the sea
   floor. The presence of underlying free-gas is further corroborated by
   the observation of increasing negative reflection coefficients with
   angles. The V-P and V-S for gas hydrates bearing sediments above the BSR
   are estimated to be 1655 and 468 m/s respectively, and match reasonably
   with the sonic log at site NGHP-01-08A passing through the seismic line.
   Gas-hydrates and free-gas have been qualitatively estimated as 7.0\% and
   0.9\% using three-phase weighted equation of Lee and Gassmann equation
   respectively. The combined usage of V-P and V-S corresponding to a
   Poisson ratio of 0.4565 provides a better estimation of gas hydrates,
   which shows comparable result that has been estimated using the
   Simandoux equation to the resistivity log data at site NGHP-01-08A.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates analytical solutions stresses and displacements
   of the functionally graded cylindrically curved beam subjected to the
   thermal load in the radial direction. The ends of this curved FGM beam
   is supposed to be guided in such a way that a displacement in
   circumferential direction may occur and that the radius of the middle
   surface remains unchanged. Then, couples act on those ends, giving rise
   to pure bending condition. It is assumed that the temperature
   distribution varies as a function of the radial coordinate and is in
   steady state. The modulus of elasticity varies with the power law
   through of the thickness of the curved FGM beam. Accordingly, by
   applying the general mixture law, the thermal expansion, the heat
   transfer coefficient and the volume fraction varies depending on the
   power law (except Poisson ratio). The curved FGM beam is assumed to be
   in plane stress state. Using the von Mises yield criterion, the effects
   of the values of power law index on the displacement and stresses of the
   curved beam is discussed. The inner surface of the curved FGM beam is
   steel and its outer surface is aluminum. At positive and negative
   temperatures, the effects of the yielding on the curved beam are
   investigated. It is observed that the starting of the plastic yielding
   is on the outer surface, inner surface and at the simultaneously on both
   surfaces. Communicated by Eleonora Tubaldi.}},

Title = {{Natural Resource Rents, Inequality, and Terrorism in Africa}},
Journal = {{DEFENCE AND PEACE ECONOMICS}},
Abstract = {{This study examines the impact of natural resource rents on terrorism
   via inequality channel in 34 African economies, straddling the period
   1980-2012. This study employs a negative binomial regression, in which
   the following findings are established: first, the unconditional impact
   of natural resource rents on terrorism is found to be positive across
   the model specifications, particularly when Gini and Theil indices are
   controlled for. Second, inequality has no discernable first-order impact
   on terrorism across the board. Third, the marginal impacts of
   interactions between inequality measures, specifically Gini and Theil
   coefficients and total natural resource rents on terrorism are
   significantly negative. Four, the corresponding net effects of
   interactions between natural resource rents and inequality (Gini and
   Theil coefficients) on terrorism are positive, thus lending support to
   earlier submission of involving all constitutive variables in the
   specifications for the parameters to make economic sense. The results
   are robust to accounting for fixed and country effects using the Poisson
   Pseudo maximum likelihood high-dimension fixed effects estimator. On the
   policy front, maintaining fairness and equity in the distribution of
   rents from the `free gifts of nature' remains a veritable policy menu,
   especially for the resource-rich economies, to counteracting terrorist

Title = {{3D compression-torsion cubic mechanical metamaterial with double

Journal = {{EXTREME MECHANICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{37}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{A novel 3D compression-torsion cubic mechanical metamaterial (CTCMM)
   with double inclined rods is proposed converting axial compression into
   a torsion. The CTCMM under uniaxial compression is studied by
   theoretical analysis, experiments and numerical simulations. The
   relationships between relative densities and geometric parameters are
   analyzed to meet the needs of lightweight. Based on the derivation of
   the over-deformation mechanism, the torsion angle is derived by the
   Timoshenko beam theory. The arrangements of gradient models are designed
   and fabricated by 3D printing, as the specimens for static compression
   experiments. Results show that the torsion angles of the numerical and
   experimental results agree well with the theoretical solution. Moreover,
   the proposed CTCMM possesses a similar compression-torsion effect
   compared to previously reported 3D CTCMM. Meanwhile, the improved 3D
   CTCMM with the better compression-torsion effect is proposed, compared
   with the original structure, the different phenomenon wherein the
   torsion angle first increases and then declines. Finally, cell number,
   variable cross-section and perforated plates all affect the
   compression-torsion effects of 3D CTCMM. The above research provides a
   new idea for improving the performance of CTCMM, no longer limited to
   the deformation mode of a single inclined rod. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The article reports on structure and mechanical properties of Ti-B alloy
   films sputter deposited from a sintered TiB2 target using an unbalanced
   do magnetron. We present results of a systematic investigation of the
   effect of negative substrate bias, Us, substrate ion current density
   i(s), and substrate temperature, T-s, on properties of Ti-B films. The
   X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis shows that the Ti-B films consist of
   the hexagonal TiB2 phase with the typical (0001) texture only. The TiBx
   films are over-stoichiometric with the ratio x=B/Ti approximate to 2.4.
   All Ti-B films sputter ion plated in argon magnetron discharge are
   superhard films with hardness H>40 GPa and exhibit high values of (i)
   effective Young's modulus E{*}=E/(1-v(2)) up to approximately 600 GPa
   and (ii) elastic recovery, W-e, up to approximately 82\%; here E and v
   are the Young's modulus and the Poisson's ratio, respectively. Besides,
   it was found that the value of the Bragg's angle 29 of the (0001)
   reflection line can be easily controlled by the energy delivered to the
   film during its growth by (1) the substrate heating T-s and (2) ion
   bombardment (Us, is). The angle 26 of the (0001) reflection increases
   with increasing Ts from 300 to 550 C and decreasing US from -150 to -50
   V In this range of process parameters, the energy E-p delivered to the
   growing film per condensing atom by ion bombardment can be adjusted to a
   value, at which the (0001) reflection from sputtered films is close to
   that of the TiB2(0001) powder standard. These films exhibit a low
   macrostress, which approaches to zero. It enables to sputter thick (up
   to 8 mum) superhard (H > 40 GPa) Ti-B films. The optimum value of E-p is
   achieved when the Ti-B film is sputtered at U-s = -50 V, i(s) =1
   mA/cm(2), T-s = 550 degreesC with a deposition rate a(D) = 52 nm/min.
   The Ti-B film prepared under these conditions exhibits a maximum
   hardness of H = 77 GPa, measured using a computer controlled
   microhardness tester Fischerscope H100 at the Vickers diamond indenter
   load L=50 mN. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The porosity dependence of Poisson's ratio of materials with random
   microstructure is investigated via analytical and numerical modeling. It
   is shown that all analytical models predict porosity independence if the
   solid Poisson ratio is 0.2 and for low porosities a converging trend
   toward this value with increasing porosity. From all theory-based
   relations, only power-law and exponential relations allow for auxetic
   behavior. Numerical calculations on computer-generated digital
   microstructures (overlapping and isolated spherical pores, pores between
   overlapping spherical grains, wall-based cellular materials/closed-cell
   foams, and strut-based cellular materials/open-cell foams) confirm the
   general qualitative trends of the analytical models, although a closer
   look reveals significant quantitative differences. Cellular materials
   and foams exhibit similar features as porous materials in general, but
   lack their converging trend toward values around 0.2. Comparison of our
   results with the classical Roberts-Garboczi results shows good
   agreement, with subtle differences due to the different microstructures
   generated.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{82}},
Number = {{23}},
Month = {{DEC 9}},
Abstract = {{There exist three conformers of hydrogenated graphene, referred to as
   chair-, boat-, or washboard-graphane. These systems have a perfect
   two-dimensional periodicity mapped onto the graphene scaffold but they
   are characterized by a sp(3) orbital hybridization, have different
   crystal symmetry, and otherwise behave upon loading. By first-principles
   calculations we determine their structural and phonon properties, as
   well as we establish their relative stability. Through continuum
   elasticity we define a simulation protocol addressed to measure by a
   computer experiment their linear and nonlinear elastic moduli and we
   actually compute them by first principles. We argue that all graphane
   conformers respond to any arbitrarily oriented extension with a much
   smaller lateral contraction than the one calculated for graphene.
   Furthermore, we provide evidence that boat-graphane has a small and
   negative Poisson ratio along the armchair and zigzag principal
   directions of the carbon honeycomb lattice (axially auxetic elastic
   behavior). Moreover, we show that chair-graphane admits both softening
   and hardening hyperelasticity, depending on the direction of applied
   load.}},

Abstract = {{A regression model for overdispersed count data based on the complex
   biparametric Pearson (CBP) distribution is developed. It is compared
   with the generalized Poisson regression model, the negative binomial
   regression model and the zero inflated Poisson regression model, which
   are based on the generalized Poisson (CBP), negative binomial (NB) and
   zero inflated Poisson (ZIP) distributions, respectively. It is shown
   that the CBP distribution is more adequate than the GP, NB and ZIP
   distributions when the overdispersion is not related to a higher
   frequency of 0, but to other low values greater than 0, so it may be
   appropriate for overdispersed cases in which there are external reasons
   that raise the number of low values different from 0. Firstly, we study
   the shape and the parameters of the CBP distribution and we compare it
   with the Poisson, GP, NB and ZIP distributions by means of the
   probability of 0, the skewness and curtosis coefficients and the
   Kullback-Leibler divergence. Furthermore, we present an application
   example where the aforementioned performance is shown by the number of
   public educational facilities by municipality in Andalusia (Spain).
   Secondly, we describe two regression models based on the CBP
   distribution and the estimation method for their parameters. Thirdly, we
   carry out a simulation study that reveals the performance of the
   regression models proposed. Finally, one application in the field of
   sport illustrates that these models can provide more accurate fits than
   those provided by other usual regression models for count data.}},

   Stress Corrosion Cracking susceptibility}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{493}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Most studies on Intergranular Stress Corrosion Cracking (IGSCC) in Light
   Water Reactor environment consider the macroscopic applied stress as the
   relevant mechanical parameter to characterize crack initiation. Progress
   in understanding, modeling, and forecasting IGSCC could be made by
   correlating crack initiation susceptibility to the stress field at crack
   initiation sites. Through finite element method (FEM) calculations, the
   present article assesses this stress field in polycrystalline 316
   stainless steel and identifies key parameters controlling local stress
   intensification. It is in particular shown that the auxetic behavior
   (i.e., negative Poisson's ratio) of 316 single crystals in some
   orientations plays an important role. FEM calculation results are used
   to set up a preliminary expression that can be used to rank IGSCC
   initiation sensitivity of components made of the same fcc alloy (i.e.,
   austenitic stainless steels, Ni-based alloys) from their surface
   texture. Further work is in progress to integrate influence of grain
   boundary triple junctions and validate the whole approach against
   experimental SCC data. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Little is known about fertility choices and pregnancy
   outcome rates among HIV-infected women in the current combination
   antiretroviral treatment era.
   OBJECTIVE: We sought to describe trends and factors associated with
   live-birth and abortion rates among HIV-positive and high-risk
   HIVnegative women enrolled in the Women's Interagency HIV Study in the
   United States.
   STUDY DESIGN: We analyzed longitudinal data collected from Oct. 1, 1994,
   through Sept. 30, 2012, through the Women's Interagency HIV Study.
   Age-adjusted rates per 100 person-years live births and induced
   abortions were calculated by HIV serostatus over 4 time periods. Poisson
   mixed effects models containing variables associated with live births
   and abortions in bivariable analyses (P <.05) generated adjusted
   incidence rate ratios and 95\% confidence intervals.
   RESULTS: There were 1356 pregnancies among 2414 women. Among
   HIV-positive women, age-adjusted rates of live birth increased from 1994
   through 1997 to 2006 through 2012 (2.85-7.27/ 100 person-years, P trend
   <.0001). Age-adjusted rates of abortion in HIV-positive women remained
   stable over these time periods (4.03-4.29/ 100 person-years,P trend
   =.09). Significantly lower live-birth rates occurred among HIVpositive
   compared to HIV-negative women in 1994 through 1997 and 1997 through
   2001, however rates were similar during 2002 through 2005 and 2006
   through 2012. Higher CD4\_ inverted perpendicular cells/mm (3) (
   (similar to) 350 adjusted incidence rate ratio, 1.39 {[}95\% CI
   1.03-1.89] vs < 350) were significantly associated with increased
   live-birth rates, while combination antiretroviral treatment use
   (adjusted incidence rate ratio, 1.35 {[}95\% CI 0.99-1.83]) was
   marginally associated with increased live-birth rates. Younger age,
   having a prior abortion, condom use, and increased parity were
   associated with increased abortion rates among both HIV-positive and
   HIV-negative women. CD4\_ inverted perpendicular-cell count, combination
   antiretroviral treatment use, and viral load were not associated with
   abortion rates.
   CONCLUSION: Unlike earlier periods (pre-2001) when live-birth rates were
   lower among HIV-positive women, rates are now similar to HIV-negative
   women, potentially due to improved health status and combination
   antiretroviral treatment. Abortion rates remain unchanged, illuminating
   a need to improve contraceptive services.}},

Abstract = {{A soft elastohydrodynamic lubrication model is formulated for deformable
   roll coating involving two contra-rotating rolls, one rigid and the
   other covered with a compliant layer. Included is a finite-strip model
   (FSM) for the deformation of the layer and a lubrication model with
   suitable boundary conditions for the motion of the fluid. The scope of
   the analysis is restricted to Newtonian fluids, linear
   elasticity/viscoelasticity and equal roll speeds, with application to
   the industrially relevant highly loaded or `negative gap' regime.
   Predictions are presented for coated film thickness, interroll
   thickness, meniscus location, pressure and layer deformation as the
   control parameters - load (gap), elasticity, layer thickness and
   capillary number, Ca - are varied. There are four main results:
   (1) Hookean spring models are shown to be unable to model effectively
   the deformation of a compliant layer when Poisson's ratio nu --> 0.5. In
   particular, they fall to predict the swelling of the layer at the edge
   of the contact region which increases as v - 0.5; they also fail to
   locate accurately the position of the meniscus, X-M, and to identify the
   presence, close to the meniscus, of a `nib' (constriction in gap
   thickness) and associated magnification of the sub-ambient pressure
   loop.
   (ii) Scaling arguments suggest that layer thickness and elasticity may
   have similar effects on the field variables. It is shown that for
   positive gaps this is true, whereas for negative gaps they have similar
   effects on the pressure profile and flow rate yet quite different
   effects on layer swelling (deformation at the edge of the contact
   region) and different effects on X-M.
   (iii) For negative gaps and Ca similar to O(1), the effect of varying
   either viscosity or speed and hence Ca is to significantly alter both
   the coating thickness and X-M. This is contrary to the case of fixed-gap
   rigid roll coating.
   (iv) Comparison between theoretical predictions and experimental data
   shows quantitive agreement in the case of X-M and qualitive agreement
   for flow rate. It is shown that this difference in the latter case may
   be due to viscoelastic effects in the compliant layer.}},

Title = {{Income inequality and schizophrenia: Increased schizophrenia incidence
   in countries with high levels of income inequality}},

Volume = {{60}},

Abstract = {{Background: Income inequality is associated with numerous negative
   health outcomes. There is evidence that ecological-level
   socio-environmental factors may increase risk for schizophrenia.
   Aims: The aim was to investigate whether measures of income inequality
   are associated with incidence of schizophrenia at the country level.
   Method: We conducted a systematic review of incidence rates for
   schizophrenia, reported between 1975 and 2011. For each country,
   national measures of income inequality (Gini coefficient) along with
   covariate risk factors for schizophrenia were obtained. Multi-level
   mixed-effects Poisson regression was performed to investigate the
   relationship between Gini coefficients and incidence rates of
   schizophrenia controlling for covariates.
   Results: One hundred and seven incidence rates (from 26 countries) were
   included. Mean incidence of schizophrenia was 18.50 per 100,000 (SD =
   11.9; range = 1.7-67). There was a significant positive relationship
   between incidence rate of schizophrenia and Gini coefficient ( = 1.02; Z
   = 2.28; p = .02; 95\% CI = 1.00, 1.03).
   Conclusions: Countries characterized by a large rich-poor gap may be at
   increased risk of schizophrenia. We suggest that income inequality
   impacts negatively on social cohesion, eroding social capital, and that
   chronic stress associated with living in highly disparate societies
   places individuals at risk of schizophrenia.}},

Title = {{Elastodynamics of a multilayered transversely isotropic half-space due
   to the rigid motion of foundation}},
Journal = {{WAVE MOTION}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{88}},
Pages = {{106-128}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{A transversely isotropic multilayered half-space is considered as a
   support of a massless circular rigid foundation undergoing forced
   vibrations. The problem formulation adopts the axes of material symmetry
   of layers with the half-space aligned depth-wise. The problem solution
   involves two coupled wave equations accompanied by mixed boundary
   conditions. Employing the influence functions, which contain the effects
   of the entire domain, i.e. reflecting and refracting phenomena as a
   consequence of the inhomogeneity of media, the governing equations
   reduce to a set of Fredholm integral equations of the second kind, which
   are then solved numerically. To illustrate the method's accuracy, a
   comparison between the result of this study and the existing solutions
   for the vibration of a foundation on a layered isotropic half-space is
   given. Also, the result of the vibration of the disc on a transversely
   isotropic half-space is determined and compared to the available
   solution in the literature To explore the effect of stratification as
   well as material anisotropy on wave motion, dispersion curves
   corresponding to surface waves are shown. These curves indicate the
   existence of limiting values for both small and large values of
   wavenumbers as compared to layers' thicknesses. Also, exploring the
   effect of various material properties (e.g., the negative Poisson ratio)
   and different layers' arrangements, it is found that the impedance
   functions of the multilayered medium are closely related to the
   frequency of excitation while showing almost no sensitivity to
   properties of the half-space and, in particular, for rocking motion. (C)

Abstract = {{We present and analyse two implicit methods for Ito stochastic
   differential equations (SDEs) with Poisson-driven jumps. The first
   method, SSBE, is a split-step extension of the backward Euler method.
   The second method, CSSBE, arises from the introduction of a compensated,
   martingale, form of the Poisson process. We show that both methods are
   amenable to rigorous analysis when a one-sided Lipschitz condition,
   rather than a more restrictive global Lipschitz condition, holds for the
   drift. Our analysis covers strong convergence and nonlinear stability.
   We prove that both methods give strong convergence when the drift
   coefficient is one-sided Lipschitz and the diffusion and jump
   coefficients are globally Lipschitz. On the way to proving these
   results, we show that a compensated form of the Euler-Maruyama method
   converges strongly when the SDE coefficients satisfy a local Lipschitz
   condition and the pth moment of the exact and numerical solution are
   bounded for some p > 2. Under our assumptions, both SSBE and CSSBE give
   well-defined, unique solutions for sufficiently small stepsizes, and
   SSBE has the advantage that the restriction is independent of the jump
   intensity. We also study the ability of the methods to reproduce
   exponential mean-square stability in the case where the drift has a
   negative one-sided Lipschitz constant. This work extends the
   deterministic nonlinear stability theory in numerical analysis. We find
   that SSBE preserves stability under a stepsize constraint that is
   independent of the initial data. CSSBE satisfies an even stronger
   condition, and gives a generalization of B-stability. Finally, we
   specialize to a linear test problem and show that CSSBE has a natural
   extension of deterministic A-stability. The difference in stability
   properties of the SSBE and CSSBE methods emphasizes that the addition of
   a jump term has a significant effect that cannot be deduced directly
   from the non-jump literature.}},

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors with desirable bandgaps and high

   low formation energies and high dynamical and thermal stabilities
   indicate the high feasibility of experimental synthesis of these ScN
   monolayers. The electronic structure calculations reveal that M-ScN and
   O-ScN are both direct bandgap semiconductors with the bandgaps of 1.39
   and 2.14 eV, respectively, while H-ScN has a large indirect bandgap of
   3.21 eV. In addition, both M-ScN and H-ScN exhibit ultra-high electron
   mobilities (3.09 x 10(4) cm(2) V-1 s(-1) and 1.22 x 10(4) cm(2) V-1

   results were systematically compared with the experimental results. The
   onset of densification phases of both structures was determined

   force-deflection response of both designs. In this manner, failure
   locations and buckling deformation in the tests were identified to find
   a relation with theory and to modify geometries. The anti-tetrachiral
   design exhibits higher specific energy absorption than modified
   re-entrant hexagonal lattices. Beyond the auxetic characteristics,
   deformation mechanism of the anti-tetrachiral lattices provides an
   opportunity to construct excellent crush absorption in-plane direction

   (BW). The effects of repositioning nanopores and AGNR type (i.e.,
   semiconductor and semimetal) are also studied. The impact of the
   parameters on the density of states, transmission probabilities, peak
   current (IP) and its voltage (VP), valley current (IV) and its voltage
   (VV), and peak-tovalley ratio (PVR) are investigated. Simulation results
   show that in both AGNR types, a decrease in WW brings about higher IP,
   VP, and VV. Moreover, in the semimetal AGNR, the narrowest WW leads to
   the highest PVR value. Another key observation is that with a decrease
   in VD, the PVR increases, and negative gate transconductance (NGT)
   characteristics show better performance. In addition, in the semimetal
   AGNR, the highest PVR value and the best NGT characteristics occur at
   the highest BW. Furthermore, repositioning nanopores across the device
   width does not affect the energy of the first resonance level. Finally,
   the structure with the largest unobstructed width (i.e., the one with
   the least backscattering) has the highest PVR.}},

Title = {{Micro-spatial distribution of malaria cases and control strategies at
   ward level in Gwanda district, Matabeleland South, Zimbabwe}},
Journal = {{MALARIA JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{NOV 21}},
Abstract = {{Background: Although there has been a decline in the number of malaria
   cases in Zimbabwe since 2010, the disease remains the biggest public
   health threat in the country. Gwanda district, located in Matabeleland
   South Province of Zimbabwe has progressed to the malaria pre-elimination
   phase. The aim of this study was to determine the spatial distribution
   of malaria incidence at ward level for improving the planning and
   implementation of malaria elimination in the district.
   Methods: The Poisson purely spatial model was used to detect malaria
   clusters and their properties, including relative risk and significance
   levels at ward level. The geographically weighted Poisson regression
   (GWPR) model was used to explore the potential role and significance of
   environmental variables {[}rainfall, minimum and maximum temperature,
   altitude, Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Normalized Difference
   Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI),
   rural/urban] and malaria control strategies {[}indoor residual spraying
   (IRS) and long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs)] on the spatial
   patterns of malaria incidence at ward level.
   Results: Two significant clusters (p < 0.05) of malaria cases were
   identified: (1) ward 24 south of Gwanda district and (2) ward 9 in the
   urban municipality, with relative risks of 5.583 and 4.316,
   respectively. The semiparametric-GWPR model with both local and global
   variables had higher performance based on AICc (70.882) compared to
   global regression (74.390) and GWPR which assumed that all variables
   varied locally (73.364). The semiparametric-GWPR captured the spatially
   non-stationary relationship between malaria cases and minimum
   temperature, NDVI, NDWI, and altitude at the ward level. The influence
   of LLINs, IRS and rural or urban did not vary and remained in the model
   as global terms. NDWI (positive coefficients) and NDVI (range from
   negative to positive coefficients) showed significant association with
   malaria cases in some of the wards. The IRS had a protection effect on
   malaria incidence as expected.
   Conclusions: Malaria incidence is heterogeneous even in low-transmission
   zones including those in pre-elimination phase. The relationship between
   malaria cases and NDWI, NDVI, altitude, and minimum temperature may vary
   at local level. The results of this study can be used in planning and
   implementation of malaria control strategies at district and ward
   levels.}},

Abstract = {{Small and large deformation in-plane elastic response of a new class of
   hierarchical fractal-like honey-combs inspired by the topology of the
   ``spiderweb{''} were investigated through analytical modeling, detailed
   numerical simulations, and mechanical testing. Small deformation
   elasticity results show that the isotropic in-plane elastic moduli
   (Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio) of the structures are controlled
   by dimension ratios in the hierarchical pattern of spiderweb, and the
   response can vary from bending to stretching dominated. In large
   deformations, spiderweb hierarchy postpones the onset of instability
   compared to stretching dominated triangular honeycomb (which is indeed a
   special case of the proposed spiderweb honeycomb), and exhibits
   hardening behavior due to geometrical nonlinearity. Furthermore, simple
   geometrical arguments were obtained for large deformation Poisson's
   ratio of first order spiderweb honeycombs, which show good agreement
   with numerical and experimental results. Spiderweb honeycombs exhibit
   auxetic behavior depending on the non-dimensional geometrical ratio of
   spiderweb. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Bicycle-car accidents at signalized intersections account for a
   considerable part of bicycle accidents. Factors that have effects on the
   bicycle-car crash risk at signalized intersections are not well
   understood. Especially, the safety effects of bicycle facilities are
   controversial at intersections. This paper aims to identify factors that
   have significant effects on bicycle-car crash risk at signalized
   intersections and their effect directions. The negative binomial
   regression model is used to model associations between the frequency of
   bicycle-car accidents at signalized intersections and the contributory
   factors, based on 6-year accident history at 140 signalized
   intersections in Berlin, Germany. The considered factors include the
   traffic volume, geometric data, and bicycle-specific and car-specific
   infrastructures. The factor effect coefficients are estimated by the
   maximum likelihood approach. The estimated coefficient of the negative
   binomial dispersion parameter is significant at the level of 0.001.
   Three factors are identified to have significant effects on the crash
   risk. The traffic volume of cars across intersections has negative
   effects on the cycling safety. Regarding bicycle facilities, the number
   of bicycle lanes on intersection approaches has positive safety effects,
   whereas the intersections with more bicycle paths is subject to a higher
   crash risk, though intersection modifications are applied for bicycle
   paths. The results support the choice of the negative binomial
   regression over the Poisson regression in this study. The estimated
   effects provide implications for the cycling safety improvement at
   signalized intersections.}},

Volume = {{107}},
Number = {{497}},
Pages = {{205-213}},

Abstract = {{In this article, we focus on the circumstances in quasi-likelihood
   inference that the estimation accuracy of mean structure parameters is
   guaranteed by correct specification of the first moment, but the
   estimation efficiency could be diminished due to misspecification of the
   second moment. We propose an information ratio (IR) statistic to test
   for model misspecification of the variance/covariance structure through
   a comparison between two forms of information matrix: the negative
   sensitivity matrix and the variability matrix. We establish asymptotic
   distributions of the proposed IR test statistics. We also suggest an
   approximation to the asymptotic distribution of the IR statistic via a
   perturbation resampling method. Moreover, we propose a selection
   criterion based on the IR test to select the best fitting
   variance/covariance structure from a class of candidates. Through
   simulation studies, it is shown that the IR statistic provides a
   powerful statistical tool to detect different scenarios of
   misspecification of the variance/covariance structures. In addition, the
   IR test as well as the proposed model selection procedure shows
   substantial improvement over some of the existing statistical methods.
   The IR-based model selection procedure is illustrated by analyzing the
   Madras Longitudinal Schizophrenia data. Appendices are included in the
   supplemental materials, which are available online.}},

Abstract = {{Scientific research activity produces the ``Matthew Effect{''} on
   resource allocation. Based on a data set in the life sciences field from
   the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) during the 11th
   Five-Year-Plan (2006-2010), this paper makes an empirical study on how
   the Matthew Effect of funding allocation at the institutional level and
   city level impact scientific research activity output. With Gini
   coefficient evaluation, descriptive statistic analysis, and the Poisson
   regression model, we found that there has been a rapid increase in the
   concentration degree of funding allocation among institutions and
   cities. Within a period of 5 years, the Gini coefficients of total
   funding of institutions and cities as the units of measurement have
   increased from 0.61 and 0.74 to 0.67 and 0.79 respectively. However,
   this concentration in funding allocation did not result in significant
   additional benefits. Institutions awarded with more funding did not
   produce the expected positive spillover effect on their scientific
   research activity output. Instead, an ``inverted U-shape{''} pattern of
   decreasing returns to scale was discovered, under which there was a
   negative effect on internal scientific research activity in the majority
   of institutions with concentrated funding allocation. Meanwhile, the
   result shows that Young Scholars projects under the NFSC produced
   high-level output. We conclude the study by discussing the possible
   reasons of the inverted U-shape pattern and its policy implications.}},

Abstract = {{A distribution F on (-infinity, infinity) is said to belong to the class
   S(y) for some y >= 0 if lim(x-infinity) (F) over bar (x - u)/(F) over
   bar (x) = e(yu) holds for all u and lim(x ->infinity) F{*}2(x)/(F) over
   bar (x) = 2m(F) exists and is finite. Let X and Y be two independent
   random variables, where X has a distribution in the class S(Y) and Y is
   non-negative with an endpoint y = sup\{y : P(Y <= y) < 1\} is an element
   of (0, infinity). We prove that the product XY has a distribution in the
   class S(y/y). We further apply this result to investigate the tail
   probabilities of Poisson shot noise processes and certain stochastic

   which cubic elastic materials are completely auxetic, non-auxetic, and

   a negative Poisson ratio is predicted in fluorinated silicene with boat2

Abstract = {{In this study, we present a theoretical investigation of structural,

   (p-graphene), boron nitride (p-B2N4 and p-B4N2), and silver azide
   (p-AgN3) by performing state-of-the-art first principles calculations.
   Our total energy calculations suggest feasible formation of monolayer
   crystal structures composed entirely of pentagons. In addition,
   electronic band dispersion calculations indicate that while p-graphene
   and p-AgN3 are semiconductors with indirect bandgaps, p-BN structures
   display metallic behavior. We also investigate the mechanical properties
   (in-plane stiffness and the Poisson's ratio) of four different
   pentagonal structures under uniaxial strain. p-graphene is found to have
   the highest stiffness value and the corresponding Poisson's ratio is
   found to be negative. Similarly, p-B2N4 and p-B4N2 have negative
   Poisson's ratio values. On the other hand, the p-AgN3 has a large and
   positive Poisson's ratio. In dynamical stability tests based on
   calculated phonon spectra of these pentagonal monolayers, we find that
   only p-graphene and p-B2N4 are stable, but p-AgN3 and p-B4N2 are
   vulnerable against vibrational excitations. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Chinese cancer registration data provide information on the
   national cancer burden but how representative they are of the real
   situation is uncertain. Mortality data from cancer registration and the
   third national death survey were therefore compared to determine the
   accuracy of estimates in China. Methods: The data were from the Cancer
   Registration Annual Report, 2004, China and the third National Death
   Survey, 2004-205. Negative binomial regression was used to estimate
   site-specific cancer mortality rate ratios between the two. Results: The
   estimated cancer mortality for all sites from national cancer
   registration was representative for China, especially in urban areas,
   but mortality was over-estimated for rural areas, with large differences
   in some cancer site-specific mortalities. Conclusion: Although cancer
   registration data are representative at the country level and for urban
   areas, they may not reflect real cancer burden in rural areas,
   particularly with some cancer types. Setting up new cancer registries in
   non-high risk areas in rural areas should be enhanced in further cancer

Abstract = {{Developing sound or reliable statistical models for analyzing motor
   vehicle crashes is very important in highway safety studies. However, a
   significant difficulty associated with the model development is related
   to the fact that crash data often exhibit over-dispersion. Sources of
   dispersion can be varied and are usually unknown to the transportation
   analysts. These sources could potentially affect the development of
   negative binomial (NB) regression models, which are often the model of
   choice in highway safety. To help in this endeavor, this paper documents
   an alternative formulation that could be used for capturing
   heterogeneity in crash count models through the use of finite mixture
   regression models. The finite mixtures of Poisson or NB regression
   models are especially useful where count data were drawn from
   heterogeneous populations. These models can help determine
   sub-populations or groups in the data among others. To evaluate these
   models, Poisson and NB mixture models were estimated using data
   collected in Toronto, Ontario. These models were compared to standard NB
   regression model estimated using the same data. The results of this
   study show that the dataset seemed to be generated from two distinct
   sub-populations, each having different regression coefficients and
   degrees of over-dispersion. Although over-dispersion in crash data can
   be dealt with in a variety of ways, the mixture model can help provide
   the nature of the over-dispersion in the data. It is therefore
   recommended that transportation safety analysts use this type of model
   before the traditional NB model, especially when the data are suspected
   to belong to different groups. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Measuring strain in foam presents a number of challanges. In the case of
   polymeric foam, the material is so soft that a conventional strain gage
   is not applicable because the rigidity of gage and its associated glue
   is stronger than the foam itself Transducers such as clip gage, etc. may
   not be suitable either because the strain field may not be uniform
   within the gage length. Thus it is desirable that a non-contact and full
   field strain measurement technique be available. In this paper we
   introduce a speckle photography technique that is non-contact and can
   measure the full field deformation of a foam specimen. We use the
   natural texture of the pattern. Digitized images of the foam specimen
   under different loads are ``compared{''} using a special algorithm
   called CASI, to yield deformation maps of the specimen. Examples of
   applying this technique to testing PVC foam composites are presented in
   the paper. (C) 2008 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA, Weinheim}},

Abstract = {{We consider statistically homogeneous two-phase random piezoactive

   of a coupled stochastic boundary value problem of electroelasticity for
   the representative domain of a matrix piezocomposite with a random
   structure in the generalized singular approximation of the method of
   periodic components; the singular approximation is based on taking into
   account only the singular component of the second derivative of the
   Green function for the comparison media. We obtain an analytic solution
   for the tensor of effective properties of the piezocomposite in terms of
   the solution for the tensors of effective properties of a composite with
   an ideal periodic structure or with the ``statistical mixture{''}
   structure and with the periodicity coefficient calculated for a given
   random structure with its specific characteristics taken into account.
   The effective properties of composites with auxiliary structures
   (periodic and ``statistical mixture{''}) are also determined in the
   generalized singular approximation by varying the properties of the
   comparisonmedium. We perform numerical computations and analyze the
   effective properties of a quasiperiodic piezocomposite with reciprocal
   polarization of oriented ellipsoidal inclusions and the matrix, the
   layered structures with reciprocal polarization of the layers {[}1] of a
   polymer piezoelectric PVF, and find their unique properties such as a
   significant increase in the Young modulus along the normal to the layers

   the Poisson ratio under extension along the normal, and an increase in
   the absolute values of the basic piezomoduli.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the causal relationship between climate and criminal
   behaviour. Considering the characteristics of integer-valued time series
   of criminal incidents, we propose a modified Granger causality test
   based on the generalized auto-regressive conditional heteroscedasticity
   type of integer-valued time series models to analyse the relationship
   between the number of crimes and the temperature as an environmental
   factor. More precisely, we employ the Poisson, negative binomial and
   log-linear Poisson integer-valued generalized auto-regressive
   conditional heteroscedasticity models and particularly adopt a Bayesian
   method for our analysis. The Bayes factors and posterior probability of
   the null hypothesis help to determine the causality between the
   variables considered. Moreover, employing an adaptive Markov chain Monte
   Carlo sampling scheme, we estimate model parameters and initial values.
   As an illustration, we evaluate our test through a simulation study and,
   to examine whether or not temperature affects crime activities, we apply
   our method to data sets categorized as sexual offences, drug offences,
   theft of motor vehicles, and domestic-violence-related assault in
   Ballina, New South Wales, Australia. The result reveals that more sexual
   offences, drug offences and domestic-violence-related assaults occur
   during the summer than in other seasons of the year. This evidence
   strongly advocates a causal relationship between crime and temperature.}},

Abstract = {{For body-mounted sensor applications, the evolution of soft condensed
   matter sensor (SCMS) materials offer conformability andit enables
   mechanical compliance between the body surface and the sensing
   mechanism. A piezoresistive hybrid sensor and compliant metamaterial
   sub-structure provided a way to engineer sensor physical designs through
   modification of the mechanical properties of the compliant design. A
   piezoresistive fiber sensor was produced by combining a thermoplastic
   elastomer (TPE) matrix with Carbon Black (CB) particles in 1: 1 mass
   ratio. Feedstock was extruded in monofilament fiber form (diameter of
   300 microns), resulting in a highly stretchable sensor (strain sensor
   range up to 100\%) with linear resistance signal response.
   The soft condensed matter sensor was integrated into a hybrid design
   including a 3D printed metamaterial structure combined with a soft
   silicone. An auxetic unit cell was chosen (with negative Poisson's
   Ratio) in the design in order to combine with the soft silicon, which
   exhibits a high Poisson's Ratio. The hybrid sensor design was subjected
   to mechanical tensile testing up to 50\% strain (with gauge factor
   calculation for sensor performance), and then utilized for strain-based
   sensing applications on the body including gesture recognition and vital
   function monitoring including blood pulse-wave and breath monitoring. A
   10 gesture Natural User Interface (NUI) test protocol was utilized to
   show the effectiveness of a single wrist-mounted sensor to identify
   discrete gestures including finger and hand motions. These hand motions
   were chosen specifically for Human Computer Interaction (HCI)
   applications. The blood pulse-wave signal was monitored with the hand at
   rest, in a wrist-mounted. In addition different breathing patterns were
   investigated, including normal breathing and coughing, using a belt and
   chest-mounted configuration.}},

Abstract = {{Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) have detrimental impact on
   health-related quality of life. This study has 2 aims: first to identify
   the optimum model for LUTS study and then to explore the potential
   associated factors of LUTS and bother LUTS with the optimum model among
   adult women in China.
   The survey was conducted in 6 regions of China between February and July
   2006. A modified Chinese Bristol Female LUTS questionnaire was
   administered. The number of LUTS was the main outcome measure. The
   fitting goodness was compared to identify the optimum model with
   likelihood ratio test statistics. Zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB)
   model was used to explore the potential associated factors of LUTS and
   bother LUTS.
   Of all 18,992 respondents, 55.5\% of respondents reported one (any LUTS)
   or more LUTS (mixed LUTS) and 36.5\% of respondents reported one or more
   bother LUTS. With the largest log likelihood and smallest AIC and BIC,
   ZINB model showed the best goodness of fit. In the ZINB model, we
   identified multiple associated factors for any LUTS and mixed LUTS;
   older age (beta=0.2), overweight {[}beta=0.059, 95\%CI (0.016 similar to
   0.102)], obese {[}beta=0.143, 95\%CI (0.087 similar to 0.198)],
   postmenopausal status {[}beta=0.099, 95\%CI (0.023 similar to 0.175)],
   prolonged labor {[}beta=0.188, 95\%CI (0.104 similar to 0.272)],
   constipation {[}beta=0.309, 95\%CI (0.262 similar to 0.357)], coexisting
   pelvic organ prolapse (POP) {[}beta=0.348, 95\%CI (0.224 similar to
   0.473)], diabetes (beta=0.178, 95\%CI (0.100 similar to 0.257),
   hypertension {[}beta=0.092, 95\%CI (0.041 similar to 0.143)], smoking
   (beta=0.192, 95\%CI (0.127 similar to 0.258) and alcohol consumption
   {[}beta=0.063, 95\%CI (0.001 similar to 0.126)] increased the odds of
   mixed LUTS. We identified multiple associated factors for bother LUTS
   and mixed LUTS; older age (beta=0.1), prolonged labor {[}beta 0.153,
   95\%CI (0.031 similar to 0.275)], constipation {[}beta=0.359, 95\%CI
   (0.292 similar to 0.426)] coexisting POP (beta=0.212, {[}95\% CI (0.031
   similar to 0.393)], diabetes {[}beta=.154, 95\%CI (0.030 similar to
   0.278)], and smoking {[}beta=0.169, 95\%CI (0.076 similar to 0.262)]
   increased the odds of bother mixed LUTS.
   ZINB model was the optimum model to explore the potential associated
   factors of LUTS. Older age, coexisting POP and constipation were both
   closely related to any and bother LUTS, also the severity of LUTS.
   Compared to nulliparity, single or multiple deliveries and women who had
   perineal laceration had nothing to do with the severity of LUTS.}},

Abstract = {{We have mixed cellulose acetate and Zeocarb-225 in different ratios,
   leading to the preparations of Membrane-1 and Membrane-2. Membrane
   potential, water content, and conductance measurements have been carried
   out to estimate and analyze the data in terms of equilibria and
   important electrochemical parameters. The Donnan equilibrium has been
   incorporated to estimate the activity coefficient of counterions,
   y(p)(M), and solute, y(+/-)(M) in the membrane phase along with the
   parameter, so called phi expressing non-ideality. Dependence of the
   extent of hydrophilicity of both membranes on mean electrolyte
   concentrations has been examined. Selectivity in membranes is discussed
   in terms of dissociation equilibria, K-d(s) and K-d(f). It has been
   found that membrane Surface charge density as increases with increasing
   ofexternal NaCl concentration. Dependence ofwater d transport number and
   cationic transport number on electrolyte concentration shows a similar
   trend of variation. At higher mean concentration of electrolyte, water
   transport number in Membrane-2 has a negative value. Membrane-2 has a
   higher value of water transport number than Membrane-1. The entropy
   production due to solute and water transport has been quantified for
   both the membranes in the light of nonequilibrium thermodynamics. The
   various type of interactions Such as solute-membrane, solute-water, and
   water-membrane are analyzed in terms of friction coefficients (f(ij)) of
   Spiegler's frictional pore model. In our case, an f(wm) < f(sm) <
   f(sw)-like trend is observed in both membranes. These frictional
   coefficients show close dependence on external electrolyte
   concentrations. Pore potential values of Membrane-1 and Membrane-2 have
   been worked out using the Poisson-Boltzrnann equation. In both systems
   pore potential values increase with increasing mean electrolyte
   concentrations. The transport through Membrane-1 and Mernbrane-2 tends
   to follow diffusion-control criteria, i.e., (D-+/- center dot C center
   dot d/(D +/- CM)-C-M center dot delta) >> 2. A slightly higher value of
   solute rejection is found in Membrane-2. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{We analyze a class of signal-to-interference-and-noise-ratio (SINR)
   random graphs. These random graphs arise in the modeling packet
   transmissions in wireless networks. In contrast to previous studies on
   SINR graphs, we consider both a space and a time dimension. The spatial
   aspect originates from the random locations of the network nodes in the
   Euclidean plane. The time aspect stems from the random transmission
   policy followed by each network node and from the time variations of the
   wireless channel characteristics. The combination of these random space
   and time aspects leads to fluctuations of the SINR experienced by the
   wireless channels, which in turn determine the progression of packets in
   space and time in such a network. In this paper we study optimal paths
   in such wireless networks in terms of first passage percolation on this
   random graph. We establish both `positive' and `negative' results on the
   associated time constant. The latter determines the asymptotics of the
   minimum delay required by a packet to progress from a source node to a
   destination node when the Euclidean distance between the two tends to
   infinity. The main negative result states that this time constant is
   infinite on the random graph associated with a Poisson point process
   under natural assumptions on the wireless channels. The main positive
   result states that, when adding a periodic node infrastructure of
   arbitrarily small intensity to the Poisson point process, the time
   constant is positive and finite.}},

Title = {{Advanced imaging use in intensive care units has decreased, resulting in

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CRITICAL CARE}},

Volume = {{30}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: There has been both greater recognition and scrutiny of the
   increased use of advanced imaging. Our aim was to determine whether
   there has been a change over time in the use of computed tomography
   (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound (US) modalities in
   the intensive care units (ICUs).
   Materials and Methods: A retrospective review of 75657 admissions to 20
   ICUs was conducted. Results were analyzed with multivariate linear,
   negative binomial, and Poisson regressions. Primary outcomes were rates
   of use of CT, MRI, and US per 1000 ICU admissions every 6 months.
   Secondary outcomes were changes in radiology use associated with impacts
   on mortality, hospital length of stay (LOS), ICU LOS, and hospital
   charges.
   Results: The rate of imaging use decreased by 13.5\% between 2007 and
   2011 (incidence rate ratio {[}IRR], 0.982; P < .001). Most of this
   decrease was by CTs (21.0\%; IRR, 0.973; P < .001). Use of MRI decreased
   by 6.0\% (IRR, 0.991; P = .04), whereas US increased by 18.9\% (IRR,
   1.012; P < .001). The charges associated with imaging decreased by \$ 74
   per ICU admission, which would save an estimated \$ 1.2 million in
   charges during 2011. Decreased imaging was not associated with changes
   in mortality, hospital, and ICU LOS.
   Conclusion: Advanced imaging use decreased for 5 years in the ICUs,
   resulting in decreased charges without negative effects on patient
   outcomes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{The effect of mineralogical parameters on the mechanical properties of
   granitic rocks}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING GEOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{240}},
Pages = {{204-225}},
Month = {{JUN 5}},
Abstract = {{The mechanical properties of a given rock volume are dependent on its
   geological composition. Being able to predict these mechanical
   properties based on mineralogical parameters could prove useful in
   engineering and construction settings. The aim of this study is to
   propose relationships between mineralogical parameters and mechanical
   properties of granitic rocks. Furthermore, relevant correlations
   proposed previously in literature were analyzed within the context of a
   larger dataset.
   An extensive literature search was performed to compile a database of
   laboratory compression testing data for granitic rock. Mineralogical
   parameters and mechanical properties of 58 distinct granitic rock types
   from 12 countries were analyzed in order to obtain a more complete view
   of their interrelationships. The following geological properties were
   compiled: grain sizes (overall and mineral-specific), modal percentages
   of minerals (quartz, alkali feldspar, plagioclase, and micas), density,
   and average Mohs Hardness. The following mechanical properties were
   assessed: Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS), Brazilian Tensile
   Strength (BTS), crack initiation stress (CI), crack damage stress (CD),
   Young's Modulus (E), Poisson's ratio (v), and the Hoek-Brown constant,
   m(i). The modal percentage of mica minerals was found to have a strong
   negative correlation with crack initiation stress, crack damage stress,
   and tensile strength. Additionally, minimum overall grain size is
   strongly correlated with the CD/CI ratio. A multivariate regression
   analysis utilized various combinations of five independent variables
   (minimum overall grain size, average overall grain size, standard
   deviation of overall grain size, quartz modal percentage, and mica modal
   percentage) to predict CI, CD, and tensile strength. Multivariate
   analysis showed that the use of two geological predictor variables
   typically improved models for CI, CD, and BTS; however, the addition of
   further predictor variables produced minimal additional improvement. The
   most important finding of this analysis was that joint consideration of
   mica modal percentage and grain size parameters allows for improved
   predictions of CI, CD, and tensile strength to be made for granitic
   rock.
   Additionally, it was found that correlations proposed previously in
   literature appear to be spurious when considered in the context of the
   larger data set compiled in this research. This occurrence is most
   likely a consequence of unknown additional variables (confounding
   variables) that is correlated to both the independent and dependent
   variables used in forming the original correlations.}},

Abstract = {{Objective The aim of the study was to evaluate the validity of anal
   cytology against high-resolution anoscopy in the detection of anal
   high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs) among women in a
   clinical setting in Puerto Rico, alone and in combination with high-risk
   human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) typing. Materials and Methods A
   cross-sectional study was done among 128 eligible women who attended the
   Anal Neoplasia Clinic of the University of Puerto Rico Comprehensive
   Center between 2014 and 2019. Kappa (kappa) coefficient, sensitivity,
   specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value
   were calculated using high-resolution anoscopy with biopsy as the
   criterion standard test. Poisson regression was used to estimate the
   adjusted prevalence ratio of anal HR-HPV infection. Results Overall,
   71.1\% of women were HIV infected and 78.9\% had anal HR-HPV infection.
   Squamous intraepithelial lesions were detected with anal cytology and
   histology in 70.3\% and 81.3\% of women, respectively. The kappa
   statistic between the tests (cytology and histology) was 0.32 (p < .05).
   Measured against the results from histology, the sensitivity of anal
   cytology alone to detect HSIL was 85.4\% (95\% CI = 72.2\%-93.9\%),
   whereas specificity was 38.8\% (95\% CI = 28.1\%-50.3\%). Although the
   sensitivity of the 2 tests combined (anal cytology and HR-HPV typing) to
   detect histologically confirmed HSIL increased (100.0\%, 95\% CI =
   92.6\%-100.0\%), the specificity decreased (16.3\%, 95\% CI =
   9.0\%-26.2\%). Meanwhile, women with HSIL had a higher prevalence of
   anal HR-HPV infection than those with no SIL/LSIL (prevalence ratio =
   6.23, 95\% CI = 1.50-25.83). Conclusions Anal cytology in combination
   with HR-HPV typing for the screening of anal intraepithelial neoplasia
   improved the detection of HSIL in women.}},

Abstract = {{A micromechanical model that is based on the homogenization technique
   for periodic composites is developed for the prediction of the response
   of multiphase materials undergoing large deformations. Every one of the
   constituents is supposed to be either a rate-independent
   thermoelastoplastic material or a thermoelastic one, both of which are
   formulated in the framework of finite strains. Hyperelastic constituents
   are obtained as a special case. The resulting macroscopic ( global)
   constitutive equations of the composite involve the instantaneous
   mechanical and thermal tangent tensors. The reliability of the
   prediction is examined by comparisons with the composite cylinder
   assemblage model, which is formulated for a finite strain
   rate-independent thermoplasticity and is valid under axisymmetric
   loading. Applications are given for a system of a rubber-like matrix
   reinforced by metallic fibers. In addition, the behavior of
   rate-independent elastoplastic laminated materials undergoing large
   deformations and subjected to in-plane loading is investigated. Finally,
   the response of an elastoplastic auxetic metallic material, which is
   capable of generating a negative Poisson's ratio at any stage of a
   finite strain loading is examined by employing the proposed
   micromechanical model.}},

Title = {{A continuous crystallographic approach to generate cubic lattices and

Abstract = {{This original work proposes to investigate the transposition of
   crystallography rules to cubic lattice architectured materials to
   generate new 3D porous structures. The application of symmetry
   operations provides a complete and convenient way to configure the
   lattice architecture with only two parameters. New lattice structures
   were created by slipping from the conventional Bravais lattice toward
   non-compact complex structures. The resulting stiffness of the porous
   materials was thoroughly evaluated for all the combinations of
   architecture parameters. This exhaustive study revealed attractive
   structures having high specific stiffness, up to twice as large as the
   usual octet-truss for a given relative density. It results in a
   relationship between effective Young modulus and relative density for
   any lattice structure. It also revealed the opportunity to generate
   auxetic structures at will, with a controlled Poisson ratio. The
   collection of the elastic properties for all the cubic structures into
   3D maps provides a convenient tool for lattice materials design, for
   research, and for mechanical engineering. The resulting mechanical
   properties are highly variable according to architecture, and can be
   easily tailored for specific applications using the simple yet powerful
   formalism developed in this work.}},

Abstract = {{Maternal psychosocial stress can negatively impact gestational length
   and development of the fetus. These effects may be sex-specific but have
   not been extensively studied. The objective of this study was to examine
   the associations between prenatal maternal stress and birth outcomes and
   whether effects are modified by sex. Prenatal maternal stress was
   indexed by a maternal negative life events (NLEs) score ascertained in
   527 urban mothers; a higher NLE score indicates greater stress. Birth
   outcomes included gestational age, preterm birth (PTB) (<37?weeks), and
   birthweight for gestational age z-scores. Modified Poisson regression
   and linear models were used to evaluate associations of prenatal NLE
   scores with birth outcomes. Sex differences were assessed by inclusion
   of an interaction term for sex by NLE score and in sex-stratified
   analyses. In analyses adjusted for maternal age, education,
   race/ethnicity, and pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), increasing
   prenatal stress was associated with shortened gestational age (days)
   (??=??0.63, {[}95\% CI ?1.20, ?0.06]). This effect was sex specific,
   with increasing prenatal stress associated with shortened gestational
   age, as well as increased risk of PTB, in male infants (??=??1.35
   {[}95\% CI ?2.17, ?0.54] and RR?=?1.18 {[}95\% CI 0.99, 1.42],
   respectively) but not female infants (??=?0.15 {[}95\%CI ?0.63, 0.94]
   and RR?=?0.85, {[}95\%CI 0.65, 1.11], respectively). Prenatal stress was
   not associated with birthweight z-scores. Our results support the
   importance of psychosocial stress as a programming factor that may have
   sex-specific effects for adverse fetal outcomes. Understanding
   sex-specific effects of prenatal stress on birth outcomes may inform
   prevention strategies. LAY SUMMARY Higher stress experienced by mothers
   in pregnancy was associated with shorter length of pregnancy and the
   effect was stronger in male infants when compared to female infants.}},

   showed that Salmonella is homogenously distributed on fresh-cut leafy

   distributions were suitable to describe pathogen distribution at the
   high and medium levels, coefficient of variation modified (CV{*})

Title = {{Detecting Signals of Disproportionate Reporting from Singapore's

Abstract = {{Introduction The ability to detect safety concerns from spontaneous
   adverse drug reaction reports in a timely and efficient manner remains
   important in public health.
   Objective This paper explores the behaviour of the Sequential
   Probability Ratio Test (SPRT) and ability to detect signals of
   disproportionate reporting (SDRs) in the Singapore context.
   Methods We used SPRT with a combination of two hypothesised relative
   risks (hRRs) of 2 and 4.1 to detect signals of both common and rare
   adverse events in our small database. We compared SPRT with other
   methods in terms of number of signals detected and whether labelled
   adverse drug reactions were detected or the reaction terms were
   considered serious. The other methods used were reporting odds ratio
   (ROR), Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN) and Gamma
   Poisson Shrinker (GPS).
   Results The SPRT produced 2187 signals in common with all methods, 268
   unique signals, and 70 signals in common with at least one other method,
   and did not produce signals in 178 cases where two other methods
   detected them, and there were 403 signals unique to one of the other
   methods. In terms of sensitivity, ROR performed better than other
   methods, but the SPRT method found more new signals. The performances of
   the methods were similar for negative predictive value and specificity.
   Conclusions Using a combination of hRRs for SPRT could be a useful
   screening tool for regulatory agencies, and more detailed investigation
   of the medical utility of the system is merited.}},

Year = {{2016}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The positive ion flux exiting a low-pressure plasma discharge is a
   crucial quantity in global (volume-averaged) models. In discharges
   containing only electrons and positive ions (electropositive
   discharges), it is common to write this flux Gamma wall = h(l)n(i0)u(B),
   where n(i0) is the central positive ion density, u(B) is the positive
   ion fluid speed at the sheath edge (the Bohm speed), and h(l) is the
   positive ion edge-to-centre density ratio. There are well established
   formulae for h(l) in electropositive discharges, but for discharges
   containing negative ions (electronegative discharges), the analysis is
   more complicated. The purpose of this paper is to propose a formula for
   the h(l) factor in low-pressure electronegative discharges. We use the
   numerical solution of fluid equations with Boltzmann negative ions,
   including Poisson's equation, as a guide to derive an analytical
   expression that can easily be incorporated in global models. The
   parameter space in which the derived expression is valid is discussed at
   the end of the paper.}},

Abstract = {{The single-layer black phosphorus is characterized by its puckered
   configuration that possesses the hinge-like behavior, which leads to the
   highly anisotropic in-plane Poisson's ratios and the negative

   mechanism can be described by the angle-angle cross interaction, which,
   combined with the bond stretching and angle bending interactions, is
   able to provide a good description for the mechanical properties of
   single-layer black phosphorus. We also propose a nonlinear angle-angle
   cross interaction, which follows the form of Stillinger-Weber potential

   The novel cores were used to manufacture sandwich beams subjected to

   were also developed to simulate the flexural and failure behaviour of
   the sandwich structures. Good agreement was observed between the
   experimental and FE model results. And the validated numerical model was
   then used to perform a parametric analysis on the influence of the
   gradient core geometry over the mechanical performance of the
   structures. It was found that the aspect ratio and the extent of
   gradient (i.e. the horizontal rib length growth rate or the internal
   angle increment) have a significant influence on the flexural properties
   of the sandwich panels with angle gradient cores. (C)2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Journal = {{CEMENT \& CONCRETE COMPOSITES}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{96}},
Pages = {{252-265}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Recent advances in the design of structural composites often mimic
   natural microstructures. Specifically, the structure of abalone nacre
   with its high stiffness, tensile strength, and toughness is a source of
   inspiration from the process of evolution. The inspiration from nacre
   can lead to design of a new class of architected structural materials
   with superb mechanical properties. This work presents a combined
   experimental and computational study on a set of bioinspired architected
   composites created using a cement mortar cast with brick-and-mortar and
   auxetic polymer phases. The impact of this unit-cell polymer phase on
   the flexural and compressive strengths, resilience, and toughness is
   thoroughly studied as a function of architected geometry. All mechanical
   properties of the architected composite specimens are found to be
   greater than those of control samples due to prevention of localized
   deformation and failure, resulting in higher strength. The architected
   composites showed more layer shear sliding during fracture, whereas the
   control samples showed more diagonal shear failure. After initial
   cracking, the architected composites gradually deformed plastically due
   to interlocking elements and achieved high stresses and strains before
   failure. Results also show that composites with the architected polymer
   phase outperform control samples with equal volume fraction of a
   randomly oriented polymer fiber phase. Extensive computational studies
   of the proposed unit cells are also performed and the results suggest
   that the orientation of cells during loading is critical to achieve
   maximum performance of a cementitious composite. The implications of
   these results are immense for future development of high performing
   construction materials.}},

Title = {{Control of cellular separation using adaptive surfaces}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUIDS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{91}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{We report results from an experimental investigation of the
   three-dimensional separation produced by a high-lift aerofoil at
   moderate incidence, with constant section, where the separation is
   controlled by the implementation of an adaptive surface. Mean and
   time-resolved measurements are made using a NASA GA(W)-1 aerofoil with
   AR = 6 at Re-c = 3.5 x 10(5). Surface oil visualisation and stereo
   Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) are used to explore the flow field. The
   mean topology of the flow identifies characteristic spanwise periodic
   behaviour, ``stall cells{''}, along the surface of the model. Analysis
   of the time-dependent surface pressure shows two distinct frequencies
   within the flow field. The higher frequency appears at a Strouhal
   number, St approximate to 0.2, representative of vortex shedding, and
   the typical von Karman vortex street. The lower frequency appears at St
   approximate to 0.02, observed as a global fluctuation in stall-cell
   extent. This lower frequency is apparent in many separated flows, but in
   the present context, appears to have received only little attention. It
   correlates with widely observed low-frequency unsteadiness in the wing
   loading around stall. While this mode is analogous to that observed in
   other types of separation, here the streamwise extent of the separation
   varies because the flow is separating from a curved surface rather than
   from a sharp edge; the width of the separated region also varies. We
   show that fully-reversible point actuations of an actuated surface with
   auxetic structure, introduced immediately upstream of the saddle point
   at the leading edge of the stall cell, reduce the extent of the
   separated region. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The low in-plane modulus of honeycombs may be used for compliant
   structures with a high elastic limit while maintaining a required
   modulus. Numerical and finite element (FE) studies for a functional
   design of honeycombs having a high shear strength, (tau(pl){*})(12) and
   a high shear yield strain, (gamma(pl){*})(12) are conducted with two
   material selections-mild-steel (MS) and polycarbonate (PC) and five
   honeycomb configurations, when they are designed to be a target shear
   modulus, G(12){*} of 6.5 MPa. A numerical study of cellular materials
   theory is used to explore the elastic limit of honeycombs. FE analysis
   is also employed to validate the numerical study. Cell wall thicknesses
   are found for each material to reach the target G(12){*} for available
   cell heights with five honeycomb configurations. Both MS and PC
   honeycombs can be tailored to have the G(12){*} of 6.5 MPa with 0.1-0.5
   mm and 0.3-2.2 mm cell wall thicknesses, respectively, depending on the
   number of vertical stacks, N. The PC auxetic honeycomb with theta= -20

Title = {{The relationships between housing quality and occupant health in Uganda}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL SCIENCE \& MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{81}},
Pages = {{115-122}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The Government of Uganda created in 2010 a strategic plan to invest in
   public health as part of its broader national development goals. The
   health plan recognizes housing and urbanization as a determinant of
   health, but has not yet formulated policy to address the relationship.
   This study can help guide health policy development as it relates to
   housing. It estimates relationships between housing quality and occupant
   health using ``count outcome{''} regression models. An economic model of
   optimal household labor allocation in poor countries provides the
   foundation for the regression modeling. The data used to estimate the
   regressions are a stratified random sample of 7096 households surveyed
   in the 2005-06 Uganda National Household Survey. They provide, among
   other things, detailed information on physical housing attributes as
   well as the health status of its occupants. Consistent with the economic
   model and other empirical work, the results show that exposure to
   burning of biomass for cooking has the largest adverse health effect.
   Different definitions of illness yield results consistent with
   expectations, and a separate specification test suggests that the
   findings are reasonably robust. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper presents a gravity model of student migration flows to higher
   education institutions (HEIs) in Ireland. The analysis is performed on a
   novel dataset containing detailed information on a range of push' and
   pull' factors, allowing one to estimate the effects of a number of
   important school-level characteristics on these flows. This is achieved
   by estimating and comparing a fixed-effects Poisson model and two
   conditional fixed-effects negative binomial models and selecting the
   best model on the basis of the Akaike information criterion (AIC). The
   preferred negative binomial model accounts for over-dispersion in the
   student flow data and allows for estimation of the parameter
   coefficients of the HEI-invariant characteristics. The analysis suggests
   that while geography plays a very important role in explaining student
   flows, so too do a range of school-level characteristics. Furthermore,
   it is found that distance has a differential impact across HEIs and HEI
   types with important implications for policy-makers and HEI managers.}},

Title = {{Matching the Statistical Model to the Research Question for Dental
   Caries Indices with Many Zero Counts}},
Journal = {{CARIES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{51}},

Pages = {{198-208}},
Abstract = {{Marginalized zero-inflated count regression models have recently been
   introduced for the statistical analysis of dental caries indices and
   other zero-inflated count data as alternatives to traditional
   zero-inflated and hurdle models. Unlike the standard approaches, the
   marginalized models directly estimate overall exposure or treatment
   effects by relating covariates to the marginal mean count. This article
   discusses model interpretation and model class choice according to the
   research question being addressed in caries research. Two data sets, one
   consisting of fictional dmft counts in 2 groups and the other on DMFS
   among schoolchildren from a randomized clinical trial comparing 3
   toothpaste formulations to prevent incident dental caries, are analyzed
   with negative binomial hurdle, zero-inflated negative binomial, and
   marginalized zero-inflated negative binomial models. In the first
   example, estimates of treatment effects vary according to the type of
   incidence rate ratio (IRR) estimated by the model. Estimates of IRRs in
   the analysis of the randomized clinical trial were similar despite their
   distinctive interpretations. The choice of statistical model class
   should match the study's purpose, while accounting for the broad decline
   in children's caries experience, such that dmft and DMFS indices more
   frequently generate zero counts. Marginalized (marginal mean) models for
   zero-inflated count data should be considered for direct assessment of
   exposure effects on the marginal mean dental caries count in the
   presence of high frequencies of zero counts. (C) 2017 S. Karger AG,

   polyelectrolytes within the framework of the cell model, first reviewing
   analytical results obtained on a mean-field Poisson-Boltzmann level, and

   hexagonally packed nematic phase of the polyelectrolytes the osmotic
   coefficient is computed as a function of density. In the presence of
   multivalent counterions it can become negative, leading to effective
   attractions. This is shown to result from a reduced contribution of the
   virial part to the pressure. The osmotic coefficient and ionic
   distribution functions are computed from Poisson-Boltzmann theory with
   and without a recently proposed correlation correction. Simulation
   results for the case of poly(p-phenylene) are presented and compared

Abstract = {{The research involving the crystal structures and properties of uranyl
   carbonate minerals is essential in actinide environmental chemistry due
   to the fundamental role played by these minerals in the migration of
   actinides from uranium deposits and nuclear waste repositories and in
   the investigation of accidental site contaminations. In this work, the
   crystal structure, hydrogen bonding network, X-ray diffraction pattern
   and mechanical properties of six important uranyl carbonate minerals,
   roubaultite (Cu-2{[}(UO2)(3)(CO3)(2)(OH)(2)]center dot 4H(2)O),
   fontanite (Ca{[}(UO2)(3)(CO3)(2)(OH)(2)]center dot 6H(2)O), sharpite
   (Ca{[}(UO2)(3)(CO3)(4)(OH)(2)]center dot 3H(2)O), widenmannite
   (Pb-2{[}(UO2)(CO3)(2)(OH)(2)]), grimselite (K3Na{[}(UO2)(CO3)(3)]center
   dot H2O) and cejkaite (Na-4{[}(UO2)(CO3)(3)]), are investigated using
   first principles solid-state methods based in density functional theory.
   The determination of the positions of the hydrogen atoms in the unit
   cells of fontanite, sharpite and grimselite minerals, defining the
   hydrogen bonding network in their crystal structures, has not been
   feasible so far due to the low quality of their experimental X-ray
   diffraction patterns. The full crystal structures of these minerals are
   obtained here and their hydrogen bonding networks are studied in detail.
   Furthermore, the experimental structures of roubaultite, widenmannite
   and cejkaite, obtained by refinement from X-ray diffraction data, are
   confirmed. In the six cases, the computed unit-cell parameters and the
   associated geometrical variables are in excellent agreement with the
   available experimental information. Furthermore, the X-ray diffraction
   patterns computed from the optimized structures are in satisfactory
   agreement with their experimental counterparts. The knowledge of the
   full crystal structures, being extraordinarily relevant for many
   scientific fields, is also extremely interesting because it opens the
   possibility of determining their physico-chemical properties using the
   first principles methodology. The measurement of these properties under
   safe conditions is very expensive and complicated due to the
   radiotoxicity of these minerals. In this paper, a large set of relevant
   mechanical properties of these minerals are determined including their
   bulk, shear and Young moduli, the Poisson's ratio, ductility, hardness
   and anisotropy indices and bulk modulus pressure derivatives. These
   properties have not been measured so far and, therefore, are predicted
   here. Four of these minerals, roubaultite, fontanite, sharpite and
   widemmannite, are highly anisotropic and exhibit negative mechanical
   phenomena under the effect of small external pressures.}},

Abstract = {{Elastic properties of a class of two-dimensional model systems,
   consisted of hard cyclic multimers, are discussed. Each multimer is
   composed of m = 3k (where k is a positive integer) hard discs of
   diameter sigma and centers forming a perfect polygon of m-sides, where
   the side length is l. Close packed structures of such systems, which are
   isotropic from the point of view of elastic properties, were solved
   exactly in the close packing limit at zero temperature. It was shown
   that the Poisson ratio, v(p), of the multimers is negative when their
   roughness parameter, defined as alpha equivalent to 1/(2sigma), is
   large. In the limit m --> infinity obtains hard disc-like particles,
   which in contrast to the standard hard discs are rough. It is
   conjectured that the formula obtained for the Poisson ratio of the
   3k-multimers, v(p) = (1 - 2alpha(2))/(3 - 2alpha(2)), is valid also for
   m not equal 3k in the limit m --> infinity.}},

Abstract = {{Background
   Prevalence estimates of anal high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) are
   needed in sub-Saharan Africa where HIV is endemic. This study evaluated
   anal HR-HPV in Nigeria among HIV-positive and HIV-negative men who have
   sex with men (MSM) for future immunization recommendations.
   Methods
   We conducted a cross-sectional study to compare the prevalence of anal
   HR-HPV infections between 64 HIV-negative and 90 HIV-positive MSM.
   Multivariate Poisson regression analyses were used to examine
   demographic and behavioral risk factors associated with any HR-HPV
   infections.
   Results
   The median age of the 154 participants was 25 years (interquartile
   range, 22-28 years; range, 16-38 years), and the median age at
   initiation of anal sex with another man was 16 years (interquartile
   range, 13-18 years; range, 7-29 years). The prevalence of anal HR-HPV
   was higher among HIV-positive than HIV-negative MSM (91.1\% vs. 40.6\%,
   P < 0.001). In the multivariate analysis, HIV infection (adjusted
   prevalence ratio {[}aPR], 2.02; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI],
   1.49-2.72), 10 years or more since anal sexual debut (aPR, 1.26; 95\%
   CI, 1.07-1.49), and concurrent relationships with men (aPR, 1.32; 95\%
   CI, 1.04-1.67) were associated with increased anal HR-HPV prevalence.
   Conclusions
   Anal HR-HPV infection is high for young Nigerian MSM, and rates are
   amplified in those coinfected with HIV. Providing universal coverage as
   well as catch-up immunization for young MSM may be an effective anal
   cancer prevention strategy in Nigeria.}},

Abstract = {{The theory of selfadjoint extensions of symmetric operators, and more
   generally the theory of extensions of dual pairs, was implemented some
   years ago for boundary value problems for elliptic operators on smooth
   bounded domains. Recently, the questions have been taken up again for
   nonsmooth domains. In the present work we show that pseudodifferential
   methods can be used to obtain a full characterization, including Krein
   resolvent formulas, of the realizations of nonselfadjoint second-order
   operators on C3/2+epsilon domains; more precisely, we treat domains with
   B-p,2(3/2)-smoothness and operators with H-q(1)-coefficients, for
   suitable p > 2(n - 1) and q > n. The advantage of the pseudodifferential
   boundary operator calculus is that the operators are represented by a
   principal part and a lower-order remainder, leading to regularity
   results; in particular we analyze resolvents, Poisson solution operators
   and Dirichlet-to-Neumann operators in this way, also in Sobolev spaces
   of negative order. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The Phase I applications of the statistical profile monitoring have
   recently been extended to the case when the response variable is binary.
   We are motivated to undertake the current research in an attempt to try
   to provide a unified framework for the Phase I control in the context of
   statistical profile monitoring that can be used to tackle a large class
   of response variables, such as continuous, count, or categorical
   response variables. The unified framework is essentially based on
   applying the change point model to the class of generalized linear
   models. The proposed Phase I control chart is assessed and compared with
   the existing charts under binomial and Poisson profiles. Some diagnostic
   procedures are also discussed. A real data set obtained from a test lab
   concerning the dispersion of carbon black filler in a rubber mix is used
   to demonstrate how the proposed chart can be used in practical
   applications. Some future research directions are also discussed.

Abstract = {{The structure and phase stability of binary tungsten-vanadium and
   tungsten-tantalum alloys are investigated over a broad range of alloy
   compositions using ab initio and cluster expansion methods. The alloys
   are characterized by the negative enthalpy of mixing across the entire
   composition range. Complex intermetallic compounds are predicted by ab
   initio calculations as the lowest energy structures for both alloys. The
   effect of atomic relaxation on the enthalpy of mixing is almost
   negligible in W-V, but is substantial in W-Ta alloys. Canonical Monte
   Carlo simulations are used for predicting the order-disorder transition
   temperatures for both alloys. Differences in the short-range order
   between the two alloys are explained by the opposite signs of the second
   nearest-neighbour cluster interaction coefficients for W-V and W-Ta.
   Using the predicted ground-state structures, we evaluate the monovacancy
   formation energies and show that in W-Ta alloys they are highly
   sensitive to the alloy composition and the local environment of a
   vacancy site, varying from 3 to 5 eV. In the dilute tungsten alloy
   limit, a < 111 > self-interstitial atom crowdion defect forms a
   configuration strongly bound to a vanadium solute atom, whereas
   interaction between the same defect and a tantalum solute atom is
   repulsive. Values of elastic constants computed for all the ground-state
   structures and several metastable cubic alloy structures are used for
   assessing the effect of alloying on mechanical properties. Values of the
   Young modulus and the Poisson ratio, as well as the empirical
   Rice-Thompson criterion, are applied to screening the alloys, to assess
   the effect of chemical composition on ductility.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this article is to provide some insights on the
   osmo-inelastic response under stretching of annulus fibrosus of the
   intervertebral disc. Circumferentially oriented specimens of square
   cross section, extracted from different regions of bovine cervical discs
   (ventral-lateral and dorsal-lateral), are tested under different
   strain-rates and saline concentrations within normal range of strains.
   An accurate optical strain measuring technique, based upon digital image
   correlation, is used in order to determine the full-field displacements
   in the lamellae and fibers planes of the layered soft tissue. Annulus
   stress-stretch relationships are measured along with full-field
   transversal strains in the two planes. The mechanical response is found
   hysteretic, rate-dependent and osmolarity-dependent with a Poisson's
   ratio higher than 0.5 in the fibers plane and negative (auxeticity) in
   the lamellae plane. While the stiffness presents a regional-dependency
   due to variations in collagen fibers content/orientation, the
   strain-rate sensitivity of the response is found independent on the
   region. A significant osmotic effect is found on both the auxetic
   response in the lamellae plane and the stiffness rate-sensitivity. These
   local experimental observations will result in more accurate
   chemo-mechanical modeling of the disc annulus and a clearer multi-scale
   understanding of the disc intervertebral function.}},

Abstract = {{The structural and dynamic properties of the mineral Cooperite (PtS) are
   investigated using density-functional theory. The results show that a
   competition with the less symmetric but more compact PdS structure leads
   to a phase transition when the pressure is increased. However, before
   the phase transition, PtS displays a rare anomalous elastic behavior by
   expanding along its long axis under hydrostatic pressure. We report the

   compressibility in the context of a displacive phase transition. We also
   show that the real structure of PtS is less symmetric than originally

Abstract = {{In this paper a concept of hexagonal chiral honeycomb is proposed as a
   truss-like internal structure for adaptive wing box configurations. In
   contrast with classical centresymmetric cellular structures like
   rectangular or hexagonal grids, the proposed honeycomb did not present
   inversion symmetry, and featured an in-plane negative Poisson's ratio
   behaviour. The cellular structure considered exhibited this Poisson's
   ratio behaviour under a large range of strain. A set of numerical
   (finite element, FE) simulations have been carried out in order to
   correct the initial theoretical predictions to take into account axial,
   shear and elastic deformations of all elements composing the unit cell
   when subjected to uniaxial loading. The homogenized linear elastic
   mechanical properties were then introduced in an FE wing box model of a
   racecar wing coupled to a panel code to simulate unidirectional static
   fluid-structure coupling between the wing box and the flow surrounding
   the airfoil. The cellular solid proposed as the internal layout of the
   wing box allowed conforming deformations with the external flow, giving
   a variation of the camber line and trailing edge displacement, and
   acting as an aileron.}},

Abstract = {{Technological progress allows for an ever-faster acquisition of
   hyperspectral data, challenging the users to keep up with interpreting
   the recorded data. Matrix factorization, the representation of data sets
   by bases (or loads) and coefficient (or score) images is long used to
   support the interpretation of complex data sets. We propose in this
   publication Simplex Volume Maximization (SiVM) for the analysis of X-ray
   fluorescence (XRF) imaging data sets. SiVM selects archetypical data
   points that represents the data set and thus provides easily
   understandable bases, preserves the non-negative character of XRF data
   sets and has low demands concerning computing resources. We apply SiVM
   on an XRF data set of Hans Memling's Portrait of a man from the
   Lespinette family from the collection of the Mauritshuis (The Hague, NL)
   and discuss capabilities and shortcomings of SiVM. (C) 2017 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The half-metallic, mechanical, and transport properties of the
   quaternary Hensler compound of PdZrTiAl is discussed under hydrostatic
   pressures in the range of -11.4 GPa to 18.4 GPa in the framework of the
   density functional theory (DFT) and Boltzmann quasi-classical theory
   using the generalization gradient approximation (GGA). By applying the
   stress, the band gap in the minor spin increases so that the lowest band
   is obtained 0.25 eV at the pressure of -11.4 GPa while the maximum gap
   is calculated 0.9 eV at the pressure of 18.4 GPa. In all positive and
   negative pressures, the PdZrTiAl composition exhibits a half-metallic
   behavior 100\% spin polarization at the Fermi level. It is also found
   that applying stress increases the Seebeck coefficient in both spin
   directions. In the minority spin, the n-type PdZrTiAl, the power factor
   (PF) for all the cases is greater in the equilibrium state than the
   strain and stress conditions whereas in the majority spin, the PF value
   of the stress state is greater than the other two. The non-dimensional
   figure of merit (ZT) is significant and is about one in spin down in the
   room temperature for the all pressure states that it remains on this
   value by applying pressure. The obtained elastic constants indicate that
   the PdZrTiAl crystalline structure has a mechanical stability. Based on
   the Yong (E), Bulk (B) and shear (G) modulus and Poisson (n) ratio, the
   brittle-ductile behavior of this compound has been investigated under
   pressure. The results indicate that PdZrTiAl has a ductile nature and it
   is a stiffiless compound in which elastic and mechanical instability
   increases by applying strain.}},

Month = {{JAN 9}},
Abstract = {{Following the advent of electromagnetic metamaterials, researchers
   working in wave physics have translated concepts of engineered media to
   acoustics, elastodynamics and diffusion processes. In elastodynamics,
   seismic metamaterials have emerged in the last decade for soft soils
   structured at the meter scale, and have been tested with full-scale
   experiments on holey soils. Born in the soil, seismic metamaterials have
   emerged from the field of tuned-resonators buried in the soil, around
   building's foundations or near the soil-structure interface as local
   seismic isolators. Forests of trees have been interpreted as
   above-surface resonators, and coined natural seismic metamaterials. We
   first review some advances made in seismic metamaterials and dress an
   inventory of which material parameters can be achieved and which cannot,
   from the effective medium theory perspective. We envision future
   developments of large scale auxetic metamaterials for building's
   foundations, above surface resonators for seismic protection and
   metamaterial-like transformed urbanism at the city scale. (C) 2019

Abstract = {{Recently, the Neotropical brown stink bug, Euschistus heros
   (Pentatomidae: Hemiptera), has been detected in cotton in the Brazilian
   Cerrado. Several reliable surveys have been conducted on the spatial
   distribution of stink bugs in soybean; however, few studies have
   examined the behavior of this insect in cotton in Brazil. Thus, this
   study examined the spatial distribution of E. heros in cotton using
   aggregation indices based on the variance-to-mean ratio, Morisita index,
   exponent k, Poisson and negative binomial distributions. Inverse
   Distance Weighting interpolation maps were also used to represent insect
   density. The study was conducted in a 1.1 hectare experimental cotton
   field in which 64 equally-sized plots were sampled on a weekly basis.
   Our findings revealed that stink bugs presented an aggregate
   distribution in 2 sampling weeks based on aggregation indices, and this
   pattern was best described by a negative binomial distribution. Maps
   showing the density of pests can be an important tool for sampling pests
   in crops and control measures in early stages of infestation, when there
   is an edge effect on the distribution of E. heros, can be an efficient
   strategy in cotton.}},

Abstract = {{Ubiquitous in nature and finding applications in engineering systems,
   cellular solids are an increasingly important class of materials. Foams
   are an important subclass of cellular solids with applications as
   packing materials and energy absorbers due to their unique properties. A
   better understanding of foam mechanical properties and their dependence
   on microstructural details would facilitate manufacture of tailored
   materials and development of constitutive models for their bulk
   response. Numerical simulation of these materials, while offering great
   promise toward furthering understanding, has also served to convincingly
   demonstrate the inherent complexity and associated modeling challenges.
   The large range of deformations which foams are subjected to in routine
   engineering applications is a fundamental source of complication in
   modeling the details of foam deformation on the scale of foam struts. It
   requires accurate handling of large material deformations and complex
   contact mechanics, both well established numerical challenges. A further
   complication is the replication of complex foam microstructure geometry
   in numerical simulations. Here various advantages of certain particle
   methods, in particular their compatibility with the determination of
   three-dimensional geometry via X-ray microtomography, are exploited to
   simulate the compression of ``real{''} foam microstructures into
   densification. With attention paid to representative volume element
   size, predictions are made regarding bulk response, dynamic effects, and
   deformed microstructural character, for real polymeric, open-cell foams.
   These predictions include a negative Poisson's ratio in the stress
   plateau, and increased difficulty in removing residual porosity during
   densification. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Title = {{In-plane compression behaviors of the auxetic star honeycomb:
   Experimental and numerical simulation}},
Journal = {{AEROSPACE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{115}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{In this study, two types of star honeycombs with different cell-wall
   angles were fabricated by additive manufacturing technology for in-plane
   compression tests. Experiment results show that the cell-wall angle has
   no evident effect on the deformation modes, but the small cell-wall
   angle can improve the energy absorption capacity of star honeycombs. In
   addition, the unilateral horizontal maximum strain (UHMS) is proposed to
   evaluate the deformation stability of the honeycomb. Subsequently,
   numerical simulations are conducted to further investigate the
   influences of macro and micro geometric parameters on the in-plane
   compression behavior of star honeycombs. The results show that reducing
   the orthogonal array ratio and length of the ligament can significantly
   enhance the deformation stability and energy absorption capacity.
   Moreover, in accordance with the deformation mechanisms of a typical
   cell, a theoretical model is established to predict the plateau stress
   of star honeycomb under quasi-static loading. The theoretical results
   are in good agreement with the simulation results. Finally, three types
   of improved star honeycombs (ISH) are constructed by adjusting the
   ligament length, which improved the specific energy absorption by 30\%
   compared with the classic star honeycomb. Besides, the ISH-II exhibits a
   stable deformation mode with a significant NPR effect. The results are
   expected to provide references for designing and optimizing the star
   honeycomb structure. (C) 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Periodic cellular configurations with negative Poisson's ratio have
   attracted the attention of several researchers because of their superior
   dynamic characteristics. Among the geometries with a negative Poisson's
   ratio, the chiral topology features localized deformed configurations
   when excited at one of its natural frequencies. This is of particular
   importance as resonance can be exploited to minimize the power required
   for the appearance of localized deformations, thus giving practicality
   to the concept. The particular nature of these deformed configurations
   and the authority provided by the chiral geometry suggest the
   application of the proposed structural configuration for the design of
   innovative lifting devices, such as helicopter rotor blades or airplane
   wings. The dynamic characteristics of chiral structures are here
   investigated through a numerical model and experimental investigations.
   The numerical formulation uses dynamic shape functions to accurately
   describe the behavior of the considered structural assembly over a wide
   frequency range. The model is used to predict frequency response
   functions, and to investigate the occurrence of localized deformations.
   Experimental tests are also performed to demonstrate the accuracy of the
   model and to illustrate the peculiarities of the behavior of the
   considered chiral structures.}},

Abstract = {{As interesting analog of black phosphorus, group-IV monochalcogenides MX
   (M = Ge, Sn; X = S, Se) are greatly expected to have potential
   applications in photodetectors, photovoltaics, thermoelectric, and
   piezoelectric devices. In this paper, we conduct a thorough
   investigation on the mechanical properties of four MX monochalcogenides,
   i.e., single-and multi-layered GeS, GeSe, SnS, and SnSe, including their
   ideal tensile strength, evolution of monolayer bulking height, and phase
   transition under uniaxial strain within the framework of density
   functional theory. The ultimate tensile strengths of the four
   monochalcogenides are found rather low, while the failure strains are
   remarkably high, showing ultrahigh mechanical flexibility. Meanwhile,
   the ideal strength demonstrates strong anisotropy, which may induce the
   exfoliated MX thin flakes showing an obvious in-plane cleavage tendency
   of much easier to crack along the zigzag orientation. In addition, it is
   found that all of them are potential auxetic materials with large
   negative Poisson's ratios, just like single-layer black phosphorus.
   Furthermore, we find all the monolayer monochalcogenides will
   demonstrate geometrical phase transition when uniaxial compressive
   strains are applied. It is expected that these newly found unique
   features of monolayer group-IV monochalcogenides and their derivatives
   make them attractive candidates for their incorporation in future
   mechanical, nanoelectronics, and thermal applications.}},

Abstract = {{The shock responses of three kinds of honeycomb cores have been
   investigated and analyzed based on explicit dynamics analysis. According
   to the real geometric configuration and the current main manufacturing
   methods of aluminum alloy honeycomb cores, the finite element models of
   honeycomb cores with three different cellular configurations
   (conventional hexagon honeycomb core, rectangle honeycomb core and
   auxetic honeycomb core with negative Poisson's ratio) have been
   established through FEM parametric modeling method based on Python and
   Abaqus. In order to highlight the impact response characteristics of the
   above three honeycomb cores, a 5 mm thick panel with the same mass and
   material was taken as contrast. The analysis results showed that the
   peak values of longitudinal acceleration history curves of the three
   honeycomb cores were lower than those of the aluminum alloy panel in all
   three reference points under the loading of a longitudinal pulse
   pressure load with the peak value of 1 MPa and the pulse width of 1 mu
   s. It could be concluded that due to the complex reflection and
   diffraction of stress wave induced by shock in honeycomb structures, the
   impact energy was redistributed which led to a decrease in the peak
   values of the longitudinal acceleration at the measuring points of
   honeycomb cores relative to the panel.}},

   microstructure}},

Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{45-50}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Structural, discrete and continual models of the Cosserat triangular
   lattice with a chiral microstructure are elaborated. The structural
   model is constructed on the base of particles of finite size with
   complex spring bonds. With symmetric diagonal bonds, one has the usual
   Cosserat triangular lattice, while with different diagonal bonds the
   Cosserat lattice with a chiral microstructure is realized. The choice of
   different variants enables one to compare the lattices with the ordinary
   and chiral microstructures and to select the specific properties caused
   by the chirality. For this purpose, the problems for the hexagonal cell
   are solved. In the first problem, the behaviour of the cell under a
   uniform compression (tension) of the cell is investigated. The ordinary
   lattice is compressed (elongated) in the direction of the force action.
   The particles of the chiral cell deviate from the direction of the force
   action during their displacements. The direction of the deviation is
   different for compressive (tensile) forces, i.e. the chiral lattice
   responds qualitatively differently to compression and tension. In the
   second problem, the top and bottom layers of the cell are rigidly
   compressed (stretched). The middle layer of the ordinary lattice is then
   stretched (compressed). This is a typical reaction of ordinary materials
   to tension (compression). The particles displace along the layer. In the
   chiral lattice, the middle layer is compressed under compression and is
   stretched under tension of the cell, i.e. chiral cell possesses the
   auxeticity property. In this case, the middle layer is inclined. The
   direction of inclination is different for compression or tension. Thus,
   the chirality effect is manifested. On the basis of the discrete model,
   equations of the continuum micropolar model are obtained. For symmetric
   connections, one has equations of the ordinary micropolar theory. The
   chiral lattice enables one to obtain equations of the chiral micropolar
   theory and to select the terms of the equations provided by chirality.
   Using the continuum model, one can find the values of the parameters,
   for which the second-order derivatives disappear in the rotational
   equations for the triangular lattice. Thus, it is possible to select a
   special case of parameters, for which the lattice is described by the
   equations of the reduced Cosserat theory.}},

   results regarding their covariance function exist. In the present paper,
   we study this covariance and, in particular, we state both necessary and
   sufficient conditions for it to be positive, zero or negative in terms
   of reliability classifications and the coefficient of variation of the
   underlying inter-renewal and the associated equilibrium distribution.
   Our results apply either for an ordinary renewal process in the steady

Abstract = {{Lattice structures are used in the design of metamaterials to achieve
   unusual physical, mechanical, or biological properties. The properties
   of such metamaterials result from the topology of the lattice
   structures, which are usually three-dimensionally (3D) printed. To
   incorporate advanced functionalities into metamaterials, the surface of
   the lattice structures may need to be ornamented with
   functionality-inducing features, such as nano-patterns or electronic
   devices. Given our limited access to the internal surfaces of lattice
   structures, free-form ornamentation is currently impossible. We present
   lattice structures that are folded from initially flat states and show
   that they could bear arbitrarily complex surface ornaments at different
   scales. We identify three categories of space-filling polyhedra as the
   basic unit cells of the cellular structures and, for each of those,
   propose a folding pattern. We also demonstrate ``sequential
   self-folding{''} of flat constructs to 3D lattices. Furthermore, we
   folded auxetic mechanical metamaterials from flat sheets and measured
   the deformation-driven change in their negative Poisson's ratio.
   Finally, we show how free-form 3D ornaments could be applied on the
   surface of flat sheets with nanometer resolution. Together, these
   folding patterns and experimental techniques present a unique platform
   for the fabrication of metamaterials with unprecedented combination of
   physical properties and surface-driven functionalities.}},

Title = {{Lasting s-ketamine block of spreading depolarizations in subarachnoid
   hemorrhage: a retrospective cohort study}},
Journal = {{CRITICAL CARE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{DEC 30}},
Abstract = {{Objective: Spreading depolarizations (SD) are characterized by breakdown
   of transmembrane ion gradients and excitotoxicity. Experimentally,
   N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonists block a majority of
   SDs. In many hospitals, the NMDAR antagonist s-ketamine and the GABAA
   agonist midazolam represent the current second-line combination
   treatment to sedate patients with devastating cerebral injuries. A
   pressing clinical question is whether this option should become
   first-line in sedation-requiring individuals in whom SDs are detected,
   yet the s-ketamine dose necessary to adequately inhibit SDs is unknown.
   Moreover, use-dependent tolerance could be a problem for SD inhibition
   in the clinic.
   Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study of 66 patients with
   aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) from a prospectively collected
   database. Thirty-three of 66 patients received s-ketamine during
   electrocorticographic neuromonitoring of SDs in neurointensive care. The
   decision to give s-ketamine was dependent on the need for stronger
   sedation, so it was expected that patients receiving s-ketamine would
   have a worse clinical outcome.
   Results: S-ketamine application started 4.2 +/- 3.5 days after aSAH. The
   mean dose was 2.8 +/- 1.4 mg/kg body weight (BW)/h and thus higher than
   the dose recommended for sedation. First, patients were divided
   according to whether they received s-ketamine at any time or not. No
   significant difference in SD counts was found between groups (negative
   binomial model using the SD count per patient as outcome variable, p =
   0.288). This most likely resulted from the fact that 368 SDs had already
   occurred in the s-ketamine group before s-ketamine was given. However,
   in patients receiving s-ketamine, we found a significant decrease in SD
   incidence when s-ketamine was started (Poisson model with a random
   intercept for patient, coefficient - 1.83 (95\% confidence intervals -
   2.17; -1.50), p < 0.001; logistic regression model, odds ratio (OR) 0.13
   (0.08; 0.19), p < 0.001). Thereafter, data was further divided into
   low-dose (0.1-2.0 mg/kg BW/h) and high-dose (2.1-7.0 mg/kg/h) segments.
   High-dose s-ketamine resulted in further significant decrease in SD
   incidence (Poisson model, - 1.10 (- 1.71; - 0.49), p < 0.001; logistic
   regression model, OR 0.33 (0.17; 0.63), p < 0.001). There was little
   evidence of SD tolerance to long-term s-ketamine sedation through 5
   days.
   Conclusions: These results provide a foundation for a multicenter,
   neuromonitoring-guided, proof-of-concept trial of ketamine and midazolam
   as a first-line sedative regime.}},

Abstract = {{A brief review is given of the effect of porosity on the Poisson ratio
   of a porous material. In contrast to elastic moduli such as K, G, or E,
   which always decrease with the addition of pores into a matrix, the
   Poisson ratio nu may increase, decrease, or remain the same, depending
   on the shape of the pores, and on the Poisson ratio of the matrix phase,
   nu o . In general, for a given pore shape, there is a unique critical
   Poisson ratio, nu c , such that the addition of pores into the matrix
   will cause the Poisson ratio to increase if nu o < nu c , decrease if nu
   o > nu c , and remain unchanged if nu o = nu c . The critical Poisson
   ratio for spherical pores is 0.2, for prolate spheroidal pores is close
   to 0.2, and tends toward zero for thin cracks. For two-dimensional
   materials, nu c = 1 / 3 for circular pores, 0.306 for squares, 0.227 for
   equilateral triangles, and again approaches 0 for thin cracks. The
   presence of a ``trapped{''} fluid in the pore space tends to cause nu c
   to increase, and for the range of parameters that may occur in rocks or
   concrete, this increase is more pronounced for thin crack-like pores
   than for equi-dimensional pores. Measurements of the Poisson ratio
   therefore may allow insight into pore geometry and pore fluid. If the
   matrix phase is strongly auxetic, small amounts of porosity will
   generally not cause the Poisson ratio to become positive.}},

Abstract = {{Very recently, a black-phosphorus-like nitrogen (bp-N) bulk has been
   synthesized in high-pressure experiments {[}D. Laniel, et al., Phys.
   Rev. Let., 2020, 124, 216001 and C. Ji, et al., Sci. Adv., 2020, 6,
   eaba9206]. However, the corresponding bp-N monolayer, i.e. a puckered N
   nanosheet, is unstable, which will decompose to loose N zigzag lines.
   Based on first-principles calculations, we find that the puckered
   geometry can be stabilized by inserting C-2 dimers between the upper and
   lower N zigzag lines. The formed C2N2 nanosheet possesses good
   energetic, dynamical, mechanical, thermal and chemical stabilities,
   which can maintain the free-standing state even in the presence of O-2
   gas. Owing to the phosphorene-like geometrical character, this C2N2
   nanosheet exhibits an auxetic mechanical behaviour with a negative
   Poisson's ratio in the out-of-plane direction. The C2N2 nanosheet is an
   indirect-gap semiconductor with a noticeable linear dichroism. More
   interestingly, a giant anisotropy appears in the hole mobility of the
   C2N2 nanosheet, which has a high (low) hole mobility of about 1700 (20)
   cm(2) V-1 s(-1) along the armchair (zigzag) direction. The corresponding
   anisotropic ratio is as large as 85 in the C2N2 nanosheet, which is the
   maximum mobility anisotropy reported in two-dimensional materials. The
   high hole mobility and large anisotropic ratio are also preserved in the
   multilayer C2N2 nanosheets. Our study demonstrates that the puckered
   N-based nanosheets possess robust structural stabilities and
   unconventional physical properties, which endow the system with many
   potential applications in flexible electronics, optoelectronics, and
   direction-sensitive sensors.}},

Abstract = {{Microbial colony counts of concern of food products are one of the most
   important items in microbiological examinations. The distributions of
   colony counts per agar plate of food samples are considered to be
   reflected with microbial cell distributions in food homogenates.
   However, (i) the probabilistic distributions of the colony counts per
   agar plate at the dilution of counting and (ii) the relationship between
   the colony counts per plate and the number of agar plates for food
   samples have not been intensively studied so far. In this study,
   therefore, these two points were studied with raw food samples of raw
   minced beef and chicken and raw milk and microbial culture samples of
   Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
   Among four major probabilistic distributions, it was found that aerobic
   plate counts per plate of the foods were well described with negative
   binomial, Poisson, and normal distributions and that the colony counts
   per plate of microbial cultures were described well with binomial,
   Poisson, and normal distributions. The effect of the number of agar
   plates on the estimation of the mean of colony counts per plate of a
   sample was then studied with the data randomly resampled from the
   experimental data. The resampled data showed that with more number of
   plates the mean of counts fluctuated less and the coefficients of
   variation of colony counts per plate decreased further, which were
   coincident to the estimated by the central limit theory. Our study would
   provide useful information on the characteristics of colony counts per
   plate of food samples which are routinely examined.}},

   extensive use in many applications. In particular, there have been
   various studies aimed at expressing the mechanical properties of
   honeycombs in terms of the geometrical parameters used to describe the
   structure of such honeycombs. Despite improvements over the first
   established model, finite element simulations performed in this work on
   honeycombs having ribs with a realistic thickness-to-length ratio
   suggest that the mechanical properties for such systems differ from
   those predicted by current models, sometimes to a very significant
   extent. In view of this, we analyse in detail the deformed structures in
   an attempt to gain insight into how and the extent to which the shape of
   the ligaments, in particular its thickness and mode of connection
   affects deformation in conventional and re-entrant hexagonal honeycombs.
   Based on these observations, we propose a modified version of the
   previous analytical models that take into consideration the finite
   thickness of the ligaments.}},

   an observational cohort study}},

Abstract = {{Background In patients with HIV, immune reconstitution after
   antiretroviral therapy (ART) is often incomplete. We assessed the
   probability of patients reaching a CD4/CD8 ratio of 1 or more after the
   start of ART and its association with the onset of non-AIDS-defi ning
   events and death.
   Methods We did an analysis of the ICONA cohort, which recruited
   treatment-naive patients with HIV in Italy. We included participants in
   the cohort who started ART, reached an undetectable viral load (<= 80
   copies per mL), and had a CD4/CD8 ratio of less than 0.8 at the time of
   an undetectable viral load. We defined ratio normalisation in patients
   as two consecutive values of 1 or more. We used Kaplan-Meier curves to
   estimate the cumulative probability of ratio normalisation. We then used
   Poisson regression models to identify factors independently associated
   with normalisation and with progression to non-AIDS-defi ning events or
   death.
   Findings We included 3236 participants, enrolled between Jan 22, 1997,
   and Feb 25, 2013. At the start of ART, median CD4/CD8 ratio in our
   population was 0.39 (IQR 0.26-0.55). 458 (14\%) patients reached a
   CD4/CD8 ratio of 1 or more; the estimated probability of normalisation
   was 4.4\% (95\% CI 3.7-5.2) by 1 year from baseline, 11.5\% (10.2-13.0)
   by 2 years, and 29.4\% (26.7-32.4) by 5 years. Factors associated with
   normalisation were high pre-ART CD4 cell counts, a high CD4/CD8 ratio at
   baseline, and negative cytomegalovirus serological findings. The
   incidence rate of non-AIDS-defi ning events for patients with a CD4/CD8
   ratio of less than 0.30 (4.2 per 100 patient-years, 95\% CI 3.4-5.3) was
   double that for those with a ratio of 0.30-0.45 (2.3, 2.1-2.5) or more
   than 0.45 (2.2, 1.7-2.9). A ratio of less than 0.30 was independently
   associated with an increased risk of non-AIDS-defi ning events or death
   compared with one of more than 0.45.
   Interpretation Few patients had normalised CD4/CD8 ratios, even though
   they had viral suppression. Low ratios were associated with increased
   risk of serious events and deaths. The CD4/CD8 ratio could be used by
   clinicians to identity patients at risk of non-AIDS-related events.}},

Pages = {{189-199}},
Abstract = {{Spatial pattern of a biotic population may change over time as its
   component individuals grow or die out, but whether this is the case for
   desert annual plants is largely unknown. Here we examined seasonal
   changes in spatial patterns of two annuals, Eriogonum abertianum and
   Haplopappus gracilis, in initial (winter) and final (summer) densities.
   The density was measured as the number of individuals from 384 permanent
   quadrats (each 0.5 m x 0.5 m) in the Chihuahuan Desert near Portal,
   Arizona, USA. We used three probability distributions (binomial,
   Poisson, and negative binomial or NB) that represent three basic spatial
   patterns (regular, random, and clumped) to fit the observed frequency
   distributions of densities of the two annuals. Both species showed clear
   clumped patterns as characterized by the NB and had similar inverse
   J-shaped frequency distribution curves in two density categories. Also,
   both species displayed a reduced degree of aggregation from winter to
   summer after the spring drought (massive die-off), as indicated by the
   increased k-parameter of the NB and decreased values of another NB
   parameter p, variance/mean ratio, Lloyd's Index of Patchiness, and David
   and Moore's Index of Clumping. Further, we hypothesized that while the
   NB (i.e., Poisson-logarithmic) well fits the distribution of individuals
   per quadrat, its components, the Poisson and logarithmic, may describe
   the distributions of clumps per quadrat and of individuals per clump,
   respectively. We thus obtained the means and variances for (1)
   individuals per quadrat, (2) clumps per quadrat, and (3) individuals per
   clump. The results showed that the decrease of the density from winter
   to summer for each plant resulted from the decrease of individuals per
   clump, rather than from the decrease of clumps per quadrat. The great
   similarities between the two annuals indicate that our observed temporal
   changes in spatial patterns may be common among desert annual plants.}},

Title = {{Measuring aggregation in parasite populations}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY INTERFACE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{165}},
Month = {{APR 29}},
Abstract = {{Aggregation, a fundamental feature of parasite distributions, has been
   measured using a variety of indices. We use the definition that
   parasite-host system A is more aggregated than parasite-host system B if
   any given proportion of the parasite population is concentrated in a
   smaller proportion of the host population A than of host population B.
   This leads to indices based on the Lorenz curve such as the Gini index
   (Poulin's D), coefficient of variation and the Hoover index, all of
   which measure departure from a uniform distribution. The Hoover index is
   particularly useful because it can be interpreted directly in terms of
   parasites and hosts. An alternative view of aggregation is degree of
   departure from a Poisson (or random) distribution, as used in the index
   of dispersion and the negative binomial k. These and Lloyd's mean
   crowding index are reinterpreted and connected back to Lorenz curves.
   Aggregation has occasionally been defined as the slope from Taylor's
   law, although the slope appears unrelated to other indices. The Hoover
   index may be the method of choice when data points are available, and
   the coefficient of variation when only variance and mean are given.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, after a review of the most common financial strategies
   and products that insurance companies use to hedge catastrophic risks,
   we study an option pricing model based on processes with jumps where the
   catastrophic event is captured by a compound Poisson process with
   negative jumps. Given the importance that catastrophe equity put options
   (CatEPuts) have in this context, we introduce a pricing approach that
   provides not only a theoretical contribution whose applicability remains
   confined to purely numerical examples and experiments, but which can be
   implemented starting from real data and applied to the evaluation of
   real CatEPuts. We propose a calibration framework based on historical
   log-returns, market capitalization and option implied volatilities. The
   calibrated parameters are then considered to price CatEPuts written on
   the stock of the main Italian insurance company over the high volatile
   period from January to April 2020. We show that the ratio between
   plain-vanilla put options and CatEPuts strictly depends on the shape of
   the implied volatility smile and it varies over time.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN MATERIALS}},

Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{The energy absorption and structural isolation performance of
   axially-compressed sandwich structures constructed with stiff face
   plates separated with an auxetic lattice core metamaterial is studied.
   Advances in additive manufacturing increasingly allow bespoke, carefully
   designed, structures to be included within the core lattice to enhance
   mechanical performance. Currently, the internal structure of the lattice
   core is deliberately disrupted geometrically to engineer suitable
   post-buckling behavior under quasi-static loading. The desirable
   properties of a high fundamental stiffness and a practically zero
   underlying stiffness in the post-buckling range ensure that energy may
   be absorbed within a limited displacement and that any transfer of
   strain to an attached structure is minimized as far as is feasible. It
   is demonstrated that such disruptions can be arranged to enhance the
   panel performance. The concept may be extended to promote cellular
   buckling where the internal lattice buckles with densification occurring
   at defined locations and in sequence to absorb energy while maintaining
   a low underlying mechanical stiffness.}},

Abstract = {{For several pairs (P, Q) of classical distributions on No, we show that
   their stochastic ordering P <=(st) Q can be characterized by their
   extreme tail ordering equivalent to P(\{k({*})\})/Q(\{k({*})\}) >= 1 >=
   limk -> k{*} P(\{k\})/Q(\{k\}), with k({*}) and k({*}) denoting the
   minimum and the supremum of the support of P + Q, and with the limit to
   be read as P((k{*}))/Q(\{k{*}\}) for finite k{*}. This includes in
   particular all pairs where P and Q are both binomial (b(n1, p1) <=(st)
   b(n2,) (p2) if and only if n(1) <= n(2) and (1-p(1))(n1) >=
   (1-p(2))n(2), or p(1) = 0), both negative binomial (b ((r1)) over bar,
   (p1) <=(st) b ((r2)) over bar, (p2) if and only if p(1) >= p(2) p(1)(r1)
   >= p(2)(r2)), or both hypergeometric with the same sample size
   parameter. The binomial case is contained in a known result about
   Bernoulli convolutions, the other two cases appear to be new. The
   emphasis of this paper is on providing a variety of different methods of
   proofs: (i) half monotone likelihood ratios, (ii) explicit coupling,
   (iii) Markov chain comparison, (iv) analytic calculation, and (v)
   comparison of Levy measures. We give four proofs in the binomial case
   (methods (i) (iv)) and three in the negative binomial case (methods (i),
   (iv), and (v)). The statement for hypergeometric distributions is proved
   via method (i).}},

Title = {{Structure of the Wollaston Lake Reflector (Trans-Hudson Orogen, Canada)
   from reflection AVO analysis: Fractured diabase intrusion, fluids, or
   silicified shear zone?}},

Abstract = {{A nearly 160-km long Wollaston Lake Reflector (WLR) observed in seismic
   reflection profile S2b of the 1994 Lithoprobe Trans-Hudson Orogen
   transect (THOT) in northern Saskatchewan (Canada) is among the most
   spectacular and well-recorded features imaged within the crystalline
   crust. Based on modeling of its normal-incidence reflectivity, the
   observed bright spot reflector was originally interpreted as a series of
   tabular diabase intrusions. In order to further elucidate its structure,
   we reprocessed line S2b and analysed the WLR for the Amplitude
   Variations with Offset (AVO). By contrast to conventional (approximate)
   AVO analysis, we used the exact Zoeppritz equations and considered a
   thin-layer (mixed positive and negative polarities) reflectivity. The
   results suggest two possible interpretations of the WLR: 1) the
   reflector caused by a massive mafic intrusion as suggested earlier, in
   which case the intruded rocks should have anomalous Poisson's ratios of
   sigma >= 0.33, and 2) the VvLR represents a silicified shear zone, with
   only moderate (e.g., similar to 5-10\%) alteration of the host rock and
   (sigma approximate to 0.2. Although both of these models may to some
   extent co-exist within the WLR, its brightness, sharpness, great lateral
   extent and smooth shape favour the second interpretation. In both
   models, a fractured fluid-filled zone within a major crustal detachment
   should have played a key role in the formation of the WLR. The
   association of the reflector with laterally-and depth-migrating fluids
   is also supported by magneto-tellulic measurements of crustal
   conductivity beneath the WLR. Analogies from the studies of the Kola
   Superdeep Borehole (Russia), where free or metamorphic fluids were found
   at comparable depths, also suggest that fluids may contribute to WLR
   structure and formation. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   many of the problems that are encountered with standard methods and is
   the basis for a Poisson process representation that generalizes existing

Volume = {{131}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a study of the laminar flow in a channel with
   longitudinal moving bars arrayed along the channel width. The governing
   equations describing the fluid, which flows along the direction of the
   bar's length, are expressed with double Poisson equations and are solved
   by eigenfunction-expansion and point-match method. The result shows that
   when the solid bars move forward, the fluid flow will move in the same
   direction, and the f Re decreases as the positive velocity of bars
   increases. However, when the bars move backward, a reverse flow will
   occur in the channel, and the f Re is higher at larger negative velocity
   of bars. For a channel flow with moving bars, the f Re value is not a
   constant, such as a classical one without moving bars, in which the f Re
   value is a constant. Furthermore, when the area of the cross section of
   the bar is fixed, both the mean velocities and the f Re values of the
   fluid can be obtained under different velocities and aspect ratios of
   the bars.}},

Title = {{Association between meteorological indicators and COVID-19 pandemic in
   Pakistan}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH}},
Abstract = {{This study was designed to investigate the impact of meteorological
   indicators (temperature, rainfall, and humidity) on total COVID-19 cases
   in Pakistan, its provinces, and administrative units from March 10,
   2020, to August 25, 2020. The correlation analysis showed that COVID-19
   cases and temperature showed a positive correlation. It implies that the
   increase in COVID-19 cases was reported due to an increase in the
   temperature in Pakistan, its provinces, and administrative units. The
   generalized Poisson regression showed that the rise in the expected log
   count of COVID-19 cases was 0.024 times for a 1 degrees C rise in the
   average temperature in Pakistan. Second, the correlation between
   rainfall and COVID-19 cases was negative in Pakistan. However, the
   regression coefficient between the expected log count of COVID-19 cases
   and rainfall was insignificant in Pakistan. Third, the correlation
   between humidity and the total COVID-19 cases was negative, which
   implies that the increase in humidity is beneficial to stop the
   transmission of COVID-19 in Pakistan, its provinces, and administrative
   units. The reduction in the expected log count of COVID-19 cases was
   0.008 times for a 1\% increase in the humidity per day in Pakistan.
   However, humidity and COVID-19 cases were positively correlated in Sindh
   province. It is required to create awareness among the general
   population, and the government should include the causes, symptoms, and
   precautions in the educational syllabus. Moreover, people should adopt
   the habit of hand wash, social distancing, personal hygiene,
   mask-wearing, and the use of hand sanitizers to control the COVID-19.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the influences of material parameters on the
   phononic band gaps of three-dimensional (3D) solid phononic crystals
   (PCs) based on the finite difference time domain (FDTD) method. We begin
   with the basic wave equations and the FDTD formulation to derive the
   material parameters directly determining the band gaps of the 3D solid
   PCs. The parameters include the transverse velocity ratio, the acoustic
   impedance ratio and the Poisson ratios (or equivalently, the mass
   density ratio, the shear modulus ratio and the Poisson ratios) of the
   scatterers and host materials. The negative Poisson ratio is also
   considered in our investigation. The effects of these material
   parameters on band gap width are discussed based on detailed numerical
   calculations for systems with three typical lattices. The generation
   mechanism of band gaps (Bragg scattering or local resonance) which is
   determined by the material parameters is also discussed. The analysis is
   expected to be applied to the artificial design of 3D phononic band gap

Abstract = {{Rational design of artificial micro-structured metamaterials with
   advanced mechanical and physical properties that are not accessible in
   nature is challenging and important. Making use of the node rotation and
   ligament bending deformation features of chiral materials, innovative
   reentrant and antichiral hybrid metastructures are proposed for
   vibration attenuation, where elastic rubber coated mass inclusions are
   distributed within the chiral circular ring nodes of unit cells. The
   bandgaps and wave attenuation mechanisms of the proposed reentrant and
   anti-chiral hybrid metastructures are explored, and finite element
   simulations are performed for analyzing the relation between wave
   attenuation properties and structural parameters. Then, coupled
   deformation mechanism of reentrant and antichiral hybrid metastructures
   are analyzed, it is found that the geometrical topology and node elastic
   mass inclusion distribution schemes have remarkable effects on the
   bandgaps of the metastructures. Meanwhile, the wave mitigations of the
   reentrant and anti-chiral hybrid metastructures are explored through
   tuning the structural parameters and mass inclusions distributions.
   Finally, the wave attenuation performances of sandwich panels with
   reentrant and anti-chiral hybrid cores are studied, thus demonstrating
   the promising engineering application potentials for vibration
   isolation. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We have employed parameter-free density functional theory calculations
   to study the thermodynamic stability and structural parameters as well
   as elastic and electronic properties of Ni4N in eight selected
   crystallographic phases. In agreement with the experimental findings,
   the cubic structure with Pearson symbol cP5, space group Pm (3) over
   barm (221) is found to be the most stable and it is also the only
   thermodynamically stable structure at T = 0 K with respect to
   decomposition to the elemental Ni crystal and N-2 gas phase. We
   determine structural parameters, bulk moduli, and their pressure
   derivatives for all eight allotropes. The thermodynamic stability and
   bulk modulus is shown to be anticorrelated. Comparing ferromagnetic and
   nonmagnetic states, we find common features between the magnetism of
   elemental Ni and studied ferromagnetic Ni4N structures. For the
   ground-state Ni4N structure and other two Ni4N cubic allotropes, we
   predict a complete set of single-crystalline elastic constants (in the
   equilibrium and under hydrostatic pressure), the Young and area moduli,
   as well as homogenized polycrystalline elastic moduli obtained by
   different homogenization methods. We demonstrate that the elastic
   anisotropy of the ground-state Ni4N is qualitatively opposite to that in
   the elemental Ni, i.e., these materials have hard and soft
   crystallographic directions interchanged. Moreover, one of the studied
   metastable cubic phases is found auxetic, i.e., exhibiting negative
   Poisson ratio.}},

Abstract = {{Stacking layers of Miura-folded origami sheets has been shown to create
   a cellular material with attractive properties. It has a rich array of
   geometric parameters that allow its elastic properties and compressive
   collapse response to be varied over a wide range, at fixed relative
   density. It displays tunable anisotropy and auxetic behaviour, and can
   also be easily conformed to curved surfaces. Because of these
   attributes, metallic stacked origami materials have shown promise for
   applications such as impact energy absorption and blast mitigation.
   However, to date, manufacturability challenges have yet to be adequately
   solved. Sensitivity to dimensional tolerance, and challenges of layer
   interfaces, make the material difficult to manufacture via sheet metal
   forming routes. However, additive manufacturing (AM) techniques offer a
   route to overcoming these challenges. In this investigation, we use a
   selective laser melting (SLM) process to allow metallic stacked origami
   materials to be assessed experimentally for the first time. The
   as-manufactured characteristics of these cellular materials were
   investigated via X-ray tomography and microstructural inspection. For
   comparison, tensile coupons were also fabricated in different
   orientations with respect to the build plane, in order to investigate
   material anisotropy resulting from the AM process. Scaling effects, both
   in terms of manufacturability and mechanical response, were investigated
   with cellular specimens fabricated with different cell sizes and cell
   wall thicknesses. The origami specimens were tested under quasi-static
   compression to provide an assessment of their as-manufactured energy
   absorbing properties. Finally, a finite element analysis is carried out,
   in order to assess its predictive accuracy and sensitivity to key
   modelling decisions. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Magnetic flux can penetrate a type-II superconductor in the form of
   Abrikosov vortices (also called flux lines, flux tubes, or fluxons),
   each carrying a quantum of magnetic flux. These tiny vortices of
   supercurrent tend to arrange themselves in a triangular and/or quadratic
   flux-line lattice, which is more or less perturbed by material
   inhomogeneities that pin the flux lines. Pinning is caused by
   imperfections of the crystal lattice, such as dislocations, point
   defects, grain boundaries, etc. Hence, a honeycomb-like pattern of the
   vortex array presents some mechanical properties. If the Lorentz force
   of interactions between the vortices is much bigger than the pinning
   force, the vortex lattice behaves elastically. So we assume that the
   pinning force is negligible in the sequel and we deal with soft
   vortices. The vortex motion in the vortex lattice and/or creep of the
   vortices in the vortex fluid is accompanied by energy dissipation.
   Hence, except for the elastic properties, the vortex field is also of a
   viscous character. The main aim of the paper is a formulation of a
   thermoviscoelastic stress-strain constitutive law consisted of
   coexistence of the ordered and disordered states of the vortex field.
   Its form describes an auxetic-like thermomechanical (anomalous) property
   of the vortex field. (C) 2007 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA,

Abstract = {{Objective: Due to concerns over increasing fluoroquinolone (FQ)
   resistance among gram-negative organisms, our stewardship program
   implemented a preauthorization use policy. The goal of this study was to
   assess the relationship between hospital FQ use and antibiotic
   resistance.
   Design: Retrospective cohort. Setting: Large academic medical center.
   Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of FQ susceptibility of
   hospital isolates for 5 common gram-negative bacteria: Acinetobacter
   spp., Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and
   Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Primary endpoint was the change of FQ
   susceptibility. A Poisson regression model was used to calculate the
   rate of change between the preintervention period (1998-2005) and the
   postimplementation period (2006-2016).
   Results: Large rates of decline of FQ susceptibility began in 1998,
   particularly among P. aeruginosa, Acinetobacter spp., and E. cloacae.
   Our FQ restriction policy improved FQ use from 173 days of therapy (DOT)
   per 1,000 patient days to <60 DOT per 1,000 patient days.
   Fluoroquinolone susceptibility increased for Acinetobacter spp. (rate
   ratio {[}RR], 1.038; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI], 1.005-1.072), E.
   cloacae (RR, 1.028; 95\% CI, 1.013-1.044), and P. aeruginosa (RR, 1.013;
   95\% CI, 1.006-1.020). No significant change in susceptibility was
   detected for K. pneumoniae (RR, 1.002; 95\% CI, 0.996-1.008), and the
   susceptibility for E. coli continued to decline, although the decline
   was not as steep (RR, 0.981; 95\% CI, 0.975-0.987).
   Conclusions: A stewardship-driven FQ restriction program stopped overall
   declining FQ susceptibility rates for all species except E. coli. For 3
   species (ie, Acinetobacter spp, E. cloacae, and P. aeruginosa),
   susceptibility rates improved after implementation, and this improvement
   has been sustained over a 10-year period.}},

Abstract = {{Simple models of molecular evolution assume that sequences evolve by a
   Poisson process in which nucleotide or amino acid substitutions occur as
   rare independent events. In these models, the expected ratio of the
   variance to the mean of substitution counts equals 1, and substitution
   processes with a ratio greater than 1 are called overdispersed.
   Comparing the genomes of 10 closely related species of Drosophila, we
   extend earlier evidence for overdispersion in amino acid replacements as
   well as in four-fold synonymous substitutions. The observed deviation
   from the Poisson expectation can be described as a linear function of
   the rate at which substitutions occur on a phylogeny, which implies that
   deviations from the Poisson expectation arise from gene-specific
   temporal variation in substitution rates. Amino acid sequences show
   greater temporal variation in substitution rates than do four-fold
   synonymous sequences. Our findings provide a general phenomenological
   framework for understanding overdispersion in the molecular clock. Also,
   the presence of substantial variation in gene-specific substitution
   rates has broad implications for work in phylogeny reconstruction and
   evolutionary rate estimation.}},

Abstract = {{Recent measurements of electrical potentials on cartilage undergoing
   compression revealed the expected negative streaming potentials due to
   the presence of fixed negative charge in the cartilage matrix. However,
   these measurements also detected positive electric potentials extending
   into the external saline bath. We hypothesized that these positive
   potentials arise from convective displacement of mobile ions through an
   extended non-equilibrium double layer at the cartilage/bath interface.
   To examine this possibility, we developed a model of electrolyte
   transport across a charged membrane and examined the distribution of
   electric potential and mobile ion concentrations in response to forced
   convection. The extended Nernst-Planck and Poisson equations were solved
   numerically assuming the membrane to be infinitely permeable and
   infinitely stiff so that neither a streaming potential nor a
   deformation-induced diffusion potential could occur. First order
   solutions for forced convection of a mono-monovalent electrolyte through
   the membrane depicted an altered structure of the extended double layer
   and the creation of net interfacial electric charge densities with
   opposing polarity on opposite sides of the membrane. The model predicted
   an increase of the electric and concentration polarizations with
   increasing ratio of membrane fixed charge to bath ionic strength, but
   only up to a point of saturation. In this regime, the non-linear
   behavior of the equation system reveals modifications of the extended
   double layers inducing localized electric fields and ion concentration
   gradients in addition with those induced in the bulk of the membrane.
   This convection-induced interfacial polarization has not been previously
   studied in detail and could be an important controlling factor in
   several situations involving transport and electrokinetic phenomena
   through charged media. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The development of stress-induced morphing materials called piezomorphic
   materials is reported. The preparation of a piezomorphic material is
   achieved by introducing spatial dependency into the compliance matrix
   describing the elastic response of a material capable of undergoing
   large strain deformation. In other words, it is necessary to produce an
   elastic-gradient material. This is achieved through modification of the
   microstructure of the compliant material to display gradient topology.
   Examples of polymeric (PU) foam and microporous polymer (ex-PTFE)
   piezomorphic materials are presented. These materials open up new
   morphing applications where dramatic shape changes can be triggered by
   mechanical stress.}},

Abstract = {{The number of lymph nodes retrieved from the specimen may be a surrogate
   measure of the adequacy of extensive colon cancer surgery, but many
   variables may influence the total lymph node yield of any specimen. We
   examined which variables would be influential both for negative and
   positive node sampling.The combined results from 428 patients from three
   hospitals A to C treated in 2007-2009 with single colon cancers having
   R0 segmental resections were analysed. The surgical technique and
   pathology staining methods were slightly different between the
   hospitals.The mean number of lymph nodes was 15.8 (range 1-60). Twelve
   or more lymph nodes were harvested in 78\% of the specimens. In the
   multivariate Poisson regression analysis of all TNM stages, the factors
   associated with the total lymph node harvest were age, pathology
   handling, tumour location and size (p<0.001), whereas for TNM stage III
   alone the pathology handling (p<0.001) and a radical operating technique
   (p=0.003) were highly significant. The total number of lymph nodes was
   the only significant factor for the number of positive lymph nodes
   (Posln) according to the multivariate negative regression analysis
   (p=0.02) but the analysis of the lymph node ratio (LNR) detected no
   statistically significant variable.Several factors, and especially the
   specimen processing technique, were important for the total number of
   harvested lymph nodes. The number of Posln varied between segments and
   increased with the total number of harvested lymph nodes, but for LNR no
   variable was important. LNR seemed to abolish the combined effect of
   tumour location and the total lymph node yield in prognosis assessment.}},

Abstract = {{Distance sampling techniques were compared to point (variable plot)
   sampling and fixed-radius circular plot sampling for inventory of teak
   (Tectona grandis) plantations in Indonesia. n-tree distance sampling
   selects the n trees closest to a sample point located in the field. The
   distance to the nth closest tree is used as a plot radius. Two n-tree
   estimators were compared. Prodan (1968) described a technique for n=6,
   which counts the nth tree as 1/2 for tree counts and tree volume (or
   other tree attributes). Another approach, here called `the (n-1)/n
   adjusted estimator', uses the bias correction factor (n-1)/n. Eberhardt
   (1967) demonstrated that the (n-1)/n adjusted estimator is unbiased for
   Poisson (random) and negative binomial (clumped) spatial distributions.
   No proof of unbiasedness is known for either method in uniform
   distributions which would be characteristic of plantations. n-tree
   sampling was performed in Indonesian teak plantations for values of n
   ranging from 3 to 10 for both methods. At the same locations, point
   (variable plot) samples with metric basal area factors 1 m(2) ha(-1)
   tree(-1) and 2 m(2) ha(-1) tree(-1) and fixed-radius circular plots 0.1
   ha in size were installed for comparison with the n-tree distance
   methods. The time required for each sampling method was recorded at each
   field location. For each method, an efficiency ratio was calculated as
   (C-k(2) x Time(k))/(C-0.1ha(2) x Time(0.1ha)) where C-k is the
   coefficient of variation for method k, Time(k) is the average time
   required for method k, C-0.1 ha is the coefficient of variation for 0.1
   ha plots and Time(0.1 ha) is the average time required for 0.1 ha plots.
   The more efficient methods have smaller efficiency ratios. According to
   this criterion, 5-tree distance sampling using Prodan's estimator was
   most efficient of the techniques compared that did not show bias for
   these data. The (n-1)/n adjusted estimator showed bias for these trials
   in teak plantations. This was probably due to the uniform spatial
   distribution characteristic of plantations. Point sampling with BAF=1
   m(2) ha(-1) tree(-1) and BAF=2 m(2) ha(-1) tree(-1) and 0.1 ha plot
   sampling were not as efficient as n-tree sampling methods for these
   trials. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   left-turn motor vehicle related collisions, and right-turn motor vehicle
   related collisions. A methodology for estimating these BMV accident
   risks was developed based on probability theory. A significant
   difference between this proposed methodology and most current approaches
   is that the proposed approach explicitly relates the risk of each
   specific BMV accident type to its related flows. The methodology was
   demonstrated using a 4-year (1992-1995) data set collected from 115
   signalized intersections in the Tokyo Metropolitan area. This data set
   contains BMV accident data, bicycle flow data, motor vehicle flow data,
   traffic control data, and geometric data for each intersection approach.
   For each BMV risk model, an independent explanatory variable set was
   chosen according to the characteristics of the accident type. Three
   negative binomial regression models (one corresponding to each BMV
   accident type) were estimated using the maximum likelihood method. The
   coefficient value and its significance level were estimated for each
   selected variable. The negative binomial dispersion parameters for all
   the three models were significant at 0.01 levels. This supported the
   choice of the negative binomial regression over the Poisson regression
   for the quantitative analyses in this study. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The purpose of the chapter is to test the hypothesis that food safety
   (chemical) standards act as barriers to international seafood imports.
   We use zero-accounting gravity models to test the hypothesis that food
   safety (chemical) standards act as barriers to international seafood
   imports. The chemical standards on which we focus include
   chloramphenicol required performance limit, oxytetracycline maximum
   residue limit, fluoro-quinolones maximum residue limit, and
   dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) pesticide residue limit. The study
   focuses on the three most important seafood markets: the European
   Union's 15 members, Japan, and North America.
   Our empirical results confirm the hypothesis and are robust to the OLS
   as well as alternative zero-accounting gravity models such as the
   Heckman estimation and the Poisson family regressions. For the choice of
   the best model specification to account for zero trade and
   heteroskedastic issues, it is inconclusive to base on formal statistical
   tests; however, the Heckman sample selection and zero-inflated negative
   binomial (ZINB) models provide the most reliable parameter estimates
   based on the statistical tests, magnitude of coefficients, economic
   implications, and the literature findings. Our findings suggest that
   continually tightening of seafood safety standards has had a negative
   impact on exporting countries. Increasing the stringency of regulations
   by reducing analytical limits or maximum residue limits in seafood in
   developed countries has negative impacts on their bilateral seafood
   imports. The chapter furthers the literature on food safety standards on
   international trade. We show competing gravity model specifications and
   provide additional evidence that no one gravity model is superior.}},

   rigidity threshold}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITES SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{191}},
Month = {{MAY 3}},
Abstract = {{The rigidity threshold in a two-phase soft-rigid material is linked to
   the formation of networks of the rigid phase, which supports a
   substantial fraction of overall load. Metal filled particulate polymer
   composites were used to characterize rigidity transition experimentally,
   as metals and polymers have contrasting mechanical properties enabling
   easy detection of the rigidity transition. A detailed analysis of the
   load transferring mechanisms was performed using in-situ synchrotron
   X-ray diffraction to directly verify the compressive loading of the
   rigid metal particles at a microscopic scale. Elastic buckling of the
   force chains was attributed to the non-affine deformation at the
   rigidity threshold at room temperature, using digital image correlation
   (DIC) technique at a mesoscopic length scale. However, beyond the glass
   transition temperature of the polymer, the deformation was homogeneous
   due to the low viscosity and high compressibility of the polymer and the
   absence of buckling of force chains. Macroscopically, an increasing
   Poisson ratio was observed as a function of elastic strains, which is
   quite unique for these composites. The criteria for having increasing
   Poisson ratio is discussed based on elastic buckling of force chains and
   polymer incompressibility, and a link is proposed between deformation at
   microscopic, mesoscopic and macroscopic scale for the composite.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a recently developed type of lower-order mixed finite
   elements is extended to model porous materials based on the
   microdilatation theory. These mixed finite elements are based on
   assuming independent linear generalized strain fields and collocating
   them with the generalized strains derived from primal variables
   (mechanical displacements and change in matrix volume fraction) at some
   cleverly chosen points within each element. This mixed formulation is
   very effective in alleviating the shear locking problem that regular
   lower-order finite elements suffer from. Hence the accuracy of the
   predicted mechanical fields (such as displacements and stresses), as
   well as the fields coupled with them (such as change in matrix volume
   fraction, which is also called microdilatation), is improved over
   regular finite-element formulation. The mixed-collocation formulation is
   also superior over other types of previously published hybrid-mixed
   finite-element formulations in that it avoids the
   Ladyzenskaja-Babuska-Brezzi (LBB) stability conditions completely
   because it does not include any Lagrange multipliers. The paper also
   presents some numerical examples that help in providing more insight on
   the effect of porosity-related parameters used in microdilatation theory
   on the behavior of porous materials. Finally, the paper defines two
   limits on the coupling number; the first considers the positive
   definiteness of the stored energy density, whereas the second sets the
   limit between auxetic (having negative Poisson's ratio) and nonauxetic
   material behavior. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{The rate of information loss in a periodic system that is subject to
   random variation can be described using the autocorrelation function.
   Autocorrelation functions have been derived here for infinitely long
   polymers consisting of independent and identically distributed
   alternating geometric, negative binomial or Poisson-distributed blocks.
   The Poisson-distributed case represents the ideal case of a perfectly
   controlled chain polymerization, while the negative binomial case may be
   a model for non-ideal RDRP. In each case, the autocorrelation
   coefficient decays exponentially to zero with a characteristic length
   that is inversely proportional to (D-1).}},

Abstract = {{Ross operation, i.e., the use of autologous pulmonary artery to replace
   diseased aortic valve, has been recently at the center of a vivid debate
   regarding its unjust underuse in the surgical practice. Keystone of the
   procedure regards the use of an autologous biologically available graft
   which would preserve the anticoagulative and tissue homeostatic
   functions normally exerted by the native leaflets and would harmoniously
   integrate in the vascular system, allowing for progressive somatic
   growth of aortic structures. With this respect, recently, some of the
   authors have successfully pioneered a large animal model of
   transposition of pulmonary artery in systemic pressure load in order to
   reproduce the clinical scenario in which this procedure might be applied
   and allow for the development and testing of different devices or
   techniques to improve the pulmonary autograft (PA) performance, by
   testing a bioresorbable mesh for PA reinforcement. In the present work,
   to support and supplement the in vivo animal experimentation, a
   mathematical model is developed in order to simulate the biomechanical
   changes in pulmonary artery subjected to systemic pressure load and
   reinforced with a combination of resorbable and auxetic synthetic
   materials. The positive biological effects on vessel wall remodeling,
   the regional somatic growth phenomena and prevention of dilatative
   degeneration have been analyzed. The theoretical outcomes show that a
   virtuous biomechanical cooperation between biological and synthetic
   materials takes place, stress-shielding guiding the physiological
   arterialization of vessel walls, consequently determining the overall
   success of the autograft system.}},

Abstract = {{Four novel cylinder-ligament honeycombs are described, where each
   cylinder has 3 tangentially-attached ligaments to form either a
   hexagonal or re-entrant hexagonal cellular network. The re-entrant
   cylinder-ligament honeycombs are reported for the first time. The
   in-plane linear elastic constants and out-of-plane bending response of
   these honeycombs are predicted using finite element (FE) modelling and
   comparison made with hexagonal and re-entrant hexagonal honeycombs
   without cylinders. A laser-crafted re-entrant cylinder-ligament
   honeycomb is manufactured and characterized to verify the FE model. The
   re-entrant honeycombs display negative Poisson's ratios and synclastic
   curvature upon out-of-plane bending. The hexagonal and `trichiral'
   honeycombs possess positive Poisson's ratios and anticlastic curvature.
   The `anti-trichiral' honeycomb (short ligament limit) displays negative
   Poisson's ratios when loaded in the plane of the honeycomb, but positive
   Poisson's ratio behaviour (anticlastic curvature) under out-of-plane
   bending. These responses are understood qualitatively through
   considering deformation occurs via direct ligament flexure and cylinder
   rotation-induced ligament flexure. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The proportion of Pap smears containing an endocervical component (ECC)
   has been declining in Australia. Given that ECC negative (ECC-) smears
   may be associated with reduced sensitivity, we undertook a retrospective
   cohort study to estimate rates of histologically confirmed high-grade
   cervical abnormality (HGA) and cancer in women with negative Pap smears
   with and without an ECC. Women 18-69 years with at least two Pap smears
   between 1 January 2001 and 31 December 2010 with the first smear in that
   period (index smear) showing no abnormality were eligible. Follow-up
   ended at date of the first abnormal smear, date of histological
   diagnosis, date of hysterectomy, date of death, or 31 December 2010,
   whichever came first. ECC status was treated as a time varying exposure.
   Follow-up was split at each smear after the index smear. Poisson
   regression was used to estimate adjusted incidence rates and incidence
   rate ratios (IRR) by ECC status. The incidence rate of histologically
   confirmed HGA was significantly lower following ECC- smears than after
   ECC+ smears (adjusted IRR: 0.69, 95\% Confidence Interval (CI)
   0.62-0.77), particularly at older ages (interaction between ECC status
   and age, p = 0.001). In contrast, the overall rate of invasive cancer
   was not significantly different after ECC- than after ECC+ smears (IRR:
   1.27, 95\% CI 0.90-1.77). In conclusion, women had a lower rate of
   confirmed HGA and no significant increase in the rate of invasive
   cervical cancer following ECC- smears. This study does not support
   differential (accelerated) follow-up in women with a negative smear
   without an endocervical component.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, 2D hierarchical re-entrant cellular structures with
   Voronoi substructures were proposed. Their Poisson's ratios and energy
   absorption capacities (in-plane) were studied using the finite-element
   method. The effects of geometric parameters (Voronoi sub structure
   irregularity, k, concave angle, theta, ratio of cell wall thickness to
   cell height, omega) on the lattice mechanical properties were
   investigated. Results showed that Poisson's ratio first decreased and
   then increased with an increasing theta when k is less than 0.5. A
   minimum Poisson's ratio of approximately 0.315 was achieved when k = 0.5
   and theta = 60 degrees. The 2D hierarchical re-entrant lattice structure
   exhibited a maximum energy absorption capacity when k = 0.2 and omega =
   1/3, which is 3.9 times higher than that of the traditional re-entrant

   studied the feasibility of printing metallic structural materials with
   robotized laser-based metal additive manufacturing (RLMAM). In this
   study, two metallic structural materials characterized by an enlarged
   positive Poisson's ratio and a negative Poisson's ratio were designed
   and simulated, respectively. An RLMAM system developed at the Research

Abstract = {{Since the outbreak of novel SARS-COV-2, each country has implemented
   diverse policies to mitigate and suppress the spread of the virus.
   However, no systematic evaluation of these policies in their alleviation
   of the pandemic has been done. We investigate the impact of five indices
   derived from 12 policies in the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response
   Tracker dataset and the Korean government's index, which is the social
   distancing level implemented by the Korean government in response to the
   changing pandemic situation. We employed segmented Poisson model for
   this analysis. In conclusion, health and the Korean government indices
   are most consistently effective (with negative coefficients), while the
   restriction and stringency indexes are mainly effective with lagging
   (1-10 days), as intuitively daily confirmed cases of a given day is
   affected by the policies implemented days before, which shows that a
   period of time is required before the impact of some policies can be
   observed. The health index demonstrates the importance of public
   information campaign, testing policy and contact tracing, while the
   government index shows the importance of social distancing guidelines in
   mitigating the spread of the virus. These results imply the important
   roles of these polices in mitigation of the spread of COVID-19 disease.}},

Abstract = {{Since the global financial crisis broke out, the plunge of stock prices,
   shrinkage of asset value, and downgrading of credit ratings for
   companies and corporate bonds, have greatly challenged the
   long-established mathematical models based on Black-Scholes option
   pricing formula in Finance. Evidences show that the important assumption
   that the returns dynamics of the underlying stock have a continuous
   sample path which can be described by the stochastic process deviates
   from the real world situation. In this paper, I took the pattern of
   stock price movement as a process driven by the combination of the
   geometric Brownian motion and Poisson Process, and study the important
   factors affecting the default probability of corporate debt using MATLAB
   to do numerical simulation. It is found that: (a) in the occurrence of
   the ``rare event{''}, the adoption of the model only based on pure
   geometric Brownian motion will lead to underestimation of bankruptcy
   risk. (b) the degree of asset value shrinkage following each ``negative
   jump{''} is positively correlated with the default risk of corporate
   debt, and this default probability is a convex function of the
   corresponding jumping probability per unit time. (c) the marginal
   default probability is a non-negative random variable that varies as the
   times of asset ``jumps{''} before the maturity of the corporate debt are
   different. Moreover, it will reach the maximum value when jumping
   probability and the degree of asset value shrinkage both approach to
   100\%. (d) when the degree of asset value shrinkage maintains unchanged,
   the greater the initial leverage ratio d, the higher default risk the
   company will face. Consequently, the agency problem between shareholders
   and creditors is likely to take place.}},

Abstract = {{Clay minerals are specified by permanent negative surface charge. In
   solutions of sodium salts, the Surface of clay is covered by
   exchangeable sodium ions. In an acidic field (pH < 4-6), sodium ions are
   displaced from the surface. This apparent H/Na exchange is conditioned
   by dissolution of alumina, followed by Al/Na exchange. Two kinds of
   published experimental data were considered in order to follow Al/Na
   exchange: the first is direct measurement of exchangeable sodium and
   aluminum in clay, and the second is exchange sorption of trace metal.
   Because of the equivalency of ionic exchange, trace metal acts as a
   probe, indicating the sodium content in clay. These experimental data
   were successfully modeled with use of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation,
   with the assumption that all exchange cations are located in the diffuse
   layer. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The Vaccine Safety Datalink project captures electronic health record
   data including vaccinations and medically attended adverse events on 8.8
   million enrollees annually from participating managed care organizations
   in the United States. While the automated vaccination data are generally
   of high quality, a presumptive adverse event based on diagnosis codes in
   automated health care data may not be true (misclassification).
   Consequently, analyses using automated health care data can generate
   false positive results, where an association between the vaccine and
   outcome is incorrectly identified, as well as false negative findings,
   where a true association or signal is missed. We developed novel
   conditional Poisson regression models and fixed effects models that
   accommodate misclassification of adverse event outcome for
   self-controlled case series design. We conducted simulation studies to
   evaluate their performance in signal detection in vaccine safety
   hypotheses generating (screening) studies. We also reanalyzed four
   previously identified signals in a recent vaccine safety study using the
   newly proposed models. Our simulation studies demonstrated that (i)
   outcome misclassification resulted in both false positive and false
   negative signals in screening studies; (ii) the newly proposed models
   reduced both the rates of false positive and false negative signals. In
   reanalyses of four previously identified signals using the novel
   statistical models, the incidence rate ratio estimates and statistical
   significances were similar to those using conventional models and
   including only medical record review confirmed cases.}},

Abstract = {{Studies of citrus leafminer in a coastal orchard in NSW, Australia
   indicated that an increase in abundance to about one mine per flush was
   followed during the midseason flush by a rapid increase in population
   that was related to an increase in the percentage of leaves infested
   within flushes and the number of mines per leaf. The fits of frequency
   distributions and Iwao's patchiness regression indicated that
   populations were highly contagious initially, and as the exponent k of
   the negative binomial distribution increased with increasing population
   density, the distribution approached random. Concurrently, the
   coefficient of variation of mines per flush (which was strongly related
   to the proportion of un-infested flushes) decreased to about unity as
   the proportion of un-infested flushes reached zero and fell further as
   the number of mines per flush increased. Both numerative and binomial
   sequential sampling plans were developed using a decision threshold
   based on 1.2 mines per flush. The binomial sampling plan was based on a
   closely fitting model of the functional relationship between mean
   density and proportion of infested flushes. Functional relationships
   using the parameters determined from Iwao's patchiness regression and
   Taylor's power law were equally satisfactory, and one based on the
   negative binomial model also fitted well, but the Poisson model did not.
   The three best fitting models indicated that a decision threshold of 1.2
   mines per flush was equivalent to 50\% of flushes infested. From a
   practical point of view, the transition from 25\% infestation of flushes
   through 50\% is so rapid that it may be prudent to take action when the
   25\% level is reached; otherwise, the 50\% may be passed before the crop
   is checked again. For valuable nursery stock should infestation be
   detected in spring, it may be advisable to apply prophylactic treatment
   as the midseason flush starts.}},

Title = {{Technical note: A preliminary study of dual-tracer PET image
   reconstruction guided by FDG and/or MR kernels}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Abstract = {{Purpose Clinically, single radiotracer positron emission tomography
   (PET) imaging is a commonly used examination method; however, since each
   radioactive tracer reflects the information of only one kind of cell, it
   easily causes false negatives or false positives in disease diagnosis.
   Therefore, reasonably combining two or more radiotracers is recommended
   to improve the accuracy of diagnosis and the sensitivity and specificity
   of the disease when conditions permit. Methods This paper proposes
   incorporating F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) as a higher-quality PET
   image to guide the reconstruction of other lower-count C-11-methionine
   (MET) PET datasets to compensate for the lower image quality by a
   popular kernel algorithm. Specifically, the FDG prior is needed to
   extract kernel features, and these features were used to build a kernel
   matrix using a k-nearest-neighbor (kNN) search for MET image
   reconstruction. We created a 2-D brain phantom to validate the proposed
   method by simulating sinogram data containing Poisson random noise and
   quantitatively compared the performance of the proposed FDG-guided
   kernelized expectation maximization (KEM) method with the performance of
   Gaussian and non-local means (NLM) smoothed maximum likelihood
   expectation maximization (MLEM), MR-guided KEM, and multi-guided-S KEM
   algorithms. Mismatch experiments between FDG/MR and MET data were also
   carried out to investigate the outcomes of possible clinical situations.
   Results In the simulation study, the proposed method outperformed the
   other algorithms by at least 3.11\% in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
   and 0.68\% in the contrast recovery coefficient (CRC), and it reduced
   the mean absolute error (MAE) by 8.07\%. Regarding the tumor in the
   reconstructed image, the proposed method contained more pathological
   information. Furthermore, the proposed method was still superior to the
   MR-guided KEM method in the mismatch experiments. Conclusions The
   proposed FDG-guided KEM algorithm can effectively utilize and compensate
   for the tissue metabolism information obtained from dual-tracer PET to
   maximize the advantages of PET imaging.}},

Abstract = {{We discuss the possible use of photonic crystals as strain sensors. We
   demonstrate the feasible fabrication of a crystal having sub-micrometric
   polystyrene colloidal spheres in a PDMS matrix on a rubber substrate,
   and we demonstrate that the photonic properties change with substrate
   elongation according to theoretical prediction. The crystal's
   sensitivity to strain depends directly on interplanar spacing and on
   Poisson's ratio. To enhance the crystal strain resolution, we propose to
   fabricate inverse photonic structures, which exhibit a high geometrical
   Poisson's ratio, and we investigate their photomechanical behavior
   through non-lineal Finite Element analysis.}},

Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{153}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Adherent cells are able to actively generate internal forces, channelled
   by cytoskeletal protein filaments and transmitted through transmembrane
   receptors to the surrounding environment by means of focal adhesions.
   Cells also dynamically interact with extracellular matrix by sensing
   external chemo-mechanical stimuli and then inducing formation of stress
   fibres mediated by polymerization/de-polymerization processes which
   continuously redesign the interplay between structural organization and
   contractility activities in the cytoskeleton, so orchestrating selected
   signal pathways at the basis of many important cell's physiological
   functions like adhesion, migration and division. Despite chemo- and
   duro-taxis have been intensively studied in the last years to understand
   how cells move on a substrate, their polarization and reorientation -
   observed during gastrulation, wound healing and morphogenesis - are only
   partially understood. By starting from the evidence highlighted in some
   recent studies that cells reorient in response to substrata deformation
   by essentially obeying a pure mechanical interaction, we propose to
   interpret the seeming overall cells' rotation resulting from the
   reconfiguration of their cytoskeleton - here named mechanotropism - as a
   nonlinear optimization problem in which the adherent cell aims to align
   along directions leading it to minimize a physically coherent measure of
   work spent to deform the elastic substrate while retaining a prescribed
   level of homeostatic contractile force. To do this, the single-cell is
   simply modelled as a finite size contractile force dipole that acts on
   the boundary of a half-space perturbed by applied point loads. The
   effects of fences of forces acting orthogonally and tangentially on the
   boundary of the adhesion medium and encircling the cell are then
   investigated, so obtaining solutions that predict multiple non-trivial
   cell polarizations as functions of number, direction, relative magnitude
   and distance from the cell-dipole of the forces, as well as of the
   substrate's Poisson ratio, with unprecedented outcomes under the
   hypothesis of auxetic (i.e. negative Poisson ratio) materials. The
   results lead to envisage that the proposed theoretical model might
   contribute to unveil the mechanobiological principles ruling in vivo
   cells orientation processes by guiding the design of novel experimental
   strategies and to conceive new mechanics-based markers for guessing
   cells' pathological conditions from their mechanotropism.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of particle softness on the Poisson's ratio of model
   solids has been investigated. We have used the repulsive inverse power
   potential (similar to r(-n) for particle separations, r) between the
   particles, which is conveniently characterised by one adjustable
   parameter, epsilon = 1/n. For large epsilon, the interaction is soft
   whereas in the epsilon --> 0 limit the particles approach hard spheres.
   The pressure and elastic constants of the solid phase have been
   calculated at various densities with constant temperature molecular
   dynamics ( MD) simulation for a range of the softness parameter in the
   range, n >12. Density-softness surfaces of these quantities were
   determined which revealed hitherto unrecorded trends in the behaviour of
   the elastic moduli and Poisson's ratio. It was found that the pressure
   and some elastic properties, e. g. the C-12 elastic constant and the
   bulk modulus, manifest a maximum value or `ridge' on this surface. The
   height of the maximum increases with density and interaction steepness
   (small epsilon). The Poisson's ratio varies essentially linearly with
   softness and is relatively insensitive to density. However, at higher
   densities and for larger steepness a considerable lowering of the
   Poisson's ratio is observed. In order to identify possible mechanisms
   for reducing the value of Poisson's ratio, nu, the fluctuation and
   Born-Green contributions were analysed. Changes in the Poisson's ratio
   are mainly determined by the fluctuation contribution which can cause a
   considerable decrease as well as increase of its value.}},

Title = {{Sexual behaviour, changes in sexual behaviour and associated factors
   among women at high risk of HIV participating in feasibility studies for
   prevention trials in Tanzania}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 16}},
Abstract = {{Introduction
   Risk reduction towards safer behaviour is promoted after enrolment in
   HIV prevention trials. We evaluated sexual behaviour, changes in sexual
   behaviour and factors associated with risky behaviour after one-year of
   follow-up among women enrolled in HIV prevention trials in Northern
   Tanzania.
   Methods
   Self-reported information from 1378 HIV-negative women aged 18-44
   enrolled in microbicide and vaccine feasibility studies between
   2008-2010,was used to assess changes in behaviour during a 12-month
   follow-up period. Logistic regression with random intercepts was used to
   estimate odds ratios for trends in each behaviour over time. A
   behavioural risk score was derived from coefficients of three
   behavioural variables in a Poisson regression model for HIV incidence
   and thereafter, dichotomized to risky vs less-risky behaviour. Logistic
   regression was then used to identify factors associated with risky
   behaviour at 12 months.
   Results
   At baseline, 22\% reported multiple partners, 28\% were involved in
   transactional sex and only 22\% consistently used condoms with
   non-regular partners. The proportion of women reporting multiple
   partners, transactional sex and high-risk sex practices reduced at each
   3-monthly visit (33\%, 43\% and 47\% reduction in odds per visit
   respectively, p for linear trend < 0.001 for all), however, there was no
   evidence of a change in the proportion of women consistently using
   condoms with non-regular partners (p = 0.22). Having riskier behaviours
   at baseline, being younger than 16 years at sexual debut, having
   multiple partners, selling sex and excessive alcohol intake at baseline
   were strongly associated with increased odds of risky sexual behaviour
   after 12 months (p<0.005 for all).
   Conclusion
   An overall reduction in risky behaviours over time was observed in HIV
   prevention cohorts. Risk reduction counselling was associated with
   decreased risk behaviour but was insufficient to change behaviours of
   all those at highest risk. Biological HIV prevention interventions such
   as PrEP for individuals at highest risk, should complement risk
   reduction counselling so as to minimize HIV acquisition risk.}},

Title = {{Impact response of metallic stacked origami cellular materials}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMPACT ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{147}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Cellular materials are attractive for applications in structural
   protection and impact energy absorption. Progressive buckling of cell
   walls during compression delivers good specific strength and energy
   absorption. In a cellular solid, the arrangement of the cell wall
   material with respect to the direction of loading has a key influence on
   its mechanical response. This is especially true for cellular materials
   loaded in dynamic compres-sion, where dynamic buckling and inertial
   stabilisation effects can also be sensitive to the alignment of cell
   walls with the loading direction. Origami-based geometries provide one
   route to designing cellular materials to achieve controllable collapse
   modes and, in some cases, auxeticity. The stacked Miura-ori geometry has
   been proposed recently as a strategy for constructing a volume of
   periodic cellular solid from an origami-inspired unit cell. However,
   these have been previously difficult to manufacture. Using selective
   laser melting, an additive manufacturing process, stainless steel
   stacked origami materials were produced in a periodic cellular
   arrangement for the first impact tests on such a cellular material. The
   origami specimens were tested with a gas gun and direct impact Hopkinson
   bar apparatus, at impact speeds of 50 m/s and 100 m/s. The auxetic
   behaviour of the origami fold was observed to diminish at the higher
   impact speeds, due to the localisation of deformation to individual fold
   layers. Different fold configurations were studied through simulations,
   with clear trends observed between fold angle and specific energy
   absorption and strength. Lastly, the influence of material strain rate
   sensitivity was investigated numerically.}},

Title = {{Dynamic impact testing of cellular solids and lattice structures:
   Application of two-sided direct impact Hopkinson bar}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMPACT ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{148}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Direct impact testing with a Hopkinson bar is, nowadays, a very popular
   experimental technique for investigating the behavior of cellular
   materials, e.g., lattice metamaterials, at high strain-rates as it
   overcomes several limitations of the conventional Split Hopkinson
   Pressure Bar (SHPB). However, standard direct impact Hopkinson bars
   (DIHB) have only single-sided instrumentation complicating the analysis.
   In this paper, a DIHB apparatus instrumented with conventional
   strain-gauges on both bars (a so called Open Hopkinson Pressure Bar -
   OHPB) is used for dynamic impact experiments of cellular materials.
   Digital image correlation (DIC) is used as a tool for investigating the
   displacements and velocities at the faces of the bars. A
   straight-forward wave separation technique combining the data from the
   strain-gauges with the DIC is adopted to increase the experiment time
   window multiple times. The experimental method is successfully tested at
   impact velocities in a range of 5 - 30 m.s(-1) with both linear elastic
   and visco-elastic bars of a medium diameter. It is shown that, under
   certain circumstances, a simple linear elastic model is sufficient for
   the evaluation of the measurements with the viscoelastic bars, while no
   additional attenuation and phase-shift corrections are necessary. The
   applicability of the experimental method is demonstrated on various
   experiments with conventional metal foams, hybrid foams, and additively
   manufactured auxetic lattices subjected to dynamic compression.}},

Abstract = {{We make an attempt to identify factors that explain accidents on German

   distinct types of ramps. For these ramps, accident data is available for
   a period of 3 years (January 2003 until December 2005). The negative
   binomial model with some random coefficients proved to be an appropriate
   model in our cross-sectional setting for detecting factors that are
   related to accidents. The most significant variable is a measure of the
   average daily traffic. For geometric variables, not only continuous
   effects were found to be significant, but also threshold effects
   indicating the exceedance of certain values. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{As a first step, variational formulations and governing equations with
   boundary conditions are derived for a pair of Euler-Bernoulli beam
   bending models following a simplified version of Mindlin's strain
   gradient elasticity theory of form II. For both models, this leads to
   sixth-order boundary value problems with new types of boundary
   conditions that are given additional attributes singly and doubly,
   referring to a physically relevant distinguishing feature between free
   and prescribed curvature, respectively. Second, the variational
   formulations are analyzed with rigorous mathematical tools: the
   existence and uniqueness of weak solutions are established by proving
   continuity and ellipticity of the associated symmetric bilinear forms.
   This guarantees optimal convergence for conforming Galerkin
   discretization methods. Third, the variational analysis is extended to
   cover two other generalized beam models: another modification of the
   strain gradient elasticity theory and a modified version of the couple
   stress theory. A model comparison reveals essential differences and
   similarities in the physicality of these four closely related beam
   models: they demonstrate essentially two different kinds of
   parameter-dependent stiffening behavior, where one of these kinds
   (possessed by three models out of four) provides results in a very good
   agreement with the size effects of experimental tests. Finally,
   numerical results for isogeometric Galerkin discretizations with
   B-splines confirm the theoretical stability and convergence results.
   Influences of the gradient and thickness parameters connected to size
   effects, boundary layers and dispersion relations are studied thoroughly
   with a series of benchmark problems for statics and free vibrations. The
   size-dependency of the effective Young's modulus is demonstrated for an
   auxetic cellular metamaterial ruled by bending-dominated deformation of
   cell struts.}},

Title = {{Quantifying the effect of habitat availability on species distributions}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{82}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1135-1145}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{1.If animals moved randomly in space, the use of different habitats
   would be proportional to their availability. Hence, deviations from
   proportionality between use and availability are considered the
   tell-tale sign of preference. This principle forms the basis for most
   habitat selection and species distribution models fitted to
   use-availability or count data (e.g. MaxEnt and Resource Selection
   Functions). Yet, once an essential habitat type is sufficiently abundant
   to meet an individual's needs, increased availability of this habitat
   type may lead to a decrease in the use/availability ratio. Accordingly,
   habitat selection functions may estimate negative coefficients when
   habitats are superabundant, incorrectly suggesting an apparent
   avoidance. Furthermore, not accounting for the effects of availability
   on habitat use may lead to poor predictions, particularly when applied
   to habitats that differ considerably from those for which data have been
   collected. Using simulations, we show that habitat use varies
   non-linearly with habitat availability, even when individuals follow
   simple movement rules to acquire food and avoid risk. The results show
   that the impact of availability strongly depends on the type of habitat
   (e.g. whether it is essential or substitutable) and how it interacts
   with the distribution and availability of other habitats. We demonstrate
   the utility of a variety of existing and new methods that enable the
   influence of habitat availability to be explicitly estimated. Models
   that allow for non-linear effects (using b-spline smoothers) and
   interactions between environmental covariates defining habitats and
   measures of their availability were best able to capture simulated
   patterns of habitat use across a range of environments. An appealing
   aspect of some of the methods we discuss is that the relative influence
   of availability is not defined a priori, but directly estimated by the
   model. This feature is likely to improve model prediction, hint at the
   mechanism of habitat selection, and may signpost habitats that are
   critical for the organism's fitness.}},

Pages = {{816-830}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of trade
   policy pertaining to imported processed food on poorer health outcomes
   of people's in the Pacific island countries.
   Design/methodology/approach - Using an extended gravity model, the paper
   adopts the OLS time varying importer/exporter effects method and a
   Pseudo Poisson maximum likelihood estimator on a cross-sectional panel
   data set of 215 countries and territories. The estimation procedure
   controlled for 11 Pacific island countries between 2003 and 2013.
   Findings - The empirical findings revealed a positive and statistically
   significant relationship between trade liberalisation and increased
   processed food imports in the Pacific island countries. The findings
   also reveal that the access ratio (kg/person) to selected imported
   processed food high in salt to Pacific island countries has increased
   significantly over time.
   Originality/value - While much of the trade literature reveals positive
   impact of trade on the prosperity of nations, this study makes a new
   contribution in terms of supporting a negative impact of trade
   liberalisation policy on people's health in small island developing

Abstract = {{Hemoglobins from normal human cells, from sickle cells, and from horse
   were investigated by electrooptical methods in their oxy and deoxy
   forms. The reduced linear dichroism measured as a function of the
   electric field strength demonstrates the existence of permanent dipole
   moments in the range of 250-400 Debye units. The reduced limiting
   dichroism is relatively small (less than or equal to 0.1); it is
   negative for hemoglobin from sickle cells and positive for the
   hemoglobins from normal human cells and from horse. The dichroism decay
   time constants are in the range from about 55 to 90 ns. Calculations of
   the electrooptical data from available crystal structures are given
   according to model of various complexity, including Monte Carlo
   simulations of proton fluctuations with energies evaluated by a finite
   difference Poisson-Boltzmann procedure. The experimental dipole moments
   are shown to be consistent with the results of the calculations. In the
   case of human deoxyhemoglobin, the root mean square dipole is higher
   than the mean dipole by a factor of about 4.5, indicating a particularly
   large relative contribution due to proton fluctuations. The ratio of the
   root mean square dipole to the mean dipole is much smaller (similar to
   1.1 to similar to 1.5) for the other hemoglobin molecules. The
   calculations demonstrate that the dichroism decay time constants are not
   simply determined by the size/shape of the proteins, but are strongly
   influenced by the orientation of the dipole vector with respect to the
   axis of maximal absorbance. The comparison of experimental and
   calculated electrooptical data provides a useful test for the accuracy
   of electrostatic calculations and/or for the equivalence of structures
   in crystals and in solutions.}},

Abstract = {{The annulus fibrosus exhibits complex osmotic and inelastic effects
   responsible for unusual transversal behavior with a Poisson's ratio
   higher than 0.5 in fibers plane and negative (i.e., auxetic) in lamellae
   plane. In this paper, we present a new chemo-mechanical approach for the
   intrinsic osmo-inelastic response of the annulus fibrosus in relation to
   the microstructure of the layered reinforced soft tissue, the
   biochemical environment and the mechanical loading conditions. The
   constitutive model introduces the coupling between the
   deformation-induced inelastic stress in the tangled extracellular matrix
   and the stress-free swelling due to internal fluid content variation by
   osmosis. The proposed formulation is implemented into a finite element
   code, and numerical simulations on annulus specimens, including
   explicitly lamellae and interlamellar zones, are presented. To
   illustrate the capability of the approach to capture experimental
   observations quantitatively, the simulated results are compared to
   experimental results obtained by monitoring the full-field strain in
   annulus specimens using digital image correlation method. Some material
   constants are found by matching the free swelling in a water bath with
   different salt concentrations, and others are found by matching tensile
   results in terms of loading-unloading stress-stretch curve and
   transversal behavior. The constitutive model is found to successfully
   capture the variations in osmolarity and strain-rate conditions (both
   statistically significant, p < 0.05) on the intrinsic response and the
   auxeticity. The stress/strain patterns in the model simulation provide
   valuable insights into the role of the interlamellar zone in the
   osmo-inelastic mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{At the present, coal bump research aims mostly at coal adjoining the
   laneway free surface but neglects the dynamic condition of laneway deep
   coal. It is based on the traditional static or dynamic theory in
   modelling with invariable boundaries systems. Actually, the stress state
   surrounding deep coal is dynamically changed with the excavation of
   working face or laneway, which may result in coal bump. This topic is
   rarely studied now. According to the representative characteristics of
   coal bump, the time-variation structure mechanics theory is applied to
   clarify the initiation mechanism of coal bump. Inherent parameters of
   coal self-sustaining bearing structures, such as load conditions,
   physics characteristics and boundaries, etc.,are time-varying. The
   time-varying structure model is established and it can be further
   simplified to a mechanics model. The time-varying mechanics model
   indicates that the mass-decreased-with-time coal structure can give
   negative damping which can cause dynamic instability and lead to coal
   bump. By using the finite element analysis in the software ANSYS, coal
   bump occurrence can be well simulated when coal is softened by
   decreasing its elastic modulus E and poisson ratio mu. The results can
   be helpful in explaining the mechanism of coal bump.}},

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional, hard-body systems of cyclic multimers (pentamers and

   (the elastic constants and the Poisson ratio) are computed for hexagonal

   strain-fluctuation method. In both systems a minimum of the Poisson
   ratio is observed at the same density at which a qualitative change of
   the orientational single distribution function occurs. This result
   confirms that, in each of the studied systems, a phase transition occurs
   between two elastically isotropic solid phases exhibiting orientational
   disorder: a higher-density phase with (strongly) hindered rotation and a
   lower-density phase with (almost) free rotation. The study also suggests
   that it is worth paying more attention to the dependence of the Poisson
   ratio on the thermodynamic variables (volume, pressure or temperature)
   in solids because this quantity can play the role of a sensitive
   indicator of (at least some) structural phase transitions.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Men who have sex with men (MSM) represent over half of new
   HIV infections in the United States. It is important to understand the
   factors associated with engaging in risky sexual behavior to develop
   effective prevention interventions. Binge drinking (>= 5 drinks on >= 1
   occasion) is the most common form of excessive alcohol consumption. This
   study examines the relationship between binge drinking and sexual risk
   behaviors among MSM who are current drinkers and who were either
   HIV-negative or unaware of their HIV status.
   Methods: Using the 2011 National HIV Behavioral Surveillance system and
   multivariable Poisson models with robust error estimates, we assessed
   the association between binge drinking and sexual risk behaviors among
   current drinkers. Prevalence ratios (PR) and 95\% confidence intervals
   (CI) are presented.
   Results: Overall, 85\% of MSM were current drinkers, and 59\% of MSM who
   drank reported >= 1 episode of binge drinking in the preceding 30 days.
   In multivariable models, binge drinking was associated with condomless
   anal intercourse (CAI) at last sex with an HIV-positive or unknown
   status partner (receptive: PR 1.3,95\% CI 1.1-1.6; insertive: PR
   1.2,95\% CI 1.0-1.4), having exchanged sex for money or drugs at last
   sex (PR: 1.4, 95\% CI 1.1-1.7), having concurrent partners in the past
   year (PR: 1.1, 95\% CI 1.1-1.2), and having more CAI partners in the
   past year (PR: 1.2, 95\% CI 1.0-1.4) compared to non-binge drinkers.
   Conclusions: Evidence-based strategies for reducing binge drinking could
   help reduce risky sexual behavior among MSM. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Advances in biotechnology have made possible the production of a large
   number of new proteins important to the food, pharmaceutical, and
   chemical industry. The significance of aqueous two-phase systems (ATPSs)
   in downstream processing with commercial application has been reported
   for the separation of a large number of biopharmaceutical products. For
   both industrial-and laboratory-scale purposes it is essential to know
   the partitioning behaviour of biomolecules and which parameters lead to
   an optimal separation {[}1]. ATPS process design and implementation at a
   large scale is limited by the poor understanding of the molecular
   mechanism behind the solute partitioning. A better understanding of the
   molecular mechanism of the factors, which govern partitioning,
   contributes for the prediction of the partitioning behaviour in ATPSs.
   The approach is based on a thermodynamic cycle where the polar and
   nonpolar contributions to the free energy of transfer are assumed to be
   additive. The total free energy of transfer was experimentally obtained
   by determination of the proteins partitioning coefficient. Electrostatic
   energy contributions were estimated using a Poisson-Boltzmann
   computational method. The nonpolar contribution was obtained as a
   difference between the total free energy of transfer and the
   electrostatic contribution and related with the solvent accessible
   surface area. This methodology was already successfully applied to the
   partitioning of amino acids in ATPSs {[}2]. In this study partitioning
   of a 14 globular proteins, was examined in 4 different polymer/polymer
   ATPSs. The model performance was analysed regarding to the influence of
   different PDB structure and protein charges. Nonpolar energy
   contribution was related with the solvent accessible surface area, by
   linear relationship. Using a semi-empirical model, it was possible to
   predict the partition coefficient of several proteins in four different
   polymer/polymer systems. The model shows improved prediction capacity
   when applied to the group of protein with the same electrostatic
   characteristic (positive or negative charge proteins).}},

Abstract = {{As is well known, the monotonicity of failure rate of a life
   distribution plays an important role in modeling failure time data. In
   this paper, we develop techniques for the determination of increasing
   failure rate (IFR) and decreasing failure rate (DFR) property for a wide
   class of discrete distributions. Instead of using the failure rate, we
   make use of the ratio of two consecutive probabilities. The method
   developed is applied to various well known families of discrete
   distributions which include the binomial, negative binomial and Poisson
   distributions as special cases. Finally, a formula is presented to
   determine explicitly the failure rate of the families considered. This
   formula is used to determine the failure rate of various classes of
   discrete distributions. These formulas are explicit but complicated and
   cannot normally be used to determine the monotonicity of the failure
   rates. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

   regimes. We tested the effectiveness of the use of variance-mean ratios
   and frequency histograms from counts in quadrats. Wheat plants (Triticum
   aestivum L. cv. `Biggar') were grown in undisturbed soil samples from
   two adjacent fields, one under no tillage for the previous 10 years, the
   other under conventional tillage for 9 years. Root contact points on
   horizontal plane sections of the samples were mapped. Statistical
   analysis of the root patterns indicated clustering; testing the
   hypotheses of pure-Poisson, Neyman type A and negative binomial
   distributions showed that the Neyman type A is the most suitable,
   Analysis of root distributions along with root and top biomass detected
   no significant difference between the two tillage treatments except a
   trend for increased rooting in the upper layer of the untilled soil.}},

Abstract = {{Sometimes there is interest in a dichotomized outcome indicating whether
   a count variable is positive or zero. Under this scenario, the
   application of ordinary logistic regression may result in efficiency
   loss, which is quantifiable under an assumed model for the counts. In
   such situations, a shared-parameter hurdle model is investigated for
   more efficient estimation of regression parameters relating to overall
   effects of covariates on the dichotomous outcome, while handling count
   data with many zeroes. One model part provides a logistic regression
   containing marginal log odds ratio effects of primary interest, while an
   ancillary model part describes the mean count of a Poisson or negative
   binomial process in terms of nuisance regression parameters. Asymptotic
   efficiency of the logistic model parameter estimators of the two-part
   models is evaluated with respect to ordinary logistic regression.
   Simulations are used to assess the properties of the models with respect
   to power and Type I error, the latter investigated under both
   misspecified and correctly specified models. The methods are applied to
   data from a randomized clinical trial of three toothpaste formulations
   to prevent incident dental caries in a large population of Scottish
   schoolchildren.}},

Abstract = {{Inspired by low transverse and high vertical stiffness characteristics

   The constitutive model of the bio-ITCLC sandwich panel under

   of epidermis cell walls, is introduced in the above constitutive model
   to capture the growth behavior of a leaf shape via epidermis cell
   divisions to study morphing mechanisms of a flexible skin. On this
   basis, by the supporting effect of self-adaption units in the bio-ITCLC
   core, with new circumstances, is proposed to be one promising approach

Abstract = {{Ideally, orthopedic implants would last for the entire lifetime of the
   patient. Unfortunately, they rarely do. Critically sized defects are a
   common sight in the revision of acetabular cups, and rather difficult to
   treat. The permanent deformation of lattice structures can be used to
   create shape-morphing implants that would fill up the defect site, and
   thereby restore the physiological loading conditions. Bending-dominated
   structures were incorporated in the porous outer layer of the
   space-filling meta-implants for their considerable lateral expansion in
   response to axial compression. A functionally graded density offered
   structural integrity at the joint while enhancing the deformability at
   the bone-implant interface. With the use of a more ductile metal, CP-Ti,
   these meta-implants could be deformed without strut failure.
   The unprecedented properties of meta-biomaterials could pave the way for
   the development of lifelasting orthopedic implants. Here, we used
   non-auxetic meta-biomaterials to address the shortcomings of the current
   treatment options in acetabular revision surgery. Due to the severe bone
   deficiencies and poor bone quality, it can be very challenging to
   acquire adequate initial implant stability and long-term fixation. More
   advanced treatments, such as patient-specific implants, do guarantee the
   initial stability, but are formidably expensive and may eventually fail
   due to stress shielding. We, therefore, developed meta-implants
   furnished with a deformable porous outer layer. Upon implantation, this
   layer plastically deforms into the defects, thereby improving the
   initial stability and homogeneously stimulating the surrounding bone. We
   first studied the space-filling behavior of additively manufactured pure
   titanium lattices, based on six different unit cells, in a compression
   test complemented with full-field strain measurements. The diamond,
   body-centered cubic, and rhombic dodecahedron unit cells were eventually
   selected for the design of the deformable porous outer layer. Each
   design came in three different relative density profiles, namely maximum
   (MAX), functionally graded (FG), and minimum (MIN). After their
   compression in bone-mimicking molds with simulated acetabular defects,
   the space-filling behavior of the implants was evaluated using
   load-displacement curves, micro-CT images, and 3D reconstructions. The
   meta-implants with an FG diamond infill exhibited the most promising
   space-filling behavior. However, the required push-in forces exceed the
   impact forces currently applied in surgery. Future research should,
   therefore, focus on design optimization, to improve the space-filling
   behavior and to facilitate the implantation process for orthopedic
   surgeons.}},

Abstract = {{Although epitaxial strain imparted by lattice mismatch between a film
   and the underlying substrate has led to distinct structures and emergent
   functionalities, the discrete lattice parameters of limited substrates,
   combined with strain relaxations driven by film thickness, result in
   severe obstructions to subtly regulate electro-elastic coupling
   properties in perovskite ferroelectric films. Here a practical and
   universal method to achieve highly strained phases with large tetragonal
   distortions in Pb-based ferroelectric films through synergetic effects
   of moderately (approximate to 1.0\%) misfit strains and laser fluences
   during pulsed laser deposition process is demonstrated. The phase
   possesses unexpectedly large Poisson's ratio and negative thermal
   expansion, and concomitant enhancements of spontaneous polarization
   (approximate to 100 mu C cm(-2)) and Curie temperature (approximate to
   800 degrees C), 40\% and 75\% larger than that of bulk counterparts,
   respectively. This strategy efficiently circumvents the long-standing
   issue of limited numbers of discrete substrates and enables continuous
   regulations of exploitable lattice states in functional oxide films with
   tightly elastic coupled performances beyond their present levels.}},

Abstract = {{Methods. Uncircumcised human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-negative men
   aged 15-49 years were randomized to immediate circumcision (intervention
   arm, 441 subjects) or delayed circumcision (control arm, 399 subjects).
   Human papillomavirus (HPV) was detected by Roche HPV Linear Array at
   enrollment, and at 6, 12, and 24 months. Incident high-risk HPV (HR-HPV)
   was estimated in men who acquired a new HR-HPV genotype. HR-HPV
   clearance was determined in men with prior genotype-specific HR-HPV
   infections. Rate ratios (RRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) of
   HR-HPV acquisition were estimated by Poisson multiple regression.
   Results. Enrollment characteristics were comparable between study
   groups. HR-HPV incidence was 19.7 cases per 100 person-years (PYs) in
   the intervention arm (70 cases per 355.8 PYs) and 29.4 cases per 100 PYs
   (125 cases per 424.8 PYs) in the control arm (RR, 0.67; 95\% CI,
   0.51-0.89; P = .006). The incidence of multiple HR-HPV infections was
   6.7 cases per 100 PYs in the intervention arm and 14.8 cases per 100 PYs
   in the control arm (RR, 0.45; 95\% CI, 0.28-0.73), but there was no
   significant effect on single infections (RR, 0.89; 95\% CI, 0.60-1.30).
   HR-HPV incidence was lower in the intervention arm for all genotypes and
   demographic/behavioral subgroups. The clearance of preexisting HR-HPV
   infections was 215.8 cases per 100 PYs (205 cases per 95 PYs) in the
   intervention arm and 159.1 cases per 100 PYs (255 cases per 160.25 PYs)
   in the control arm (adjusted RR, 1.39; 95\% CI, 1.17-1.64).
   Conclusions. Male circumcision reduces the incidence of multiple HR-HPV
   infections and increases clearance of HR-HPV infections in
   HIV-uninfected men.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanical properties of oxalic acid dihydrate and anhydrous oxalic
   acid ( and polymorphic forms) were obtained by using rigorous
   theoretical solid-state methods based on density functional theory using
   plane waves and pseudopotentials. The calculated crystal structures and
   X-ray powder diffraction patterns of these materials were found to be in
   excellent agreement with the experimental information. Since the
   calculated elasticity matrices fullfilled the Born stability conditions,
   the corresponding crystal structures were found to be mechanically
   stable. A large number of relevant mechanical properties including the
   values of the bulk moduli and their pressure derivatives, shear and
   Young moduli, Poisson ratios, ductility and hardness indices, and
   mechanical anisotropy values of these materials were reported. The three
   forms of oxalic acid are highly anisotropic ductile materials having low
   hardness and bulk moduli. The three materials are shown to display small
   negative Poisson ratios (NPR) and to exhibit the phenomenon of negative
   linear compressibility (NLC) for applied pressures along the direction
   of the minimum Poisson ratio. In addition, they undergo pressure induced
   phase transitions for relatively small applied pressures. The analysis
   of the crystal structures of these materials as a function of pressure
   demonstrates that the mechanism of NLC of these materials is unrelated
   to the wine-rack structural mechanism commonly used to rationalize this
   phenomenon. The three forms of oxalic acid considered in this work are
   molecular crystals whose structures are characterized by structural
   elements which are not directly bonded but held together by weak van der
   Waals forces. The weak bonding between these elements is able to
   accommodate the structural variations originating from the application
   of pressure, but the resulting structural deformations appear to be
   counterintuitive and lead to the anomalous mechanical behavior of these
   materials.}},

Title = {{Socioeconomic determinants of geographic disparities in
   campylobacteriosis risk: a comparison of global and local modeling
   approaches}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH GEOGRAPHICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{OCT 13}},
Abstract = {{Background: Socioeconomic factors play a complex role in determining the
   risk of campylobacteriosis. Understanding the spatial interplay between
   these factors and disease risk can guide disease control programs.
   Historically, Poisson and negative binomial models have been used to
   investigate determinants of geographic disparities in risk. Spatial
   regression models, which allow modeling of spatial effects, have been
   used to improve these modeling efforts. Geographically weighted
   regression (GWR) takes this a step further by estimating local
   regression coefficients, thereby allowing estimations of associations
   that vary in space. These recent approaches increase our understanding
   of how geography influences the associations between determinants and
   disease. Therefore the objectives of this study were to: (i) identify
   socioeconomic determinants of the geographic disparities of
   campylobacteriosis risk (ii) investigate if regression coefficients for
   the associations between socioeconomic factors and campylobacteriosis
   risk demonstrate spatial variability and (iii) compare the performance
   of four modeling approaches: negative binomial, spatial lag, global and
   local Poisson GWR.
   Methods: Negative binomial, spatial lag, global and local Poisson GWR
   modeling techniques were used to investigate associations between
   socioeconomic factors and geographic disparities in campylobacteriosis
   risk. The best fitting models were identified and compared.
   Results: Two competing four variable models (Models 1 \& 2) were
   identified. Significant variables included race, unemployment rate,
   education attainment, urbanicity, and divorce rate. Local Poisson GWR
   had the best fit and showed evidence of spatially varying regression
   coefficients.
   Conclusions: The international significance of this work is that it
   highlights the inadequacy of global regression strategies that estimate
   one parameter per independent variable, and therefore mask the true
   relationships between dependent and independent variables. Since local
   GWR estimate a regression coefficient for each location, it reveals the
   geographic differences in the associations. This implies that a factor
   may be an important determinant in some locations and not others.
   Incorporating this into health planning ensures that a needs-based,
   rather than a ``one-size-fits-all{''}, approach is used. Thus, adding
   local GWR to the epidemiologists' toolbox would allow them to assess how
   the impacts of different determinants vary by geography. This knowledge
   is critical for resource allocation in disease control programs.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a dual metal trapezoidal recessed channel metal
   oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET) embedded with
   asymmetric stack gate with linearly graded metal work-function technique
   to improve the carrier transport efficiency and device switching
   performance. The analytical model for the proposed asymmetric-linearly
   graded trapezoidal gate (ASY-LGTG) silicon on insulator (SOI) MOSFET has
   been developed considering parabolic approximation of 2-D Poisson's
   equation. The threshold voltage of the device is extracted using minimum
   surface potential. The simulation work has been carried out using a
   Silvaco TCAD tool to validate the results of the analytical model. This
   grooved structure exhibits the corner effect, which plays a dynamic role
   in the improvement of the device performance. However, the impact of the
   corner effect can be controlled by the groove corner angle and doping
   concentration. We have also investigated the impact of different
   structural parameters such as negative junction depth (NJD), corner
   angle, substrate doping and stack gate features (upper oxide
   permittivity and oxide thickness ratio) on the performance of minimum
   surface potential, sub-threshold slope (SS), drain induced barrier
   lowering (DIBL), threshold voltage and device switching characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{The formation and dynamics of fully nonlinear ion-acoustic solitary
   waves, which accompany electronegative plasmas composed of positive
   ions, two-negative ions, isothermal electrons, as well as a fraction of
   stationary charged (positive or negative) dust impurities are
   investigated. By using the hydrodynamic and Poisson equations, an
   energy-integral equation involving a Sagdeev pseudo-potential is
   derived. Using the latter, we have defined precisely the existence
   regions of the electrostatic localized pulses. The critical total
   negative ions concentration ac and critical second-negative ion density
   ratio mc thresholds, which indicate where the solitary pulses set in,
   have been determined for various regimes. Numerical calculations reveal
   that only supersonic pulses can exist. The total negative ions
   concentration, the second-to-total negative ions density ratio,
   electrons-to-positive ions temperature ratio, dust impurities
   concentration, positive-to-negative mass ratio, and Mach number have
   been investigated on the nonlinear wave profile. It is found that the
   total negative ion concentration as well as the dust particles
   concentration play the significant role in deciding the polarity of the
   propagating pulses. The results could be applied to investigate and
   predict the behavior of the nonlinear solitary structure in future

   pattern transformation when the structures are loaded by compression
   force beyond a critical value. Different from other periodic cellular
   materials, novel transformed pattern for SMP material can be fixed via
   cooling to a temperature below the glass transition temperature T-g, and
   this fixed pattern can further be recovered to its original pattern by
   reheating to a temperature above T-g. Moreover, viscous property of SMP
   during shape memory cycle is taken into account by considering the
   effects of nominal strain rate and temperature on the pattern
   transformation. Time-temperature superposition principle is adopted to
   explain these effects. On the other hand, this transformation phenomenon
   for SMP can be triggered even by the stress relaxation process. It is
   also observed that the auxetic behavior (negative Poisson ratio) exists
   in the pattern transformation during both the compression process and
   the stress relaxation process for SMP periodic cellular structures. With
   present study, we are able to gain deeper insights and explain some of
   the new interesting physical phenomena observed in reported experiments
   for SMP periodic cellular structures. Besides, these new findings can be
   used to design appropriate SMP structures in special applications. (C)

Abstract = {{In this work the concept of using a chiral honeycomb as the internal
   structure for a passively morphing wing is explored. The use of a chiral
   honeycomb, which features an in-plane negative Poisson's ratio,
   potentially offers high deformability whilst maintaining structural
   integrity of the wing box. A finite element simulation was carried out,
   coupling a complete two-dimensional model of the wing and internal
   structure to a panel code flow solver. An iterative process was then
   used in order to predict the wing camber change with respect to
   air-flow. The concept was validated experimentally through the
   construction of a prototype wing for wind-tunnel testing. The measured
   response was non-linear with respect to aerodynamic loading, but the
   final deflected shape at the design case compared well with the finite
   element prediction. The concept was proven to work for small camber
   changes, with larger deflections predicted by tailoring the mechanical
   properties of the hexachiral core.}},

Title = {{An association between decreasing incidence of invasive non-typhoidal
   salmonellosis and increased use of antiretroviral therapy, Gauteng

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Abstract = {{Background
   HIV-infected persons are at increased risk of opportunistic infections,
   including invasive nontyphoidal Salmonella (iNTS) infections;
   antiretroviral therapy (ART) reduces this risk. We explored changing
   iNTS incidence associated with increasing ART availability in South
   Africa.
   Methods
   Laboratory-based surveillance for iNTS was conducted in Gauteng
   Province, South Africa, with verification using the National Health
   Laboratory Service's Central Data Warehouse (CDW), between 2003 and
   2013. Isolates were serotyped at the Centre for Enteric Diseases. CDW
   data on patient numbers obtaining HIV viral load measurements provided
   estimates of numbers of HIV-infected patients receiving ART. A Poisson
   regression model was used to measure the changing incidence of iNTS
   infection from 2003 to 2013. The correlation between the incidence of
   iNTS and ART use from 2004 to 2013 was determined using Pearson's
   correlation coefficient.
   Results
   From 2003-2013, the incidence of iNTS per 100,000 population per year
   decreased from 5.0 to 2.2 (p < .001). From 2004 to 2013, the incidence
   per 100,000 population of HIV viral load testing increased from 75.2 to
   3,620.3 (p < .001). The most common serotypes causing invasive disease
   were Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (Salmonella Typhimurium),
   and Salmonella Enteritidis: 2,469 (55.4\%) and 1,156 (25.9\%) of 4,459
   isolates serotyped, respectively. A strong negative correlation was
   observed between decreasing iNTS incidence and increasing ART use from
   2004 to 2013 (r = -0.94, p < .001). Similarly, decreasing incidence of
   invasive Salmonella Typhimurium infection correlated with increasing ART
   use (r = -0.93, p <.001). Incidence of invasive Salmonella Enteritidis
   infection increased, however (r = 0.95, p <.001). Between 2003 and 2004,
   fewer adult men than women presented with iNTS (male-to- female rate
   ratio 0.73 and 0.89, respectively). This was reversed from 2005 through
   2013 (ranging from 1.07 in 2005 to 1.44 in 2013). Adult men accessed ART
   less (male-to-female rate ratio ranging from 0.61 {[}2004] to 0.67
   {[}2013]).
   Conclusions
   The incidence of iNTS infections including Salmonella Typhimurium
   decreased significantly in Gauteng Province in association with
   increased ART utilization. Adult men accessed ART programs less than
   women, translating into increasing iNTS incidence in this group.
   Monitoring iNTS incidence may assist in monitoring the ART program.
   Increasing incidence of invasive Salmonella Enteritidis infections needs
   further elucidation.}},

Abstract = {{Using particle swarm optimization (PSO) methodology for crystal
   structure prediction, we predicted a novel two-dimensional (2D)
   monolayer of silicide diphosphorus compound: SiP2, which exhibits good
   stability as examined via cohesive energy, mechanical criteria,
   molecular dynamics simulation and all positive phonon spectrum,
   respectively. The SiP2 monolayer is an indirect semiconductor with the
   band gap as 1.8484 eV (PBE) or 2.681 eV (HSE06), which makes it more
   advantageous for high-frequency-response optoelectronic materials.
   Moreover, the monolayer is a relatively hard auxetic material with
   negative Possion's ratios, and also possesses a ultrahigh carrier
   mobility (1.069 x 10(5) cm(2) V-1 s(-1)) which is approximately four
   times the maximum value in phosphorene and comparable to the value of
   graphene and CP monolayers. Furthermore, the effects of strains on band
   structures and optical properties of SiP2 monolayer have been studied,
   as well as CO2 molecules can be strongly chemically adsorbed on the SiP2
   monolayer. A semiconductor-to-metal transition for -9.5\% strain ratio
   case and a huge optical absorption capacity on the order of 106 cm(-1)
   in visible region present. These theoretical findings endow SiP2
   Monolayer to be a novel 2D material holding great promises for
   applications in high-performance electronics, optoelectronics, mechanics
   and CO2 capturing material. (C) 2020 Chinese Chemical Society and

Title = {{Random parameter models for accident prediction on two-lane undivided

Abstract = {{Introduction: Generalized linear modeling (GLM), with the assumption of
   Poisson or negative binomial error structure, has been widely employed
   in road accident modeling. A number of explanatory variables related to
   traffic, road geometry, and environment that contribute to accident
   occurrence have been identified and accident prediction models have been
   proposed. The accident prediction models reported in literature largely
   employ the fixed parameter modeling approach, where the magnitude of
   influence of an explanatory variable is considered to be fixed for any
   observation in the population. Similar models have been proposed for
   Indian highways too, which include additional variables representing
   traffic composition. The mixed traffic on Indian highways comes with a
   lot of variability within, ranging from difference in vehicle types to
   variability in driver behavior. This could result in variability in the
   effect of explanatory variables on accidents across locations. Random
   parameter models, which can capture some of such variability, are
   expected to be more appropriate for the Indian situation. Method: The
   present study is an attempt to employ random parameter modeling for
   accident prediction on two-lane undivided rural highways in India. Three
   years of accident history, from nearly 200 km of highway segments, is
   used to calibrate and validate the models. Results: The results of the
   analysis suggest that the model coefficients for traffic volume,
   proportion of cars, motorized two-wheelers and trucks in traffic, and
   driveway density and horizontal and vertical curvatures are randomly
   distributed across locations. Conclusions: The paper is concluded with a
   discussion on modeling results and the limitations of the present study.

Abstract = {{FISH functions were written and embedded in FLAC to calculate the axial,
   lateral and volumetric strains as well as the ratio of negative lateral
   strain to axial strain (called the calculated Poisson's ratio in plane
   strain compression, which is different from Poisson's ratio in elastic
   stage) of rock specimen in plane strain compression. The influence of
   pore pressure on pattern of shear band and entire deformational
   characteristics was numerically investigated. In elastic stage, the
   adopted constitutive relation of rock was linear elastic. Beyond the
   peak stress, a composite Mohr-Coulomb criterion with tension cut-off was
   used and the post-peak constitutive relation was linear softening.
   Numerical results show that higher pore pressure leads to larger failure
   zone, steeper shear band's inclination closer to Arthur's predictions,
   lower peak stress, lower absolute values of axial, lateral and
   volumetric strains corresponding to the peak stress. Lower pore pressure
   has not an influence on the slopes of stress-axial strain curve and
   stress-lateral strain curve beyond the peak stress since the failure
   mode of the specimen is independent of pore pressure. However, for
   higher pore pressure, the number of failed elements is greatly
   increased, leading to less steep post-peak stress-axial strain curve and
   stress-lateral strain curve. For higher pore pressure, higher lateral
   deformation and higher calculated Poisson's ratio as well as negative
   volumetric strain can be reached at the same axial strain. No apparent
   difference in precursors to unstable failure of rock specimen is
   observed with an increase of pore pressure. In strain-softening stage,
   the slopes of lateral strain-axial strain curve, Poisson's ratio-axial
   strain curve and volumetric strain-axial strain curve are not influenced
   by pore pressure; owing to the apparent lateral expansion, the
   calculated Poisson's ratio can exceed 0.5, as is consistent with some
   experimental measurements.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: to assess the prevalence of self-medication and to
   investigate its associated factors in adults living in the Federal
   District, Brazil. Methods: this is a cross-sectional population-based
   study conducted with adults selected through probabilistic sampling;
   self-medication prevalence was obtained from those who reported having
   used any medicine in the previous seven days; Poisson regression model
   with robust variance was applied to adjust the prevalence ratios.
   Results: 1,820 individuals were interviewed, of which 646 had taken at
   least one medicine; self-medication prevalence was of 14.9\% (95\% CI:
   12.6\%; 17.5\%); the adjusted analysis showed negative association in
   people aged 50 to 65 years (PR=0.26; 95\% CI: 0.15; 0.47) and with
   chronic diseases (PR=0.38; 95\% CI: 0.28; 0.51); adults with
   difficulties in performing daily activities (PR=2.25; 95\% CI: 1.43;

Abstract = {{Cancer has long been known to be a hazard of exposure to ionizing
   radiation. However, the assessment of health effects from exposure to
   radiation is a matter of considerable controversy. This paper presents
   results of a retrospective study of leukemia incidence (203-207, ICD-9)
   around the highest Cs-137 pollution in Poland (as an effect of the
   Czarnobyl disaster and/or military bomb tests). The data relating to all
   the registered leukemias in males and females originated from the
   Regional Cancer Registry in Opole. The information on Cs-137
   concentration rates in Opole province was derived from the state
   monitoring provided by the Polish Geological Institute in Warsaw. The
   spatial analysis - based on the random-effects Poisson regression model
   - was carried out via the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique
   (Gibbs sampling) using BUGS software. The model incorporated
   epidemiological data and an ecological covariate - isotope
   concentrations - and provided a framework for estimating the strength of
   a dose-response relationship. The differences in incidence levels were
   quantified by traditional standardized morbidity ratios (SMRs) and
   presented in thematic maps as well as in combined charts of
   distance-disease-dose relations. Additionally, to assess spatial disease
   clustering, a Tango test was adopted. The results of this ecological
   study suggest that the Cs-137 concentrations did not have any negative
   influence on the exposed population.}},

Number = {{13}},
Pages = {{3510-3525}},

Abstract = {{We develop a projected Nesterov's proximal-gradient (PNPG) approach for
   sparse signal reconstruction that combines adaptive step size with
   Nesterov's momentum acceleration. The objective function that we wish to
   minimize is the sum of a convex differentiable data-fidelity (negative
   log-likelihood (NLL)) term and a convex regularization term. We apply
   sparse signal regularization where the signal belongs to a closed convex
   set within the closure of the domain of the NLL; the convex-set
   constraint facilitates flexible NLL domains and accurate signal
   recovery. Signal sparsity is imposed using the l(1)-norm penalty on the
   signal's linear transform coefficients. The PNPG approach employs a
   projected Nesterov's acceleration step with restart and a duality-based
   inner iteration to compute the proximal mapping. We propose an adaptive
   step-size selection scheme to obtain a good local majorizing function of
   the NLL and reduce the time spent backtracking. Thanks to step-size
   adaptation, PNPG converges faster than the methods that do not adjust to
   the local curvature of the NLL. We present an integrated derivation of
   the momentum acceleration and proofs of O(k-2) objective function
   convergence rate and convergence of the iterates, which account for
   adaptive step size, inexactness of the iterative proximal mapping, and
   the convex-set constraint. The tuning of PNPG is largely application
   independent. Tomographic and compressed-sensing reconstruction
   experiments with Poisson generalized linear and Gaussian linear
   measurement models demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{Soft materials capable of transforming between three-dimensional (3D)
   shapes in response to stimuli such as light, heat, solvent, electric and
   magnetic fields have applications in diverse areas such as flexible
   electronics(1,2), soft robotics(3,4) and biomedicine(5-7). In
   particular, magnetic fields offer a safe and effective manipulation
   method for biomedical applications, which typically require remote
   actuation in enclosed and confined spaces(8-10). With advances in
   magnetic field control11, magnetically responsive soft materials have
   also evolved from embedding discrete magnets(12) or incorporating
   magnetic particles(13) into soft compounds to generating nonuniform
   magnetization profiles in polymeric sheets(14,15). Here we report 3D
   printing of programmed ferromagnetic domains in soft materials that
   enable fast transformations between complex 3D shapes via magnetic
   actuation. Our approach is based on direct ink writing(16) of an
   elastomer composite containing ferromagnetic microparticles. By applying
   a magnetic field to the dispensing nozzle while printing(17), we
   reorient particles along the applied field to impart patterned magnetic
   polarity to printed filaments. This method allows us to program
   ferromagnetic domains in complex 3D-printed soft materials, enabling a
   set of previously inaccessible modes of transformation, such as remotely
   controlled auxetic behaviours of mechanical metamaterials with negative
   Poisson's ratios. The actuation speed and power density of our printed
   soft materials with programmed ferromagnetic domains are orders of
   magnitude greater than existing 3D-printed active materials. We further
   demonstrate diverse functions derived from complex shape changes,
   including reconfigurable soft electronics, a mechanical metamaterial
   that can jump and a soft robot that crawls, rolls, catches fast-moving
   objects and transports a pharmaceutical dose.}},

Volume = {{79}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{1549-1566}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we present a quantitative theory of temporal
   spike-frequency adaptation in cortical pyramidal cells. Our model
   pyramidal neuron has two-compartments (a ``soma{''} and a
   ``dendrite{''}) with a voltage-gated Ca2(+) conductance (g(Ca)) and a
   Ca2+-dependent K+ conductance (g(AHP)) located at the dendrite or at
   both compartments. Its frequency-current relations are comparable with
   data from cortical pyramidal cells, and the properties of spike-evoked
   intracellular {[}Ca2+] transients are matched with recent dendritic
   {[}Ca2+] imaging measurements. Spike-frequency adaptation in response to
   a current pulse is characterized by an adaptation time constant
   tau(adap) and percentage adaptation of spike frequency F-adap {[}\%
   (peak - steady state)/peak]. We show how tau(adap) and F-adap can be
   derived in terms of the biophysical parameters of the neural membrane
   and {[}Ca2+] dynamics. Two simple, experimentally testable, relations
   between tau(adap) and F-adap are predicted. The dependence of tau(adap)
   and F-adap On current pulse intensity, electrotonic coupling between the
   two compartments, g(AHP) as well the {[}Ca2+] decay time constant
   tau(Ca), is assessed quantitatively. In addition, we demonstrate that
   the intracellular {[}Ca2+] signal can encode the instantaneous neuronal
   firing rate and that the conductance-based model can be reduced to a
   simple calcium-model of neuronal activity that faithfully predicts the
   neuronal firing output even when the input varies relatively rapidly in
   time (tens to hundreds of milliseconds). Extensive simulations have been
   carried out for the model neuron with random excitatory synaptic inputs
   mimicked by a Poisson process. Our findings include 1) the instantaneous
   firing frequency (averaged over trials) shows strong adaptation similar
   to the case with current pulses; 2) when the g(AHP) is blocked, the
   dendritic g(Ca) could produce a hysteresis phenomenon where the neuron
   is driven to switch randomly between a quiescent state and a repetitive
   firing state. The firing pattern is very irregular with a large
   coefficient of variation of the interspike intervals (ISI CV > 1). The
   ISI distribution shows a long tail but is not bimodal. 3) By contrast,
   in an intrinsically bursting regime (with different parameter values),
   the model neuron displays a random temporal mixture of single action
   potentials and brief bursts of spikes. Its ISI distribution is often
   bimodal and its power spectrum has a peak. 4) The spike-adapting current
   I-AHP, as delayed inhibition through intracellular Ca2+ accumulation,
   generates a ``forward masking{''} effect, where a masking input
   dramatically reduces or completely suppresses the neuronal response to a
   subsequent test input. When two inputs are presented repetitively in
   time, this mechanism greatly enhances the ratio of the responses to the
   stronger and weaker inputs, fulfilling a cellular form of lateral
   inhibition in time. 5) The {[}Ca2+]-dependent I-AHP provides a mechanism
   by which the neuron unceasingly adapts to the stochastic synaptic
   inputs, even in the stationary state following the input onset. This
   creates strong negative correlations between output ISIs in a
   frequency-dependent manner, while the Poisson input is totally
   uncorrelated in time. Possible functional implications of these results
   are discussed.}},

   natural history of high-risk anal human papillomavirus (HPV) among a
   multinational group of men who have sex with men (MSM) aged 18-64 years.
   Methods. Anal specimens from human immunodeficiency virus-negative men
   from Brazil, Mexico, and the United States were genotyped. Over 2 years,
   406 MSM provided evaluable specimens every 6 months for >= 2 visits.
   These men were stratified into men who have sex only with men (MSOM, n =
   70) and men who have sex with women and men (MSWM, n = 336). Persistence
   was defined as >= 12 months' type-specific duration and could begin with
   either a prevalent or incident infection. Prevalence ratios and 95\%
   confidence intervals were calculated by Poisson regression.
   Results. Median follow-up time was 2.1 years. Retention was 82\%. Annual
   cumulative incidence of 9-valent vaccine types was 19\% and 8\% among
   MSOM and MSWM, respectively (log-rank P =.02). Duration of anal HPV did
   not differ for MSOM and MSWM and was a median of 6.9 months for HPV-16
   after combining men from the 2 groups. Among men with prevalent
   high-risk infection (n = 106), a total of 36.8\%, retained the infection
   for at least 24 months. For those with prevalent HPV-16 (n = 27), 29.6\%
   were persistent for at least 24 months. Persistence of high-risk HPV was
   associated with number of male anal sex partners and inversely
   associated with number of female sex partners.
   Conclusions. MSM with prevalent high-risk HPV infection should be
   considered at increased risk for nontransient infection.}},

Abstract = {{We report calculated elastic tensors, axial Gruneisen parameters, and
   thermal stress distributions in Al2Mo3O12, ZrMgMo3O12, Sc2Mo3O12, and
   Y2Mo3O12, a series of isomorphic materials for which the coefficients of
   thermal expansion range from low-positive to negative. Thermal stress in
   polycrystalline materials arises from interactions between thermal
   expansion and mechanical properties, and both can be highly anisotropic.
   Thermal expansion anisotropy was found to be correlated with elastic
   anisotropy: axes with negative thermal expansion were less compliant.
   Calculations of axial Gruneisen parameters revealed that the thermal
   expansion anisotropy in these materials is in part due to the Poisson
   effect. Models of thermal stress due to thermal expansion anisotropy in
   polycrystals following cooling showed thermal stresses of sufficient
   magnitude to cause microcracking in all cases. The thermal expansion
   anisotropy was found to couple to elastic anisotropy, decreasing the
   bulk coefficient of thermal expansion and leading to lognormal extremes
   of the thermal stress distributions.}},

Abstract = {{Background Increased understanding of whether individuals who have
   recovered from COVID-19 are protected from future SARS-CoV-2 infection
   is an urgent requirement. We aimed to investigate whether antibodies
   against SARS-CoV-2 were associated with a decreased risk of symptomatic
   and asymptomatic reinfection.
   Methods A large, multicentre, prospective cohort study was done, with
   participants recruited from publicly funded hospitals in all regions of
   England. All health-care workers, support staff, and administrative
   staff working at hospitals who could remain engaged in follow-up for 12
   months were eligible to join The SARS-CoV-2 Immunity and Reinfection
   Evaluation study. Participants were excluded if they had no PCR tests
   after enrolment, enrolled after Dec 31, 2020, or had insufficient PCR
   and antibody data for cohort assignment. Participants attended regular
   SARS-CoV-2 PCR and antibody testing (every 2-4 weeks) and completed
   questionnaires every 2 weeks on symptoms and exposures. At enrolment,
   participants were assigned to either the positive cohort (antibody
   positive, or previous positive PCR or antibody test) or negative cohort
   (antibody negative, no previous positive PCR or antibody test). The
   primary outcome was a reinfection in the positive cohort or a primary
   infection in the negative cohort, determined by PCR tests. Potential
   reinfections were clinically reviewed and classified according to case
   definitions (confirmed, probable, or possible) and symptom-status,
   depending on the hierarchy of evidence. Primary infections in the
   negative cohort were defined as a first positive PCR test and
   seroconversions were excluded when not associated with a positive PCR
   test. A proportional hazards frailty model using a Poisson distribution
   was used to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRR) to compare infection
   rates in the two cohorts.
   Findings From June 18, 2020, to Dec 31, 2020, 30 625 participants were
   enrolled into the study. 51 participants withdrew from the study, 4913
   were excluded, and 25 661 participants (with linked data on antibody and
   PCR testing) were included in the analysis. Data were extracted from all
   sources on Feb 5, 2021, and include data up to and including Jan 11,
   2021. 155 infections were detected in the baseline positive cohort of
   8278 participants, collectively contributing 2 047113 person-days of
   follow-up. This compares with 1704 new PCR positive infections in the
   negative cohort of 17 383 participants, contributing 2 971 436
   person-days of follow-up. The incidence density was 7.6 reinfections per
   100 000 person-days in the positive cohort, compared with 57.3 primary
   infections per 100 000 person-days in the negative cohort, between June,
   2020, and January, 2021. The adjusted IRR was 0.159 for all reinfections
   (95\% CI 0.13-0.19) compared with PCR-confirmed primary infections. The
   median interval between primary infection and reinfection was more than
   200 days.
   Interpretation A previous history of SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated
   with an 84\% lower risk of infection, with median protective effect
   observed 7 months following primary infection. This time period is the
   minimum probable effect because seroconversions were not included. This
   study shows that previous infection with SARS-CoV-2 induces effective
   immunity to future infections in most individuals. Copyright Crown

   is achieved via molecular dynamics simulations and density functional
   theory calculations. To illustrate the potential of the origami

Abstract = {{Understanding the linkage between Mg2+ binding and RNA folding requires
   a proper theoretical model describing the energetics of Mg2+ binding to
   the folded and unfolded states of RNA. Our current understanding of Mg2+
   binding to these different RNA states derives from empirical
   thermodynamic models that depend on a number of unjustified assumptions.
   We present a rigorous theoretical model describing the linkage between
   RNA folding and magnesium ion binding. In this model, based on the
   non-linear Poisson-Boltzmann (NLPB) equation, the stabilization of RNA
   by Mg2+ arises from two distinct binding modes, diffuse binding and site
   binding. Diffusely bound Mg2+ are described as an ensemble of hydrated
   ions that are attracted to the negative charge of the RNA. Site-bound
   Mg2+ are partially desolvated ions that are attracted to electronegative
   pockets on the RNA surface. We explore two systems, yeast tRNA(Phe) and
   a 58-nucleotide rRNA fragment, with different Mg2+ binding properties.
   The NLPB equation accurately describes both the stoichiometric and
   energetic linkage between imaging for both of these systems without
   requiring any fitted parameters in the calculation. Moreover, the NLPB
   model presents a well-defined physical description of how Mg2+ binding
   helps fold an RNA. For both of the molecules studied here, the relevant
   unfolded state is a disordered intermediate state (1) that contains
   stable helical secondary structure without any tertiary contacts.
   Diffusely bound Mg2+ interact with these secondary structure elements to
   stabilize the I state. The secondary structural elements of the I state
   fold into a compact, native tertiary structure (the N state). Diffuse
   binding plays a dominant role in stabilizing the N state for both RNAs
   studied. However, for the rRNA fragment, site-binding to a location with
   extraordinarily high electrostatic potential is also coupled to folding.
   Our results suggest that much experimental data measuring the linkage
   between Mg2+ binding and RNA folding must be reinterpreted. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{A helical spring that is constrained to no rotation has a compliance
   that is typically more than 95\% of the compliance of springs
   constrained to free rotation when restricted to symmetric wires made
   from materials with Poisson's ratio between 0 and 1/2. It is shown that
   the shape of the spring wire can be designed so the spring will not
   twist when it is extended nor extend when it is twisted. The constrained
   spring versus a freely rotating spring with the helix angle equal to
   pi/4 has the largest reduction in compliance in the limits of beam
   theory. Spring compliances for torsion and extension with quite complex
   helical spring geometries are found to be related by a dimensionless
   ratio of compliances in a very simple equation that only depends on
   Poisson's ratio and the helical, spring angle, psi. Springs made from
   materials with negative Poisson's ratio, however, can have a very
   substantial reduction in compliance; the no rotation compliance is zero
   when Poisson's ratio is -1. There are large changes in spring
   compliances for springs with geometric coils that are elongated
   rectangles or flattened ellipses.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose
   To show a novel application of a weighted zero-inflated negative
   binomial model in modeling count data with excess zeros and
   heterogeneity to quantify the regional variation in HIV-AIDS prevalence
   in sub-Saharan African countries.
   Methods
   Data come from latest round of the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS)
   conducted in three countries (Ethiopia-2011, Kenya-2009 and Rwanda-2010)
   using a two-stage cluster sampling design. The outcome is an aggregate
   count of HIV cases in each census enumeration area of each country. The
   outcome data are characterized by excess zeros and heterogeneity due to
   clustering. We compare scale weighted zero-inflated negative binomial
   models with and without random effects to account for zero-inflation,
   complex survey design and clustering. Finally, we provide marginalized
   rate ratio estimates from the best zero-inflated negative binomial
   model.
   Results
   The best fitting zero-inflated negative binomial model is scale weighted
   and with a common random intercept for the three countries. Rate ratio
   estimates from the final model show that HIV prevalence is associated
   with age and gender distribution, HIV acceptance, HIV knowledge, and its
   regional variation is associated with divorce rate, burden of sexually
   transmitted diseases and rural residence.
   Conclusions
   Scale weighted zero-inflated negative binomial with proper modeling of
   random effects is shown to be the best model for count data from a
   complex survey design characterized by excess zeros and extra
   heterogeneity. In our data example, the final rate ratio estimates show
   significant regional variation in the factors associated with HIV
   prevalence indicating that HIV intervention strategies should be
   tailored to the unique factors found in each country.}},

Abstract = {{All types of thin-walled tube with different configurations were studied
   to determine their crashworthiness performances. A novel single-cell
   tapered elliptical tube is proposed in this paper. First, the
   crashworthiness performance of the single-cell tapered elliptical tube
   subjected to different oblique impacts was compared with those of other
   tubes with different configurations (straight, tapered, and multi-cell
   tapered) and different cross-sections (square, rectangular, and
   circular). It can be found that the single-cell tapered elliptical tube
   shows a better crashworthiness performance at multiple loading angles by
   comparing the specific energy absorption values and minimizing the peak
   crushing force. Second, to simplify the optimization process, the radial
   basis function model combined with the design-of-experiments method was
   utilized. Third, to determine the ideal radial rate f, the taper angle
   and the thickness t of the wall of the single-cell tapered elliptical
   tube, this paper adopted the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II
   to maximize the specific energy absorption and to minimize the peak
   crushing force. When determining the effect of the uncertainty in the
   loading angle, two different weighting-factor cases (case 1 and case 2)
   can be considered. In both cases, the optimized single-cell tapered
   elliptical tube has a better crashworthiness performance than tubes with
   other different cross-sections do. The design has a great influence on
   the optimization results. In comparison with the original single-cell
   tapered elliptical tube, in case 1, the composite specific energy
   absorption index under multiple oblique loading of the optimal tube
   increases by 12.81\% and the peak crushing force at 0 degrees decreases
   by 16.66\% and, in case 2, the specific energy absorption index under
   multiple oblique loading increases by 11.8\% and the peak crushing force
   at 0 degrees decreases by 12.83\%.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To evaluate a low-cost multimodal intervention on the
   acquisition of carbapenem-non-susceptible Acinetobacter baumannii,
   Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa by patients in
   low-resource intensive care units. Materials and methods: We performed a
   quasi-experimental study in a referral hospital in Jakarta, Indonesia:
   pre intervention phase 1 (2013-2014), intervention phase 2 (2014-2015)
   and post-intervention phase 3 (2015-2016). The intervention was hand
   hygiene promotion and environmental cleaning and disinfection combined
   with patient disinfection and cohorting. The primary outcome was
   acquisition of resistant bacteria per 100 patient-days at risk, which
   was assessed by active microbiological surveillance and analysed with a
   multilevel Poisson segmented regression model. Results: In phase 1 (387
   patients), the acquisition rate was 4.3/100 days for
   carbapenem-non-susceptible A. baumannii versus 1.1/100 days for both K.
   pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa. There was a significant step change from
   phase 1 to phase 3 (361 patients) in the acquisition of
   carbapenem-non-susceptible strains, the incidence rate ratio (IRR) was
   0.343 (99\%CI: 0.164-0.717). This significant change was mainly due to
   reduced acquisitions of resistant A. baumannii (IRR 0.4, 99\%CI:
   0.181-1.061). Negative confounding was observed. Conclusion: A
   multimodal intervention to prevent acquisition of resistant pathogens is
   feasible and may be effective in ICUs in lower-middle income countries.

Abstract = {{In this paper we give an asymptotic theory for the eigenvalues of the

   constitutes a linear process across time and between components. The

   infinite fourth moment. We derive the limiting behavior for the largest
   eigenvalues of the sample covariance matrix and show point process
   convergence of the normalized eigenvalues. The limiting process has an
   explicit form involving points of a Poisson process and eigenvalues of a
   non-negative definite matrix. Based on this convergence we derive limit
   theory for a host of other continuous functionals of the eigenvalues,
   including the joint convergence of the largest eigenvalues, the joint
   convergence of the largest eigenvalue and the trace of the sample
   covariance matrix, and the ratio of the largest eigenvalue to their sum.

Abstract = {{As a kind of protective equipment, obstruction block is playing an
   important role in traffic accidents. In this work, a novel re-entrant
   honeycomb obstruction block (RHOB) with negative Poisson's ratio was
   proposed. The energy-absorbing performances under static compression
   were examined and the influences of re-entrant angle a, material
   thickness t and aspect ratio y on deformation behaviours of RHOB were
   investigated with finite element method (FEM). It is demonstrated that
   RHOB has distinguished bearing capacities and energy absorbing
   properties compared to traditional honeycomb obstruction block (THOB).
   Besides, with the reduction of re-entrant angle a, the negative
   Poisson's ratio of RHOB is decreased. Also, RHOB has notable
   bi-directional stabilities with a proper range of aspect ratio y. And
   the increasing material thickness t enhances stiffness of RHOB. These
   findings highlight that a well-constructed re-entrant honeycomb
   obstruction block has extraordinary mechanical properties and can be
   widely applied in practical engineering.}},

Abstract = {{Spatial autocorrelation is problematic for classical hierarchical
   cluster detection tests commonly used in multidrug resistant
   tuberculosis (MDR-TB) analyses as considerable random error can occur.
   Therefore, when MDR-TB clusters are spatially autocorrelated the
   assumption that the clusters are independently random is invalid. In
   this research, a product moment correlation coefficient (i.e. the
   Moran's coefficient) was used to quantify local spatial variation in
   multiple clinical and environmental predictor variables sampled in San
   Juan de Lurigancho, Lima, Peru. Initially, QuickBird (spatial resolution
   = 0.61 m) data, encompassing visible bands and the near infra-red bands,
   were selected to synthesize images of land cover attributes of the study
   site. Data of residential addresses of individual patients with
   smear-positive MDR-TB were geocoded, prevalence rates calculated and
   then digitally overlaid onto the satellite data within a 2 km buffer of
   31 georeferenced health centres, using a 10 m(2) grid-based algorithm.
   Geographical information system (GIS)gridded measurements of each health
   centre were generated based on preliminary base maps of the
   georeferenced data aggregated to block groups and census tracts within
   each buffered area. A three-dimensional model of the study site was
   constructed based on a digital elevation model (DEM) to determine
   terrain covariates associated with the sampled MDR-TB covariates.
   Pearson's correlation was used to evaluate the linear relationship
   between the DEM and the sampled MDR-TB data. A SAS/GIS(R) module was
   then used to calculate univariate statistics and to perform linear and
   non-linear regression analyses using the sampled predictor variables.
   The estimates generated from a global autocorrelation analyses were then
   spatially decomposed into empirical orthogonal bases, using a negative
   binomial regression with a non-homogeneous mean. Results of the DEM
   analyses indicated a statistically non-significant, linear relationship
   between georeferenced health centres and the sampled covariate
   elevation. The data exhibited positive spatial autocorrelation and the
   decomposition of Moran's coefficient into uncorrelated, orthogonal map
   pattern components which revealed global spatial heterogeneities
   necessary to capture latent autocorrelation in the MDR-TB model. It was
   thus shown that Poisson regression analyses and spatial eigenvector
   mapping can elucidate the mechanics of MDR-TB transmission by
   prioritizing clinical and environmental-sampled predictor variables for
   identifying high risk populations.}},

Abstract = {{This study aims to evaluate the impact of pavement physical
   characteristics on the frequency of single-vehicle run-off-road (ROR)
   crashes in two-lane separated rural highways. In order to achieve this
   goal and to introduce the most accurate crash prediction model (CPM),
   authors have tried to develop generalized linear models, including the
   Poisson regression (PR), negative binomial regression (NBR)), and
   non-linear negative binomial regression models. Besides exposure
   parameters, the examined pavement physical characteristics explanatory
   variables contain pavement condition index (PCI), international
   roughness index (IRI) and ride number (RN). The forward procedure was
   conducted by which the variables were added to the core model one by
   one. In the non-linear procedure and at each step, 39 functional forms
   were checked to see whether the new model gives better fitness than the
   core/previous model. Several measurements were taken to assess the
   fitness of the model. In addition, other measurements were employed to
   estimate an external model validation and an error structure. Results
   showed that in PR and NBR models, variables coefficients were not
   significant. Findings of the suggested nonlinear model confirmed that
   PCI, as an objective variable, follows the experts anticipation (i.e.,
   better pavement manner associates with less ROR crashes). Finally, it
   should be noted that the roughness variable was insignificant at the
   assumed significance level, so it had no contribution to ROR crashes.
   The results imply that improving the pavement condition leads to a more
   probable decrease in the ROR crashes frequency.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of this paper is to investigate the relation between
   object-oriented design choices and defects in software systems, with
   focus on a real-time telecommunication domain. The design choices are
   measured using the widely accepted metrics suite proposed by Chidamber

   Kemerer, A metrics suite for object oriented design, IEEE Transactions
   on Software Engineering 20 (6) (1994) 476-493].
   This paper reports the results of an extensive case study, which
   strongly reinforces earlier, mainly anecdotal, evidence that design
   aspects related to communication between classes can be used as
   indicators of the most defect-prone classes.
   Statistical models applicable for the non-normally distributed count
   data are used, such as Poisson regression, negative binomial regression,
   and zero-inflated negative binomial regression. The performances of the
   models are assessed using correlations, dispersion coefficients and
   Alberg diagrams.
   The zero-inflated negative binomial regression model based on response
   for a class shows the best overall ability to describe the variability
   of the number of defects in classes. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{In this article, the inverted honeycomb cell, known to exhibit an
   auxetic behavior, is considered to design two pneumatic linear
   actuators. The actuators are built using a combination of soft and rigid
   structures. They present complementary performances in terms of
   displacement, force, and stiffness. Experimental evaluations are
   conducted using prototypes produced using multimaterial additive
   manufacturing to combine soft and rigid materials with freedom of shape.
   The first actuator is inspired by origami structures. The possibility to
   obtain large deformations under low pressure is observed. The second
   actuator is based on a cylindrical auxetic structure based on the
   inverted honeycomb cell. Smaller deformation is reached but the design
   favors the off-axis stiffness, so the component can be integrated
   without any additional mechanical joint for translation. A discussion on
   the relative performances of these two actuators and their possible uses
   conclude the paper.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{420}},
Pages = {{59-71}},
Month = {{FEB 14}},
Abstract = {{As a generalization of the commonly assumed Poisson distribution (PD)
   used to estimate the annual number of peaks over threshold in partial
   duration series (PDS) model, the negative binomial (NB) distribution is
   proposed in this study. Instead of generalized pareto distribution (GPD)
   and exponential distribution (ED) models popularly applied to predict
   the probability of the exceedances of peak over threshold, the
   performance of the general logistic distribution (GLD) models is
   analyzed. Two different models for analyzing extreme hydrologic events
   are compared, based on, PDS and annual maximum series (AMS),
   respectively. The performance of the two models in terms of uncertainty
   of T-year event estimator {[}q(T)] is evaluated in the cases of
   estimation with the method of moments (MOMs), maximum likelihood (ML),
   and probability weighted moments (PWMs). The annual maximum distribution
   corresponding to a PDS model with Poisson distributed count of peaks
   above threshold and GLD for flood exceedances was found to be an extreme
   value type I (EV1) distribution. The comparison between PDS and AMS is
   made using ratio of variance of the T-year event estimates, which is
   derived analytically after checking the reliability of the expressions
   with Monte Carlo simulations. The results reveal that the AMS/NB-GLD and
   PDS/GLD models using PWM estimation method give least variance of flood
   estimates with the PDS model giving marginally better results. From the
   overall results, it was observed that the Poisson distribution performs
   better, where the difference between mean (mu) and variance of counts of
   threshold exceedances is small otherwise the NB distribution is found to
   be efficient when used in combination with generalized logistic
   distribution in the PDS model, and this is more prominent for it mu <
   1.4. Hence, in such cases when the PDS data have a mean less than this,
   the AMS/NB-GLD and PDS/GLD should be a better model for q(T) estimation
   as compared to PDS/ED. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, a hyperelastic formulation for light and compliant
   foams which accounts for nonlinear effects at material and kinematic
   levels is introduced. This theory is applicable to a large number of 2-
   and 3-D irregular open-cell structures. An expression for the
   strain-energy function is proposed which includes bending and stretching
   contributions. Although this description allows for irregularity in the
   structure at local or cell level, it also assumes that the macro
   structure is homogeneous, i.e. built by repetition of the same irregular
   unit cell. This micromechanical formulation has explicit correlation
   with the foam structure, and therefore it preserves in the constitutive
   relation the symmetries or directional properties of the corresponding
   structures, including the cases of re-entrant foams which exhibit
   negative Poisson's ratio effects. Due to the introduction of nonlinear
   kinematics, the evolution of the structure during the loading process
   and its effects on the constitutive behavior can be traced, including
   the cases where configurational transformations are present leading to
   non-convex strain-energy functions. Several examples of the
   stress-strain behavior for arbitrary large homogeneous deformations in a
   diamond-like structure are presented. The effect of the structure
   reorientation on the transition of local deformation mechanisms is
   clearly shown. The development of texture and anisotropy induced by the
   deformation process is also demonstrated. Finally, the role of the
   deformation mechanisms on the relation between foam stiffness and foam
   density is analyzed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Caching popular contents in advance is an important technique to achieve
   low latency and reduce the backhaul costs in future wireless
   communications. Considering a network with base stations distributed as
   a Poisson point process, optimal content placement caching probabilities
   are obtained to maximize the average success probability (ASP) for a
   known content popularity (CP) profile, which in practice is time-varying
   and unknown in advance. In this paper, we first propose two online
   prediction (OP) methods for forecasting CP viz., popularity prediction
   model (PPM) and Grassmannian prediction model (GPM), where the
   unconstrained coefficients for linear prediction are obtained by solving
   constrained non-negative least squares. To reduce the higher
   computational complexity per online round, two online learning (OL)
   approaches viz., weighted-follow-the-leader and
   weighted-follow-the-regularized-leader are proposed, inspired by the OP
   models. In OP, ASP difference (i.e, the gap between the ASP achieved by
   prediction and that by known content popularity) is bounded, while in
   OL, sub-linear MSE regret and linear ASP regret bounds are obtained.
   With MovieLens dataset, simulations verify that OP methods are better
   for MSE and ASP difference minimization, while the OL approaches perform
   well for the minimization of the MSE and ASP regrets.}},

Abstract = {{The number of patient-years needed to treat (NPYNT), also called the
   event-based number needed to treat, to avoid one additional exacerbation
   has been reported in recently published respiratory trials, but the
   confidence intervals are not routinely reported. The challenge of
   constructing confidence intervals for NPYNT is due to the fact that
   exacerbation data or count data in general are usually analyzed using
   Poisson-based models such as Poisson or negative binomial regression and
   the rate ratio is the natural metric for between-treatment comparison,
   while NPYNT is based on rate difference, which is not usually calculated
   for those models. Therefore, the variance estimates from these analysis
   models are directly related to the rate ratio rather than the rate
   difference. In this paper, we propose several methods to construct
   confidence intervals for the NPYNT, assuming that the event rates are
   estimated using Poisson or negative binomial regression models. The
   coverage property of the confidence intervals constructed with these
   methods is assessed by simulations. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{This paper is devoted to the investigation of the effects of the
   realistic tension-compression asymmetry and anisotropy of phase
   transformations of shape memory alloy wires embedded in composite
   sandwich plates with auxetic cores on the resulting nonlinear
   vibrations. A third-order zigzag description of the displacement field
   that takes into account the thickness variations of the flexible core
   and a novel three-dimensional dynamic elasticity stress and displacement
   correction is proposed and employed. The governing equations are
   extracted based on Hamilton's principle and solved using an iterative
   finite element procedure. A comprehensive phase transformation algorithm
   and a constitutive model that are capable of accurately tracking the
   nested hysteresis loops and sub-loops and reverse loading of the shape
   memory alloy are proposed, considering the tension-compression
   anisotropy. Interactions of the core compliance, auxeticity, and
   especially, the transformations anisotropy on the dynamic responses are
   studied numerically and three-dimensional plots are presented for
   distributions of the martensite volume fraction. Results show that the
   realistic tension-compression anisotropy of the shape memory alloy
   material leads to results that are quite different from those based on
   the assumption of the symmetry of the material properties and
   significantly increases the differences between the damping roles of the
   shape memory alloy wires of the upper and lower layers of the sandwich

Title = {{Seroprevalence and factors associated with herpes simplex virus type 2

Journal = {{BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES}},

Abstract = {{Background: Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) is the leading cause of
   genital ulcer disease in developing countries, including Brazil, and is
   especially prevalent among men who have sex with men (MSM). HSV-2
   infection represents a risk factor for the acquisition and transmission
   of other sexually transmitted diseases. The goal of the present
   cross-sectional study was to estimate HSV-2 seroprevalence and to
   determine the factors associated with HSV-2 seropositivity in
   HIV-negative high-risk MSM from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
   Methods: Stored sera were tested to estimate HSV-2 seroprevalence, while
   socio-demographic and sexual behavior data were used to measure
   associations between risk factors and HSV-2 seropositivity. Using the
   Poisson regression model with robust variance, prevalence ratios (PR)
   were used to estimate de degree of association between risk factors and
   HSV-2 seropositivity in bivariate and multivariate analyses.
   Results: Seroprevalence of HSV-2 was of 45.7\% (184 out of 403). Factors
   independently associated with HSV-2 seroprevalence in the multivariate
   model were: older age (>= 26 years, PR: 1.41 95\% Confidence Interval:
   1.11-1.78), non- white race (PR: 1.32 95\% CI: 1.06-1.64), positive
   serology for syphilis (PR: 1.65 95\% CI: 1.33-2.05), positive serology
   for hepatitis B (PR: 1.25 95\% CI: 0.99-1.57), stable male partner in
   the past 6 months (PR: 1.42 95\% CI: 1.12-1.79), and unprotected anal
   sex with a stable female partner (PR: 1.46 95\% CI: 1.05-2.04) in the 6
   months preceding the cross-sectional assessment.
   Conclusion: The present study made evident a high prevalence of HSV-2
   infection in a sample of HIV-negative high-risk MSM from Rio de Janeiro.
   This finding indicates the need and urgency for implementing integrated
   programs for the prevention of HSV-2 and other sexually transmitted
   diseases, and, in particular, programs targeting high-risk MSM.}},

Abstract = {{The paper deals with a 2D metamaterial constructed from chiral elements
   comprising rings and ligaments (ribs). The behavior of the metamaterial
   during tension was studied by numerical modeling. The shear deformation
   appears within the tetrachiral honeycomb under uniaxial loading. It is
   found that coupling exists between the elongation and inclination of the
   sample with tetrachiral honeycomb structure and this causes some
   ambiguity when calculating the effective Poisson's ratio. The coupling
   effect depends on both the honeycomb's deformation and the geometric
   parameters of the cell structure. This special coupling effect of
   tetrachiral honeycombs provides a new idea for designing new
   metamaterials. An analytical expression for this effective Poisson's
   ratio is derived. In the process of uniaxial loading, the reason for the
   elongation of the specimen was found.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study an instance of the G-closure problem for
   two-dimensional periodic metamaterials. Specifically, we consider
   composites with isotropic homogenized elasticity tensor, obtained as a
   mixture of two isotropic materials. We focus on the case when one
   material has zero stiffness, i.e., single-material structures with
   voids. This problem is important, in particular, in the context of
   designing small-scale structures for metamaterials that can be
   manufactured using additive fabrication. A range of effective
   metamaterial properties can be obtained this way using a single base
   material.
   We demonstrate that two closely related simple parametric families based
   on the structure proposed by Sigmund in {[}26] attain good coverage of
   the space of isotropic properties satisfying Hashin-Shtrikman bounds. In
   particular, for positive Poisson's ratio, we demonstrate that
   Hashin-Shtrikman bound can be approximated arbitrarily well, within
   limits imposed by numerical approximation: a strong evidence that these
   bounds are achievable in this case. For negative Poisson's ratios, we
   numerically obtain a bound which we hypothesize to be close to optimal,
   at least for metamaterials with rotational symmetries of a regular

Abstract = {{Count data models are established to overcome the shortcommg of linear
   regression model used for trip generation in conventional four step
   travel demand forecasting. It should be checked if there are
   overdispersion and excess zero responses in count data to forecast the
   generation of trips. The forecasted values should also be non-negative
   ones. The study applies to nonhome based trips at household level to
   perform efficient analysis on count data. The Poisson model with an
   assumption of equidispersion has frequently been used to analyze count
   data. However, if the variance of data is greater than the mean, the
   Poisson model tends to underestimate errors, resulting in problem in
   reliability. Excess zeros in data result in heterogeneity leading to
   biased coefficient estimates for the models. The negative binomial model
   and the modified count data models are established to consider
   overdispersion and heterogeneity to improve the reliability. The optimal
   model is chosen through Vuong test. Model reliability is also checked by
   likelihood test and accuracy of estimated value of model by Theil
   inequality coefficient. Finally, sensitivity analysis is performed to
   know the change of nonhome based trips depending on the change in
   socio-economic characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{Can the popular shortest remaining processing time (SRPT) algorithm
   achieve a constant competitive ratio on multiple servers when server
   speeds are adjustable (speed scaling) with respect to the flow time plus
   energy consumption metric? This question has remained open for a while,
   where a negative result in the absence of speed scaling is well known.
   The main result of this paper is to show that multi-server SRPT with
   speed scaling can be constant competitive, with a competitive ratio that
   only depends on the power-usage function of the servers, but not on the
   number of jobs/servers or the job sizes (unlike when speed scaling is
   not allowed). When all job sizes are unity, we show that round-robin
   routing is optimal and can achieve the same competitive ratio as the
   best known algorithm for the single server problem. Finally, we show
   that a class of greedy dispatch policies, including policies that route
   to the least loaded or the shortest queue, do not admit a constant
   competitive ratio. When job arrivals are stochastic, with Poisson
   arrivals and i.i.d. job sizes, we show that random routing and a simple
   gated-static speed scaling algorithm achieves a constant competitive
   ratio.}},

   Support System}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN CIVIL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{2020}},
Month = {{JUN 29}},
Abstract = {{In order to explore the monitoring and control method of rock slope,
   indoor physical model testing of collapse control and monitoring were
   carried out with the example of a rock slope collapse area project in
   Jietai Temple in Beijing, China, as the prototype. Based on the
   similarity theory, in this study, a new structural support with Negative
   Poisson's Ratio bolt and flexible anchored net was utilized to reinforce
   the rock slope. Following a graded loading sequence, the collapse
   failure characteristics and the overall control effect of energy
   absorption reinforcement measures were explored. The experimental
   results demonstrated that the entire process of slope collapse presented
   four distinct stages of failure: fracture generation, fracture
   propagation, partial collapse, and overall collapse. The full-field
   displacement nephogram and the displacement monitoring point of the
   collapse area indicated that the large deformation and failure of the
   collapsed surrounding rock were effectively controlled, while the
   Negative Poisson's Ratio bolt and the flexible anchored net had good
   reinforcement effects. The experimental stress record presented that the
   change of pressure curve was an apparent regularity in the entire
   process of slope collapse, which reflects the change state of internal
   force of surrounding rock; it includes the function of monitoring of
   slope collapse. It was indicated that the Negative Poisson's Ratio bolt
   along with the large-deformation flexible anchored net had good
   reinforcement monitoring effect on the rock slope collapse disaster.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the diversity of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), polymers, and the
   preparation processes of the composites, CNT-filled polymeric composites
   present various piezoresistive properties. One puzzling issue is the
   concurrence of a negative piezoresistive effect and a positive
   piezoresistive effect in composites with different polymer matrixes. In
   this paper, we present a microscopic view of the nature of the positive
   piezoresistive effect and its dependence on the polymer matrix types
   based on the model in our previous study, in which the piezoresistive
   behavior was tailored by a parameter-the average junction gap variation
   (AJGV)-describing the statistical property of the CNT conductive
   network. The microscopic movement process of CNTs embedded in a polymer
   matrix was analyzed and then the Poisson's ratio of the polymer matrix
   was determined as a key factor that is in charge of negative or positive
   piezoresistive properties. The obstacle effect of polymer chains on the
   movement of CNTs was also found to be responsible for the positive
   piezoresistive effect as it affects the AJGV in compressive strain.
   Based on numerical simulations of CNT network deformation with different
   Poisson's ratios and minimum junction gaps caused by the obstacle
   effect, the positive piezoresistive effect was found resulted from the
   obstacle effect on CNT junction gap variations that exceeds the initial
   value of the AJGV caused by the CNT network deformation, and only occur
   under the precondition of the polymer matrixes with a large Poisson's
   ratio close to 0.5. The conclusions were then verified experimentally
   using composites with two kinds of polymer matrixes with significantly
   different Poisson's ratios.}},

Abstract = {{By applying the kinetic theory of the Valsove-Poisson model and the
   reductive perturbation technique, a Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation is
   derived for small but finite amplitude ion acoustic waves in multi-ion
   plasma composed of positive and negative ions along with the fraction of
   electrons. A correspondent equation is also derived from the basic set
   of fluid equations of adiabatic ions and isothermal electrons. Both
   kinetic and fluid KdV equations are stationary solved with different
   nature of coefficients. Their differences are discussed both
   analytically and numerically. The criteria of the fluid approach as a
   limiting case of kinetic theory are also discussed. The presence of
   negative ion makes some modification in the solitary structure that has
   also been discussed with its implication at the laboratory level.

Abstract = {{In the past decade, mechanical metamaterials have garnered increasing
   attention owing to its novel design principles which combine the concept
   of hierarchical architecture with material size effects at
   micro/nanoscale. This strategy is demonstrated to exhibit superior
   mechanical performance that allows us to colonize unexplored regions in
   the material property space, including ultrahigh strength-to-density
   ratios, extraordinary resilience, and energy absorption capabilities
   with brittle constituents. In the recent years, metamaterials with
   unprecedented mechanical behaviors such as negative Poisson's ratio,
   twisting under uniaxial forces, and negative thermal expansion are also
   realized. This paves a new pathway for a wide variety of multifunctional
   applications, for example, in energy storage, biomedical, acoustics,
   photonics, and thermal management. Herein, the fundamental scientific
   theories behind this class of novel metamaterials, along with their
   fabrication techniques and potential engineering applications beyond
   mechanics are reviewed. Explored examples include the recent progresses
   for both mechanical and functional applications. Finally, the current

Abstract = {{In this paper, a pseudo-rigid body model is proposed for the analysis of
   a spatial mechanical metamaterial and its application is demonstrated.
   Using this model, the post-buckling behavior of the mechanical
   metamaterial can be determined without the need to consider the whole
   elastic structure, e.g., using finite-element procedures. This is done
   by analyzing a porous cylindrical mechanical metamaterial using a rigid
   body mechanism, consisting of rigid squares that are connected at their
   corners. Stiffness in this model comes from torsion springs placed at
   the connections between rigid parts. The theory of the model is
   presented and the results of two versions of this model are compared
   through experiments. One version describes the metamaterial in the free
   state, while the other, more extended, version includes clamped
   boundaries, matching the conditions of the experimental set-up. It is
   shown that the mechanical behavior of the spatial metamaterial is
   captured by the models and that the shape of the metamaterial in the
   deformed state can be obtained from the more extended model.}},

Abstract = {{Quantification of selective pressures on regulatory sequences is a
   central question in studying the evolution of gene regulatory networks.
   Previous methods focus primarily on single sites rather than motif
   sequences. We propose a method of evaluating the strength of natural
   selection of a motif from a family of aligned sequences. The method is
   based on a Poisson process model of neutral sequence substitutions and
   derives a birth-death process of the motif occurrence frequencies. The
   selection coefficient is treated as a penalty for the motif death rate.
   We demonstrate that the birth-death model closely approximates
   statistics generated from simulated data and the Poisson process
   assumption holds in mammalian promoter sequences. Furthermore, we show
   that a considerably higher portion of known transcription factor binding
   motifs possess high selection coefficients compared to negative controls
   with high occurrence frequencies on promoters. Preliminary analysis
   supports the potential applications of the model to identify regulatory
   sequences under selection.}},

Title = {{On the Comparative Suitability of Strain Relaxation and Stress
   Relaxation Compression for Ultrasound Poroelastic Tissue
   Characterization}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{MAY 10}},
Abstract = {{Poroelastic tissue strain imaging measures the time-varying and
   spatially varying deformation of a soft-tissue matrix during compression
   as the tissue fluid flows out of the compartmental boundaries. With the
   help of ultrasound, it has been carried out by observing the evolution
   of the images of the ultrasound echo strain over time, which shows that,
   in a stress-relaxation experiment (constantly applied global axial
   strain), a front of negative dilatation (volumetric strain) propagates
   slowly from the boundaries of a sample toward the center of the
   compressed region. The fitting of equations that predict this behavior
   to experimental data has earlier allowed quantitative imaging of the
   product of aggregate modulus and permeability of a tissue phantom,
   H(A)k, and its Poisson's ratio, nu. An ability to image and measure such
   novel tissue characteristics is likely to benefit biomedical research
   and have a wide range of clinical applications, including the assessment
   of lymphoedema, the diagnosis of cancer, the prediction of anticancer
   drug effectiveness, and monitoring of the tissue response to various
   treatments. This method is problematic, however, for application in vivo
   because the calculation of the volumetric strain requires the lateral
   and elevational strains, which are not easily measured accurately with
   conventional ultrasound strain imaging. This paper investigates for the
   first time whether the ultrasound observation in a strain-relaxation
   experiment (constantly applied uniaxial stress) could be used to observe
   the same mechanical behavior and provide the same information about the
   properties of a poroelastic sample as in a stress-relaxation experiment.
   The analytical theory was used to demonstrate that the propagation of
   dilatation shown in stress relaxation should also be observable in
   strain relaxation and that it should be detectable using axial strain,
   which is relatively easily measured in vivo. Finite element modeling
   (FEM) was employed to simulate all strain components within a
   homogeneous poroelastic material first during strain relaxation and then
   during stress relaxation, again demonstrating their equivalence for the
   observation of the propagation of a dilatation. The validity of using
   the strain relaxation conditions as an alternative to stress relaxation
   for measuring a poroelastic material's response was further confirmed by
   a fitting of the analytical models to the results of FEM. This allowed
   for an inversion of the time-varying volumetric strain, to recover the
   images of H(A)k and nu, for either loading configuration. The
   strain-relaxation configuration offers not only an opportunity to derive
   the same important quantitative poroelastic properties of the tissue as
   stress relaxation but also the potential to avoid the difficulties and
   errors associated with the estimation of strain along the axes
   perpendicular to the imaging axis, thus offering opportunities for
   easier clinical translation.}},

Abstract = {{Herein, the deformation and properties of cellular structures of
   missing-rib (MR) model and mixed structures (MSs) are studied
   experimentally and numerically. Samples with different beam angles and

   tested in uniaxial compression. Parametric finite-element models are
   developed and used to simulate structures of different sample dimensions
   and lattice patterns with a particular focus on beam-wall contacts.
   Structures with different sizes and aspect ratios, beam angles, and
   lattice patterns are comparatively studied. The numerical results show a
   good agreement with the experimental data on samples of various
   sizes/patterns. The main deformation modes and key stages of the corner
   edge-wall contact and structure deformation are presented, and the key
   mechanism is analyzed. Poisson's ratio and stability of the auxeticity
   of different structures are established. The link between the structural
   and auxeticity stabilities and the characteristic of the corner
   edge-wall contact in MR and MSs are discussed. The MSs with alternative

   fold pattern. The structural mechanics of these metamaterials are
   dominated by the kinematics of the folding, which only depends on the

   structure is introduced, where the fold pattern provides a negative
   Poisson's ratio for in-plane deformations and a positive Poisson's ratio
   for out-of-plane bending. Second, a cellular metamaterial is described
   based on a stacking of individual folded layers, where the folding
   kinematics are compatible between layers. Additional freedom in the
   design of the metamaterial can be achieved by varying the fold pattern
   within each layer.}},

Abstract = {{An explicit surface potential and subthreshold current model for novel
   Dual Metal Gate (DMG) Asymmetric Vacuum (AV) as gate dielectric Schottky
   Barrier (SB) Cylindrical Gate All Around (CGAA) MOSFET with the
   incorporation of localized charges (N-f) is developed to provide
   excellent immunity against threshold voltage (V-th) degradation due to
   hot carriers. Hot carrier induced Localized Charges (LC) either positive
   or negative leads to degrade the threshold of the device. The major
   advantage of the proposed DMG-AV-SB-CGAA MOSFET is that it mitigates the
   ambipolar behavior thus offering very good on current to off Current
   ratio; and also reduces the electron temperature which leads to less hot
   carrier generation thus lesser degradation in Vth and improved Hot
   Carrier reliability.
   The surface potential is determined for three different regions by
   solving 1-D Poisson's and 2-D Laplace equation through separation of
   variable method to facilitate an optimal model for calculating the
   subthreshold drain current from Si-SiO2 interface boundary. The
   developed model results are in good agreement with that of ATLAS-TCAD

Title = {{Predicting length of stay from an electronic patient record system: a
   primary total knee replacement example}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL INFORMATICS AND DECISION MAKING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{APR 4}},
Abstract = {{Background: To investigate whether factors can be identified that
   significantly affect hospital length of stay from those available in an
   electronic patient record system, using primary total knee replacements
   as an example. To investigate whether a model can be produced to predict
   the length of stay based on these factors to help resource planning and
   patient expectations on their length of stay.
   Methods: Data were extracted from the electronic patient record system
   for discharges from primary total knee operations from January 2007 to
   December 2011 (n = 2,130) at one UK hospital and analysed for their
   effect on length of stay using Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests for
   discrete data and Spearman's correlation coefficient for continuous
   data. Models for predicting length of stay for primary total knee
   replacements were tested using the Poisson regression and the negative
   binomial modelling techniques.
   Results: Factors found to have a significant effect on length of stay
   were age, gender, consultant, discharge destination, deprivation and
   ethnicity. Applying a negative binomial model to these variables was
   successful. The model predicted the length of stay of those patients who
   stayed 4-6 days (similar to 50\% of admissions) with 75\% accuracy
   within 2 days (model data). Overall, the model predicted the total days
   stayed over 5 years to be only 88 days more than actual, a 6.9\% uplift
   (test data).
   Conclusions: Valuable information can be found about length of stay from
   the analysis of variables easily extracted from an electronic patient
   record system. Models can be successfully created to help improve
   resource planning and from which a simple decision support system can be
   produced to help patient expectation on their length of stay.}},

Abstract = {{In statistical analyses, metabolic syndrome as a dependent variable is
   often utilized in a binary form (presence/absence) where the logistic
   regression model is used to estimate the odds ratio as the measure of
   association between health-related factors and metabolic syndrome. Since
   metabolic syndrome is a common outcome the interpretation of odds ratio
   as an approximation to prevalence or risk ratio is questionable as it
   may overestimate its intended target. In addition, dichotomizing a
   variable that could potentially be treated as discrete may lead to
   reduced statistical power. In this paper, the authors treat metabolic
   syndrome as a discrete outcome by defining it as the count of syndrome
   components. The goal of this study is to evaluate the usefulness of
   alternative generalized linear models for analysis of metabolic syndrome
   as a count outcome and compare the results with models that utilize the
   binary form. Empirical data were used to examine the association between
   depression and metabolic syndrome. Measures of association were
   calculated using two approaches; models that treat metabolic syndrome as
   a binary outcome (the logistic, log-binomial, Poisson, and the modified
   Poisson regression) and models that utilize metabolic syndrome as
   discrete/count data (the Poisson and the negative binomial regression).
   The method that treats metabolic syndrome as a count outcome
   (Poisson/negative binomial regression model) appears more sensitive in
   that it is better able to detect associations and hence can serve as an
   alternative to analyze metabolic syndrome as count dependent variable
   and provide an interpretable measure of association.}},

   the constraint of piecewise isometric deformations. Here we characterize
   the geometry and planar and nonplanar effective elastic response of a
   simple periodically folded Miura-ori structure, which is composed of
   identical unit cells of mountain and valley folds with four-coordinated
   ridges, defined completely by two angles and two lengths. We show that
   the in-plane and out-of-plane Poisson's ratios are equal in magnitude,
   but opposite in sign, independent of material properties. Furthermore,
   we show that effective bending stiffness of the unit cell is singular,
   allowing us to characterize the two-dimensional deformation of a plate
   in terms of a one-dimensional theory. Finally, we solve the inverse
   design problem of determining the geometric parameters for the optimal
   geometric and mechanical response of these extreme structures.}},

Abstract = {{We consider zero-inflated Poisson and zero-inflated negative binomial
   regression models to analyze discrete count data containing a
   considerable amount of zero observations. Analysis of current data could
   be empirically feasible if we utilize similar data based on previous
   studies. Ibrahim and Chen (2000) proposed the power prior to incorporate
   certain information from the historical data available from previous
   studies. The power prior is constructed by raising the likelihood
   function of the historical data to the power a(0). where 0 <= a(0) <= 1.
   The power prior is a useful informative prior in Bayesian inference. We
   estimate regression coefficients associated with several safety
   countermeasures. We use Markov chain and Monte Carlo techniques to
   execute some computations. The empirical results show that the
   zero-inflated models with the power prior perform better than the
   frequentist approach. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{BackgroundMalaria infection during pregnancy has negative health
   consequences for both mothers and offspring. Sub-microscopic malaria
   infection during pregnancy is common in most African countries. We
   sought to identify factors associated with sub-microscopic placental
   malaria, and its association with adverse pregnancy outcomes among
   HIV-negative pregnant women in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.MethodsWe
   recruited a cohort of pregnant women during their first trimester and
   assessed for the occurrence of placental malaria and pregnancy outcomes.
   The follow-up was done monthly from recruitment until delivery.
   Histopathology placental malaria positive results were defined as the
   presence of malaria pigment or parasitized erythrocytes on the slide
   (histology-positive (HP)), and the sub-microscopic placental infection
   was defined as positive Plasmodium falciparum DNA by polymerase chain
   reaction (DNA PCR) amplification in a negative histopathology test.
   Adverse pregnancy outcomes investigated included low birth weight (birth
   weight below 2.5kg), prematurity (live birth below 37weeks), and
   small-for-gestational-age (SGA) (live born with a birth weight below
   10th percentile for gestational age and sex). Weighted baseline category
   logit, log-binomial, and log-Poisson models were used to assess factors
   associated with placental malaria, and its association with adverse
   pregnancy outcomes.ResultsAmong 1115 women who had histopathology and
   DNA PCR performed, 93 (8\%) had HP placental infection, and 136 (12\%)
   had the sub-microscopic placental infection. The risk of sub-microscopic
   placental malaria was greater in women who did not use mosquito
   prevention methods such as bed nets, fumigation, or mosquito coils (odds
   ratio (OR)=1.75; 95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.05-2.92; P=0.03) and
   in women who were anemic (OR=1.59; 95\% CI: 1.20-2.11; P=0.001). Women
   who were underweight had reduced odds of sub-microscopic placental
   malaria infection (OR=0.33; 95\% CI: 0.17-0.62; P=0.001). Women who were
   overweight/obese had 1.48 times higher the odds of HP placental malaria
   compared to normal weight (OR=1.48; 95\% CI: 1.03-2.11; P=0.03). HP
   placental malaria infection was associated with an increased risk of SGA
   births (RR=1.30, 95\% CI: 0.98-1.72, P=0.07). In contrast, the
   sub-microscopic infection was associated with a reduced risk of SGA
   births (RR=0.61, 95\% CI: 0.43-0.88, P=0.01). Placental malaria was not
   associated with low birth weight or prematurity.ConclusionMalaria
   prevention methods and maternal nutrition status during early pregnancy
   were important predictors of sub-microscopic placental malaria. More
   research is needed to understand sub-microscopic placental malaria and
   the possible mechanisms mediating the association between placental
   malaria and SGA.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental sampling has been identified as an effective procedure to
   verify correct implementation of food safety control systems in catering
   establishments. At the same time characterization of microbial
   distribution of environmental contamination could potentially address
   effective fit-for-purpose sampling procedures. In this study 1202
   environmental samples from three types of food catering establishments
   located in Madrid, Spain were monitored for presence of mesophilic
   bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia
   coli. Samples corresponded to food-contact utensils, handlers' contact
   utensils and food handlers, using 3MTm PetrifilmTM count plates.
   Contamination routes were identified through the calculation of Spearman
   correlation coefficients. Further, characterization of statistical
   distributions of microbial contamination and suggestion of sampling
   procedures were also performed. Results showed that 53.0\% of the
   samples were positive for at least one of the bacterial group studied
   and 328 among those (27.1\%) with counts between 1 and 15 CHI/plate.
   Enterobacteriaceae were present in 62.1\% of food handlers' samples as
   well as E. coli and S. aureus (7.5\% and 26.6\%, respectively).
   Contamination routes from food handlers to handlers'-utensils was
   identified in a bidirectional way, being it subsequently spread to
   utensils in contact with foods. Finally, it was shown that the selection
   of the microbial distribution significantly affected significantly the
   number of samples needed to detect positives above a certain microbial
   level. As expected, when negative results are present (high zero counts
   or left censored data), Poisson-log normal distributions can describe
   properly the distribution of microbial contamination. However, log
   normal distributions presented better fit for samples with higher
   microbial counts and right-censored data (mesophilic bacteria) so that
   they can be used to describe contamination at high levels. The data and
   results generated in this study could be of high relevance to food
   safety authorities to appropriately address environmental sampling
   procedures in catering establishments. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{We analyze the folding kinematics of a recently proposed origami-based
   tessellated structure called the Morph pattern, using thin, rigid panel
   assumptions. We discuss the geometry of the Morph unit cell that can
   exist in two characteristic modes differing in the mountain/valley
   assignment of a degree-four vertex and explain how a single tessellation
   of the Morph structure can undergo morphing through rigid origami
   kinematics resulting in multiple hybrid states. We describe the
   kinematics of the tessellated Morph pattern through multiple branches,
   each path leading to different sets of hybrid states. We study the
   kinematics of the tessellated structure through local and global
   Poisson's ratios and derive an analytical condition for which the global
   ratio switches between negative and positive values. We show that the
   interplay between the local and global kinematics results in folding
   deformations in which the hybrid states are either locked in their
   current modes or are transformable to other modes of the kinematic
   branches, leading to a reprogrammable morphing behavior of the system.
   Finally, using a bar-and-hinge model-based numerical framework, we
   simulate the nonlinear folding behavior of the hybrid systems and verify
   the deformation characteristics that are predicted analytically.}},

   Many probabilistic models have been used, including Poisson, negative

   identifying the most appropriate discrete probabilistic models for
   zero-inflated or Hurdle models based on the p-value of the discrete

   Neyman-Pearson lemma for choosing the best model when appropriate ones
   are more than one.}},

Abstract = {{Anal condylomata are common in HIV-positive individuals and among men
   who have sex with men (MSM). Generally attributable to infection by
   low-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs), condylomata are considered
   benign low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (SILs). However, anal
   condylomata have occasionally been linked to high-grade SIL and to
   oncogenic, high-risk HPVs. Here we describe the range of intraepithelial
   lesions and of the associated HPVs in heterosexual men and women and
   MSM. Perianal and anal condylomata were collected from 243 patients (56
   heterosexual women, 61 heterosexual men and 126 MSM, including 41
   HIV-positive MSM). We assessed lesion histology and HPV genotype.
   Prevalence estimates and Poisson models were used. Irrespective of HIV
   infection status, MSM showed a higher proportion of condylomata as
   high-grade SILs compared to heterosexual men/women. High-grade SILs were
   also more prevalent in anal than in perianal lesions in all patient
   groups. HIV-positive MSM exhibited increased prevalence ratio (4.6; 95\%
   confidence interval 2.1-10.0) of perianal low-grade SILs containing only
   high-risk HPVs compared to HIV-negative MSM. In addition, more than 64\%
   of anal SILs with a high-grade component, regardless of HIV infection,
   were exclusively associated with low-risk HPVs. In anal condylomata,
   both high-grade and low-grade SILs can be associated with high-risk
   and/or low-risk HPVs. Particularly, low-grade perianal SILs associated
   with high-risk HPVs were common in HIV-positive MSM, while presence of
   only low-risk HPVs in high-grade SILs were common in both MSM groups.
   Our findings sound a note of caution for the common clinical practice
   for the treatment of anal condylomata as benign lesions in MSM and
   HIV-positive patients.

Abstract = {{The peridynamic theory has been used to model and simulate numerically
   various kinds of mechanical behavior of solids. This work is devoted to
   analytical solutions of the elastodynamic behavior of linearized
   isotropic state-based peridynamic materials. First, we present the
   solutions of the dispersion relations, group velocities, and phase
   velocities of longitudinal and transverse waves, and examine in detail
   the effects of the Poisson's ratio on these properties. It is shown that
   the elastodynamic behavior of the state-based peridynamic material with
   a negative Poisson's ratio is remarkably different from that of the
   material with a positive Poisson's ratio. We then derive the general
   solutions of initial-value problems, and obtain the Green's function in
   a closed form. Finally, we study the evolution of a displacement
   discontinuity in the state-based peridynamic medium, and find that each
   component of the discontinuity in the three-dimensional theory varies
   independently according to the same vibrational mode. The results may
   have implications in investigations of wave propagations, including
   discontinuities such as phase transitions and kink propagations.}},

   design of 3D printed mechanical metamaterials}},
Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{115}},

Month = {{JUL 8}},
Abstract = {{The emergence of advanced 3D printing techniques and the recent interest
   in architected materials have sparked a surge of interest in mechanical
   metamaterials whose unusual properties are defined by their highly
   ordered microarchitectures. Mechanical metamaterials with disordered
   microarchitectures have, however, not received as much attention despite
   their inherent advantages, such as robustness against the precise
   arrangement and design parameters of individual unit cells. Here, we
   computationally studied the elastic properties of two general types of
   disordered networks, namely, lattice-restricted and unrestricted
   networks that were made of beamlike elements and possessed mean
   connectivity values, Z, ranging between 2.5 and 7. We also additively
   manufactured a number of representative networks using selective laser
   sintering and showed that their deformations are consistent with our
   computational predictions. Unrestricted networks exhibited several
   advantages over the lattice-restricted ones including a broader range of
   achievable elastic modulus-Poisson's ratio duos as well as a higher
   probability of exhibiting auxetic and double-auxetic (i.e., auxetic
   behavior in both orthogonal directions) behaviors. Most interestingly,
   we could find unrestricted auxetic networks for high connectivity levels
   of up to 4.5, while no lattice-restricted auxetic networks were found
   for any connectivity level beyond 3.5. Given the fact that, according to
   Maxwell's criterion, 3.5 is the highest Z for which both of our
   lattice-restricted and unrestricted networks are bending-dominated, we
   concluded that unrestricted networks exhibit auxetic behavior well into
   their stretch-dominated domain. This is a promising observation that
   underlines the potential of unrestricted networks for the challenging
   task of designing stiff auxetic metamaterials in the stretch-dominated
   domain (i.e., Z = 4-4.5). Published under license by AIP Publishing.}},

Abstract = {{We use first-principles calculations to investigate the lattice
   properties of group-IV monochalcogenides. These include static
   dielectric permittivity, elastic and piezoelectric tensors. For the
   monolayer, it is found that the static permittivity, besides acquiring a
   dependence on the interlayer distance, is comparatively higher than in
   the 3D system. In contrast, it is found that elastic properties are
   little changed by the lower dimensionality. Poisson ratios relating
   in-plane deformations are close to zero, and the existence of a negative
   Poisson ratio is also predicted for the GeS compound. Finally, the
   monolayer shows piezoelectricity, with piezoelectric constants higher
   than those recently predicted to occur in other 2D systems, such as
   hexagonal BN and transition-metal dichalcogenide monolayers.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of comparing some known distributions in various types of

   comparison of Poisson, binomial, and negative binomial distributions
   with their respective mixtures. Incidentally, these distributions are
   among the four well-known distributions of the family of generalized
   power series distributions (GPSD's). The remaining distribution is the
   logarithmic series distribution. In this paper, we shall be concerned
   with comparing this remaining distribution of the class GPSD with its
   mixture in terms of various types of stochastic orderings such as the
   simple stochastic, likelihood ratio, uniformly more variable, convex,
   hazard rate and expectation orderings. Derivation of the results in this
   case prove to be computationally trickier than the other three. The
   special case when the means of the two distributions are the same is
   also discussed. Finally, an illustrative explicit example is provided.}},

Abstract = {{The maximum tangential strain energy density (MTSED) criterion was
   modified by taking the influences of stress intensity factors and
   T-stress into consideration for combined mode I-III brittle fracture.
   Furthermore, the Poisson's ratio and T-stress influencing the fracture
   characteristics of cracked components were discussed by using the
   extended MTSED criterion. Moreover, the predicted values of this
   extended MTSED criterion and some testing results were comparatively
   analysed. The results indicate that the Poisson's ratio and T-stress
   have no impact on the out-of-plane initiation angle; however, their
   effects on fracture resistance ratios are significant especially for
   pure mode III. A positive T-stress increases the fracture resistance
   ratio, and it is opposite for a negative T-stress. The predicted values
   calculated by the extended MTSED criterion agree very well with the
   testing data obtained with edge-notched disc bend samples especially for
   pure mode III case.}},

Abstract = {{Addition of selected transition-metal elements into aluminum matrix is
   known to yield systems that exhibit unique structural arrangements and
   mechanical properties, especially high yield strength obtained after
   suitable heat treatment. These lightweight systems are known to be
   compactable from ribbon shape prepared by rapid quenching of the melt
   into bulk form, yielding physically and technically attractive
   materials. The combination of knowledge about formation of
   aluminum-based foams with the physics of rapid quenching and compaction
   is shown as a possible route for approaching the preparation of
   lightweight materials with potentially auxetic behavior. Enhancement of
   this property is discussed briefly in terms of tailoring the network or
   cell-pore structure of different dimensions, ranging from millimeters
   down to nanoscale and sub-nanoscale atomic ordering. (c) 2005 WILEY-VCH

Abstract = {{A numerical methodology developed for the microarchitecture design of 3D
   elastic two-phase periodic composites with effective isotropic
   properties close to the theoretical bounds is here presented and
   analyzed. This methodology is formulated as a topology optimization
   problem and is implemented using a level-set approach jointly with
   topological derivative.
   The most salient characteristic of this methodology is the imposition of
   preestablished crystal symmetries to the designed topologies; we
   integrate a topological optimization formulation with crystal symmetries
   to design mechanical metamaterials.
   The computational homogenization of the composite elastic properties is
   determined using a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) technique. Due to the
   design domains are the primitive cells of Bravais lattices compatible
   with the space group imposed to the material layout, we have adapted the
   FFT technique to compute the effective properties in 3D parallelepiped
   domains.
   In this work, to find the topologies satisfying the proposed targets, we
   test four space groups of the cubic crystal system. Thus, the
   achievement of composites with effective elasticity tensor having cubic
   symmetry is guaranteed, and the isotropic response is then enforced by
   adding only one scalar constraint to the topology optimization problem.
   To assess the methodology, the following microarchitectures are designed
   and reported: two auxetic composites, three pentamode materials, and one
   maximum stiffness composite. With only one exception, all the remaining
   topologies display effective elastic properties with Zener coefficients
   approximating to 1. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives The objective of this study was to compare the prevalence of
   polydrug use, use of drugs associated with chemsex, specific drug use,
   and HIV-related behaviours, between two time periods, using two groups
   of HIV-negative men who have sex with men (MSM) attending the same
   sexual health clinics in London and Brighton, in two consecutive periods
   of time from 2013 to 2016.
   Methods Data from MSM in the cross-sectional Attitudes to and
   Understanding Risk of Acquisition of HIV (AURAH) study (June 2013 to
   September 2014) were compared with baseline data from different MSM in
   the prospective cohort study Attitudes to and Understanding Risk of
   Acquisition of HIV over Time (AURAH2) (November 2014 to April 2016).
   Prevalence of polydrug use, drug use associated with chemsex and
   specific drug use, and 10 measures of HIV-related behaviours including
   condomless sex, post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) use, pre-exposure
   prophylaxis (PrEP) use, and HIV testing, were compared. Prevalence
   ratios (PRs) for the association of the study (time period) with drug
   use and HIV-related behaviour measures were estimated using modified
   Poisson regression analysis, unadjusted and adjusted for
   sociodemographic factors.
   Results In total, 991 MSM were included from AURAH and 1031 MSM from
   AURAH2. After adjustment for sociodemographic factors, use of drugs
   associated with chemsex had increased (adjusted PR (aPR) 1.30, 95\% CI
   1.11 to 1.53) and there were prominent increases in specific drug use;
   in particular, mephedrone (aPR 1.32, 95\% CI 1.10 to
   1.57),gamma-hydroxybutyric/gamma-butryolactone (aPR 1.47, 95\% CI 1.15
   to 1.87) and methamphetamine (aPR 1.42, 95\% CI 1.01 to 2.01). Use of
   ketamine had decreased (aPR 0.54, 95\% CI 0.38 to 0.78). Certain
   measures of HIV-related behaviours had also increased, most notably PEP
   use (aPR 1.50, 95\% CI 1.21 to 1.88) and number of self-reported
   bacterial STI diagnoses (aPR 1.24, 95\% CI 1.08 to 1.43).
   Conclusions There have been significant increases in drug use associated
   with chemsex and some measures of HIV-related behaviours among
   HIV-negative MSM in the last few years. Changing patterns of drug use
   and associated behaviours should be monitored to enable sexual health
   services to plan for the increasingly complex needs of some clients.}},

   ratio at high densities with respect to the static (zero temperature)
   case and (h) the ratio can be also decreased at fixed temperatures and

Abstract = {{Molecular Dynamics simulations are used to investigate the structure and
   dynamics of an aqueous electrolyte (NaCl) confined within a
   nanomembrane, which consists of a nanopore with a diameter 3 nm having a
   negatively charged surface. Both nanomembranes with a diffuse charge and
   with local charges are considered (in both cases, two surface charge
   densities are considered, -0.9 e/nm(2) and -1.8 e/nm(2)). For all
   nanomembranes, significant layering of water and ions in the vicinity of
   the nanomembrane surface is observed. While the distribution of water
   and chloride ions is nearly insensitive to the nanomembrane charge and
   type, the arrangement of sodium cations within the nanomembrane depends
   on the system being considered. The water and ion density profiles in
   the nanomembranes are compared with the predictions of a modified
   Poisson-Boltzmann equation in which charge image, solvation effects, and
   dispersion interactions with the surface are taken into account {[}Huang
   et al. Langmuir, 2008, 24, 1442]. The self-diffusion coefficient for a
   given species is smaller than its bulk counterpart and is at most 75\%
   of the bulk value. While the self-diffusion coefficients for water and
   sodium cations decrease with decreasing the overall negative charge of
   the nanomembrane, the self-diffusion coefficient for the chloride anions
   is nearly independent of the nanomembrane type and charge. We also
   estimate the dynamics of the confined aqueous electrolyte by calculating
   time correlation functions which allow estimating solvation, ion
   pairing, and residence times.}},

Abstract = {{PurposeOnly a few studies have investigated the impact of negative
   aspects of social relations on cognitive function, and they have shown
   mixed results. Conflicts at work are part of the negative aspects of
   social relations, but the impact of experiencing conflicts at work has
   not yet been investigated as a risk factor for dementia. Therefore, we
   investigated whether experiencing prolonged or serious conflicts with a
   supervisor or colleagues at work was associated with incident dementia
   in old age.MethodsWe analyzed data of 6,436 men and women from the third
   survey of the Copenhagen City Heart Study. At baseline in 1991-1994, the
   participants reported whether they had ever had a prolonged or serious
   conflict at work. The participants were followed until 2014. We used
   Poisson regression to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRR) and their
   95\% confidence intervals (CI).ResultsAfter adjusting for potential
   confounders, the IRR for dementia was 1.53 (95\% CI 0.77-3.03) among
   participants who had reported having prolonged or serious conflicts both
   with a supervisor and colleagues compared with participants who had
   never had such conflicts. In separate analyses stratified by sex, the
   IRRs were 2.14 (95\% Cl 0.97-4.71) for men and 0.98 (95\% Cl 0.29-3.32)
   for women.ConclusionsOur findings did not support an overall association
   between experiencing prolonged or serious conflicts at work and incident
   dementia. However, because of the large differences in the point
   estimates for men and women, future research could aim at investigating
   potential sex differences regarding the association between conflicts at
   work and dementia.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we present the results of the combined analyses of ocean
   bottom seismometer and multi-channel seismic reflection data collection
   offshore southwestern Taiwan, with respect to the presence of gas
   hydrates and free gas within the accretionary wedge sediments. Estimates
   of the compressional velocities along EW9509-33 seismic reflection
   profile are obtained by a series of pre-stack depth migrations in a
   layer stripping streamlined Deregowski loop. Strong BSR is imaged over
   most of the reflection profile while low velocity zones are imaged below
   BSR at several locations. Amplitude versus angle analysis that are
   performed within the pre-stack depth migration processes reveal strong
   negative P-impedance near the bottom of the hydrate stability zone,
   commonly underlain by sharp positive P impedance layers associated with
   negative pseudo-Poisson attribute areas, indicating the presence of free
   gas below the BSR. Ray tracing of the acoustic arrivals with a model
   derived from the migration velocities generally fits the vertical and
   hydrophone records of the four ocean-bottom seismographs (OBS). In order
   to estimate the Poisson's ratios in the shallow sediments at the
   vicinity of the OBSs, we analyze the mode-converted arrivals in the
   wide-angle horizontal component. P-S mode converted reflections are
   dominant, while upward P-S transmissions are observed at large offsets.
   We observe significant compressional velocity and Poisson's ratio
   pull-down in the sediment below the BSR likely to bear free gas. When
   compared to Poisson's ratio predicted by mechanical models, the values
   proposed for the OBSs yield rough estimates of gas hydrate saturation in
   the range of 0-10\% in the layers above the BSR and of free gas
   saturation in the range of 0-2\% just below the BSR.}},

Abstract = {{In mechanical metamaterials, geometry and material properties dictate
   the structural response to mechanical loads. These materials are
   comprised of a tessellated array of repeat unit cells, which form a
   lattice that populates the domain of the structure. While the mechanical
   behavior of 2D lattices is well understood, recent advances in polymer
   based Additive Manufacturing (AM) usher in a new era of metamaterials
   research. However, previous work in this area has failed to address the
   effects of time and temperature on the transient response of
   polymerbased mechanical metamaterials. We seek to investigate the
   effects of thermal loads on the mechanical properties of mechanical
   metamaterials, in particular, the stiffness and damping properties of
   lattice structures comprised of bowtie and honeycomb representative unit
   cells. Towards this goal, in the present paper, an experimental approach
   is used to investigate the mechanical behaviour of 2D lattice
   structures. Experimental samples are prepared using Fused Deposition
   Modeling (FDM) AM. These samples are subject to quasi-static mechanical
   tests at room temperature. Additionally, we investigate the effects of
   mismatched unit cells (defects) on the mechanical behavior of the
   lattice. Mechanical metamaterials with adjustable stiffness and damping
   properties have applications in the aerospace and automotive industries,
   including sandwich composites, damping and impact protection.}},

Abstract = {{Background Count outcomes are commonly encountered in many epidemiology
   applications, and are often characterised by a large proportion of
   zeros. Although linear or logistic regression models have often been
   used to analyse count outcomes, the resulting estimates are likely to be
   inefficient, inconsistent or biased.
   Methods Data were taken from the first wave of the English Longitudinal
   Study of Ageing (ELSA). The main outcome measure is difficulty (ranging
   from 0 to 6) with `Activities of Daily Living (ADL-s)', such as
   dressing, walking across a room, bathing, eating, getting in and out of
   bed and using the toilet. Four regression models specifically developed
   for count outcomes were fitted to the data: Poisson, negative binomial
   (NB), zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) and zero-inflated negative binomial
   (ZINB). The models were compared using the Likelihood Ratio (LR) test of
   overdispersion, the Vuong test and graphical methods.
   Results The plots of predictions showed that overall, the ZINB model fit
   best. Although the ZINB and the ZIP models showed similar fit, the LR
   test provided strong evidence that the ZINB had improved fit over the
   ZIP. Increasing difficulties with ADL-s were associated with fair/poor
   self-reported health, limiting longstanding illness and physical
   inactivity. The probability of not having any difficulty with ADL-s
   decreases with a limiting longstanding illness, increasing age, no
   education, fair/poor self-reported health and with not living with a
   partner.
   Conclusion Models specifically developed for count outcomes with excess
   zeros such as ZINB can provide better insights into the investigation of
   the factors associated with the difficulties with ADL-s.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Previous studies of pavement management factors that relate
   to the occurrence of traffic-related crashes are rare. Traditional
   research has mostly employed summary statistics of bidirectional
   pavement quality measurements in extended longitudinal road segments
   over a long time period, which may cause a loss of important information
   and result in biased parameter estimates. The research presented in this
   article focuses on crash risk of roadways with overall fair to good
   pavement quality. Real-time and location-specific data were employed to
   estimate the effects of pavement management factors on the occurrence of
   crashes.
   Methods: This research is based on the crash data and corresponding
   pavement quality data for the Tennessee state route highways from 2004
   to 2009. The potential temporal and spatial correlations among
   observations caused by unobserved factors were considered. Overall 6
   models were built accounting for no correlation, temporal correlation
   only, and both the temporal and spatial correlations. These models
   included Poisson, negative binomial (NB), one random effect Poisson and
   negative binomial (OREP, ORENB), and two random effect Poisson and
   negative binomial (TREP, TRENB) models. The Bayesian method was employed
   to construct these models. The inference is based on the posterior
   distribution from the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation. These
   models were compared using the deviance information criterion.
   Results: Analysis of the posterior distribution of parameter
   coefficients indicates that the pavement management factors indexed by
   Present Serviceability Index (PSI) and Pavement Distress Index (PDI) had
   significant impacts on the occurrence of crashes, whereas the variable
   rutting depth was not significant. Among other factors, lane width,
   median width, type of terrain, and posted speed limit were significant
   in affecting crash frequency.
   Conclusions: The findings of this study indicate that a reduction in
   pavement roughness would reduce the likelihood of traffic-related
   crashes. Hence, maintaining a low level of pavement roughness is
   strongly suggested. In addition, the results suggested that the temporal
   correlation among observations was significant and that the ORENB model
   outperformed all other models.}},

Abstract = {{By introducing a periodic array of pores in an elastic matrix,
   instabilities with wavelengths that are of the order of the size of the
   microstructure can be triggered. Interestingly, these instabilities can
   be utilized to design a novel class of responsive materials. Possible
   applications include materials with unusual properties such as negative
   Poisson's ratio, phononic and photonic switches and colorful and
   reconfigurable displays.
   Although shape plays an important role in the design and performance of
   periodic materials, so far only the non-linear response of structures
   with circular and elliptical pores has been investigated and the effect
   of the pore shape on the structural response has not yet been explored.
   Here, we numerically explore the effect of pore shape on the non-linear
   response of a square array of pores in an elastomeric matrix. Our
   results show that pore shape can be used effectively to design material
   with desired properties and to control attractive features of soft
   porous systems, such as their stiffness, critical strain and negative
   Poisson's ratio. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   starts with defining TSMs and how to classify and name TSMs. The article
   also introduces the theoretical modeling of TSMs, the software developed
   for analyzing TSMs and the parametric studies performed. Findings After
   these studies, new materials are introduced that have abilities such as
   negative Poisson ratio inXandYdirection, negative Poisson ratio in one
   direction (eitherxor y), self-remodeling under stress. Research
   limitations/implications The research is done in 2D, further studies in
   3D using 3D printing are required to make the suggested materials a
   viable real-world solution. Originality/value The main contribution of
   this research work is the proposed nomenclature that creates a system
   for researchers to experiment and create novel and unique versions of
   the proposed materials. Furthermore, some of the materials developed
   exhibit some unique properties that may create advances in engineering

Abstract = {{We describe a methodology to calculate the relative free energies of
   protein-peptide complex formation. The interaction energy was decomposed
   into nonpolar, electrostatic and entropic contributions. A free
   energy-surface area relationship served to calculate the nonpolar free
   energy term. The electrostatic free energy was calculated with the
   finite difference Poisson-Boltzmann method and the entropic contribution
   was estimated from the loss in the conformational entropy of the peptide
   side chains.
   We applied this methodology to a series of DnaK peptide complexes. On
   the basis of the single known crystal structure of the peptide-binding
   domain of DnaK with a bound heptapeptide, we modeled ten other DnaK
   heptapeptide complexes with experimentally measured K-d values from 0.06
   mu M to 11 mu M, using molecular dynamics to refine the structures of
   the complexes, Molecular dynamic trajectories, after equilibration, were
   used for calculating the energies with greater accuracy. The calculated
   relative binding free energies were compared with the experimentally
   determined free energies. Linear scaling of the calculated terms was
   applied to fit them to the experimental values. The calculated binding
   free energies were between -7.1 kcal/mol and - 9.4 kcal/mol with a
   correlation coefficient of 0.86, The calculated nonpolar contributions
   are mainly due to the central hydrophobic binding pocket of DnaK for
   three amino acid residues. Negative electrostatic fields generated by
   the protein increase the binding affinity for basic residues flanking
   the hydrophobic core of the peptide ligand, Analysis of the individual
   energy contributions indicated that the nonpolar contributions are
   predominant compared to the other energy terms even for peptides with
   low affinity and that inclusion of the change In conformational entropy
   of the peptide side chains does not improve the discriminative power of
   the calculation. The method seems to be useful for predicting relative
   binding energies of peptide ligands of DnaK and might be applicable to
   other protein-peptide systems, particularly if only the structure of one
   protein-ligand complex is available. Proteins 2000;40:185-192. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Spinal epidural lipomatosis (SEL) results from
   excess lumbar epidural fat (EF) accumulation that compresses the cauda
   equina or nerve roots. Guidelines for the therapeutic management of SEL
   are not currently available.
   PURPOSE: To elucidate the efficacy of lumbar decompression surgery in
   SEL.
   STUDY DESIGN: Multicenter retrospective study.
   PATIENT SAMPLE: A total of 288 consecutive patients who underwent
   posterior lumbar spinous-splitting decompression surgery for lumbar
   spinal canal stenosis and followed up greater than 2 years at
   participating institutions were retrospectively reviewed.
   OUTCOME MEASURES: Japanese Orthopedic Association Back Pain Evaluation
   Questionnaire (JOABPEQ) and Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire
   (RDQ).
   METHODS: Participants were divided into two groups according to the
   ratio of EF to anteroposterior diameter of the spinal canal (EF/SC-L) at
   the spinal level with maximum dural tube compression. Patients with
   EF/SC-L of >= 0.6 and <0.6 were defined as those with SEL and non-SEL,
   respectively. We assessed whether surgical treatment was ``effective{''}
   or ``not effective{''} using the JOABPEQ based on the following: an
   increase of >= 20 points in the postoperative score compared with the
   preoperative score, or a preoperative score <90 with a postoperative
   score >= 90 points. We constructed a multiple Poisson regression model
   by adjusting for confounding factors, and determined estimated relative
   risk (RR) for ``not effective{''} with surgical treatment using the
   JOABPEQ. Additionally, we selected age-, sex-, BMI-, and decompression
   levels-matched patients with non-SEL and compared the frequency of ``not
   effective{''} between SEL patients (n=60) and non-SEL patients (n=60).
   RESULTS: Analysis using the RDQ and JOABPEQ showed that the 1- and
   2-year postoperative scores were significantly better than the
   preoperative scores in the both groups. Multivariable Poisson regression
   analysis demonstrated that SEL was significantly associated with ``not

   1.0-2.2) and social life (RR 1.3, 95\% CI 1.0-1.8) and the 2-year
   postoperative outcomes of walking ability (RR 1.6, 95\% CI 1.2-2.3).
   Matching analysis showed that SEL was significantly associated with

   postoperative outcomes of walking ability (p=.02).
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients with SEL exhibited significant improvements in
   surgical outcomes at 1 and 2 years postoperatively. However, compared
   with the non-SEL group, the efficacy of posterior lumbar
   spinous-splitting decompression surgery was worse in the SEL group,
   especially for walking ability. These results indicate that EF
   accumulation should be considered when planning treatment for patients
   with lumbar spinal canal stenosis and estimating the efficacy of lumbar
   decompression surgery. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Assume that the surplus of an insurer follows a compound Poisson surplus
   process. When the surplus is below zero or the insurer is on deficit,
   the insurer could borrow money at a debit interest rate to pay claims.
   Meanwhile, the insurer will repay the debts from her premium income. The
   negative surplus may return to a positive level. However, when the
   negative surplus is below a certain critical level, the surplus is no
   longer able to be positive. Absolute ruin occurs at this moment. In this
   paper, we study absolute ruin questions by defining an expected
   discounted penalty function at absolute ruin. The function includes the
   absolute ruin probability, the Laplace transform of the time to absolute
   ruin, the deficit at absolute ruin, the surplus just before absolute
   ruin, and many other quantities related to absolute ruin. First, we
   derive a system of integro-differential equations satisfied by the
   function and obtain a defective renewal equation that links the
   integro-differential equations in the system. Second, we show that when
   the initial surplus goes to infinity, the absolute ruin probability and
   the classical ruin probability are asymptotically equal for heavy-tailed
   claims while the ratio of the absolute ruin probability to the classical
   ruin probability goes to a positive constant that is less than one for
   light-tailed claims. Finally, we give explicit expressions for the
   function for exponential claims.}},

Title = {{Factors facilitating or limiting the use of AVO for coal-bed methane}},
Journal = {{GEOPHYSICS}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{71}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{C49-C56}},
Month = {{JUL-AUG}},
Abstract = {{There are similarities and differences in employing amplitude variation
   with offset (AVO) to explore for gas-sand reservoirs, as opposed to
   coal-bed methane (CBM) reservoirs. The main similarity is that large
   Poisson's ratio contrasts, resulting in AVO gradient anomalies, are
   expected for both kinds of reservoirs. The main difference is that
   cleating and fracturing raise the Poisson's ratio of a coal seam as it
   improves its reservoir potential for CBM, while gas always lowers the
   Poisson's ratio of a sandstone reservoir. The top of gas sands usually
   has a negative AVO gradient, leading to a class one, two, or three
   anomaly depending on the impedance contrast with the overlying caprock.
   On the other hand, the top of a CBM reservoir has a positive AVO
   gradient, leading to a class four anomaly. Three environmental factors
   may limit the usage of AVO for CBM reservoirs: the smaller contrast in
   Poisson's ratio between a CBM reservoir and its surrounding rock,
   variations in the caprock of a specific CBM reservoir, and the fact that
   CBM is not always free to collect at structurally high points in the
   reservoir. However, other factors work in favor of using AVO. The
   strikingly high reflection amplitude of coal improves signal/noise ratio
   and hence the reliability of AVO measurements. The relatively simple
   characteristics of AVO anomalies make them easy to interpret. Because
   faults are known to improve the quality of CBM reservoirs, faults
   accompanied by AVO anomalies would be especially convincing. A 3D-AVO
   example offered in this paper shows that AVO might be helpful to
   delineate methane-rich sweet spots within coal seams.}},

Abstract = {{Metallic glasses (MGs) possess large elastic limit and high strength,
   but unfortunately they are of limited commercial utility due to their
   macroscopic brittle nature. Here, we report that a chiral nanolattice
   can be used to design large-scale MGs with negative Poisson's ratio,
   large elastic deformation capability, extensive hardening, and large
   ductility. Furthermore, the mechanical behaviors of the metallic glass
   chiral nanolattice (MGCN) can be significantly altered through changing
   the thickness and length of the ligaments in the nanolattice. An
   exceptional combination of high strength and ductility is observed for
   MGCN with thin and long ligaments, wherein the sample density is only
   twice that of water. The deformation mechanism that characterizes the
   chiral topology is a combination of rotation of the nodes with bending
   and extension of the ligaments, leading to the extraordinary mechanical
   behaviors. The present study not only offers a potential solution to
   mitigating the brittleness of MGs, but also provides some guidelines in
   designing large-scale MG meta-materials for prospective applications in
   the fields of acoustics and energy absorption.}},

Abstract = {{A wide-angle x-ray scatter (WAXS) measurement could potentially be used
   to determine whether a biopsy of a breast duct is healthy or malignant.
   A ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) occurs when the epithelial cells
   lining the wall start to replicate and invade the duct interior. Since
   cells are composed mainly of water a WAXS signal of DCIS could contain a
   larger component due to water. A model approximates that a breast duct
   biopsy consists of connective tissue (c.t.) and cells. For a 2 mm
   diameter 3.81 mm thick healthy duct biopsy, the volumes in cubic mm are
   11.56 c.t. and 0.41 cells whereas 6.64 c.t. and 5.33 cells for DCIS. The
   differential linear scattering coefficients (mu(s)) for both types of
   biopsies were calculated using the sum nu c.t mu(s) c.t + nu cell where
   nu denotes fractional volume. The cell was assumed to be composed of
   water, lipids (fat), and other atoms associated with RNA, DNA, proteins,
   and carbohydrates. The pscell was calculated using the sum 0.771
   mu(water)(s) + 0.023 mu(fat)(s) 0.206(mu s)(other). The mu(s) of c.t.,
   water, and fat were available from literature whereas the independent
   atomic model approximation was used to calculate values for pother. A
   WAXS model provided predictions of the number of 6 degree scattered
   photons N-s for incident 50 kV beams on healthy and malignant ducts. The
   sum of Ns between 31.5 <= E <= 45 keV were 1402 and 1529 for
   respectively the healthy and malignant biopsies. Using Poisson
   statistics, two Gaussian distributions, and a descision threshold set at
   their intersection, the false positive and false negative probabilities
   were 4.7\% and 5.0\%. This work suggests that DCIS could potentially be
   diagnosed via energy dispersive WAXS measurements.}},

   empirical analysis for bus-involved crashes}},
Journal = {{ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Previous studies related to bus crash frequencies modeling are limited
   and the statistical models are usually developed at the road segment or
   zonal level. This study focuses on modeling crash frequencies
   specifically at the bus-service-route level, which is useful and
   important to policymakers and bus operation companies toward the
   improvement of the safety level of bus networks, especially for
   developing countries where buses are still a major mode of urban
   travels. Using the observed data adopted from one of the bus operating
   companies in Beijing, China, we proposed a spatiotemporal-random-effect
   zero-inflated negative binomial (spatiotemporal ZINB) model to
   investigate bus crash occurrence and identity key influential factors at
   the bus-service-route level. The model was motivated to accommodate the
   special statistical characteristics of the excessive zeros and, more
   importantly, the potential spatiotemporal correlations of the data.
   Three degenerated versions of this model were also developed for
   comparison purposes. Results indicate that the proposed spatiotemporal
   ZINB model is statistically superior to the others according to a
   comprehensive judgment based on the EAIC, EBIC, and RMSE criteria. The
   estimated coefficients reveal the impacts of related factors on the
   likelihood of bus-involved crashes from bus operation factors including
   total passengers, number of drivers, and proportion of male drivers as
   well as planning factors including route length and stop density. On the
   other hand, the standard deviations of the introduced structured and
   unstructured spatiotemporal random-effects are statistically significant
   indicating that the observations are correlated within each route,
   between neighbor routes and across years. Corresponding policy and
   practical implications are provided for bus operating companies and
   planning departments toward the improvement of bus safety.}},

Title = {{EFFECTS OF INPLANE RESTRAINTS ON THE STABILITY OF LAMINATED COMPOSITE
   PLATES}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{1992}},
Volume = {{20}},

Pages = {{73-81}},
Abstract = {{Stability predictions of uniaxially compressed laminates have consisted
   mainly of solutions based on assumptions of free in-plane edges avoiding
   consideration of Poisson's effect in the prebuckling stage.  The paper
   considers a practical problem of uniaxial buckling of rectangular,
   anisotropic laminates with in-plane restrained unloaded edges where a
   transverse in-plane force due to Poisson's effect is predominant to an
   extent that induces premature instability and causes significant
   departure from classical behavior.  Two general classes of laminates,
   namely, (+/- theta)sym and (phi(1), phi(2))sym, are studied under
   various combinations of out-of-plane simple and clamped boundary
   conditions.  A wide variation in Poisson's ratio with respect to the
   fiber orientation is observed that, in turn, results in dramatic changes
   in the buckling as well as postbuckling behavior.  It is clearly shown
   that the classical optimal fiber angles become practically meaningless
   when the effect of in-plane edge restraints is incorporated in the
   analysis.
   For the analysis a computerized Ritz method, in conjunction with
   Gram-Schmidt orthogonal polynomials as coordinate functions, is
   developed, which is capable of modeling a variety of boundary condition,
   viz. simple, clamped, free and their combinations.
   The paper investigates a little known but practical mode of instability,
   highlights the effect of fiber orientation and aspect ratio, explores
   the possibility of controlling buckling by tailoring laminates to
   exhibit negative Poisson's ratio and cautions against improper selection
   of boundary conditions in the design and optimization of composite
   plates.}},

Title = {{Confronting imperfect detection: behavior of binomial mixture models
   under varying circumstances of visits, sampling sites, detectability,
   and abundance, in small-sample situations}},

Abstract = {{Binomial mixture models (BMMs) have been increasingly applied to account
   for imperfect detection and to estimate abundance from count data, but
   their performance has not been thoroughly evaluated. Here, I conducted
   simulation experiments to examine parameter estimates in BMMs under
   various situations. I generated data by assuming that abundance followed
   a Poisson distribution with an expected value lambda and that the number
   of detected individuals followed a binomial distribution with an
   individual detection probability p. In simple simulations without
   covariates for lambda and p, when the number of sampling sites (n) was
   between 20 and 160, BMMs could recover lambda and p under the following
   conditions: 0.1 <=lambda <= 160 and p >= 0.1. However, within these
   ranges of lambda and p, the estimates were variable under lower values
   of lambda and p, although the situation improved as n increased. When
   lambda and p are expected to exceed these ranges and the sample size is
   small, the results suggest that sampling and/or modeling designs should
   be reconsidered. I then conducted simulation experiments with
   covariates. I assumed that lambda increased with a covariate (x) across
   20 sampling sites. I varied p, number of visits (v), and their
   dependency on a covariate. To compare BMMs with analyses that did not
   accommodate imperfect detection, I fitted ordinary Poisson generalized
   linear models to mean and maximum counts (GLM(mean) and GLM(max)). The
   results showed that GLM(max) was superior to GLM(mean) because GLM(mean)
   underestimated lambda when p was small. GLM(max) underestimated a
   coefficient of the covariate (slope) when v was negatively correlated
   with x. BMMs successfully recovered true values of the intercepts,
   slopes, and lambda in most cases. However, when p and v were small, and
   when p and lambda were highly negatively correlated due to their inverse
   dependency on x, estimates from BMMs were more variable.}},

Abstract = {{Mechanical metamaterials are artificial composites that exhibit a wide
   range of advanced functionalities such as negative Poisson's ratio,
   shape shifting, topological protection, multistability, extreme
   strength-to-density ratio, and enhanced energy dissipation. In
   particular, flexible metamaterials often harness zeroenergy deformation
   modes. To date, such flexible metamaterials have a single property, for
   example, a single shape change, or are pluripotent, that is, they can
   have many different responses, but typically require complex actuation
   protocols. Here, we introduce a class of oligomodal metamaterials that
   encode a few distinct properties that can be selectively controlled
   under uniaxial compression. To demonstrate this concept, we introduce a
   combinatorial design space containing various families of metamaterials.
   These families include monomodal (i.e., with a single zero-energy
   deformation mode); oligomodal (i.e., with a constant number of
   zero-energy deformation modes); and plurimodal (i.e., with many
   zero-energy deformation modes), whose number increases with system size.
   We then confirm the multifunctional nature of oligomodal metamaterials
   using both boundary textures and viscoelasticity. In particular, we
   realize a metamaterial that has a negative (positive) Poisson's ratio
   for low (high) compression rate over a finite range of strains. The
   ability of our oligomodal metamaterials to host multiple mechanical
   responses within a single structure paves the way toward multifunctional
   materials and devices.}},

   Gripper and Human Joint Wearables}},
Journal = {{ADVANCED ENGINEERING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Existing stretchable capacitive sensor arrays face challenges in
   decoupling normal forces and stretch stimuli which restrict its
   applications into soft robotics. Herein, a metamaterial capacitive
   sensor array with 6 x 6 sensors is developed for the detection of normal
   forces on curved deforming surfaces common to both the soft universal
   jamming gripper and human elbow. The fabrication process involves the 3D
   printing of carbon black thermoplastic polyurethane (PI-ETPU) electrodes
   and thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) insulation based on commercially
   available multimaterial fused deposition modeling (FDM). This
   metamaterial capacitive sensor array is unaffected by a uniaxial stretch
   of up to 21.6\% and remains capable of detecting normal forces. The
   sensor array structure possesses a negative Poisson's ratio which is
   desirable for improving compliance and conformability to adhered
   expanding surfaces. Consequently, normal force-distribution and
   proximity detection capabilities on curved deforming surfaces are
   demonstrated on a soft universal jamming gripper for measuring gripping
   forces and identifying object shapes. Conformal force-sensing joint
   wearable on a human elbow with an individualized Poisson's ratio is
   explored as another application. The possibility of programming
   Poisson's ratio of a metamaterial capacitive sensing array opens new
   avenues for potential sensing applications into soft robotics and
   personalized wearables.}},

Abstract = {{An analysis was conducted of 27,982 deaths among 106,020 persons
   employed at four Federal nuclear plants in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, between
   1943 and 1985. The main objectives were to extend the evaluation of the
   health effects of employment in the nuclear industry in Oak Ridge to
   include most workers who were omitted from earlier studies, to compare
   the mortality experience of workers among the facilities, to address
   methodological problems that occur when individuals employed at more
   than one facility are included in the analysis, and to conduct
   dose-response analyses for those individuals with potential exposure to
   external radiation. All-cause mortality and all-cancer mortality were in
   close agreement with national rates. The only notable excesses occurred
   for white males for lung cancer {[}standardized mortality ratio (SMR) =
   1.18, 1,849 deaths] and non-malignant respiratory disease (SMR = 1.12,
   1,568 deaths). A more detailed analysis revealed substantial differences
   in death rates among workers at the Oak Ridge plants. Evaluation of
   internally adjusted log SMRs using Poisson regression showed that
   workers employed only at Tennessee Eastman Corporation or K-25 and at
   multiple facilities had higher death rates than similar workers employed
   only at X-10 or Y-12, and that the differences were primarily due to
   non-cancer causes. Analysis of selected cancer causes for white males
   indicated large differences among the workers at the different
   facilities for lung cancer, leukemia and other lymphatic cancer.
   Dose-response analyses for external penetrating radiation were limited
   to a subcohort of 28,347 white males employed at X-10 or Y-12. Their
   collective recorded dose equivalent was 376 Sv. There was a strong
   `'healthy worker effect'' in this subcohort - all-cause SMR = 0.80
   (4,786 deaths) and all-cancer SR IR = 0.87 (1,134 deaths). Variables
   included in the analyses were age, birth cohort, a measure of
   socioeconomic status, length of employment, internal radiation exposure
   potential and facility. For external radiation dose with a 10-year lag,
   the excess relative risk was 0.31 per Sv (95\% CI = -0.16, 1.01) for all
   causes and 1.45 per Sv (95\% CI = 0.15, 3.48) for all cancer. The
   estimated excess relative risk for leukemia was negative but imprecisely
   determined. A preliminary dose adjustment procedure was developed to
   compensate for missing dose but not other dosimetry errors. Results of
   the analyses using the adjusted doses suggest that the effect of missing
   dose is an upward bias in dose-response coefficients and test
   statistics. (C) 1997 by Radiation Research Society.}},

   changes in structural geometry and stiffness. In this study, we
   demonstrate variable stiffness cellular materials capable of large
   global changes in area through local buckling modes. Furthermore,
   stiffness properties and Poisson ratios may be tailored to provide
   desirable structural reconfiguration properties such as negative Poisson
   ratio and highly anisotropic stiffness. However, stiffness properties of
   cellular materials are two to three orders of magnitude below their
   constitutive materials properties. Their elastic properties can vary
   considerably as a function of the applied strain level due to the
   redistribution of structural material within the cells. Another

Abstract = {{Methods. The frequency, predictors, treatment and clinical outcomes of
   CNS peritonitis were examined by multivariate logistic regression and
   multilevel Poisson regression in all adult PD patients in Australia
   between 2003 and 2006.
   Results. A total of 936 episodes of CNS peritonitis (constituting 26\%
   of all peritonitis episodes) occurred in 620 individuals. The observed
   rate of CNS peritonitis was 0.16 episodes per patient-year. Lower rates
   of CNS peritonitis were independently predicted by Asian racial origin
   (adjusted odds ratio {[}OR], 0.52; 95\% CI, 0.35-0.79), renovascular
   nephrosclerosis (OR, 0.40; 95\% CI, 0.18-0.86), early referral to a
   renal unit prior to dialysis commencement (OR, 0.38; 95\% CI, 0.19-0.79)
   and treatment with automated PD at any time during the PD career (OR,
   0.79; 95\% CI, 0.66-0.96). The majority of CNS peritonitis episodes were
   initially treated with intraperitoneal vancomycin or cephazolin in
   combination with gentamicin. This regimen was changed in 533 (57\%)
   individuals after a median period of 3 days, most commonly to vancomycin
   monotherapy. The median total antibiotic course duration was 14 days.
   Compared with other forms of peritonitis, CNS episodes were
   significantly more likely to be cured by antibiotics alone (76 vs 64\%,
   P < 0.001) and less likely to be complicated by hospitalization (61 vs
   73\%, P < 0.001), catheter removal (10 vs 26\%, P < 0.001), temporary
   haemodialysis (2 vs 5\%, P < 0.001), permanent haemodialysis transfer (9
   vs 21\%, P < 0.001) and death (1.0 vs 2.7\%, P = 0.002). CNS peritonitis
   was also associated with a shorter duration of hospitalization, a longer
   time to catheter removal and a shorter duration of temporary
   haemodialysis. Catheter removal and permanent haemodialysis transfer
   were independently predicted by polymicrobial peritonitis and initial
   empiric administration of vancomycin (compared with cephalosporins). CNS
   peritonitis was associated with a higher relapse rate (17 vs 13\%, P =
   0.003) and relapsed CNS peritonitis was associated with a higher
   catheter removal rate (22 vs 7\%, P < 0.001). Repeat peritonitis
   occurred in 194 (31\%) individuals and the highest risk was in the
   second month after completion of antibiotic treatment for CNS
   peritonitis (OR, 1.87; 95\% CI, 1.39-2.51 compared with > 2 months).
   Conclusions. CNS peritonitis is a common complication with a relatively
   benign outcome compared with other forms of PD-associated peritonitis.
   Relapsed and repeat peritonitis are relatively common and are associated
   with worse outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Consider a compound Poisson surplus process of an insurer with debit
   interest and tax payments. When the portfolio is in a profitable
   situation, the insurer may pay a certain proportion of the premium
   income as tax payments. When the portfolio is below zero, the insurer
   could borrow money at a debit interest rate to continue his/her
   business. Meanwhile, the insurer will repay the debts from his/her
   premium income. The negative surplus may return to a positive level
   except that the surplus is below a certain critical level. In the latter
   case, we say that absolute ruin occurs. In this paper, we discuss
   absolute ruin quantities by defining an expected discounted penalty
   function at absolute ruin. First, a system of integro-differential
   equations satisfied by the expected discounted penalty function is
   derived. Second, closed-form expressions for the expected discounted
   total sum of tax payments until absolute ruin and the Laplace-Stieltjes
   transform (LST) of the total duration of negative surplus are obtained.
   Third, for exponential individual claims, closed-form expressions for
   the absolute ruin probability, the LST of the time to absolute ruin, the
   distribution function of the deficit at absolute ruin and the expected
   accumulated discounted tax are given. Fourth, for general individual
   claim distributions, when the initial surplus goes to infinity, we show
   that the ratio of the absolute ruin probability with tax to that without
   tax goes to a positive constant which is greater than one. Finally, we
   investigate the asymptotic behavior of the absolute ruin probability of
   a modified risk model where the interest rate on a positive surplus is
   involved. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Marginal zero-inflated regression models for count data}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED STATISTICS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{44}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{1807-1826}},
Abstract = {{Data sets with excess zeroes are frequently analyzed in many
   disciplines. A common framework used to analyze such data is the
   zero-inflated (ZI) regression model. It mixes a degenerate distribution
   with point mass at zero with a non-degenerate distribution. The
   estimates from ZI models quantify the effects of covariates on the means
   of latent random variables, which are often not the quantities of
   primary interest. Recently, marginal zero-inflated Poisson (MZIP; Long
   etal. {[}A marginalized zero-inflated Poisson regression model with
   overall exposure effects. Stat. Med. 33 (2014), pp.5151-5165]) and
   negative binomial (MZINB; Preisser et al., 2016) models have been
   introduced that model the mean response directly. These models yield
   covariate effects that have simple interpretations that are, for many
   applications, more appealing than those available from ZI regression.
   This paper outlines a general framework for marginal zero-inflated
   models where the latent distribution is a member of the exponential
   dispersion family, focusing on common distributions for count data. In
   particular, our discussion includes the marginal zero-inflated binomial
   (MZIB) model, which has not been discussed previously. The details of
   maximum likelihood estimation via the EM algorithm are presented and the
   properties of the estimators as well as Wald and likelihood ratio-based
   inference are examined via simulation. Two examples presented illustrate
   the advantages of MZIP, MZINB, and MZIB models for practical data
   analysis.}},

Title = {{Analysis of crash frequency in motorway tunnels based on a correlated
   random-parameters approach}},
Journal = {{TUNNELLING AND UNDERGROUND SPACE TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{85}},
Pages = {{243-251}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The paper provides an analysis of the frequency of total accidents
   (accidents involving material damage, physical injuries and fatalities),
   which occurred in 226 unidirectional motorway tunnels over a four-year
   monitoring period, based on unrelated and correlated random-parameter
   models. The so-called random-intercept model, in which only the
   regression intercept is assumed to be random, was also developed a
   priori for recording the random-effects (temporal correlations among
   accidents occurring in the same tunnel in different years). The
   independent variables were: tunnel length (L), annual average daily
   traffic (AADT) per lane, percentage of trucks (\%Tr), presence of a
   sidewalk (SW), longitudinal slope (LS), and mechanical ventilation (MV).
   The comparison among the aforementioned three models showed that the
   correlated random-parameters model, which takes into account the cross
   correlation among the random-parameters, provided a better
   goodness-of-fit than the corresponding uncorrelated random-parameter and
   intercept-random models. This means that more precise estimations of
   accidents can be obtained when the random-parameters are assumed to be
   correlated in statistical analysis. The developed model also offers
   additional insights into showing how different combinations of
   parameters affect tunnel safety. In particular, through the correlation
   coefficient matrix of random-parameters, we found that the non-constant
   longitudinal slope (LS) alleviates the effect of the annual average
   daily traffic (AADT) per lane on increasing crash frequency. In
   addition, the presence of the mechanical ventilation (MV) in tunnels
   makes less significant the influence of AADT per lane on increasing
   crash frequency, too. The knowledge of these correlations may be useful
   for future applications, for example, for road engineers in designing
   tunnel. The model proposed can also be used by Tunnel Management
   Agencies (TMAs) for estimating possible variations in accident frequency
   in a specific tunnel due to modifications of traffic control systems.}},

Title = {{Differential Impacts of HIV status on short-term fertility desires among
   couples in Rakai, Uganda}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 24}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Fertility desires of female and male partners in current relationships
   are often correlated. We examined the influence of HIV seropositive
   status of female and male partners on short-term fertility desires in
   Rakai, Uganda, a setting with high fertility and HIV infection rates.
   Methods
   Participants were couples (15-49 years old) enrolled in the Rakai
   Community Cohort Study, from 2011 to 2013 (n = 2,291). Cohen's kappa
   coefficient was used to measure the correlation of female and male
   partners' short-term fertility desires (measured as `wanting a child in
   the next 12 months'), in both total sample and stratified serostatus
   groups. HIV serostatus and additional characteristics of female and male
   partners were included in Poisson regression models to estimate the rate
   ratios (RR) for each partner's short-term fertility desires. Individual
   and partner characteristics included HIV status, partner HIV status, age
   in years, partner age in years, educational attainment, number of living
   children, community of residence, and socioeconomic status (SES).
   Results
   Short-term fertility desires among female and male partners were
   moderately associated (Kappa = 0.37, p-value<0.001). The association was
   weakest among female sero-positive and male sero-negative couples (Kappa
   = 0.29, p-value<0.001). When adjusting for parity and other covariates
   in the model, women's short-term fertility desires were significantly
   associated with their positive sero-status regardless of male partners'
   sero-status (adjRR = 1.58, p<0.001 for F+M-; adjRR = 1.33, p = 0.001 for
   F+M+; in comparison with F-M-). Men's short-term fertility desires were
   significantly associated with their positive sero-status, in addition to
   their female partners' positive sero-status (adjRR = 1.23 with p-value =
   0.022 for F-M+; adjRR = 1.42 with p-value<0.001 for F+M-; adjRR = 1.26
   with p-value<0.001 for F+M+; in comparison with F-M-). When the
   differential effect of parity was included in the model, similar
   associations remained for both female and male partners when the number
   of living children was small, but largely reduced when the number of
   living children was large (3 or more).
   Conclusion
   Female and male partners in couple dyads demonstrated moderate
   agreements about short-term fertility desires. The HIV seropositive
   status of female partners was most strongly associated with short-term
   fertility desires of both genders, and this association was even
   stronger for women who had few or no living children.}},

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{148}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In this study, the mechanical performance of a three-dimensional (3D)
   re-entrant structure subjected to dynamic compression was experimentally
   investigated using a high-speed Instron machine. Quasi-static tests were
   conducted for comparison. All samples were fabricated by multi-jet
   fusion technology. A finite element (FE) model was developed using
   ABAQUS/Explicit and validated against the dynamic test results in terms
   of deformation mode, plateau stress, and Poisson's ratio. The validated
   FE model was subsequently employed to study the effects of the number of
   unit cells, geometrical parameters (aspect ratio, H/L, and re-entrant
   angle, theta) of the re-entrant unit cell, and compressive velocity. The
   results showed that the structure with H/L = 1 and theta = 45 degrees
   had the highest specific energy absorption (SEA) when compressed in the
   Z direction and the structure with H/L = 1.1 and theta = 75 degrees had
   the highest SEA when compressed in the X direction. Moreover, the
   performance of the 3D re-entrant structure was compared with that of a
   2D re-entrant structure with the same geometrical parameters. The energy
   absorption of the 3D re-entrant structure was also compared with other
   popular cellular structures using an Ashby chart.}},

Abstract = {{The synthesis of novel one-dimensional carbon nanostructures named
   diamond nanothreads (DNT) has been recently reported, and subsequent
   studies employing molecular dynamics (MD) simulations demonstrated that
   they possess remarkable mechanical properties. In this paper we present
   the results of Density Functional Theory calculations of the mechanical
   properties for several DNT configurations, confirming that they indeed
   exhibit a high ideal strength (as high as 15.7 nN or 2.6 x 10(7) N m/kg)
   and stiffness (as high as 168 nN or 2.8 x 10(8) N m/kg), similarly to
   other carbon nanostructures. We compare these results with previously
   reported and additional MD calculations, and show that traditional
   interatomic potentials predict these properties with deviations up to
   similar to 50\%. A detailed analysis of the dependence of atomic
   structure on strain shows the reasons for these discrepancies. We also
   show that the most known DNT configuration (the (3,0) sp(3)-nanotube)
   exhibits a negative radial Poisson ratio. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Bit error rate of pulse position modulation wireless optical
   communication in gamma-gamma oceanic anisotropic turbulence}},
Journal = {{ACTA PHYSICA SINICA}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{68}},
Number = {{16}},
Month = {{AUG 20}},
Abstract = {{Pulse position modulation (PPM) technology combined with the system of
   wireless optical communication received by the photon detector has the
   advantages of high energy efficiency and strong anti-interference
   capability. This technology has received extensive attention in the
   field of underwater wireless optical communication (UWOC) system.
   Affected by ocean turbulence, the UWOC system will produce the intensity
   fluctuations, leading the system performance to degrade. The Gamma-gamma
   intensity fluctuation probability model, which is a two-parameter model,
   possesses a wide range of applications. It can describe weak, medium and
   strong fluctuation in light intensity statistics. In this paper,
   firstly, based on the relationship between the weak atmospheric
   turbulent spherical wave scintillation index and the weak ocean
   anisotropic turbulent spherical wave scintillation index, the equivalent
   structural parameter expressed by both ocean turbulence parameters and
   anisotropy factor is derived. Then, using the structural parameter
   combined with the gamma-gamma turbulence channel and the asymptotic
   Rytov theory, the bit error rate (BER) under anisotropic ocean
   turbulence is calculated based on the BER formula of the PPM
   communication system. Finally, numerical simulations are carried out to
   analyze the ocean turbulence parameters, the average avalanche
   photodiode (APD) gain, the PPM modulation order, the data bit rate, and
   the influences of transmission distance on the BER under different
   anisotropic ocean turbulences. The results indicate that the negative
   effect of turbulence becomes stronger with increasing the ratio between
   the contributions of temperature and salinity to the refractive index
   spectrum, the dissipation rate of mean-squared temperature, data bit
   rate, and propagation distance. As the viscosity coefficient increases,
   the BER decreases. When the isotropic ocean turbulence and the
   anisotropy factors are very small, the increase of the rate of
   dissipation of kinetic energy per unit mass of fluid will result in a
   decrease in BER. When the turbulent environment anisotropy is further
   strengthened, the BER first increases and then decreases as the rate of
   dissipation of kinetic energy per unit mass of fluid increases. As the
   average APD gain increases, the BER first decreases and then increases.
   This trend is especially noticeable as the anisotropy factor increases.
   The choice of the average APD gain is important for finding the minimum
   value of the BER. In general, the system is more affected by salinity
   fluctuation than by temperature fluctuation. As the rate of dissipation
   of mean-squared temperature increases and the viscosity coefficient
   decreases, the negative effects of turbulence becomes more and more
   serious. When the system propagates longer distances or works at a
   higher data bit rate, the system is severely affected by turbulence,
   which limits the system operating distance and data transmission rate.
   However, using a smaller modulation order and choosing the right APD can
   conduce to improving the system performance. In addition, the PPM UWOC
   system can perform better when the system operates within acceptable bit
   error rate as the ocean turbulence environment becomes more anisotropic.
   This study will provide reference for the construction and performance
   estimation of UWOC system platform.}},

   membranes}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},

Volume = {{83}},

Month = {{MAR 31}},
Abstract = {{We investigate the properties of crystalline phantom membranes, at the
   crumpling transition and in the flat phase, using a nonperturbative
   renormalization group approach. We avoid a derivative expansion of the
   effective average action and instead analyze the full momentum
   dependence of the elastic coupling functions. This leads to a more
   accurate determination of the critical exponents and further yields the
   full momentum dependence of the correlation functions of the in-plane
   and out-of-plane fluctuation. The flow equations are solved numerically
   for D = 2 dimensional membranes embedded in a d = 3 dimensional space.
   Within our approach we find a crumpling transition of second order which
   is characterized by an anomalous exponent eta(c) approximate to 0.63(8)
   and the thermal exponent nu approximate to 0.69. Near the crumpling
   transition the order parameter of the flat phase vanishes with a
   critical exponent beta approximate to 0.22. The flat phase anomalous
   dimension is eta(f) approximate to 0.85 and the Poisson's ratio inside
   the flat phase is found to be sigma(f) approximate to -1/3. At the
   crumpling transition we find a much larger negative value of the
   Poisson's ratio sigma(c) approximate to -0.71(5). We discuss further in
   detail the different regimes of the momentum dependent fluctuations,
   both in the flat phase and in the vicinity of the crumpling transition,
   and extract the crossover momentum scales which separate them.}},

Abstract = {{Motivated by the recent successful growth of quasi-free-standing single
   layer blue phosphorus (BlueP) on tellurium functionalized Au(1 1 1) by
   using black phosphorus as the precursor (Zhang et al 2016 Nano Lett. 16
   4903; Gu et al 2017 ACS Nano 11 4943), here we study the strain
   performance for zigzag BlueP nanoribbons (zBluePNRs) with different edge
   chemical modifications. Based on the first-principles calculations,
   interestingly, we find that a narrow zBluePNR of width up to similar to
   2 nm with edge sulfur (S) passivation under an uniaxial strain exhibits
   an important effect of negative Poisson's ratio because of the
   particularity of the P-S bonds at edges, and as the ribbon width further
   increases the Poisson's ratio varies from negative to positive.
   Meanwhile, the S-passivation also induces magnetism, and applying a
   strong enough strain can transfer this zBluePNR from magnetic metal
   state to half-metal one. All these physical properties are discussed in
   connection with the variation of microstructure of the ribbons. Our
   findings may paving the way for both a fundamental understanding of

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL SOFTWARE}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{1-14}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{There has been much recent interest in Bayesian inference for
   generalized additive and related models. The increasing popularity of
   Bayesian methods for these and other model classes is mainly caused by
   the introduction of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation
   techniques which allow realistic modeling of complex problems. This
   paper describes the capabilities of the free software package BayesX for
   estimating regression models with structured additive predictor based on
   MCMC inference. The program extends the capabilities of existing
   software for semiparametric regression included in S-PLUS, SAS, R or
   Stata. Many model classes well known from the literature are special
   cases of the models supported by BayesX. Examples are generalized
   additive ( mixed) models, dynamic models, varying coefficient models,
   geoadditive models, geographically weighted regression and models for
   space-time regression. BayesX supports the most common distributions for
   the response variable. For univariate responses these are Gaussian,
   Binomial, Poisson, Gamma, negative Binomial, zero inflated Poisson and
   zero inflated negative binomial. For multicategorical responses, both
   multinomial logit and probit models for unordered categories of the
   response as well as cumulative threshold models for ordered categories
   can be estimated. Moreover, BayesX allows the estimation of complex
   continuous time survival and hazard rate models.}},

   estimators are comprehensively analyzed using simulation. Three
   situations are considered using data generated with: a fixed
   autoregressive parameter and equidispersed Poisson innovations; negative
   binomial innovations; and, additionally, a random autoregressive
   coefficient. The first set of experiments indicates that bias correction
   methods, not hitherto used in this context to our knowledge, are
   sometimes needed and that likelihood-based estimators, as might be
   expected, perform well. The second two scenarios are representative of
   overdispersion. Methods designed specifically for the Poisson context
   now perform uniformly badly, but simple, bias-corrected, Yule-Walker and
   least squares estimators perform well in all cases.}},

Abstract = {{Composite materials with periodic microstructures are commonly used in
   engineering. Numerical homogenization with finite element method (FEM)
   has proven fairly effective to determine the mechanical properties of a
   range of composite materials. However, traditional FEM fails to evaluate
   the effective mechanical properties for incompressible constituents due
   to volumetric locking problem in numerical analysis. In this paper, a
   novel selective smoothed finite element method (S-FEM) in multi-material
   domain using triangular and tetrahedral elements is proposed to overcome
   the locking problem in the numerical homogenization of incompressible
   materials. The implementation of S-FEM is easy without additional
   parameters. A number of characterization examples for porous,
   multiphase, tissue scaffold composites are presented to demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the proposed SFEM homogenization in handling
   incompressible base materials. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A rugged lithium-ion battery (LIB) can be realized without any new
   material development through selective material matching based on
   localized deformation of a substrate induced by its well-designed
   pattern. In particular, an auxetic cut flexible substrate accommodates
   various complex deformations and adaptive conformations through the
   hinge joints because the external force is highly localized in the
   hinges while the segmented motifs remain almost undeformed. The embedded
   LIB cells in undeformed regions of the auxetic cut silicon rubber sheet
   do not undergo large deformation, maintaining their battery performance
   regardless of loading conditions via the pattern-associated deformation
   mechanism. The hierarchy and number of segmentations are the key
   parameters of the deformation mechanism for auxetic cut
   shape-reconfigurable battery systems. The numerically and experimentally
   proven strategy that utilizes strain gradients induced by a patterned
   substrate as a design guideline for material matching can lead to
   various wearable and conformable designs without sacrificing the
   functionality and durability of electronic devices.}},

   analyses of the distribution patterns of adults and squares with feeding
   punctures of A. grandis on two cotton genotypes, Bt and non-Bt near
   isogenic lines. We conducted the field experiment in two experimental
   areas; each area had 100 plots composed of seven rows, each seven metros
   long. Between Jan and May 2010, 16 samplings were made, in each, five
   plants were evaluated per plot by counting the adults and damaged
   squares. The dispersion indexes (ratio of the variance/mean, the
   Morisita index, and Exponent k of the Binomial Negative Distribution)
   and the theoretical distribution of frequencies (Poisson, Negative
   Binomial and Positive Binomial) were calculated. No differences between
   cotton genotypes were found. The spatial distribution of A. grandis
   adults fit the Negative Binominal (aggregate) and Positive Binominal
   (uniform) distributions, depending on the number of days after cotton
   emergence. The dispersion analyses of the feeding damaged squares on the
   Bt and conventional cotton revealed Poisson (random), Negative Binominal

Abstract = {{The flexing of the ligaments at the edge of a finite hexagonal honeycomb
   array is studied using analytical and numerical methods. It is shown
   that when compressed axially, the ligaments on the border of a hexagonal
   honeycomb array bend outwardly in contrast to the interior ligaments
   that bend to a negligible extent, if at all. This boundary effect
   reduces the overall auxeticity of re-entrant hexagonal honeycombs.
   Analytical expressions that account for the edge effects on the
   Poisson's ratio and Young's modulus are obtained using Castigliano's
   second theorem. These are then tested against numerical simulations
   showing good agreement at least for the values of the parameters used.
   Additional investigations indicate that the use of a larger ligament
   thickness for the ligaments residing on the border of the system
   mitigates this edge effect on the Poisson's ratio.}},

Title = {{HER-2 positive breast cancer: decreasing proportion but stable incidence
   in Finnish population from 1982 to 2005}},
Journal = {{BREAST CANCER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{11}},

Abstract = {{Introduction Classification of breast cancers according to the HER-2
   oncogene status is of central importance in the selection of
   post-surgical therapies. A decrease in the proportion of HER2-positive
   breast cancer has been suspected, but no data on the incidence trends at
   population level have been reported.
   Methods We studied the proportion of HER-2-positive breast cancers by
   chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) in three cohorts ( years 1982
   to 1986 (n = 310), 1989 to 1992 ( n = 108), and 2004 to 2005 ( n = 713))
   in the population of the Pirkanmaa hospital district ( approximately
   220,000 women). Cancer incidence rates were age-adjusted to the world
   standard population.
   Results The proportion of HER-2-positive breast cancer declined from
   21.6\% ( average in 1982 to 1986) to 13.6\% ( average in 2004 to 2005).
   However, during the same time period the age-adjusted incidence of all
   invasive breast cancers had increased by 40\%. These opposite trends
   balanced each other and indicated that the incidence of HER-2-positive
   breast cancer has remained unchanged (Poisson regression coefficient for
   time trend 1.000; 95\% CI = 0.989 to 1.012). In contrast, the incidence
   of HER-2-negative cancer showed 2\% annual increase (Poisson regression
   coefficient 1.021, 95\% CI = 1.016 to 1.026). Although HER-2-negative
   cancers were more likely to be diagnosed by mammography screening, the
   changes were more likely to be explained by etiological risk factors
   favoring HER-2-negative (and hormone receptorpositive) disease such as
   menopausal hormone therapy.
   Conclusions These results document a significant decrease in the
   proportion of HER-2-positive breast cancer. However, the incidence of
   HER-2-positive cancer at the population level was found to be unchanged.}},

Month = {{JAN 20}},
Abstract = {{Colloids with patchy metal coating under laser irradiation could act as
   local heat sources and generate temperature gradients that could induce
   self-propulsion and interactions between them. The collective behavior
   of a dilute solution of such thermally active particles is studied using
   a stochastic formulation. It is found that when the Soret coefficient is
   positive, the system could be described in a stationary state by the
   nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann equation and could adopt density profiles
   with significant depletion in the middle region when confined. For
   colloids with a negative Soret coefficient, the system can be described
   as a dissipative equivalent of a gravitational system. It is shown that
   in this case the thermally active colloidal solution could undergo an
   instability at a critical laser intensity, which has similarities to a
   supernova explosion.}},

Abstract = {{Wildfire prevention education efforts involve a variety of methods,
   including airing public service announcements, distributing brochures,
   and making presentations, which are intended to reduce the occurrence of
   certain kinds of wildfires. A Poisson model of preventable Florida

   Controlling for potential simultaneity biases, this model indicated that
   wildfire prevention education efforts have statistically significant and
   negative effects on the numbers of wildfires ignited by debris burning,
   campfire escapes, smoking, and children. Evaluating the expected
   reductions in wildfire damages given a change in wildfire prevention
   education efforts from current levels showed that marginal benefits
   exceed marginal costs statewide by an average of 35-fold. The benefits
   exceeded costs in the fire management regions by 10- to 99-fold,
   depending on assumptions about how wildfire prevention education
   spending is allocated to these regions. FOR. SCI. 56(2):181-192.}},

Abstract = {{In view of their potential applications in sandwich structures, there
   has been increasing interest in honeycomb networks. Several different
   types of honeycomb systems have been proposed each exhibiting different
   mechanical properties. Here we propose a new hexagonal honeycomb
   structure composed of two different geometrical features: a re-entrant
   feature which is known to generate auxetic behavior, and a non
   re-entrant feature found in regular hexagonal honeycombs which leads to
   conventional behavior. This results in a ``semi re-entrant honeycomb''
   built of alternate conventional and auxetic layers. Finite element
   analysis and analytical modeling of these honeycombs show that they
   exhibit a zero Poisson ratio in one direction and a higher than normal
   Young's modulus in the orthogonal direction. We also show that by virtue
   of its zero Poisson's ratio, this honeycomb has a natural tendency to
   form cylindrical shaped curvatures, something which is very difficult to
   achieve with conventional or auxetic honeycombs.}},

Title = {{Inference concerning a common dispersion of several treatment groups in

Abstract = {{Over/underdispersed count data arise in many biostatistical practices in
   which a number of different treatment groups are compared in an
   experiment. In the analysis of several treatment groups of such count
   data, a very common statistical inference problem is to test whether
   these data come from the same population. The usual practice for testing
   homogeneity of several treatment groups in terms of means and
   dispersions is first to test the equality of dispersions and then to
   test the equality of the means based on the result of the test for
   equality of dispersions. Previous studies reported test procedures for
   testing the homogeneity of the means of several treatment groups with an
   assumption of equal or unequal dispersions. This article develops test
   procedures for testing the validity of the equal or unequal dispersions
   assumption of several treatment groups in the analysis of
   over/underdispersed count data. We consider the C() test based on the
   maximum likelihood (ML) method using the negative binomial model as well
   as the three other C() tests based on the method of moments, extended
   quasi-likelihood, and double extended quasi-likelihood using the models
   specified by the first two moments of counts. Monte Carlo simulations
   are then used to study the comparative behavior of these C() tests along
   with the likelihood ratio test in terms of size and power. The
   simulation results demonstrate that all four statistics hold the nominal
   level reasonably well in most of the data situations studied here, and
   the C() test based on ML shows some edge in power over the other three
   C() tests. Finally, applications to biostatistical practices are
   analyzed.}},

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Background: The assessment of methods for analyzing over-dispersed zero
   inflated count outcome has received very little or no attention in
   stratified cluster randomized trials. In this study, we performed
   sensitivity analyses to empirically compare eight methods for analyzing
   zero inflated over-dispersed count outcome from the Vitamin D and
   Osteoporosis Study (ViDOS) - originally designed to assess the
   feasibility of a knowledge translation intervention in long-term care
   home setting.
   Method: Forty long-term care (LTC) homes were stratified and then
   randomized into knowledge trans lation (KT) intervention (19 homes) and
   control (21 homes) groups. The homes/clusters were stratified by home
   size (< 250/> = 250) and profit status (profit/non-profit). The outcome
   of this study was number of falls measured at 6-month post-intervention.
   The following methods were used to assess the effect of KT intervention
   on number of falls: i) standard Poisson and negative binomial
   regression; ii) mixed-effects method with Poisson and negative binomial
   distribution; iii) generalized estimating equation (GEE) with Poisson
   and negative binomial; iv) zero inflated Poisson and negative binomial -
   with the latter used as a primary approach. All these methods were
   compared with or without adjusting for stratification.
   Results: A total of 5,478 older people from 40 LTC homes were included
   in this study. The mean (=1) of the number of falls was smaller than the
   variance (=6). Also 72\% and 46\% of the number of falls were zero in
   the control and intervention groups, respectively. The direction of the
   estimated incidence rate ratios (IRRs) was similar for all methods. The
   zero inflated negative binomial yielded the lowest IRRs and narrowest
   95\% confidence intervals when adjusted for stratification compared to
   GEE and mixed-effect methods. Further, the widths of the 95\% confidence
   intervals were narrower when the methods adjusted for stratification
   compared to the same method not adjusted for stratification.
   Conclusion: The overall conclusion from the GEE, mixed-effect and zero
   inflated methods were similar. However, these methods differ in terms of
   effect estimate and widths of the confidence interval.}},

Abstract = {{Reproductive failure has a negative impact on animal production, health
   and welfare and ultimately rural economies. In Ethiopia, the factors
   affecting small ruminant reproductive efficiency are inadequately
   investigated. A cross-sectional survey was done from November, 2010 to
   May, 2011 to investigate risk factors of reproductive failures including
   Toxoplasma gondii infection. Analysis of 1372 sera (787 sheep and 585
   goats) from 409 flocks using ELISA showed high flock (59.7\%) and animal
   (31.8\%) level T gondii seroprevalence. An overall 24.9\% (341/1372)
   annual abortion rate (19.6\% in sheep and 32.0\% in goats) was recorded.
   Animal level T. gondii seroprevalence was significantly associated with
   abortion in Ambo and Ada'a-Liben districts (Odds ratio {[}OR] = 2.31,
   95\% confidence interval {[}CI]: 1.42, 3.76; P = 0.001). Questionnaire
   survey on 199 households of Ambo, Ada'a-Liben and Fentale districts
   revealed high flock level abortion (57.5\%), still birth (28.9\%) and
   neonatal losses (47.9\%), which are significantly different between
   study districts (P < 0.001). Multivariable logistic regression model
   showed that species (goat), large flock size, pastoral and agro-pastoral
   production systems, drinking water from river and stagnant water bodies,
   grazing/browsing in plain land and extensive management were significant
   predictors of flock level reproductive failures. In the final Zero
   inflated Poisson regression model number of abortions was significantly
   higher in goat than in sheep flocks (Incidence risk ratio {[}IRR] =
   1.42, 95\% CI: 1.08, 1.87; P = 0.012). It is also significantly higher
   in pastoral (IRR = 1.81, 95\% CI: 1.16, 2.83; P = 0.008) and
   agro-pastoral production systems (IRR = 1.94, 95\% CI: 1.32, 2.86; P =
   0.001) than in sedentary production system. Prevention of toxoplasmosis,
   improved husbandry practices and further epidemiological studies to
   identify causes of reproductive failures are recommended. (C) 2013

Journal = {{BIOMETRICS}},
Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{59}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{254-262}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Whenever inference for variance components is required, the choice
   between one-sided and two-sided tests is crucial. This choice is usually
   driven by whether or not negative variance components are permitted. For
   two-sided tests, classical inferential procedures can be followed, based
   on likelihood ratios, score statistics, or Wald statistics. For
   one-sided tests, however, one-sided test statistics need to be
   developed, and their null distribution derived. While this has received
   considerable attention in the context of the likelihood ratio test,
   there appears to be much confusion about the related problem for the
   score test. The aim of this paper is to illustrate that classical
   (two-sided) score test statistics, frequently advocated in practice,
   cannot be used in this context, but that well-chosen one-sided
   counterparts could be used instead. The relation with likelihood ratio
   tests will be established, and all results are illustrated in an
   analysis of continuous longitudinal data using linear mixed models.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the formation and dynamics of ion thermal double layers

   By using the hydrodynamic and Poisson equations for the two ion species,
   a modified Korteweg-de Vries equation (mKdV) has been derived. The mKdV
   equation admits double layer solution. It is found that ITDLs profile is
   significantly affected by the presence of positively/negatively charged
   dust impurities. Also, the temperature ratio between the
   negative-to-positive ions plays an important role in deciding the
   polarity of the ITDLs. In the dust free case, the system supports only
   rarefactive double layers for any possible values of the temperature
   ratio. This investigation can be useful for future research on pair-ion

Abstract = {{Using density functional theory (DFT), we have studied the effect of

Abstract = {{This paper presents an analysis of the effect of temperature rise and
   hydrostatic pressure on microbending loss, refractive index change, and
   stress components of a double-coated optical fiber by considering
   coating material parameters such as Young's modulus and the Poisson

   It is shown that, when temperature rises, the microbending loss and
   refractive index changes would decrease with increase of thickness of
   primary coating layer and will increase after passing through a minima.
   Increase of thickness of secondary coating layer causes the microbending
   loss and refractive index changes to decrease.
   We have shown that the temperature rise affecting the fiber makes the
   microbending loss and refractive index decrease, linearly. At a
   particular temperature, the microbending loss takes negative values, due
   to tensile pressure applied on the fiber.
   The increase of Young's modulus and the Poisson ratio of primary coating
   would lower the microbending loss and refractive index change whereas in
   the secondary coating layer, the condition reverses. (c) 2007 Elsevier

Title = {{Mechanical performance of additively manufactured meta-biomaterials}},
Journal = {{ACTA BIOMATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{85}},
Pages = {{41-59}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Additive manufacturing (AM) (=3D printing) and rational design
   techniques have enabled development of meta-biomaterials with
   unprecedented combinations of mechanical, mass transport, and biological
   properties. Such meta-biomaterials are usually topologically ordered and
   are designed by repeating a number of regular unit cells in different
   directions to create a lattice structure. Establishing accurate
   topology-property relationships is of critical importance for these
   materials. In this paper, we specifically focus on AM metallic
   meta-biomaterials aimed for application as bone substitutes and
   orthopaedic implants and review the currently available evidence
   regarding their mechanical performance under quasi-static and cyclic
   loading conditions. The topology-property relationships are reviewed for
   regular beam-based lattice structures, sheet-based lattice structures
   including those based on triply periodic minimal surface, and graded
   designs. The predictive models used for establishing the topology
   property relationships including analytical and computational models are
   covered as well. Moreover, we present an overview of the effects of the
   AM processes, material type, tissue regeneration, biodegradation,
   surface bio-functionalization, post-manufacturing (heat) treatments, and
   loading profiles on the quasi-static mechanical properties and fatigue
   behavior of AM meta-biomaterials. AM meta-biomaterials exhibiting
   unusual mechanical properties such as negative Poisson's ratios (auxetic
   meta-biomaterials), shape memory behavior, and superelasitcity as well
   as the potential applications of such unusual behaviors (e.g. deployable
   implants) are presented too. The paper concludes with some suggestions
   for future research.
   Statement of Significance
   Additive manufacturing enables fabrication of meta-biomaterials with
   rare combinations of topological, mechanical, and mass transport
   properties. Given that the micro-scale topological design determines the
   macro-scale properties of meta-biomaterials, establishing
   topology-property relationships is the central research question when
   rationally designing meta-biomaterials. The interest in understanding
   the relationship between the topological design and material type on the
   one hand and the mechanical properties and fatigue behavior of
   meta-biomaterials on the other hand is currently booming. This paper
   presents and critically evaluates the most important trends and findings
   in this area with a special focus on the metallic biomaterials used for
   skeletal applications to enable researchers better understand the
   current state-of-the-art and to guide the design of future research
   projects. (C) 2018 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Two new graphene allotropes, penta-graphene and phagraphene, have been
   proposed recently with unique electronic properties, e.g. quasi-direct
   band gap, direction-dependent Dirac cones and tunable Fermi velocities.
   However, their mechanical properties have not been fully studied yet. In
   this work, we have performed extensive density functional theory
   calculations to evaluate the mechanical properties of these two
   materials and compared with graphene, graphane, and pentaheptite. Our
   simulations show that the ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and the strain
   corresponding to UTS in both penta-graphene and phagraphene are smaller
   than that of graphene. A complete set of nonlinear anisotropic elastic
   constants up to the fourth order have been determined for these two
   allotropes using the tenets of continuum mechanics by fitting the
   stress-strain responses under uniaxial and biaxial tension until the
   point of fracture. We propose a new physical explanation for
   penta-graphene's negative Poisson's ratio based on the atomic
   de-wrinkling mechanism, driven by the local Hellman-Feynman force on
   each atom. Additionally, we used charge density plot and virtual
   Scanning Tunneling Microscopy images to analyze the initiation of
   fracture under uniaxial and biaxial tensile loading in these two
   materials. The charge density plots reveal that the charge density in
   sp(3) bonds is lower than that in the sp(2) bonds. In phagraphene, all
   the broken bonds were found to belong to the largest carbon ring in the
   structure.}},

Abstract = {{This paper analyzes the structural and acoustic behavior of sandwich
   beams with a chiral truss-core. This particular core configuration is
   considered to exploit some of the unique properties of the chiral
   geometry and to explore their potential benefits in terms of
   sound-transmission reduction and vibration isolation. The chiral core is
   composed of circular elements or nodes, joined by ligaments or ribs. The
   arrangement of nodes and ribs is such that chiral assemblies exhibit
   in-plane negative Poisson's ratio behavior as well as unique deformation
   patterns. The vibroacoustic performance of the considered beams is
   evaluated through a numerical model, formulated by employing dynamic
   shape functions derived directly from the distributed parameter model of
   beam elements. This formulation allows an accurate evaluation of the
   dynamic response of the considered structures at high frequencies with a
   limited number of elements. Furthermore, such a numerical model can be
   coupled with a Fourier-transform-based analysis of the sound radiated by
   the structure in a surrounding fluid medium. The structural-acoustic
   behavior of the proposed beams is investigated in terms of kinetic
   energy of the constraining layers and sound pressure levels
   corresponding to an incident pressure wave. A sensitivity study
   investigates the influence of core configuration and geometry on the
   beam performance. Moreover the performance of the chiral core is
   compared to that of cores with ``square{''} and hexagonal topologies.
   The results demonstrate the design flexibility offered by the proposed
   core design, whose configuration is defined by a number of independent
   parameters that can be modified and optimized to enhance the
   structural-acoustic performance of the beam.}},

Volume = {{73}},

Abstract = {{Statistical tolerance intervals for discrete distributions are widely
   employed for assessing the magnitude of discrete characteristics of
   interest in applications like quality control, environmental monitoring,
   and the validation of medical devices. For such data problems,
   characterizing extreme counts or outliers is also of considerable
   interest. These applications typically use traditional discrete
   distributions, like the Poisson, binomial, and negative binomial. The
   discrete Pareto distribution is an alternative yet flexible model for
   count data that are heavily right-skewed. Our contribution is the
   development of statistical tolerance limits for the discrete Pareto
   distribution as a strategy for characterizing the extremeness of
   observed counts in the tail. We discuss the coverage probabilities of
   our procedure in the broader context of known coverage issues for
   statistical intervals for discrete distributions. We address this issue
   by applying a bootstrap calibration to the confidence level of the
   asymptotic confidence interval for the discrete Pareto distribution's
   parameter. We illustrate our procedure on a dataset involving cyst
   formation in mice kidneys.}},

Abstract = {{We report the nonaqueous synthesis of Cd(CN)(2) by oxidation of cadmium
   metal with Hg(CN)(2) in liquid ammonia. The reaction proceeds via an
   intermediate of composition Cd(NH3)(2){[}Cd(CN)(4)], which converts to
   Cd(CN)(2) on prolonged heating. Powder X-ray diffraction measurements
   allow us to determine the crystal structure of the previously-unreported
   Cd(NH3)(2){[}Cd(CN)(4)], which we find to adopt a twofold
   interpenetrating PtS topology. We discuss the effect of partial
   oxidation on the Cd/Hg composition of this intermediate, as well as its
   implications for the reconstructive nature of the deammination process.
   Variable-temperature X-ray diffraction measurements allow us to
   characterise the anisotropic negative thermal expansion (NTE) behaviour
   of Cd(NH3)(2){[}Cd(CN)(4)] together with the effect of Cd/Hg
   substitution; ab initio density functional theory (DFT) calculations
   reveal a similarly anomalous mechanical response in the form of both
   negative linear compressibility (NLC) and negative Poisson's ratios.}},

Title = {{3D-Printed highly stretchable conducting polymer electrodes for flexible
   supercapacitors}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A}},
Abstract = {{Recent advances in the development of wearable, implantable, and
   bio-integrated electronic devices have increased the demand for
   stretchable and flexible energy storage devices that can deliver high
   degrees of mechanical deformability. However, the fabrication of fully
   flexible electronics with both satisfactory electrochemical performance
   and mechanical stretchability remains a significant technological
   hurdle. In this work, by synergistically combining theoretical
   structural design and 3D printing, additive-free free-standing
   stretchable electrodes with different negative Poisson's ratio (NPR)
   structures have been developed based on a
   poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) ink.
   Through tensile tests and finite element analyses (FEA), the stretchable
   electrode with a well-designed arc-shaped NPR structure can effectively
   reduce the peak strain, resulting in excellent flexibility (up to 180
   degrees) and stretchability (maximum elongation 150\%). Through further
   integration of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), the 3D printed hybrid
   polymer/CNT electrode exhibits enhanced electrochemical performance with
   a high area capacitance of 990 mF cm(-2). The as-fabricated
   quasi-solid-state symmetric supercapacitor not only achieves a
   satisfactory energy density and maintains excellent capacitance
   retention of 74.7\% after 14 000 cycles, but also shows promising
   mechanical properties by maintaining stable power output even when being
   extremely deformed. The strategy proposed here offers promising
   opportunities in developing novel deformable electrodes for integrated
   wearable energy storage devices in various applications.}},

Abstract = {{The implementation of periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) is one of the
   most important and difficult steps in the computational analysis of
   structures and materials. This is especially true in cases such as
   mechanical metamaterials which typically possess intricate geometries
   and designs which makes finding and implementing the correct PBCs a
   difficult challenge. In this work, we analyze one of the most common
   PBCs implementation technique, as well as implement and validate an
   alternative generic method which is suitable to simulate any possible 2D
   microstructural geometry with a quadrilateral unit cell regardless of
   symmetry and mode of deformation. A detailed schematic of how both these
   methods can be employed to study 3D systems is also presented.}},

Abstract = {{Recent successes of researchers in the fabrication of new carbon
   structures of different morphologies and dimensions open up broad
   prospects for the development of carbon materials with qualitatively new
   properties. Such promising materials are cellular structures (or carbon
   aerogels) that have high deformability, good adsorption and conductivity
   characteristics. In this work, we consider a carbon structure consisting
   of re-entrant honeycomb cells, which allow the structure to be auxetic.
   The stability and deformation behaviour of re-entrant carbon honeycomb
   structures is studied by molecular dynamics simulation. The effect of
   structural parameters on the stability of carbon aerogel is discussed.
   It is shown that structural changes significantly depend on the strain
   rate and the loading direction. At a high strain rate in tension along
   the z-axis, all cells open slightly at the same time. On the contrary,
   at small strain rates, certain cells open, while others almost
   completely collapse, which is expected to result in changes in physical
   properties, for example, in conductivity. During tension along the
   x-axis, a transformation from a re-entrant honeycomb to a traditional
   honeycomb took place.}},

Abstract = {{The space charge model (SCM) relies on the Poisson-Boltzmann (PB)
   equation, and hence on the assumption of negligible ion size effects, to
   calculate the radial distribution of the electrical potential and ionic
   concentrations. The consideration of nanopores and/or high surface
   charge densities demands that we account for the finite ion size. In
   this work, the SCM has been extended by including the ion size effects
   in the modified PB equation, in the transport equations, and in the
   diffusion coefficients, through the Renkin function. The ion size
   effects on the electrokinetic flow through a nanoporous membrane caused
   by a concentration gradient under open circuit and no applied pressure
   gradient conditions have been analyzed. The conditions for the
   observation of the negative anomalous osmosis have also been studied. It
   has been concluded from the calculations that ion size effects decrease
   the average ionic concentrations in the pore solution, reduce the
   absolute values of the average solute flux density and the average
   solution velocity, and increase the absolute value of the membrane
   potential. Since the reduction in the solute flux density is quite
   significant, it is concluded that this extension of the SCM should be
   used, at least, when analyzing permeability measurements.}},

Abstract = {{Control charts based on the Poisson and negative binomial distribution
   for monitoring time series of counts typically arising in the
   surveillance of infectious diseases are presented. The in-control mean
   is assumed to be time-varying and linear on the log-scale with intercept
   and seasonal components. If a shift in the intercept occurs the system
   goes out-of-control. Using the generalized likelihood ratio (GLR)
   statistic a monitoring scheme is formulated to detect on-line whether a
   shift in the intercept occurred. In the case of Poisson the necessary
   quantities of the GLR detector can be efficiently computed by recursive
   formulas. Extensions to more general alternatives e.g. containing an
   auto-regressive epidemic component are discussed. Using Monte Carlo
   simulations run-length properties of the proposed schemes are
   investigated and the Poisson scheme is compared to existing methods. The
   practicability of the charts is demonstrated by applying them to the
   observed number of salmonella hadar cases in Germany 2001-2006. (c) 2008

Journal = {{NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{JUL 6}},
Abstract = {{By using the hydrodynamic equations of positive and negative ions, the
   Boltzmann electron density distribution and the Poisson equation with
   stationary dust, a three-dimensional (3D) Zakharov-Kuznetsov (ZK)
   equation is derived for small but finite amplitude ion-acoustic waves.
   However, the ZK equation is not appropriate to describe the system
   either at critical plasma compositions or in the vicinity of the
   critical plasma compositions. Therefore, the modified ZK (MZK) and
   extended ZK (EZK) equations are derived. The generalized expansion
   method is used to analytically solve the ZK, MZK and EZK equations. A
   new class of solutions that admits a train of well-separated bell-shaped
   periodic pulses is obtained. In certain conditions, the latter
   degenerates to either solitary or shock wave solutions. The effects of
   the physical parameters on the nonlinear structures are examined in many
   plasma environments having different negative ion species, such as D-
   and F-regions of the Earth's ionosphere, as well as in laboratory plasma
   experiments. Numerical analysis of the solutions revealed that the
   profile of the nonlinear pulses suffers amplitude and width
   modifications due to enhancement of the dust practices, negative ions,
   positive-to-negative ion mass ratio and positive/negative ion cyclotron
   frequency. Furthermore, the necessary conditions for both solitons and
   shocks propagation as well as their polarity are examined.}},

Title = {{Food Insecurity and the Negative Impact on Brazilian Children's
   HealthWhy Does Food Security Matter for Our Future Prosperity? Brazilian

Abstract = {{Background: Food insecurity (FI) refers to limited or uncertain access
   to food resulting from financial constraints. Numerous studies have
   shown association between FI and adverse health outcomes among adults
   and children around the world, but in Brazil, such information is
   scarce, especially if referring to nationally representative
   information.
   Objective: To test for an independent association between FI and health
   outcomes.
   Methods: Most recent Brazilian Demographic and Health Survey using
   nationally representative complex probability sampling. Participants
   were 3923 children <5 years of age, each representing a household. Data
   from the validated Brazilian Food Insecurity Scale were dichotomized as
   food secure (food security/mild FI) or food insecure (moderate FI/severe
   FI). Poisson regression was used to test for associations between FI and
   various health indicators.
   Results: Models adjusted for socioeconomic and demographic variables
   showed that children hospitalized for pneumonia or diarrhea were 30\%
   more prevalent in FI households (adjusted prevalence ratio {[}aPR]: 1.3;
   1.1-1.6). Underweight children were 40\% more prevalent in FI households
   (aPR: 1.4; 1.1-1.7). Children who didn't eat meat and fruits and
   vegetables every day were 20\% and 70\% more prevalent in FI households
   (aPR: 1.2; 1.1-1.4 and aPR: 1.7; 1.3-2.3), respectively.
   Conclusion: Children who grow up in food-insecure households have been

Abstract = {{The structural, mechanical, thermodynamic and electronic properties of
   intermetallic compounds Al3Ti and Al3V in L1(2) structure in the
   pressure range of 0-100 GPa have been investigated using
   first-principles method. The calculated structural parameters and energy
   information at ambient pressure are consistent with the available
   experimental and theoretical results. The stability of Al3Ti and Al3V in
   L1(2) structure is checked both by Born's criteria and phonon
   calculation. The values of bulk modulus, shear modulus, Young's modulus,
   hardness, Poisson ratio, anisotropy index, Debye temperature, and wave
   velocities increase with the increasing external pressure. The compound
   Al3V in L1(2)structure possesses interesting properties, including
   ductility in low pressure region (up to 20 GPa) but weakly brittle
   behavior at high pressures (above 30 GPa) and the minimum value of
   Poisson ratio is negative under high pressure. Finally, the
   pressure-dependence behavior of density of states and charge densities
   are analyzed to explore the bond characteristics and physical origin of
   the pressure effect on the various properties of Al3Ti and Al3V.}},

Abstract = {{We use first-principles method to investigate the effects of external
   strain epsilon on the structural, mechanical and electronic properties
   for the superconductor Nb2InC. The results show that the tensile strain
   induces an isostructural phase transition in Nb2InC. The elastic
   constants C-ij, bulk modulus B, shear modulus G, Young's moduli E, and
   Poisson ratio v(ij) of Nb2InC were also investigated in the range from
   epsilon=-10\% to epsilon=10\%. It indicates that Nb2InC is mechanically
   stable under external strain, and its brittle-ductile transition occurs
   at epsilon=3.5\%. Moreover, Nb2InC gets a negative Poisson ratio at
   epsilon=4\%. The calculated electronic structures indicate that the Nb-C
   bonding is stronger than Nb-In bonding in Nb2InC. The energy band
   structures and densities of states of strained Nb2InC were also
   calculated and discussed in detail. From these calculations, it is clear
   that the related properties of Nb2InC can be easily tuned by strain.
   Therefore, our findings are very useful to tailor the physical
   properties of Nb2InC by using strain engineering. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The combination of cationic lipids with cationic peptides and DNA
   vectors can produce synergistic effects in gene delivery to eukaryotic
   cells. Binary complexes of cationic lipids with DNA are well-studied
   whereas little information is available about the structure of the
   ternary lipid/peptide/DNA (LPD) complexes and mechanisms defining DNA
   protection and delivery. Here we use synchrotron small angle X-ray
   scattering and dynamic light scattering zeta-potential measurements to
   determine structure and the net charge of supramolecular aggregates of
   complexes in mixtures of plasmid DNA, cationic liposomes formed from
   DOTAP, plus a linear cationic epsilon-oligolysine with the pendant
   alpha-amino acids Leu-Tyr-Arg (LYR), epsilon-(LYR)K10. These ternary
   complexes display multilamellar structures with relatively constant
   separation between DOTAP bilayers, accommodating a hydrated monolayer of
   parallel DNA rods. The DNA-DNA distance in the complexes varies as a
   function of the net positive to negative (lipid + peptide)/DNA charge
   ratio. An explanation for the observed dependence of DNA-DNA distance on
   charge ratio was proposed based on general polyelectrolyte properties of
   non-stoichiometric polycation-DNA mixtures. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Estimating numbers of undiscovered mineral deposits is a fundamental
   part of assessing mineral resources. Some statistical tools can act as
   guides to low variance, unbiased estimates of the number of deposits.
   The primary guide is that the estimates must be consistent with the
   grade and tonnage models. Another statistical guide is the deposit
   density (i.e., the number of deposits per unit area of permissive rock
   in well-explored control areas). Preliminary estimates and confidence
   limits of the number of undiscovered deposits in a tract of given area
   may be calculated using linear regression and refined using frequency
   distributions with appropriate parameters. A Poisson distribution leads
   to estimates having lower relative variances than the regression
   estimates and implies a random distribution of deposits. Coefficients of
   variation are used to compare uncertainties of negative binomial,
   Poisson, or MARK3 empirical distributions that have the same expected
   number of deposits as the deposit density. Statistical guides presented
   here allow simple yet robust estimation of the number of undiscovered
   deposits in permissive terranes.}},

Abstract = {{A complete characterization is given of the possible macroscopic
   deformations of periodic non-linear affine unimode metamaterials
   constructed from rigid bars and pivots. The materials are affine in the
   sense that their macroscopic deformations can only be affine
   deformations: on a local level the deformation may vary from cell to
   cell. Unimode means that macroscopically the material can only deform
   along a one dimensional trajectory in the six dimensional space of
   invariants describing the deformation (excluding translations and
   rotations). We show by explicit construction that any continuous
   trajectory is realizable to an arbitrarily high degree of approximation

Abstract = {{A single primary user cognitive radio system with multiuser diversity at
   the secondary users (SUs) is considered, where there is an interference
   constraint between SUs and the primary receiver. The SU with the highest
   instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio is selected for communication from a
   set of active users, which also satisfies the interference constraint.
   The active number of SUs is shown to be binomial, negative binomial, or
   Poisson-binomial distributed depending on various modes of operation.
   The outage probability in the slow-fading scenario is also studied. This
   is then followed by a derivation of the scaling law of the ergodic
   capacity and bit error rate (BER) averaged across the fading and the
   user distribution for a large mean number of users. The ergodic capacity
   and average BER under the binomial user distribution are shown to
   outperform the negative binomial case with the same mean number of
   users. Moreover, the Poisson distribution is used to approximate the
   user distribution under the non-independent and identically distributed
   interference scenario and compared with binomial and negative binomial
   distributions in a stochastic ordering sense. Monte Carlo simulations
   are used to supplement our analytical results and compare the
   performances under different user distributions.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NON-LINEAR MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{129}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents exact solutions for the buckling loads and
   postbuckling states of extensible, shear deformable beams. The governing
   equation for the large-amplitude lateral deformation of beams in
   compression is expanded in Taylor series up to the cubic nonlinearity.
   Closed-form solutions in terms of the axial and shear stiffnesses are
   developed for statically determinate and statically indeterminate beams.
   Namely, pinned-pinned, cantilevered, clamped-clamped, and clamped-pinned
   beams are considered with the loaded end is a roller that is able to
   slide. The postbuckling response under a given axial load is exactly
   derived. The dependence of the buckling load on the length-to-radius of
   gyration is discussed. It is shown that the extensibility and the shear
   deformation significantly affect the buckling loads and the postbuckling
   response. For conventional materials with positive Poisson's ratio, the
   inclusion of the axial and shear deformation results in a meaningful
   reduction of the buckling load. It is further shown that the buckling
   load can be enhanced by designing artificial metamaterials materials
   with an effective negative Poisson's ratio.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the energy absorption properties of hexagonal
   honeycomb structures of varying cellular geometries to high speed
   in-plane impact. While the impact responses in terms of energy
   absorption and densification strains have been extensively researched
   and reported, a gap is identified in the generalization of honeycombs
   with controlled and varying geometric parameters. This paper attempts to
   address this gap through a series of finite element (FE) simulations
   where cell angle and angled wall thickness are varied while maintaining
   a constant mass of the honeycomb structure. A randomly filled,
   non-repeating Design of Experiments (DOE) is generated to determine the
   effects of these geometric parameters on the output of energy absorbed,
   and a statistical sensitivity analysis is used to determine the
   parameters significant for optimization. A high degree of variation in
   the impact response of varying cellular geometries has shown the
   potential for the forward design into lightweight crushing regions in
   many applications, particularly the automotive and aerospace industries.
   It is found that while an increase in angled wall thickness enhances the
   energy absorption of the structure, increases in either the cell angle
   or ratio of cell angle to angled wall thickness have adverse effects on
   the output. Finally, optimization results present that a positive angle
   cellular geometry with maximum angled wall thickness provides for
   maximum energy absorption, which is verified with a 6\% error when
   compared to a final FE simulation.}},

Month = {{JUL 15}},
Abstract = {{Hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites (HOIPs) have attracted significant
   attention in recent years attributed to their outstanding physical
   properties and striking application potentials in the fields of
   photovoltaic and optoelectronic devices. For the commercialization of
   devices employing hybrid perovskite materials, their mechanical
   properties critically influence the manufacturing, processing as well as
   the device durability, and hence need to be well understood. In this
   review, we summarize recent mechanical studies of the known HOIPs.
   Firstly, we present a comprehensive account of the relationship between
   crystal structures and properties, where the influence of different
   chemical and bonding factors on the load response of HOIPs are
   extensively discussed. The functional abnormalities of HOIP materials
   under the stress stimuli are also reviewed, addressing the effects of
   negative linear compressibility, negative Poisson's ratio and
   barocaloric effect. Finally, we briefly summarize the significant effect
   of strain and stress in thin-film halide perovskite materials, which
   have been widely employed in solar cells and Light-emitting diodes. This
   review aims to raise more awareness about the fundamental understanding
   of the mechanical properties of hybrid perovskite materials, and attract
   more research attention to this interdisciplinary field. (C) 2019

Title = {{Some Alternatives in the Statistical Analysis of Sickness Absence}},
Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{52}},
Number = {{10}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Purpose Sickness absence (SA) is a commonly used outcome in occupational
   health cohort studies. Without the use of statistical techniques that
   take into account that SA is a recurrent event, the probability of
   obtaining biased estimates of the effects related to SA is very high.
   The objective of this article is to examine the application of marginal
   models, comparing them to count-based models, when the outcome of
   interest is SA.
   Methods By re-sampling the data of a reference study, 1,000 samples of
   1,200 individuals were generated. In each of these samples, the
   coefficients of two factors were estimated by fitting various models:
   Poisson, Negative Binomial, standard Cox model for a first occurrence,
   Andersen-Gill and Prentice-Williams-Peterson.
   Results In general, differences among the models are observed in the
   estimates of variances and coefficients, as well as in their
   distribution. Specifically, the Poisson model estimates the greatest
   effect for both coefficients (IRR = 1.17 and IRR = 1.60), and the
   Prentice-Williams-Peterson the least effect (HR = 1.01 and HR = 1.26).
   Conclusions Whenever possible, the instantaneous form of analysis should
   be used for occurrences of a recurrent event. Collection of study data
   should be organized in order to permit recording of the most complete
   information possible, particularly regarding event occurrences. This
   should allow the presence of within-individual heterogeneity and/or
   occurrence dependency to be studied, and would further permit the most
   appropriate model to be chosen. When there is occurrence dependence, the
   choice of a model using the specific baseline hazard seems to be
   appropriate. Am. J. Ind. Med. 52:811-816, 2009. (C) 2009 Wiley-Liss,

Abstract = {{The uniqueness of the complementarity determining region III (CDRIII)
   has been utilized successfully in the last decade for development of a
   patient specific, molecular, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assay
   for determining minimal residual disease in various lymphoid
   malignancies. There are various approaches for carrying out this test.
   i) CDRIII primers are used to amplify the corresponding DNA from the
   same patient and quantitation of the amplified CDRIII bands is done by
   generation a standard curve of known amounts of purified patient's tumor
   DNA, followed by a linear regression analysis to quantitate the results.
   ii) CDRIII primers are used to amplify a serially-diluted patient's
   sample (unknown), with replicate points. According to Poisson equation,
   replicate points in each dilution can be either all positive, all
   negative, or `mixed', negative and positive. The quantitation, according
   to this approach is done by determination of the dilution point where
   there are `mixed' lanes plus the flanking `all negative' and `all
   positive' lanes, assuming that the test can always detect one tumor cell
   in 100,000 cells. In this communication we show evidence that the use of
   the Poisson method can lead to an underestimation of the amount of tumor
   cells, due to the great variability in the priming and amplification
   among the various CDRIII primers. This variation is inherent to the
   size, C/G ratio, melting point of each primer, etc. In a simulated
   statistical model we show that the magnitude of error in the Poisson
   method could reach 1-2 logs. In contrast, using the standard curve for
   each patient and regression analysis eliminate these problems.}},

Title = {{Mathematical simulation of elastoplastic deformation in cubic materials
   with an account of anisotropic bulk compressibility}},
Journal = {{MATHEMATICS AND MECHANICS OF SOLIDS}},
Abstract = {{It was shown for the first time that when modelling the deformation of
   materials with cubic symmetry (at full stress), the rotation of the
   computational axes leads to the identification of anisotropic volumetric
   compressibility. Loading of the materials with cubic symmetry of
   properties in the directions not coincided with the main directions (for
   example, 011) allows one to detect 75\% cases of the auxetic single
   crystals (i.e. with negative Poisson's ratio). In these cases, the
   negative volumetric compressibility has anisotropy, in contrast to the
   volumetric compressibility calculated along the crystallographic axes
   for cubic materials. Anisotropy of the volumetric compressibility leads
   to anisotropy of velocities of propagation of body waves. This paper
   considers several elastoplastic problems for a cubic material with
   different orientations of a coordinate system about its crystallographic
   axes. The behaviour of such a material under dynamic loads is modelled
   with an account of anisotropic bulk compressibility to provide the same
   anisotropy of bulk wave velocities in the elastic and plastic ranges and
   a uniform pressure function at the elastic-to-plastic strain transition.
   For each orientation of the coordinate system and respective planes,
   different values at the indicatrices of elastic constants are specified,
   and this specifies different deformation processes in cubic materials.
   Such an effect is demonstrated by solving three problems in
   three-dimensional (3D) statements approximating the following processes:
   (1) one-dimensional elastoplastic deformation in a thin target impacted
   by a thin plate; (2) uniform compression in a spherical body under
   pulsed hydrostatic pressure; and (3) 3D elastoplastic deformation in a
   cylindrical body striking a rigid target in view of anisotropic bulk
   compressibility. The problems were solved numerically using original
   programs based on the finite element method modified by GR Johnson for
   impact problems. Solving problems in a 3D formulation makes it possible
   to take into account the dependences of the direction of the elastic and
   plastic characteristics of the material, as well as the velocities of
   propagation of elastic and plastic waves from that direction. The
   simulation results suggest that for cubic materials, changing the
   orientation of two coordinate axes in a plane changes the strains along
   all three axes, including those perpendicular to this plane. It is
   concluded that anisotropic bulk compressibility in cubic materials
   should be allowed for by mathematical models of their elastic and
   plastic deformation. We demonstrate that the orientation of a
   computational coordinate system for cubic materials should be in those
   directions in which their deformation is analysed in each particular
   case.}},

Abstract = {{We study the rank-frequency distribution of syllables in texts from
   written press in Bamana and Guinean Maninka, two closely related
   languages from the Manding group of the Mande family in West Africa.
   Five issues of widely circulating newspapers are analyzed in each
   language. The Bamana texts are written in a Roman-based alphabet without
   marking of tones, while Maninka texts are published in the N'ko alphabet
   comprising a superficial notation of tones. For the sake of comparisons,
   the Maninka data are also compiled for syllables with tonal distinctions
   neglected. The obtained rank-frequency distributions of syllables are
   fitted using two discrete distributions, Jain-Poisson and positive
   negative binomial, as well as the continuous Yule distribution. In most
   cases, a satisfactory fit was achieved, with the determination
   coefficient R-2 > 0.95 and discrepancy coefficient C < 0.02. The
   relation of the Yule distribution and Zipf's law with respect to the
   number of syllable types is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{We consider a problem of identification of nuclides from weak and poorly
   resolved spectra. A two stage algorithm is proposed and tested based on
   the principle of majority voting. The idea is to model gamma-ray counts
   as Poisson processes. Then, the average part is taken to be the model
   and the difference between the observed gamma-ray counts and the average
   is considered as random noise. In the linear part, the unknown
   coefficients correspond to if isotopes of interest are present or
   absent. Lasso types of algorithms are applied to find non-vanishing
   coefficients. Since lasso or any prediction error based algorithm is
   inconsistent with variable selection for finite data length, an estimate
   of parameter distribution based on subsampling techniques is added in
   addition to Lasso. Simulation examples are provided in which the
   traditional peak detection algorithms fail to work and the proposed two
   stage algorithm performs well in terms of both the False Negative and
   False Positive errors. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Do alternative methods for analysing count data produce similar
   estimates? Implications for meta-analyses}},
Journal = {{SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{4}},
Abstract = {{Background: Many randomised trials have count outcomes, such as the
   number of falls or the number of asthma exacerbations. These outcomes
   have been treated as counts, continuous outcomes or dichotomised and
   analysed using a variety of analytical methods. This study examines
   whether different methods of analysis yield estimates of intervention
   effect that are similar enough to be reasonably pooled in a
   meta-analysis.
   Methods: Data were simulated for 10,000 randomised trials under three
   different amounts of overdispersion, four different event rates and two
   effect sizes. Each simulated trial was analysed using nine different
   methods of analysis: rate ratio, Poisson regression, negative binomial
   regression, risk ratio from dichotomised data, survival to the first
   event, two methods of adjusting for multiple survival times, ratio of
   means and ratio of medians. Individual patient data was gathered from
   eight fall prevention trials, and similar analyses were undertaken.
   Results: All methods produced similar effect sizes when there was no
   difference between treatments. Results were similar when there was a
   moderate difference with two exceptions when the event became more
   common: (1) risk ratios computed from dichotomised count outcomes and
   hazard ratios from survival analysis of the time to the first event
   yielded intervention effects that differed from rate ratios estimated
   from the negative binomial model (reference model) and (2) the precision
   of the estimates differed depending on the method used, which may affect
   both the pooled intervention effect and the observed heterogeneity.
   The results of the case study of individual data from eight trials
   evaluating exercise programmes to prevent falls in older people
   supported the simulation study findings.
   Conclusions: Information about the differences in treatments is lost
   when event rates increase and the outcome is dichotomised or time to the
   first event is analysed otherwise similar results are obtained. Further
   research is needed to examine the effect of differing variances from the
   different methods on the confidence intervals of pooled estimates.}},

Abstract = {{We developed an algorithm for simulating the effects of potential bag

   fishery.  The catch with the bag limit is calculated by censoring the
   simulated distribution.  We establish the conditions under which
   compounded Poisson distributions, such as the negative binomial, can be
   expected to provide adequate models for the catch distributions of
   recreational fisheries.  We also discuss the assumptions that underlie
   the method of censoring catch-per-trip distributions, and, where
   appropriate, suggest alternative models.  An example is developed in
   which we use the negative binomial distribution to model catch per trip
   and the familiar exponential model to simulate the change in stock
   abundance due to fishing mortality.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, a 3D printed modular soft gripper with highly conformal
   soft fingers was developed. A soft auxetic structure with compliant ribs
   is 3D printed simultaneously with each soft pneumatic finger for
   conformal grasping. The fingers of the soft gripper were printed
   monolithically, without requiring support material and postprocessing,
   using a low-cost and open-source fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D
   printer that employs a commercially available thermoplastic polyurethane
   (TPU). The soft fingers of the gripper were optimized using finite
   element modeling (FEM). The FE simulations accurately predicted the
   performance of the fingers in terms of deformation and blocked force.
   Also, FEM was used to predict the behavior of the auxetic structure and
   its compliant ribs to prove that it highly decreases the contact
   pressure by increasing the contact area between the soft fingers and the
   grasped objects. The contact pressure can be decreased by up to 8 times
   with the implementation of the auxetic structure. Also, the
   configuration of the highly conformal gripper can be easily modulated by
   changing the number of fingers attached to its base to tailor it for
   specific manipulation tasks. A wide variety of objects with different
   weights, shapes, sizes, textures and stiffnesses can be grasped using

Title = {{A Note on the Inverse Birthday Problem With Applications}},
Journal = {{AMERICAN STATISTICIAN}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{71}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{191-201}},
Abstract = {{The classical birthday problem considers the probability that at least
   two people in a group of size N share the same birthday. The inverse
   birthday problem considers the estimation of the size N of a group given
   the number of different birthdays in the group. In practice, this
   problem is analogous to estimating the size of a population from
   occurrence data only. The inverse problem can be solved via two simple
   approaches including the method of moments for a multinominal model and
   the maximum likelihood estimate of a Poisson model, which we present in
   this study. We investigate properties of both methods and show that they
   can yield asymptotically equivalent Wald-type interval estimators.
   Moreover, we show that these methods estimate a lower bound for the
   population size when birth rates are nonhomogenous or individuals in the
   population are aggregated. A simulation study was conducted to evaluate
   the performance of the point estimates arising from the two approaches
   and to compare the performance of seven interval estimators, including
   likelihood ratio and log-transformation methods. We illustrate the
   utility of these methods by estimating: (1) the abundance of tree
   species over a 50-hectare forest plot, (2) the number of Chlamydia
   infections when only the number of different birthdays of the patients
   is known, and (3) the number of rainy days when the number of rainy
   weeks is known. Supplementary materials for this article are available

Title = {{Generalised count distributions for modelling parity}},
Journal = {{DEMOGRAPHIC RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{36}},
Pages = {{745-758}},
Month = {{MAR 14}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND
   Parametric count distributions customarily used in demography - the
   Poisson and negative binomial models - do not offer satisfactory
   descriptions of empirical distributions of completed cohort parity. One
   reason is that they cannot model variance-to-mean ratios below unity,
   i.e., underdispersion, which is typical of low-fertility parity
   distributions. Statisticians have recently revived two generalised count
   distributions that can model both over-and underdispersion, but they
   have not attracted demographers' attention to date.
   OBJECTIVE
   The objective of this paper is to assess the utility of these
   alternative general count distributions, namely the
   Conway-Maxwell-Poisson and gamma count models, for the modeling of
   distributions of completed parity.
   METHODS
   Simulations and maximum-likelihood estimation are used to assess their
   fit to empirical data from the Human Fertility Database (HFD).
   RESULTS
   The results show that the generalised count distributions offer a
   dramatically improved fit compared to customary Poisson and negative
   binomial models in the presence of underdispersion, without performance
   loss in the case of equidispersion or overdispersion.
   CONCLUSIONS
   This gain in accuracy suggests generalised count distributions should be
   used as a matter of course in studies of fertility that examine
   completed parity as an outcome.
   CONTRIBUTION
   This note performs a transfer of the state of the art in count data
   modelling and regression in the more technical statistical literature to
   the field of demography, allowing demographers to benefit from more
   accurate estimation in fertility research.}},

Title = {{Overcome of bed-joint imperfections and improvement of actual contact in
   dry-stacked masonry}},
Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{233}},
Month = {{FEB 10}},
Abstract = {{Several researchers studied dry-stacked masonry walls (DSM) and inferred
   that the actual contact surface between the different block rows and the
   compressive strength in such walls are reduced by bed-joint
   imperfections as well as by height differences between different masonry
   blocks leading both to high stress concentration. This paper
   concentrates on the first type on imperfections. Through experimental
   tests, it analyses the influence of bed-joint roughness on the load
   bearing capacity and investigates a strategy to improve the load-bearing
   capacity of DSM by placing an additional horizontal layer on the top
   face of raw masonry blocks. First, different contact layers using
   conventional and auxetic materials were applied. Then 20 dry-stacked
   masonry prisms built with raw and improved masonry blocks were tested
   under axial compressive load until failure. Prescale Fujifilm strips
   were used to measure the actual contact in the bed-joints. Experimental
   tests show that the use of a contact layer with well-defined material
   properties enables firstly to increase the actual contact area in the
   bed-joints from 23\% to 98\% of the nominal contact area and secondly to
   increase the load-bearing capacity by 14-97\%. In addition, the contact
   layer with an auxetic material shows a significant capacity in altering
   the lateral expansion in the block units. The outcomes show that
   although the bed joint roughness influences the stress distribution in a
   dry-stacked masonry block, a contact layer with well-defined material
   properties enables to overcome the roughness induced by the bed-joint
   imperfections. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{SEP-OCT}},
Abstract = {{In an effort to quantitatively examine the effect of coupling between
   multiple relaxation modes, a new model involving two coupled Maxwell
   modes is developed as a generalization of the upper-convected Maxwell
   and the Giesekus models. The model contains, in addition to the
   parameters inherent to a Maxwell model with two uncoupled modes (i.e.,
   lambda(1),lambda(2) and eta(1) = G(1) lambda(1), eta(2) = G(2)
   lambda(2)), a dimensionless coupling coefficient theta that multiplies a
   quadratic coupling term. In the two characteristic limits theta = 0 or
   (eta(1),lambda(1)) = (eta(2),lambda(2)), the Maxwell model with two
   uncoupled relaxation modes or the Giesekus constitutive model is
   obtained, respectively. The rheological behavior of the model is
   investigated in the linear and nonlinear deformation-rate regimes.
   Calculation of the linear viscoelastic behavior shows that the linear
   stress relaxation modulus is the sum of two decaying exponentials with
   characteristic times and preexponential factors that are quite different
   from lambda(1), lambda(2) and G(1), G(2), respectively. In slow, slowly
   varying flows, the zero shear-rate ratio Psi(2)(0)/Psi(1)(0) assumes
   small negative values when theta takes on small positive values. The
   nonlinear rheological behavior of the model is examined under the
   imposition of shear and extensional flow fields, from both a
   steady-state and transient perspective. The qualitative behavior
   observed is remarkably rich in describing the experimental trends seen
   in polymer melts and Boger fluids for a constant value of theta
   approximate to 0.1. (C) 1996 Society of Rheology.}},

Abstract = {{We analyze the steady-state behavior of a general mathematical model for
   reversible galvanic cells, such as redox flow cells, reversible solid
   oxide fuel cells, and rechargeable batteries. We consider not only
   operation in the galvanic discharging mode, spontaneously generating a
   positive current against an external load, but also operation in two
   modes which require a net input of electrical energy: (i) the
   electrolytic charging mode, where a negative current is imposed to
   generate a voltage exceeding the open-circuit voltage, and (ii) the
   ``super-galvanic{''} discharging mode, where a positive current
   exceeding the short-circuit current is imposed to generate a negative
   voltage. Analysis of the various (dis-) charging modes of galvanic cells
   is important to predict the efficiency of electrical to chemical energy
   conversion and to provide sensitive tests for experimental validation of
   fuel cell models. In the model, we consider effects of diffuse charge on
   electrochemical charge-transfer rates by combining a generalized
   Frumkin-Butler-Volmer equation for reaction kinetics across the compact
   Stern layer with the full Poisson-Nernst-Planck transport theory,
   without assuming local electroneutrality. Since this approach is rare in
   the literature, we provide a brief historical review. To illustrate the
   general theory, we present results for a monovalent binary electrolyte,
   consisting of cations, which react at the electrodes, and non-reactive
   anions, which are either fixed in space (as in a solid electrolyte) or
   are mobile (as in a liquid electrolyte). The full model is solved
   numerically and compared to analytical results in the limit of thin
   diffuse layers, relative to the membrane thickness. The spatial profiles
   of the ion concentrations and electrostatic potential reveal a complex
   dependence on the kinetic parameters and the imposed current, in which
   the diffuse charge at each electrode and the total membrane charge can
   have either sign, contrary perhaps to intuition. For thin diffuse
   layers, simple analytical expressions are presented for galvanic cells
   valid in all three (dis-)charging modes in the two subsequent limits of
   the ratio delta of the effective thicknesses of the compact and diffuse
   layers: (i) the ``Helmholtz limit{''} (delta ->infinity) where the
   compact layer carries the double layer voltage as in standard
   Butler-Volmer models, and (ii) the opposite ``Gouy-Chapman limit{''}
   (delta -> 0) where the diffuse layer fully determines the
   charge-transfer kinetics. In these limits, the model predicts both
   reaction-limited and diffusion-limited currents, which can be surpassed
   for finite positive values of the compact layer, diffuse layer and
   membrane thickness. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper double-diffusive mixed convection in a heated lid driven
   cavity has been studied numerically using a finite element base code.
   Double-diffusive convection phenomenon is observed in many process
   industrial applications where essentially hot air is used to remove
   moisture or to aid any other process. In the current problem numerical
   investigations have been conducted on double-diffusive convection in a
   hot lid driven cavity with mass diffusive side walls. Galerkin's
   weighted residual method has been implemented to reduce the governing
   equations, namely vorticity transport, velocity, Poisson, energy, and
   solutal equations into weak form. Results have been obtained for
   different parameters like Reynolds number ranging from 100 to 500,
   Richardson number ranging from 0.1 to 3.0, and buoyancy ratio 50 to +50.
   Results show that an increase in Richardson number increased heat
   transfer rates when operated in a positive buoyancy ratio regime and the
   transverse is observed when operated in a negative regime. Increase in
   strength of buoyancy forces s to formation of a number of secondary

   improved convective heat transfer rate from lid more effectively when

Title = {{Towards the design of mechanically superior tubular structures for
   microcatheters}},
Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Cardiac catheterization (CC) procedures in children and adults, and
   especially within vasculature of small cross-section comes with the
   increased risk of complications due to acute occlusive arterial injuries
   and (or) thrombosis. Micro-catheters play a vital role in enabling CC
   procedures, however, to extend their functionality beyond large blood
   vessels and into pediatric wards, necessitates superior mechanical
   attributes that are fundamental to their structure. There exists a
   strong correlation between tool footprint and the risk of these
   injuries, nevertheless, changes in tool-size are impeded by mechanical
   constraints and manufacturing. In this paper, we propose pattern
   geometries for tubular structures that can be tuned to obtain desired
   mechanical characteristics, while retaining a minimum tool
   cross-section. We perform numerical simulations to systematically
   investigate the effect of pattern design parameters on the tube's
   properties, and present guidelines for obtaining the preferred behavior.
   The rounded re-entrant honeycomb (RRH) is introduced as the base
   structure for more responsive catheters, and is contrasted with the
   dog-bone geometry (DB), and the conventional slot. Notably, the RRH
   patterned tubes are highly compliant in bending yet strong in torsion
   while the DB tubes are strong in both torsion and bending. Therefore,
   our results indicate positively for a wide-range of tunable behavior in
   patterned tubes, with the RRH poised as a promising alternative for
   achieving the design goals that are introduced.}},

Abstract = {{Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) is often considered as a main
   covariate for predicting crash frequencies at urban and suburban
   intersections. A linear functional form is typically assumed for the
   Safety Performance Function (SPF) to describe the relationship between
   the natural logarithm of expected crash frequency and covariates derived
   from AADTs. Such a linearity assumption has been questioned by many
   researchers. This study applies Generalized Additive Models (GAMS) and
   Piecewise Linear Negative Binomial (PLNB) regression models to fit
   intersection crash data. Various covariates derived from minor-and
   major-approach AADTs are considered. Three different dependent variables
   are modeled, which are total multiple-vehicle crashes, rear-end crashes,
   and angle crashes. The modeling results suggest that a nonlinear
   functional form may be more appropriate. Also, the results show that it
   is important to take into consideration the joint safety effects of
   multiple covariates. Additionally, it is found that the ratio of minor
   to major-approach AADT has a varying impact on intersection safety and
   deserves further investigations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The rational design of mechanical metamaterials has the potential to
   grant them with properties unattainable by bulk materials. This paper
   describes twisting mechanical metamaterials (TMMs), a new class of
   programmable matter whose rationally designed architecture endows them
   with compression-twist coupling, a property absent in conventional
   materials. Upon compression, the cellular architecture of TMMs
   efficiently transforms longitudinal strain into unidirectional or
   bidirectional twisting-free from mechanical frustrations and independent
   of the flexible material chosen to fabricate the TMM. TMMs can be
   rapidly designed using an automated generative algorithm, which enables
   the tailoring of their twisting properties (up to 3.24 degrees twist per
   \% strain) and Poisson's ratio (-0.6 to +1.22) using only two design
   parameters. The scalable architecture of TMMs does not suffer from size
   effects which impair their twist per unit strain. Bidirectional TMMs
   autonomously switch their direction of rotation during uniform
   displacement-controlled compressive loading, conferring them with
   non-interchangeable compression-twist coupling. The capability of TMMs
   to controllably convert translation to rotation blurs the boundary
   between materials and machines, expanding the range of mechanical
   properties currently accessible to 3D printed materials and paving the
   way toward the creation of future programmable matter.}},

Pages = {{217-235}},
Abstract = {{The continuous development of sport technologies constantly demands
   advancements in protective headgear to reduce the risk of head injuries.
   This article introduces new cellular helmet liner designs through two
   approaches. The first approach is the study of energy-absorbing
   biological materials. The second approach is the study of lattices
   comprised of force-diverting compliant mechanisms. On the one hand,
   bio-inspired liners are generated through the study of biological,
   hierarchical materials. An emphasis is given on structures in nature
   that serve similar concussion-reducing functions as a helmet liner.
   Inspiration is drawn from organic and skeletal structures. On the other
   hand, compliant mechanism lattice (CML)-based liners use topology
   optimization to synthesize rubber cellular unit cells with effective
   positive and negative Poisson's ratios. Three lattices are designed
   using different cellular unit cell arrangements, namely, all positive,
   all negative, and alternating effective Poisson's ratios. The proposed
   cellular (bio-inspired and CML-based) liners are embedded between two
   polycarbonate shells, thereby, replacing the traditional expanded
   polypropylene foam liner used in standard sport helmets. The cellular
   liners are analyzed through a series of 2D extruded ballistic impact
   simulations to determine the best performing liner topology and its
   corresponding rubber hardness. The cellular design with the best
   performance is compared against an expanded polypropylene foam liner in
   a 3D simulation to appraise its protection capabilities and verify that
   the 2D extruded design simulations scale to an effective 3D design.}},

Abstract = {{Lightweight architected cellular cores have been introduced as an
   advanced alternative to improve the overall performance of sandwich
   structures. In this study, we implement semi-analytical and finite
   element approaches and conduct experimental impact tests to evaluate the
   performance of 3D printed lightweight sandwich panels with architected
   cellular cores of programmable six-sided cells. Changing the geometrical
   parameters of the cells leads to cellular cores of hexagonal,
   rectangular and auxetic topologies. A semi-analytical methodology is
   developed for conducing structural and low-velocity impact analyses
   based on a modified higher-order shear deformation theory. The standard
   mechanics homogenization is implemented through finite element modelling
   to accurately predict the effective mechanical properties of architected
   cellular cores. We apply explicit large deformation finite element
   analysis using ANSYS to analyze the elasto-plastic behavior of
   architected sandwich panels under a low-velocity impact. To
   experimentally corroborate the developed theoretical and computational
   models and to evaluate the manufacturability of the architected sandwich
   panels, we use the fused deposition modeling to 3D print samples of
   polylactic acid biopolymers. Uniaxial tensile test is first used to
   characterize the polymer. We then conduct low-velocity impact tests to
   investigate the energy absorption capability of architected sandwich
   panels. X-ray micro-tomography is finally employed to study the
   microstructural features of panels before and after the impact. The
   experimental and numerical results show that the auxetic sandwich panel
   is potentially an appropriate candidate for energy absorption
   applications due to its high-energy absorption capability and a minimum
   response force transferred from the 3D printed panel.}},

Abstract = {{In the process of coalbed methane (CBM) mining, with the decreasing of
   reservoir pressure, stress sensitivity and matrix desorption shrinkage,
   which could be called self-regulating effect comprehensively, possess
   great effect on the gas adsorption due to the changing of pore volume.
   Therefore, it is necessary to modify the simplified local density (SLD)
   model to investigate the gas adsorption under reservoir conditions for
   an accurate prediction of CBM production. For the utilization of SLD
   adsorption model, assume the pores as slit pore. When pressure is lower
   than critical desorption pressure and keeps falling, the deformations of
   specific surface area (SSA) and pore width could be studied by the
   chosen Shi and Durucan (S\&D) model. Furthermore, based on the variation
   relationship and the modification of SLD model, a new adsorption
   predicting model could be derived with the consideration of stress
   sensitivity, and matrix desorption shrinkage. In the absence of stress
   sensitivity and matrix desorption shrinkage, the calculated consequence
   is relatively smaller than the actual field adsorption data. What's
   more, the sensitivity analyses of Poisson's ratio, pore volume
   compressibility and critical desorption pressure are conducted with the
   application of this new model. At the same reservoir pressure, Poisson's
   ratio possesses negative relationship with modified adsorption, while
   pore volume compressibility and critical desorption pressure both
   possess positive influence on modified adsorption. The main reason is
   that Poisson's ratio affects matrix desorption shrinkage negatively,
   while pore volume compressibility and critical desorption pressure
   affect matrix desorption shrinkage positively. In spite of the opposite
   effect of stress sensitivity and matrix desorption shrinkage on pore
   deformation, matrix desorption shrinkage exhibits a dominant role in
   self-regulating.}},

Abstract = {{Designing structures that dilate rapidly in both tension and compression
   would benefit devices such as smart filters, actuators or fasteners.
   This property however requires an unusual Poisson ratio, or Poisson
   function at finite strains, which has to vary with applied strain and
   exceed the familiar bounds: less than 0 in tension and above 1/2 in
   compression. Here, by combining mechanical tests and discrete element
   simulations, we show that a simple three-dimensional architected
   material, made of a self-entangled single long coiled wire, behaves in
   between discrete and continuum media, with a large and reversible
   dilatancy in both tension and compression. This unusual behaviour arises
   from an interplay between the elongation of the coiled wire and
   rearrangements due to steric effects, which, unlike in traditional
   discrete media, are hysteretically reversible when the architecture is
   made of an elastic fibre.}},

   Problem Solution for Circle under the Neumann Boundary Condition}},

Pages = {{168-172}},
Abstract = {{It is known that boundary value problems for the Laplace and Poisson
   equations are equivalent to the problem of the calculus of variations -
   the minimum of an integral for which the given partial differential
   equation is the Euler - Lagrange equation. For example, the problem of
   the minimum of the Dirichlet integral in the unit disc centered at the
   origin on some admissible set of functions for given values of the
   normal derivative on the circle is equivalent to the Neimann boundary
   value problem for the Laplace equation in this domain. An effective
   approximate dilogarithm representation of the solution of the above
   equivalent variational boundary value problem is constructed on the
   basis of the known exact solution of the Neumann Boundary value problem
   for a circle using a special approximate formula for the Dini integral.
   The approximate formula is effective in the sense that it is quite
   simple in numerical implementation, stable, and the error estimation,
   which is uniform over a circle, allows calculations with the given
   accuracy. A special quadrature formula for the Dini integral has a
   remarkable property - its coefficients are non-negative. Quadrature
   formulas with non-negative coefficients occupy a special place in the
   theory of approximate calculations of definite integrals and its
   applications. Naturally, this property becomes even more significant
   when the coefficient are not number, but some functions. The performed
   numerical analysis of the approximate solution confirms its
   effectiveness.}},

   models are recommended for handling excessive zeros in count data. For
   various reasons, researchers may not address zero inflation. This paper
   helps educate researchers on the importance of accounting for zero
   inflation and the consequences of misspecifying the statistical model.
   Using simulations, we found that when the zero inflation in the data was
   ignored, estimation was poor and statistically significant findings were
   missed. When overdispersion within the zero-inflated data was ignored,
   poor estimation and inflated Type I errors resulted. Recommendations on
   when to use the ZINB and ZIP models are provided. In an illustration
   using a two-step model selection procedure (likelihood ratio test and
   the Vuong test), the ZIP model was correctly identified only when the
   distributions had moderate means and sample sizes and did not correctly
   identify the ZINB model or the zero inflation in the ZIP and ZINB

Abstract = {{Metal-insulator transition in zigzag graphene nanoribbon has been
   studied using random matrix theory. By employing inverse participation
   ratio and spectral analysis, our results show that metal-insulator
   transition occurs in the presence of a random distribution of
   substitutional nitrogen atoms. We have observed quantum chaotic Wigner
   energy levelstatistics distribution for low nitrogen concentration. At
   sufficiently high doping, system is at the begging of transition from
   Wigner to Poisson distribution. For doped graphene, our calculations
   indicate that this transition becomes fast by applying transverse
   electric field. Additionally, a threshold value for the transverse
   electric field is reported. For this threshold value, the change of the
   conductivity is drastically and Poisson level-spacing sets in. More
   interestingly, a negative differential resistance and quasi-ohmic
   behavior can be found for various values of impurity and electric field,
   such that for these values quantum chaotic predicts Wigner distribution.}},

Journal = {{STATISTICAL METHODS IN MEDICAL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{257-278}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Zero-inflated (ZI) models, which may be derived as a mixture involving a
   degenerate distribution at value zero and a distribution such as
   negative binomial (ZINB), have proved useful in dental and other areas
   of research by accommodating extra' zeroes in the data. Used in
   conjunction with generalised linear models, they allow
   covariate-adjusted inference of an exposure effect on the mixing
   probability and on the mean for the non-degenerate distribution.
   However, these models do not directly provide covariate-adjusted
   inference for the overall exposure effect. Focusing on the ZINB and ZI
   beta binomial models, we propose an approach that uses model-predicted
   values for each person under each exposure state. This average predicted
   value' method allows covariate-adjusted estimation of flexible functions
   of exposure group means such as the difference or ratio. A second
   approach considers a log link for both components of the ZINB to allow a
   direct approach to estimation. We apply these new methods to a study of
   dental caries in very low birth weight adolescents. Simulation studies
   show good bias and robustness properties for both approaches under
   various scenarios. Robustness diminishes when there is exposure group
   imbalance for a covariate with a large effect.}},

Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},

Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{2705-2714}},
Abstract = {{Numerical simulations based on the full Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP)
   equations are performed to investigate the reverse electrodialysis (RED)
   in negatively charged conical nanopores. The simulations consider three
   different salts (i.e., KCl, NaCl and LiCl) and examine the effects of
   the concentration gradient, surface charge density and diffusion
   coefficient on the current-voltage characteristics and energy conversion
   efficiency of the RED system. When diffusion takes place from the base
   side to the tip side, the transference number of counter-ion (t(+)) can
   be enhanced due to an addition in the EDL overlap near the tip side. It
   results in the higher energy conversion efficiency of RED than the salt
   ion diffusion from the tip side to the base side, i.e., the RED
   performance of the conical nanopore is dependent on the direction of
   salt concentration gradient. In addition, the results show that the
   conversion efficiency increases as the diffusion coefficient of the
   positive ions (D+) approaches that of the negative ions (D-). For D+ <
   D-, the diffusion current and diffusion potential in negatively charged
   conical nanopores show negative on the current-voltage characteristics
   and the conversion efficiency increases as the concentration gradient is
   increased at small surface charge density. Finally, the calculated
   maximum power conversion efficiency reaches 45\%.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The previously existing quasilinear theory of the generation of a
   large-scale radial electric field by small-scale drift turbulence in a
   plasma is generalized for the case of strong turbulence which is usually
   observed in experiments. The geostrophic equation (i.e., the reduced
   Charney-Hasegawa-Mima equation) is used to construct a systematic theory
   in the two-scale direct interaction approximation. It is shown that, as
   in the quasilinear case, drift turbulence results in a turbulent
   viscosity effect and leads to the renormalization of the Poisson bracket
   in the Charney-Hasegawa-Mima equation. It is found that, for strong
   drift turbulence, the viscosity coefficient is represented as a sum of
   two parts, which are comparable in magnitude. As in quasilinear theory,
   the first part is determined by the second-order correlation functions
   of the turbulent field and is always negative. The second part is
   proportional to the third-order correlation functions, and the sign of
   its contribution to the turbulent viscosity coefficient depends strongly
   on the turbulence spectrum. The turbulent viscosity coefficient is
   calculated numerically for the Kolmogorov spectra, which characterize
   the inertial interval of the drift turbulence. (C) 2001 MAIK

Abstract = {{Mediation analysis seeks to understand the mechanism by which a
   treatment affects an outcome. Count or zero-inflated count outcomes are
   common in many studies in which mediation analysis is of interest. For
   example, in dental studies, outcomes such as the number of decayed,
   missing and filled teeth are typically zero inflated. Existing mediation
   analysis approaches for count data often assume sequential ignorability
   of the mediator. This is often not plausible because the mediator is not
   randomized so unmeasured confounders are associated with the mediator
   and the outcome. We develop causal methods based on instrumental
   variable approaches for mediation analysis for count data possibly with
   many 0s that do not require the assumption of sequential ignorability.
   We first define the direct and indirect effect ratios for those data,
   and then we propose estimating equations and use empirical likelihood to
   estimate the direct and indirect effects consistently. A sensitivity
   analysis is proposed for violations of the instrumental variables
   exclusion restriction assumption. Simulation studies demonstrate that
   our method works well for different types of outcome under various
   settings. Our method is applied to a randomized dental caries prevention
   trial and a study of the effect of a massive flood in Bangladesh on
   children's diarrhoea.}},

   examples when beta(v) not equal 0 and more than three hundred when
   beta(v) = 0 that we gathered from the literature and from Sloane's OEIS

Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is to investigate the application of topology
   description function (TDF) in material design. Using TDF to describe the
   topology of the microstructure, the formulation and the solving
   technique of the design problem of materials with prescribed mechanical
   properties are presented. By presenting the TDF as the sum of a series
   of basis functions determined by parameters, the topology optimization
   of material microstructure is formulated as a size optimization problem
   whose design variables are parameters of TDF basis functions and
   independent of the mesh of the design domain. By this method, high
   quality topologies for describing the distribution of constituent
   material in design domain can be obtained and checkerboard problem often
   met in the variable density method is avoided. Compared with the
   conventional level set method, the optimization problem can be solved
   simply by existing optimization techniques without the process to solve
   the `Hamilton-Jacobi-type' equation by the difference method. The method
   proposed is illustrated with two 2D examples. One gives the unit cell
   with positive Poisson's ratio, the other with negative Poisson's ratio.
   The examples show the method based on TDF is effective for material
   design.}},

   the phase transition. The extent of counterion release is calculated for
   a range of lipid/DNA concentration ratios based on the nonlinear
   Poisson-Boltzmann theory. Both experiment and theory show maximal,
   essentially complete, release of counterions at the isoelectric point,
   where the positive (lipid)/negative (DNA) charge ratio is 1:1.
   Furthermore, at this point the entropic contribution to the condensation
   free energy is maximal and dominant.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To present mixture regression analysis as an alternative to
   more standard regression analysis for predicting adolescent delinquency.
   We demonstrate how mixture regression analysis allows for the
   identification of population subgroups defined by the salience of
   multiple risk factors.
   Methods: We identified population subgroups (i.e., latent classes) of
   individuals based on their coefficients in a regression model predicting
   adolescent delinquency from eight previously established risk indices
   drawn from the community, school, family, peer, and individual levels.
   The study included N = 37,763 10th-grade adolescents who participated in
   the Communities That Care Youth Survey. Standard, zero-inflated, and
   mixture Poisson and negative binomial regression models were considered.
   Results: Standard and mixture negative binomial regression models were
   selected as optimal. The five-class regression model was interpreted
   based on the class-specific regression coefficients, indicating that
   risk factors had varying salience across classes of adolescents.
   Conclusions: Standard regression showed that all risk factors were
   significantly associated with delinquency. Mixture regression provided
   more nuanced information, suggesting a unique set of risk factors that
   were salient for different subgroups of adolescents. Implications for
   the design of subgroup-specific interventions are discussed. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{With the rapid growth and advance in the Internet of things and
   flexible/on-skin electronics, stretchable/flexible energy storage
   devices are being unprecedentedly needed and widely pursued. However, it
   remains a great challenge to realize devices with both high storage
   capacity and satisfactory mechanical stretchability/flexibility. Herein,
   by synergistically combining 3D printing with electrodeposition, a
   3D-printed stretchable structural supercapacitor with thick electrodes
   and a 3D Negative Poisson's Ratio (NPR) multicellular framework was
   developed. Benefiting from the well-designed NPR lattice electrode
   architecture and unique 3D nanoflower-on-nanosheet structured
   CoNi2S4/NiCo-LDHs nanocomposites, the assembled stretchable symmetric
   supercapacitor was highly stretchable (up to similar to 55\%) and
   flexible (up to 180 degrees) with a favorable capacitance of 28.71 F
   cm(-3), superior energy density of 0.582 mW h cm(-3)and satisfied
   stability in stretching and bending cycles (75.2\% of its initial
   capacitance after 1000 periodic stretch/release cycles), which are
   highly comparable to those obtained for previously reported stretchable
   supercapacitors. The strategy proposed here provides new insights in
   developing next-generation highly customized 3D structural strengthening
   energy storage devices for human-machine interfaces and real wearable

Title = {{Models for Count Data With an Application to Healthy Days Measures: Are
   You Driving in Screws With a Hammer?}},
Journal = {{PREVENTING CHRONIC DISEASE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Introduction
   Count data are often collected in chronic disease research, and
   sometimes these data have a skewed distribution. The number of unhealthy
   days reported in the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)
   is an example of such data: most respondents report zero days. Studies
   have either categorized the Healthy Days measure or used linear
   regression models. We used alternative regression models for these count
   data and examined the effect on statistical inference.
   Methods
   Using responses from participants aged 35 years or older from 12 states
   that included a homeownership question in their 2009 BRFSS, we compared
   5 multivariate regression models logistic, linear, Poisson, negative
   binomial, and zero-inflated negative binomial with respect to 1) how
   well the modeled data fit the observed data and 2) how model selections
   affect inferences.
   Results
   Most respondents (66.8\%) reported zero mentally unhealthy days. The
   distribution was highly skewed (variance = 58.7, mean = 3.3 d).
   Zero-inflated negative binomial regression provided the best-fitting
   model, followed by negative binomial regression. A significant
   independent association between homeownership and number of mentally
   unhealthy days was not found in the logistic, linear, or Poisson
   regression model but was found in the negative binomial model. The
   zero-inflated negative binomial model showed that homeowners were 24\%
   more likely than nonhomeowners to have excess zero mentally unhealthy
   days (adjusted odds ratio, 1.24; 95\% confidence interval, 1.08 - 1.43),
   but it did not show an association between homeownership and the number
   of unhealthy days.
   Conclusion
   Our comparison of regression models indicates the importance of
   examining data distribution and selecting models with appropriate
   assumptions. Otherwise, statistical inferences might be misleading.}},

Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Creating complex spatial objects from a flat sheet of material using
   origami folding techniques has attracted attention in science and
   engineering. In the present work, we use the geometric properties of
   partially folded zigzag strips to better describe the kinematics of
   known zigzag/herringbone-base folded sheet metamaterials such as
   Miura-ori. Inspired by the kinematics of a one-degree of freedom zigzag
   strip, we introduce a class of cellular folded mechanical metamaterials
   comprising different scales of zigzag strips. This class of patterns
   combines origami folding techniques with kirigami. Using analytical and
   numerical models, we study the key mechanical properties of the folded
   materials. We show that our class of patterns, by expanding on the
   design space of Miura-ori, is appropriate for a wide range of
   applications from mechanical metamaterials to deployable structures at
   small and large scales. We further show that, depending on the geometry,
   these materials exhibit either negative or positive in-plane Poisson's
   ratios. By introducing a class of zigzag-base materials in the current
   study, we unify the concept of in-plane Poisson's ratio for similar
   materials in the literature and extend it to the class of zigzagbase
   folded sheet materials.}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The elastic properties of chiral cylindrically anisotropic
   nano/microtubes from hexagonal crystals are analyzed. The problems of
   longitudinal tension and torsion of such tubes demonstrate that there is
   a linear direct Poynting effect with an elongation (shortening) of a
   twisted tube and a linear inverse Poynting effect with the twisting of
   the stretch tube. It is shown that both effects disappear at zero chiral
   angle and at some other chiral angles. Many chiral tubes with negative
   Poisson ratios are revealed. It is shown that Poisson ratios do not
   depend on the sign of the chiral angle. It is found that the dependence
   of the torsional stiffness of the tubes on the chiral angle is stronger
   than the dependence on the thickness of the tube walls. At the same
   time, chiral tubes made of graphite are separated from other tubes from
   hexagonal crystals. Their Young's modulus varies rapidly from large to
   small with a change in the chiral angle. The value of the torsional
   stiffness is large and it varies rapidly with the change in the chiral
   angle and the thickness of the tube walls.}},

Abstract = {{Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) remain a public health concern
   because of their interaction(s) with HIV. In the HPTN 052 study, STIs
   were evaluated in both HIV-positive index cases and their HIV-negative
   partners at enrollment and at yearly follow-up visits. Our definition
   for STI was based on any infection with Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria
   gonorrhoeae, syphilis, or Trichomonas vaginalis. We used log-binomial
   regression models to identify factors associated with prevalent STIs.
   Generalized estimating equation models with the Poisson distribution
   were used to compare STI incidence between HIV-positive index cases and
   HIV-negative partners. 8.1\% of the participants had STIs at enrollment.
   The prevalence of STIs (8.9 vs. 7.2) was higher in HIV-positive index
   cases than HIV-negative partners. Being female (prevalence ratio (PR) =
   1.61; 95\% CI: 1.20-2.16) or unmarried (PR = 1.92; 95\% CI: 1.17-3.14)
   was associated with prevalent STIs. Compared to HIV-negative male
   partners, HIV-positive female index cases had a higher risk of STI
   acquisition (incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 2.25; 95\% CI: 1.70-2.97).
   While we are implementing HIV prevention interventions for HIV-negative
   people, we should also intensify targeted STI prevention interventions,

Abstract = {{In the past decades, various novel functions (i.e., negative Poisson's

   microstructures of the cellular structures. Among all the
   microstructures, the horseshoe topology shows a J-shaped stress-strain
   curve, which is quite different from the conventional materials. It can
   be inferred that the 2D lattice structure with horseshoe microstructure
   will also exhibit excellent out-of-plane impact resistance since the
   spider silk also exhibits the J-shaped stress-strain curve. In this
   paper, the out-of-plane sphere impact of 2D truss lattice structure is
   conducted using finite element method (FEM) simulation. The point has
   been made that, by replacing the direct-line beam to horseshoe curved
   beam, the out-of-plane impact resistance has been greatly improved. The
   most curved beam structure is found to have the best out-of-plane
   performs with the maximum energy absorption and the minimum passing

Abstract = {{In this study, the behavior of the logistic difference model is
   investigated under random conditions using discrete probability
   distributions. The logistic difference model consists of parameters that
   depend on the population models to be used. For the study of random
   difference equation population models, the parameters are treated as
   random variables which constitutes the basis of the study. Random models
   were created using Uniform, Bernouilli, Binom, Negative Binomial (or
   Pascal), Geometric, Hypergeometric, Poisson distributions and their
   numerical characteristics are obtained through their simulations. Then,
   the results showing random numerical characteristics such as expected
   value, variance, standard deviation, coefficient of variation and
   confidence intervals were obtained with MATLAB package program. Analysis
   of random logistic difference model is given with the help of graphics

Abstract = {{Stroke risk has been shown to display varying patterns of geographic
   distribution amongst countries but also between regions of the same
   country. Traditionally a disease of older persons, a global 25\%
   increase in incidence instead was noticed between 1990 and 2010 in
   persons aged 20-<= 64 years, particularly in low-and medium-income
   countries. Understanding spatial disparities in the association between
   socioeconomic factors and stroke is critical to target public health
   initiatives aiming to mitigate or prevent this disease, including in
   younger persons. We aimed to identify socioeconomic determinants of
   geographic disparities of stroke risk in people 65 years old, in
   municipalities of mainland Portugal, and the spatiotemporal variation of
   the association between these determinants and stroke risk during two
   study periods (1992-1996 and 2002-2006). Poisson and negative binomial
   global regression models were used to explore determinants of disease
   risk. Geographically weighted regression (GWR) represents a distinctive
   approach, allowing estimation of local regression coefficients. Models
   for both study periods were identified. Significant variables included
   education attainment, work hours per week and unemployment. Local
   Poisson GWR models achieved the best fit and evidenced spatially varying
   regression coefficients. Spatiotemporal inequalities were observed in
   significant variables, with dissimilarities between men and women. This
   study contributes to a better understanding of the relationship between
   stroke and socioeconomic factors in the population <65 years of age, one
   age group seldom analysed separately. It can thus help to improve the
   targeting of public health initiatives, even more in a context of
   economic crisis.}},

Abstract = {{After a general introduction on the main aspects of the mechanical
   properties of main-chain liquid-crystal elastomers (MCLCEs) and
   side-chain liquid-crystal elastomers (SCLCEs), new results will be
   presented dealing with several MCLCEs with a cross-linker density C =
   8\%, 6\% and 4\% and with a SCLCE with C = 10\%, all prepared by the
   two-step cross-linking process. A non-SCLCE with bulky side-groups
   similar in shape to the mesogens was also synthesized for comparison
   with the SCLCE. Most of the experiments were performed with a
   piezorheometer allowing the determination of the shear anisotropy of the
   samples by applying shear in a direction parallel (G'(parallel to)) or
   perpendicular (G'(perpendicular to)) thornto the director, and with a
   thermo-elastic device for the E measurements. The main results concern:
   (a) the influence of the supercritical nature of SCLCE and the
   subcritical nature of MCLCEs on the mechanical properties of these
   elastomers, as well as that of SmC domains present in MCLCEs; (b) the
   relationship between the degrees of elongation and of anisotropy deduced
   from the variations of G'(parallel to) and G'(perpendicular to) during
   the poly-domain to mono-domain transition of the 10\% SCLCE and the 8\%
   MCLCE; (c) the determination of the Poisson's ratio showing that it is
   isotropic for the non-SCLCE, with a crossover between 0.5 (classical
   value for rubbers) for small strains and 0.38 for high strains, and
   anisotropic for the 10\% SCLCE and 8\% MCLCE, with values <0.5. The
   particular behaviors of the Poisson's ratios can be explained by
   confinement effects occurring when stretching increases.}},

Abstract = {{Plane elasticity has allowed the development of the current knowledge on
   fracture mechanics since the dawn of this discipline. Linear elastic
   fracture mechanics (LEFM) has taken advantage of the possibility to
   obtain analytical closed-form solutions. Indeed, three dimensional
   effects, related basically to the Poisson's ratio and the plate
   thickness, have been mostly neglected for a long time. The proof of the
   existence of corner point singularities, i.e. stress singularity at the
   intersection of crack front with a free surface, has contributed to
   explain fracture phenomena, such as the bowed crack fronts and the
   behavior of stress intensity factors along the thickness of a
   cracked/notched body. Although fatigue crack growth is Mode I dominated
   and corner point singularities become insignificant, for the estimation
   of brittle failure of cracked/notched they may represent a substantial
   source of error, both in terms of magnitude of the stress field and
   failure location. In this paper we provide before a brief overview on 3D
   corner point singularities. By exploiting of 3D finite element (FE)
   modeling, to understand the theoretical basis of this phenomenon,
   numerical experiments on sharply-V-notched linear elastic plates under
   mode 1 loading are performed. A quantitative and qualitative description
   of the causes and effects of 3D vertex singularities under mode 1 in
   relation with Poisson's ratio is given, including negative values of
   this latter material parameter, never before investigated. Besides, by
   means of numerical simulations of the same notched plates subjected to
   mode 3 loading, observations on the possible connection between 3D
   corner point singularities and the out-of-plane shear stress
   distribution near the model surface are discussed. Finally, future
   perspectives on this research field are addressed. (C) 2020 The Authors.

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the problem of noise-to-state practical
   stability in mean (NSpS-M) (which is a natural generalization of
   noise-to-state stability in mean) and the problem of almost sure global
   asymptotic stability (GAS a.s.) for a class of random nonlinear
   time-varying impulsive switched systems. By using the notions of average
   impulsive switched interval and Poisson process, unified sufficient
   stability criteria on NSpS-M and GAS a.s. are derived. Two remarkable
   distinctions from the existing results lie in that: (1) stabilizing,
   inactive and destabilizing impulses are simultaneously considered; (2)
   the coefficient of the derivative of a Lyapunov function is allowed to
   be a time-varying function which can be both positive and negative and
   may even be unbounded. As an accompaniment, a less conservative unified
   criterion on NSpS-M for a special case is also presented by taking into
   account the stabilization role of the gain constant of the time-varying
   coefficient. Two examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness
   of our derived criteria.}},

Abstract = {{The disintegration of a copper electrode and the subsequent transport of
   Cu+ ions into a borosilicate glass has been qualitatively observed in a
   recent electron charge attachment induced transport (e-CAIT) experiment

   of the transport coefficients of Cu+ and two native alkali ions in the
   glass. Electron attachment to the front side of the sample generates a
   negative surface potential inducing transport of mobile native alkali
   ions towards the front side. At the backside of the sample, in contact
   with a copper electrode, the electric field increases as a result of the
   alkali ion transport. Under these conditions, Cu+ ions become ejected
   from the electrode and enter into the glass. The concentration depth
   profiles of all mobile species in the glass have been quantitatively
   analyzed by means of the Nernst-Planck-Poisson theory. As the result of
   the analysis we arrive at a diffusion coefficient for Cu+ ions in the
   borosilicate glass at 160 degrees C of D(Cu+) = (5.2 +/- 1) . 10(-20)

   we have revisited the phonon mode assignments at the zone-center, so
   that the contradictions met in previous experimental studies between 250
   and 300 cm(-1) are now explained and understood. We found that the
   temperature dependence of the Raman frequencies is mainly due to an
   implicit volume contribution and related to the large Gruneisen
   parameter. This explains why CrSi2 has a moderate thermal conductivity
   although its Debye temperature is quite large. Optic and static
   dielectric constants have also been analyzed and discussed. The elastic
   constants of CrSi2 are large, but this compound is quite brittle. In
   addition, the relatively low Poisson coefficient associated to the large
   negative Cauchy pressure of CrSi2 indicate the angular nature of its
   bonding. The calculation of its piezoelectric coefficient shows a
   sizable value with a magnitude similar to that reported for a-quartz.
   This prediction requires, however, experimental confirmation.}},

Title = {{Zero inflated statistical count models for analysing the costs imposed
   by GERD and dyspepsia}},
Journal = {{ARAB JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{14}},

Pages = {{165-168}},

Abstract = {{Background and study aims: Recent studies have shown that the high
   prevalence and the various clinical presentations of gastro-oesophageal
   reflux disease (GERD) and dyspepsia impose an enormous economic burden
   on society. Economic cost data have unique characteristics: they are
   counts, and they have zero inflation. Therefore, these data require
   special models. Poisson regression (PR), negative binomial regression
   (NB), zero inflated Poisson (ZIP) and zero inflated negative binomial
   (ZINB) regression are the models used for analysing cost data in this
   paper.
   Patients and methods: In this study, a cross-sectional household survey
   was distributed to a random sample of individuals between May 2006 and
   December 2007 in the Tehran province of Iran to determine the prevalence
   of gastrointestinal symptoms and disorders and their related factors.
   The cost associated with each item was calculated. PR, NB, ZIP and ZINB
   models were used to analyse the data. The likelihood ratio test and the
   Voung test were used to conduct pairwise comparisons of the models. The
   log likelihood, the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian
   information criterion (BIC) were used to compare the performances of the
   models.
   Results: According to the likelihood ratio test and the Voung test and
   all three criteria used to compare the performance of the models, ZINB
   regression was identified as the best model for analysing the cost data.
   Sex, age, smoking status, BMI, insurance status and education were
   significant predictors.
   Conclusion: Because the NB model demonstrated a better fit than the PR
   and ZIP models, over-dispersion was clearly only due to unobserved
   heterogeneity. In contrast, according to the likelihood ratio test, the
   ZINB model was more appropriate than the ZIP model. Conclusion: The ZINB
   model for the cost data was more appropriate than the other models. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper presents a comparative study on the size optimization of four
   mesostructures to meet the design requirements for a nonpneumatic tire's
   (NPT) shear beam with 10\% shear flexure (SF) at 10 MPa effective shear
   modulus. The need for such comparison is motivated from the previous
   research wherein a systematic design method is proposed to design a
   mesostructure with high SF by studying the strain energy distribution
   pattern in honeycomb, auxetic, and sinusoidal auxetic mesostructure.
   Based upon the distribution pattern, a new type of mesostructure termed
   S-type is invented. Although it exhibited higher SF than the other
   mesostructures for a comparable set of geometry, it is not possible to
   validate the design method without exploring the complete design space
   of both existing and newly invented mesostructures. In order to address
   this limitation, these four mesostructures are optimized using the
   following optimization algorithms: (i) particle swarm; (ii) genetic
   algorithm (GA); and (iii) FAST-SIMPLEX (using response surface method).
   The results show the S-type mesostructure can be configured to meet the
   design requirements, thereby validating the design method presented in
   previous research. Additionally, it is also observed that auxetic
   mesostructure is only 5\% less than the required design target, which
   presents an opportunity in future, to develop an alternate design method
   to maximize SF other than the one that is being validated in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{Elastic plates or cylinders can support guided modes with zero group
   velocity (ZGV) at a nonzero value of the wave number. Using laser-based
   ultrasonic techniques, we experimentally investigate some fascinating
   properties of these ZGV modes: resonance and ringing effects, backward
   wave propagation, interference between backward and forward modes. Then,
   the conditions required for the existence of ZGV Lamb modes in isotropic
   plates are discussed. It is shown that these modes appear in a range of
   Poisson's ratio about the value for which the cutoff frequency curves of
   modes belonging to the same family intercept, i.e., for a bulk wave
   velocity ratio equal to a rational number. An interpretation of this
   phenomenon in terms of a strong repulsion between a pair of modes having
   a different parity in the vicinity of the cutoff frequencies is given.
   Experiments performed with materials of various Poisson's ratio
   demonstrate that the resonance spectrum of an unloaded elastic plate,
   locally excited by a laser pulse, is dominated by the ZGV Lamb modes.

Abstract = {{Due to their excellent physical properties and compatibility with
   micro-fabrication processes, vertically aligned carbon nanotubes
   (VA-CNTs) have been successfully integrated in various
   nano/micro-electromechanical system (NEMS/MEMS) devices, composites, and
   electronic circuits. Here, we investigate the behavior of VA-CNTs under
   electrostatic tension. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that
   electrostatic tension reorganizes the individual CNTs and increases
   their alignment, thereby increasing their stiffness, and resulting in a
   negative Poisson's ratio (NPR). High NPR values were obtained in the top
   portion of the VA-CNTs (the location of the greatest morphological
   change), while the other portions (a less significant morphological
   change) demonstrated smaller NPR values. Therefore, the electrostatic
   pressure induces an irreversible morphological change in the VA-CNTs,
   which, in turn, modifies their properties. This behavior makes VA-CNTs
   an attractive material for a wide range of micro- and nano-scale
   devices, wherein tunable mechanical properties and a versatile motion
   transformation are required. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   has been focused on smart biomaterials primarily on auxetic materials
   which are automatically adjustable with strength and thickness in
   response to the applied forces as they have memorial ability to return
   to its original state on dissipation of the stresses. Here, the main
   emphasize is on biomedical applications of auxetic materials which comes
   under the category of 16 smart materials of the twenty first century

Abstract = {{Deformation rules and acoustic emission characteristics of granite under
   repeated loading-unloading are studied using the MTS Mechanics Testing
   System and Disp. acoustic emission instrument. It's found that the axial
   stiffness of granite as well as Poisson's ratio increases with the
   development of the plastic strain while the change trend of lateral
   stiffness is negative. For brittle rocks, strain is produced by three
   mechanisms: elastic deformation, axial micro-cracking and compaction.
   The peak AE rate is increasing with the plastic strain, which indicates
   that using the axial plastic strain as the internal damage variable to
   represent rock damage is reasonable.}},

Abstract = {{In this investigation, mechanical behavior of periodic cellular solids
   with diamond-shaped inclusions connected via wavy network were explored.
   Two families of cellular solids within this category were designed based
   on two different geometric constraints. Auxetic effects and snap-through
   instability were observed for each family, respectively. The mechanical
   properties, including the stress-strain behavior, stiffness and
   Poisson's ratio, were systematically quantified via finite element (FE)
   simulations. The parametric space for auxetic effects and snap-through
   instability was numerically identified. This study demonstrates the
   connection and transition between mechanical auxeticity and snap-through
   instability. The materials designed have potential engineering
   applications, such as lightweight supporting and protective foams,
   biomedical devices, smart composites or fabrics with switchable
   properties responsive to external environments.}},

Title = {{Associations between ambient air pollution and mortality from all
   causes, pneumonia, and congenital heart diseases among children aged
   under 5 years in Beijing, China: A population-based time series study}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{176}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Background: Previous studies have mainly focused on the associations
   between particulate matters and infant mortality. However, evidence
   regarding the associations between gaseous pollutants and mortality
   among children aged < 5 years remains sparse.
   Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate the associations
   between ambient air pollution and death among children aged < 5 years in
   Beijing, China, and explore the impact of age, gender and specific
   causes of death on these associations.
   Methods: Concentrations of ambient air pollution and the number of
   deaths among children aged < 5 years in Beijing from January 2014 to
   September 2016 were extracted from authoritative electronic databases.
   The associations were estimated for a single-month lag from the current
   month up to the previous 5 months (lag0-lag5) and moving averages of the
   current and previous months (lag01-lag05) using generalized additive
   Poisson regression (adjusted for time trends, season, meteorological
   variables and holidays). Subgroup analyses related to age, gender and
   specific diseases were performed. Two-pollutant models were used to
   evaluate the possible role of single pollutants.
   Results: Sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and carbon
   monoxide (CO) demonstrated the strongest associations with death among
   children aged < 5 years at lag0 and the estimates decreased or even
   turned negative with the increasing lag periods. For an interquartile
   range increase in SO2, NO2 and CO at lag0, the odds ratios (OR) were
   1.332 (95\% CI 1.152-1.539), 1.383 (95\% CI 1.113-1.718) and 1.273 (95\%
   CI 1.028-1.575). However, CO lost significance after adjusting for SO2
   and NO2, and PM2.5 gained significance (OR 1.548, 95\% CI 1.061-2.258)
   after adjusting for PM10. The ORs for SO2 and NO2 remained the most
   stable across all two-pollutant models. The associations for children
   aged 1-5 years were stronger than those reported for infants at lag but
   lower at the other lag months. The pollutant associations were stronger
   for congenital heart disease-related death than overall and
   pneumonia-related death. We did not find significant differences in
   terms of gender.
   Conclusion: Exposure to air pollution may increase the incidence of
   death among children aged < 5 years. SO2 and NO2 may be the most stable
   pollutants reflecting associations between air pollution and death,
   deserving further attention. Children with congenital heart diseases are
   more susceptible to air pollution. Therefore, it is urgent to implement
   the clean air targets established by WHO and reduce the exposure of
   children to air pollution.}},

Abstract = {{We present results on the ballistic and diffusive behavior of the
   Langevin dynamics in a periodic potential that is driven away from
   equilibrium by a space-time periodic driving force, extending some of
   the results obtained by Collet and Martinez in (J Math Biol, 56(6):
   765-792 2008). In the hyperbolic scaling, a nontrivial average velocity
   can be observed even if the external forcing vanishes in average. More
   surprisingly, an average velocity in the direction opposite to the
   forcing may develop at the linear response level-a phenomenon called
   negative mobility. The diffusive limit of the non-equilibrium Langevin
   dynamics is also studied using the general methodology of central limit
   theorems for additive functionals of Markov processes. To apply this
   methodology, which is based on the study of appropriate Poisson
   equations, we extend recent results on pointwise estimates of the
   resolvent of the generator associated with the Langevin dynamics. Our
   theoretical results are illustrated by numerical simulations of a

Abstract = {{Many articles have dealt with the loss formulas for determining the
   required number of circuits in a transit circuit group with overflow
   traffic. Traditionally, ERM (Equivalent Random Method) is used to
   determine number of circuits in a final circuit group with rough
   overflow traffic which has vmr (variance to mean ratio) greater than
   one. Recently, IPP (Interrupted Poisson Process) approximate method
   which represents the collective feature of the overflow have been
   introduced. The negative binomial loss formula can be applied to
   determine the required number of circuits. In this paper, we deal with
   the negative binomial loss formula and determination method of number of
   circuits. We also analyze and compare these three loss formulas. To
   apply these formulas to the capacity planning of circuit networks, we
   need more effective algorithm for the accurate numerical calculation.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND \& AIMS: The rate of postcolonoscopy colorectal cancer
   (PCCRC) is a measure of colonoscopy quality, but there are conflicting
   results from studies of survival times of patients with PCCRC. We
   assessed survival times of patients with PCCRC and characterized the
   microscopic and macroscopic features of postcolonoscopy colorectal
   tumors.
   METHODS: We performed a population-based cohort study using data from a
   database in Sweden, on 458,937 colonoscopies (54.0\% women) performed
   from 2003 through 2012. Rates of colorectal cancer within 3 years of a
   colonoscopy were calculated based on the World Endoscopy Organization
   guidelines. Risk factors were evaluated using Poisson regression
   analysis. We used Cox regression models and Kaplan-Meier analyses,
   stratified by sex, to assess conditional survival. Logistic regression
   models were used to evaluate features of postcolonoscopy colorectal
   tumors, including stage location (right, left, or rectum)
   differentiation grade (high or low), synchronous tumors, perineural
   growth, resection margins, and mucinous and vessel characteristics.
   RESULTS: Within 36 months after a colonoscopy, there were 19,184
   individuals who had received a diagnosis of CRC; 1384 of these were
   PCCRCs (7.2\%). The proportion of individuals with PCCRC decreased from
   9.4\% in 2003 to 6.1\% in 2012. The largest risk factors for PCCRC were
   a prior diagnosis of CRC (relative risk {[}RR], 3.31; 95\% CI,
   2.71-4.04), ulcerative colitis (RR, 5.44; 95\% CI, 4.75-6.23), Crohn's
   disease (RR, 3.81; 95\% CI, 2.98-4.87), and prior polypectomy (RR, 2.32;
   95\% CI, 1.97-2.72). Individuals with PCCRCs had shorter survival times
   than individuals with CRCs detected during the index colonoscopy.
   Multivariate hazard ratios for PCCRC were 2.75 for men (95\% CI,
   2.21-3.42) and 2.00 for women (95\% CI, 1.59-2.52), respectively.
   Individuals with left-side PCCRC had shorter survival times than
   patients with CRC detected during the index colonoscopy. Postcolonoscopy
   colorectal tumors had increased odds of low differentiation grade (odds
   ratio, 1.27; 95\% CI, 1.09-1.49) compared with colorectal tumors
   detected during the index colonoscopy.
   CONCLUSIONS: In an analysis of colonoscopies in Sweden, the rate of
   PCCRCs decreased from 9.4\% in 2003 to 6.1\% in 2012. Diseases that
   require surveillance (such as prior colorectal neoplasms and
   inflammatory bowel diseases) are the largest risk factors for PCCRC.
   Patients with PCCRC have shorter survival times than patients with CRC
   detected during their initial colonoscopy-especially women and patients
   with left-side tumors.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To determine whether low levels of recall lead to increased
   interval cancers and the magnitude of this effect.
   Materials and Methods: The authors retrospectively analyzed
   prospectively collected data from the UK National Health Service Breast
   Screening Programme during a 36-month period (April 1, 2005 to March 31,
   2008), with 3-year follow-up in women aged 50-70 years. Data on recall,
   cancers detected at screening, and interval cancers were available for
   each of the 84 breast screening units and for each year (n= 252). The
   association between interval cancers and recalls was modeled by using
   Poisson regression on aggregated data and according to age (5-year
   intervals) and screening type (prevalent vs incident).
   Results: The authors analyzed 5 126 689 screening episodes,
   demonstrating an average recall to assessment rate (RAR) of 4.56\%
   (range, 1.64\%-8.42\%; standard deviation, 1.15\%), cancer detection
   rate of 8.1 per 1000 women screened, and interval cancer rate (ICR) of
   3.1 per 1000 women screened. Overall, a significant negative association
   was found between RAR and ICR (Poisson regression coefficient: 20.039
   {[}95\% confidence interval: 20.062, 20.017]; P=.001), with
   approximately one fewer interval cancer for every additional 80-84
   recalls. Subgroup analysis revealed similar negative correlations in
   women aged 50-54 years (P=.002), 60-64 years (P=.01), and 65-69 years
   (P=.008) as well as in incident screens (P=.001) and prevalent screens
   (P=.04). No significant relationship was found in women aged 55-59 years
   (P=.46).
   Conclusion: There was a statistically significant negative correlation
   between RAR and ICR, which suggests the merit of a minimum threshold for
   RAR. (c) RSNA, 2018}},

Abstract = {{We have presented some practical consequences on the molecular-dynamics
   simulations arising from the numerical algorithm published recently in
   paper {[}1]. The algorithm is not a finite-difference method and
   therefore it could be complementary to the traditional numerical
   integrating of the motion equations. It consists of two steps. First, an
   analytic form of polynomials in some formal parameter lambda (we put
   lambda = 1 after all) is derived, which approximate the solution of the
   system of differential equations under consideration. Next, the
   numerical values of the derived polynomials in the interval, in which
   the difference between them and their truncated part of smaller degree
   does not exceed a given accuracy epsilon, become the numerical solution.
   The particular examples, which we have considered, represent the forced
   linear and nonlinear oscillator and the 2D Lennard-Jones fluid. In the
   latter case we have restricted to the polynomials of the first degree in
   formal parameter lambda.
   The computer simulations play very important role in modeling materials
   with unusual properties being contradictictory to our intuition. The
   particular example could be the auxetic materials. In this case, the
   accuracy of the applied numerical algorithms as well as various
   side-effects, which might change the physical reality, could become
   important for the properties of the simulated material. (C) 2007

Abstract = {{Mass-spring networks (MSNs) have long been used as approximate
   descriptions of biological and engineered systems, from actomyosin
   networks to mechanical trusses. In the last decade, MSNs have
   re-attracted theoretical interest as models for phononic metamaterials
   with exotic properties such as negative Poisson's ratio, negative
   effective mass, or gapped vibrational spectra. A numerical advantage of
   MSNs is their tuneability, which allows the inverse design of materials
   with pre-specified bandgaps. Building on this fact, we demonstrate here
   that designed MSNs, when subjected to Coriolis forces, can host
   topologically protected chiral edge modes at predetermined frequencies,
   thus enabling robust unidirectional transmission of mechanical waves.
   Similar to other recently discovered topological materials, the
   topological phases of MSNs can be classified by a Chern invariant
   related to time-reversal symmetry breaking.}},

   the C-C bond lengths are slightly lengthened relative to graphene ( two-
   dimensional graphite); the others remain essentially the same or are
   shorter. There is overall a longitudinal compression of the tube. The
   strain energy per atom, relative to graphene, varies inversely with the
   square of the tube radius. The Young's moduli decrease with increasing
   radius but do not depend upon chirality. The Poisson ratios are nearly
   constant. The consequences of removing an electron from each system were
   also investigated. In most instances, the tube dimensions were little
   affected; in only a few cases is there a change in length or radius (

Abstract = {{The emergence of additive manufacturing in combination with the
   advancement of engineering analysis tools has led to a new paradigm in
   the design of materials, in which the organization of matter and
   topology plays a central role. A new class of artificial materials has
   emerged that exhibit static and dynamic properties typically not
   encountered in natural materials and have been named as metamaterials.
   In the current work, we present recent advances made in the field,
   relating to both the static attributes and to the wave propagation
   characteristics of metamaterials under small and large strains. In
   particular, we present a class of anti-auxetic inner material
   architectures with positive and high Poissons ratio values which lead to
   metamaterials of controlled anisotropy. Thereupon, we study the
   influence of the degree of anisotropy on the wave propagation
   characteristics under small strains. Moreover, we analyze the effect of
   geometrical nonlinearities on the propagation of longitudinal and shear
   waves in two-dimensional hexagonal-shaped architectured lattices viewed
   as effective 1D and 2D media, while we showcase the potential of
   non-auxetic architectures to reach auxetic ones through a kinematic
   control in the large strains regime. What is more, we analyze the role
   of the considered nonlinearity in the nature of propagating waves,
   identifying strain thresholds beyond which both supersonic and subsonic
   modes emerge.}},

Abstract = {{Flexible ultrasensitive strain sensors are highly desirable in view of
   their widespread applications in wearable electronics, health monitoring
   systems, and smart robots, where subtle strain detection is required.
   However, traditional fabrication of such sensors was done to prepare
   sensitive layers on bare or single-sided structural substrates, leading
   to limited sensitivity. Herein, a stretchable resistive-type strain
   sensor was demonstrated by self-assembling conductive networks onto a
   monolithic polydimethylsiloxane substrate with a two-sided topological
   design, for example, a sinusoid/auxetic binary architecture. The
   sensitivity of the obtained sensor was greatly improved by 22-fold as
   compared to the traditional counterpart with a bare substrate. The
   remarkably good agreement between the experimental results and finite
   element analysis predictions confirmed that the superior sensitivity is
   a synergistic effect of local strain enhancement derived from the
   topological structure on the foreside and an additional strain
   concentration and a reduced Poisson's ratio from the auxetic arrays on
   the backside. Furthermore, this sensor can withstand an extreme
   mechanical force (>750 N) because of the shear stiffening characteristic
   of the auxetic structure. Benefiting from the characteristics of
   ultrahigh sensitivity (gauge factor similar to 1744 at 5\%), low
   detection limit (<0.05\%), and long-term durability (>500 loading
   cycles), this as-prepared sensor shows promise in practical applications
   of high-performance wearable electronics.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To determine the association of HIV infection and
   immunodeficiency with incidence of ischemic stroke.
   Design: Cohort study of HIV-positive and matched HIV-negative adult
   Kaiser Permanente Northern and Southern California (KPNC and KPSC,
   respectively) members during 1996-2011 (KPNC) or 2000-2011 (KPSC).
   Methods: We used Poisson models to obtain rate ratios for incident
   ischemic stroke associated with HIV infection, both overall and
   stratified by CD4(+) cell counts (cells/mu l) and HIV RNA copies
   (copies/mu l), with HIV-negative individuals as the reference group. We
   also obtained rate ratios for risk factors in the HIV-positive subset.
   Results: Among 24 768 HIV-positive and 257 600 HIV-negative individuals,
   the ischemic stroke rate per 100 000 person-years was 125 (n = 151
   events) for HIV-positive and 74 (n 1128 events) for HIV-negative
   individuals, with an adjusted rate ratio of 1.4 {[}95\% confidence
   interval (CI) 1.2-1.7). Compared with HIV-negative individuals,
   HIV-positive individuals with recent CD4(+) cell counts of 500 cells/ml
   at least (rate ratio 1.0, 95\% CI 0.8-1.4) or recent HIV RNA less than
   500 copies/ml (rate ratio 1.1, 95\% CI 0.9-1.4) had no excess risk of
   ischemic stroke, with similar results for HIV-positive individuals with
   nadir CD4(+) cell counts of 500 cells/ml at least (rate ratio 1.4, 95\%
   CI 0.8-2.2) or 200-499 cells/mu l (rate ratio 1.2, 95\% CI 0.9-1.5).
   Among HIV-positive individuals only, recent CD4(+) cell count less than
   200 cells/ml (rate ratio 2.5, 95\% CI 1.3-4.6) was associated with an
   increased risk of ischemic stroke after adjustment for recent HIV RNA
   and nadir CD4(+) cell count, whereas recent HIV RNA and nadir CD4(+)
   were not independent risk factors.
   Conclusion: Ischemic stroke incidence in HIV-positive individuals with
   high CD4(+) cell count or low HIV RNA is similar to that of HIV-negative
   individuals. (C) 2014 Wolters Kluwer Health vertical bar Lippincott

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW C}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{93}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB 29}},
Abstract = {{We study the effects of correlations on cumulants and their ratios of
   net-proton multiplicity distributions which have been measured for
   central (0\%-5\%) Au + Au collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion
   Collider (RHIC). This effect has been studied by assuming individual
   proton and antiproton distributions as a Poisson or negative binomial
   distribution (NBD). In spite of significantly correlated production due
   to baryon number, electric charge conservation, and kinematical
   correlations of protons and antiprotons, the measured cumulants of the
   net-proton distribution follow the independent-production model. In the
   present work we demonstrate how the introduction of the correlations
   will affect the cumulants and their ratios for the difference
   distributions. We have also demonstrated this study using the proton and
   antiproton distributions obtained from the HIJING event generator.}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{This work reports on the dynamic tensile behaviour of an auxetic
   structure, namely, honeycomb with representative re-entrant topology.
   Quasi-static and dynamic tensile tests were conducted by employing MTS
   and Instron VHS 8800 hydraulic testing machines, respectively. The
   re-entrant samples were printed using AlSi12 powder via the selective
   laser melting (SLM) process. The deformation and force - displacement
   curves were of interest A good agreement was observed between the
   numerical simulations and the experimental results. Subsequently,
   numerous finite element (FE) simulations were performed through
   ABAQUS/Explicit. Three deformation modes were classified, especially
   with a tensile shock wave observed within the Localised deformation
   mode. An analytical equation was obtained for the dynamic force of such
   materials under tension, which agrees well with the FE result. The
   effect of loading velocity and cell geometries was considered.}},

Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF DRUG AND ALCOHOL ABUSE}},

Abstract = {{Background: Marijuana use is common among HIV+ individuals, but few
   studies have examined long-term trends in prevalence and correlates of
   use. Methods: We evaluated trends (1984-2013) in the annual prevalence
   of current (past 6-month use) and daily (among current users) marijuana
   use and determined correlates of use among 2742 HIV-seropositive (HIV+)
   and 3172 HIV-seronegative (HIV-) men who have sex with men in the
   Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS). Poisson regression models were
   used to estimate prevalence ratios of marijuana use separately for the
   men who were enrolled before 2001 (early-cohort) and after 2001
   (late-cohort). Results: Over the 29 years of the study, the prevalence
   of current marijuana use declined significantly, whereas daily use among
   users increased among all men in the early and late-cohorts. A HIV+
   status was associated with higher prevalence of marijuana use among the
   men in the early-cohort (adjusted prevalence ratio {[}aPR] = 1.53, 95\%
   confidence interval {[}CI]:1.42, 1.64, p = <0.0001), but not in the men
   in the late-cohort (aPR = 0.90, 95\% CI: 0.79, 1.03, p = 0.1424).
   Alcohol use and cigarette smoking were being positively associated with
   marijuana use. Conclusions: Although the annual prevalence of current
   marijuana use decreased significantly over time in the MACS, daily use
   among users increased significantly. Further, among the HIV+ men, our
   study did not show clinically significant adverse effects of marijuana
   use on highly active antiretroviral therapy use, CD4(+) count, or HIV
   viral load.}},

Title = {{Five different distributions for the Lee-Carter model of mortality
   forecasting: A comparison using GAS models}},
Journal = {{INSURANCE MATHEMATICS \& ECONOMICS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{75}},
Pages = {{48-57}},

Abstract = {{This paper extends the well-known Lee-Carter model used for forecasting
   mortality rates by utilizing a new class of time series models, known as
   Generalized Autoregressive Score (GAS) or Dynamic Conditional Score
   (DCS) models. This framework can be used to derive a wide range of
   non-Gaussian time series models with time varying coefficients and has
   shown to be very successful in financial applications. In this paper we
   propose five probability models (Poisson, binomial, negative binomial,
   Gaussian and beta) based on the GAS framework to estimate the Lee-Carter
   parameters and dynamically forecast the mortality rates using a single
   unified step. The models are applied to the mortality rates time series
   for the male population of the United States, Sweden, Japan and the UK.
   Diagnostic tests are performed on quantile residuals, model selection is
   made via AIC and predictive accuracy of the models is compared using the
   Diebold-Mariano test. We conclude that, amongst the proposed models, the
   negative binomial extension of the Lee-Carter model is the most
   appropriate for forecasting mortality rates. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{We discuss the origin of Warburg's impedance in unsupported electrolytic
   cells containing only one group of positive and one group of negative
   ions. Our analysis is based on the Poisson-Nernst-Planck model, where
   the generation-recombination phenomenon is neglected. We show that to
   observe Warburg-like impedance the diffusion coefficient of the positive
   ions has to differ from that of the negative ones, and furthermore the
   electrodes have to be not blocking. We assume that the nonblocking
   properties of the electrodes can be described by means of an Ohmic
   model, where the charge exchange between the cell and the external
   circuit is described by means of an electrode conductivity. For
   simplicity we consider a symmetric cell. However, our analysis can be
   easily generalized to more complicated situations, where the cell is not
   symmetric and the charge exchange is described by the Chang-Jaffe model,
   or by a linearized version of the Butler-Volmer equation. Our analysis
   allows justification of the expression for Warburg's impedance proposed
   previously by several groups, based on wrong assumptions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a design approach for developing meso-structure for
   high shear flexure in considering distribution of strain energy for a
   unit cell. Currently, flexible components are often designed with
   elastomers to take advantage of their unique properties of low shear
   modulus and high elongation. However, elastomers exhibit high loss
   modulus at a high frequency when they are subjected to cyclic loading.
   As a design requirement to find an alternative material in one of the
   sub systems in the extraterrestrial rover, materials with high
   elongation but low energy loss is investigated using a meso-structure
   design approach. In this paper, an approach to design a meso-structure
   exhibiting shear flexure is developed by conducting comparative studies
   of shear flexure on three equivalent configurations: auxetic, honeycomb,
   and sinusoidal. Based on this comparative study, a new hypothesis is
   proposed that specific strain energy distribution pattern in these
   meso-structure has a direct impact on the high shear flexure
   performance. This proposition is verified by developing a new
   meso-structure, termed `S'-Type, which is compared with auxetic and
   sinusoidal auxetic meso-structures on their shear flexure ability. It is
   shown from this comparative analysis that the `S'-Type meso-structure
   exhibits higher shear flexure than the other two meso-structures at 5,
   10, 20, and 40 MPa of effective shear moduli. Hence, based on this
   result, a four-step design approach is proposed to design future
   meso-structures with high shear flexure.}},

Title = {{Accuracy of Anthropometric Indexes of Obesity to Predict Diabetes
   Mellitus Type 2 Among Men and Women With Hypertension}},

Volume = {{24}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND
   Anthropometric measurements and indexes that assess excess of adiposity
   are associated with cardiovascular risk factors, and predict diabetes
   mellitus.
   METHODS
   This cross-sectional study reported the performance of adiposity indexes
   to detect or turn diabetes unlikely in patients with hypertension.
   Patients with hypertension (blood pressure (BP) >= 140/90 mm Hg or
   antihypertensive drug use) aged 18-80 years, being 150 men and 332
   women, had weight, height, waist circumference (WC), hip circumference,
   body mass index (BMI), waist-hip ratio (WHR), waist-to-height ratio
   (WHtR), and waist-to-square height ratio (WHt(2)R) calculated. Diabetes
   was diagnosed by fasting blood glucose >= 126 mg/dl or antidiabetic drug
   use (23\% of the sample).
   RESULTS
   All anthropometric indexes were associated with diabetes in a modified
   Poisson regression, adjusting forage, smoking, and physical activity, in
   women, but not in men. In men, only the area under the
   receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) for WHR was statistically
   associated with diabetes (0.67,95\% confidence interval (Cl) 0.57-0.77).
   A cutoff of >= 0.95 had sensitivity of 84.6\% (73.3-95.9) and negative
   post-test probability of 12.8\% (3.2-22.4). Among women, WC >88 cm, WHR
   >= 0.85, and WHtR >0.54 had sensitivity >93\% and negative post-test
   probability <7.5\%.
   CONCLUSIONS
   WHR >= 0.85, WC>88.0cm, and WHtR>0.54 for women and WHR >= 0.95 for men
   are highly suggestive of diabetes among this population of hypertensive
   patients. Indexes below these cutoffs turn diabetes unlikely in this
   context. The investigation of reproducibility of this performance in
   other outpatient clinics is warranted.}},

Abstract = {{The term liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) describes a class of materials
   that combine the elastic entropy behaviour associated with conventional
   elastomers with the stimuli responsive properties of anisotropic liquid
   crystals. LCEs consequently exhibit attributes of both elastomers and
   liquid crystals, but additionally have unique properties not found in
   either. Recent developments in LCE synthesis, as well as the
   understanding of the behaviour of liquid crystal elastomers-namely their
   mechanical, optical and responsive properties-is of significant
   relevance to biology and biomedicine. LCEs are abundant in nature,
   highlighting the potential use of LCEs in biomimetics. Their exceptional
   tensile properties and biocompatibility have led to research exploring
   their applications in artificial tissue, biological sensors and cell
   scaffolds by exploiting their actuation and shock absorption properties.
   There has also been significant recent interest in using LCEs as a model
   for morphogenesis. This review provides an overview of some aspects of
   LCEs which are of relevance in different branches of biology and
   biomedicine, as well as discussing how recent LCE advances could impact
   future applications.}},

Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{226}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{This paper introduces a class of honeycomb composite metamaterials
   whereby the increase and decrease in temperature give rise to opposing
   microstructural geometries in situ, thereby leading to Poisson's ratio
   of opposing signs. The metamaterial consists of rigid crossbeams from
   which alternating bimaterials are joined onto. Four types of this class
   of metamaterial, depending on the relative location of the bimaterial
   phase with higher coefficient of thermal expansion within each unit
   cell, have been identified. The O-Type and X-Type metamaterials, in
   which each unit cell has 2 axes of symmetry, exhibit sign-reversal of
   Poisson's ratio upon temperature change sign reversal. The CC-Type has
   one axis of symmetry in each unit cell while the SS-Type possesses a
   180-degree rotational symmetry; these metamaterial types display zero
   Poisson's ratio and zero thermal expansion in a specific direction. This
   class of metamaterial avails to the practising engineer the possibility
   of designing materials and structures with in situ sign-switchable
   Poisson's ratio by means of thermal-toggling, as well as those that
   require good dimensional stability.}},

Abstract = {{Sea pens, particularly Pennatula aculeata Danielssen, are major
   components of the megafauna in the Gulf of Maine, USA.  A review of
   three separate collections (National Marine Fisheries Service, Woods
   Hole; University of Maine; Smithsonian Institution), as well as recent
   submersible and remotely operated vehicle survey work, have shown that
   this single species is fairly ubiquitous.  It is, however, more
   prevalent in the eastern part of the Gulf and is almost absent from
   Wilkinson Basin in the west.  The spatial distribution of sea pens was
   photographically documented on four submersible dive transects in the
   eastern and central Gulf of Maine in 1983.  The degree of contagion of
   sea pen populations was evaluated using the variance-to-mean ratio and
   Morisita's index of dispersion.  In all cases these indices were > 1,
   suggesting a contagious distribution.  Both Poisson and negative
   binomial probability distributions were fitted to the data.  The
   negative binomial was the best descriptor of the distributions on three
   transects.  On one transect, neither distributional model had a
   significant fit at the 5\% level.  The effect of quadrat size (7, 3, and
   1.24 m2).  The pattern for the smallest quadrat size showed a
   significant fit to both Poisson and negative binomial distributions,
   while the Poisson distribution did not fit the data for the larger
   quadrats.  The density of sea pens in individual photographs varied from
   0 to 8 m-2 in Georges Basin, but density estimates were slightly
   confounded by the ability of sea pens to withdraw into their burrows,
   completely below the sediment surface.  Behavioral observations in situ
   on Jeffreys Bank in 1986 were made using a manned submersible to observe
   the withdrawal and extension of specified sea pens.  Seventeen sea pens
   were monitored on five dives over 24 h; two specimens withdrew
   completely, and another individual extended from a fully withdrawn
   position.  During the observation period, 88\% of the sea pens remained
   fully extended.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the static and dynamic (phononic) elastic behavior of
   fractal-cut materials. These materials are novel in the sense that they
   deform by rotation of ``rigid{''} units rather than by straining these
   units, can be fabricated by exploiting a simple cutting paradigm, and
   have properties that can be manipulated by control of the cut pattern
   and its hierarchy. We show that variation of fractal-cut level and cut
   pattern can be exploited to manipulate the symmetry of the elastic
   constant tensor, the elastic limit of deformation, and, therefore, the
   elastic response. By studying phonon behavior, we demonstrate how some
   cut symmetries naturally open acoustic band gaps. Several of the
   important features of the band structure can be directly related to the
   static elastic properties. Based upon our phonon calculations, we
   predict the acoustic transmission spectrum of an example fractal-cut
   structure and validated it through 3D printing and sound attenuation
   experiments. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A nonlinear mechanics model of bio-inspired hierarchical lattice
   materials consisting of horseshoe microstructures}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICS AND PHYSICS OF SOLIDS}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Development of advanced synthetic materials that can mimic the
   mechanical properties of non-mineralized soft biological materials has
   important implications in a wide range of technologies. Hierarchical
   lattice materials constructed with horseshoe microstructures belong to
   this class of bio-inspired synthetic materials, where the mechanical
   responses can be tailored to match the nonlinear J-shaped stress-strain
   curves of human skins. The underlying relations between the J-shaped
   stress-strain curves and their microstructure geometry are essential in
   designing such systems for targeted applications. Here, a theoretical
   model of this type of hierarchical lattice material is developed by
   combining a finite deformation constitutive relation of the building
   block (i.e., horseshoe microstructure), with the analyses of equilibrium
   and deformation compatibility in the periodical lattices. The nonlinear
   J-shaped stress-strain curves and Poisson ratios predicted by this model
   agree very well with results of finite element analyses (FEA) and
   experiment. Based on this model, analytic solutions were obtained for
   some key mechanical quantities, e.g., elastic modulus, Poisson ratio,
   peak modulus, and critical strain around which the tangent modulus
   increases rapidly. A negative Poisson effect is revealed in the
   hierarchical lattice with triangular topology, as opposed to a positive
   Poisson effect in hierarchical lattices with Kagome and honeycomb
   topologies. The lattice topology is also found to have a strong
   influence on the stress-strain curve. For the three isotropic lattice
   topologies (triangular, Kagome and honeycomb), the hierarchical
   triangular lattice material renders the sharpest transition in the
   stress-strain curve and relative high stretchability, given the same
   porosity and arc angle of horseshoe microstructure. Furthermore, a
   demonstrative example illustrates the utility of the developed model in
   the rapid optimization of hierarchical lattice materials for reproducing
   the desired stress-strain curves of human skins. This study provides
   theoretical guidelines for future designs of soft bio-mimetic materials
   with hierarchical lattice constructions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{As 3D printing gets more popular in many industrial areas, 3D printing
   researchers have focused mainly on designing and developing cellular
   structures for material minimization and better mechanical performances.
   In the present paper, twelve samples were fabricated by fused deposition
   modeling in PLA, and corresponding numerical simulations for each sample
   are implemented in Abaqus/Explicit. As the honeycomb structures and the
   re-entrant structures are impressive due to desirable mechanical
   performances and light-weight, much research has been carried out. Some
   researchers attempted to come up with new hybrid structures by combining
   the honeycomb and re-entrant auxetic. In this study, two new hybrid
   structures are developed, studied, and compared with basic structures
   with respect to the mechanical properties both experimentally and
   numerically. According to the experiment and numerical simulation
   results, the newly-designed hybrid structures are of better mechanical
   performances than the basic honeycomb and the re-entrant auxetic
   separately. During the fabrication of the samples, the material of 18 g,
   14 g, 10 g, and 14 g in amount was used for H\_A, H\_B, honeycomb as
   well as re-entrant auxetic, respectively. According to the stress-strain
   curve, the former two show better performance. Therefore, the material
   during 3D printing can be minimized by changing the inner structure of
   the objects being printed. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We consider a parameter-driven regression model for binary time series,

   As a remedial measure, in this article, we propose a modified GLM
   estimation procedure and show that the resulting estimator is consistent
   and asymptotically normal. Moreover, we develop two procedures for
   estimating the asymptotic covariance matrix of the estimator and
   establish their consistency property. Simulation studies are conducted

Abstract = {{We investigate, using an analytical and a numerical model, the in-plane
   stiffness of fiber mats. A mat is modeled by randomly depositing thin
   linear-elastic fibers on top of each other under the influence of an
   external pressure. The external pressure has the effect of bending the
   fibers over each other. The fibers are assumed rigidly bonded at
   contacts. For a low external pressure the stiffness of the mat deviates
   from that of its two-dimensional projection only by a geometrical
   factor, and the effective Poisson contraction is close to zero. For
   higher pressures, stiffness is governed by two competing effects and a
   maximum appears in the stiffness. The effective Poisson ratio is clearly
   negative in this range. An approximative analytical description is
   developed for the stiffness of mats formed under low external pressure.
   The stiffness is given as a function of only a few parameters: the
   degree of bonding, the dimensions of the fibers, the elastic constants
   of the fiber material, and the density of fibers. (C) 2000 American

Abstract = {{College students, as a large part of young adults, are a vulnerable
   group to several risky behaviors including smoking and drug abuse. This
   study aimed to utilize and to compare count regression models to
   identify correlates of cigarette smoking among college students. This
   was a cross-sectional study conducted on students of Hamadan University
   of Medical Sciences. The Poisson, negative binomial, generalized
   Poisson, exponentiated-exponential geometric regression models and their
   zero-inflated counterparts were fitted and compared using the Vuong test
   (alpha = 0.05). A number of 1258 students participated in this study.
   The majority of students were female (60.8\%) and their average age was
   23 years. Most of the students were non-smokers (84.6\%). Negative
   binomial regression was selected as the most appropriate model for
   analyzing the data (comparable fit and simpler interpretation). The
   significant correlates of the number of cigarettes smoked per day
   included gender (male: incident-rate-ratio (IRR = 9.21), birth order
   (Forth: IRR = 1.99), experiencing a break-up (IRR = 2.11), extramarital
   sex (heterosexual (IRR = 2.59), homosexual (IRR = 3.13) vs. none), and
   drug abuse (IRR = 5.99). Our findings revealed that several high-risk
   behaviors were associated with the intensity of smoking, suggesting that
   these behaviors should be considered in smoking cessation intervention
   programs for college students.}},

Abstract = {{In previous research, the authors have produced and analysed a model of
   an electrical double layer, demonstrating the positiveness of the zeta
   potential arising when aluminium particles are introduced into distilled
   water. Further, they were able to demonstrate that an increase in
   conductivity led to the appearance of a negative zeta potential. The
   same type of phenomenon can also be found when the electrostatic
   potential energies are sought by applying the Poisson-Boltzmann
   equation.
   The present paper provides an additional comparison of these two double
   layer models obtained from experimental measurements and from
   calculation respectively. From the comparison, a value of 5.3x10(-11)
   m(2)/s is deduced for the coefficient of molecular diffusion. This is
   close to the value of 7.35x10(-11) m(2)/s given by the Chemical Handbook
   for polyethylene oxide.}},

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional (3D) printing or additive manufacturing, as a
   revolutionary technology for future advanced manufacturing, usually
   prints parts with poor control of complex gradients for functional

   two-stage curing ink to obtain functionally graded materials with the
   mechanical gradient up to three orders of magnitude and high resolution.
   To demonstrate the g-DLP, we show the direct fabrication of complex
   2D/3D lattices with controlled buckling and deformation sequence,
   negative Poisson's ratio metamaterial, presurgical models with stiffness
   variations, composites for 4D printing, and anti-counterfeiting 3D

Abstract = {{Auxetic-like strain states were generated in self-assembled
   nanocomposite thin films of (Ba0.6Sr0.4TiO3)(1-x) - (Sm2O3)(x)(BSTO -
   SmO). A switch from auxetic-like to elastic-like strain behavior was
   observed for x > 0.50, when the SmO switched from being nanopillars in
   the BSTO matrix to being the matrix with BSTO nanopillars embedded in
   it. A simple model was adopted to explain how in-plane strain varies
   with x. At high x (0.75), strongly enhanced ferroelectric properties
   were obtained compared to pure BSTO films. The nanocomposite method
   represents a powerful new way to tune the properties of a wide range of
   strongly correlated metal oxides whose properties are very sensitive to

Abstract = {{We study a phase-field variational model for the solvation of charged
   molecules with an implicit solvent. The solvation free-energy functional
   of all phase fields consists of the surface energy, solute excluded
   volume and solute-solvent van der Waals dispersion energy, and
   electrostatic free energy. The surface energy is defined by the van der
   Waals-Cahn-Hilliard functional with squared gradient and a double-well
   potential. The electrostatic part of free energy is defined through the
   electrostatic potential governed by the Poisson-Boltzmann equation in
   which the dielectric coefficient is defined through the underlying phase
   field. We prove the continuity of the electrostatics-its potential, free
   energy, and dielectric boundary force-with respect to the perturbation
   of the dielectric boundary. We also prove the -convergence of the
   phase-field free-energy functionals to their sharp-interface limit, and
   the equivalence of the convergence of total free energies to that of all
   individual parts of free energy. We finally prove the convergence of
   phase-field forces to their sharp-interface limit. Such forces are
   defined as the negative first variations of the free-energy functional;
   and arise from stress tensors. In particular, we obtain the force
   convergence for the van der Waals-Cahn-Hilliard functionals with minimal
   assumptions.}},

Abstract = {{We study elasticity of spontaneously orientationally ordered amorphous
   solids, characterized by a vanishing transverse shear modulus, as
   realized by nematic elastomers and gels. We show that local
   heterogeneities and elastic nonlinearities conspire to lead to anomalous
   nonlocal universal elasticity controlled by a nontrivial infrared fixed
   point. Namely, such solids are characterized by universal shear and
   bending moduli that, respectively, vanish and diverge at long scales,
   are universally incompressible, and exhibit a universal negative Poisson
   ratio and a non-Hookean elasticity down to arbitrarily low strains.
   Based on expansion about five dimensions, we argue that the nematic
   order is stable to thermal fluctuation and local heterogeneities down to
   d(lc)<3.}},

   structures (constant, proportional to effort and proportional to the
   squared effort) and their magnitudes (tail weight). The Jackknife
   approach of the index is recommended, whenever catch is proportional to
   effort or even under small deviations from proportionality assumption,
   when a ratio estimator is to be applied and little is known about the
   underlying behaviour of variables, as is the case for most fishery

Abstract = {{The effect of the desorption of hydrogen on the mechanical
   characteristics and electronic structure of the armchair conformation of
   graphane is studied in the context of the nonorthogonal tight-binding
   model. It is shown that the mechanical stiffness and the Poisson ratio
   nonmonotonically depend on the hydrogen content and take minimum values
   at a hydrogen vacancy content of similar to 50\% and similar to 30\%,
   respectively. As hydrogen is desorbed, the characteristic peaks of the
   phonon density of states are rapidly reduced. In the initial stage of
   desorption, local energy levels are formed in the band gap. As the
   number of hydrogen vacancies is increased, these levels form an impurity
   band, in which the Fermi level is located.}},

Abstract = {{Inter-tube cross-linking of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is an effective

Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{3139-3147}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The Tokunaga cyclic model describes average network topology. A
   stochastic generalization is proposed. The stochastic model assumes that
   actual tributary numbers are random realizations from a negative
   binomial distribution whose mean is defined by the Tokunaga parameters
   epsilon(1) and K. These parameters can be interpreted as representing
   the effects of regional controls. Upon these regional controls is
   superimposed an inherent spatial variability in network topology. A
   third parameter alpha characterizes this spatial variability. When alpha
   becomes large, the negative binomial model approaches a Poisson model. A
   goodness-of-fit test based on a chi(2) test statistic is developed, and
   an inference framework for estimation of parameters and stream-related
   statistics is described. This methodology is illustrated on tributary
   data from three catchments, one of the order of 5 and two of the order
   of 8. It is shown that the stochastic Tokunaga model using the negative
   binomial distribution is not inconsistent with the tributary data,
   whereas the Poisson model is unambiguously rejected by the data. Monte
   Carlo Bayesian methods are used to evaluate the uncertainty in the
   Tokunaga parameters and in stream number related statistics such as the
   bifurcation ratio. It is shown that tributary data from the order-5
   network provide little power for discriminating between model
   hypotheses. The tributary data for the two order-8 basins are
   significantly different from the asymptotic stream number statistics
   predicted by Shreve's random network model. Finally, the problem of
   space filling or preservation of nontopological properties is considered
   in the context of the stochastic Tokunaga model.}},

Journal = {{THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{66}},
Number = {{3-4}},
Pages = {{211-227}},
Abstract = {{Rainfall anomaly patterns are obtained for the city of Barcelona from a
   statistical and a spectral point of view. The time series consists of
   monthly rainfall amounts recorded over 128 years without interruption.
   Monthly positive and negative anomalies, obtained as the difference
   between monthly amounts and monthly threshold values, are used for both
   types of analyses. The threshold levels are derived form the deciles of
   theoretical monthly rainfall distributions, which have been previously
   modelled by the gamma distribution. Positive anti negative anomalies of
   the monthly rain amounts are investigated fur these threshold levels.
   The statistical analysis is applied to each decile considered, yielding
   empirical exponential laws that can be used to forecast the cumulative
   number of episodes of consecutive months with either positive or
   negative anomalies equalling or exceeding a fixed length. A set of
   linear laws, relating the expected rainfall amount cumulated during an
   episode of a fixed length, is also deduced. It is worthy of mention
   that, independently of the decile considered, all the exponential and
   linear laws have satisfactory regression coefficients. Ar the same time,
   it has also been possible to establish the evolution of the coefficients
   of these laws with respect to the different deciles considered. The
   exponential laws for episodes of positive and negative anomalies are the
   starting point, together with two hypotheses, to model probabilities of
   repeated long episodes over an arbitrary number of years and their
   return periods in terms of the Poisson distribution model. Moreover,
   power spectra are derived for anomalies relative to the 50\% decile at
   monthly and seasonal scale. The spectral estimates obtained are then
   compared with theoretical spectra deduced from possible Markovian or
   random behaviour of the time series of anomalies. Finally, the
   significant spectral peaks are discussed and compared with other
   significant spectral components deduced for some areas of the
   Mediterranean domain.}},

Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{203}},
Pages = {{142-152}},

Abstract = {{Chiral-type cells consisting of rigid nodes and rotatable ligaments
   provide an opportunity to develop lightweight engineering structures
   with unique mechanical performances. For a 2D or 3D chiral-type cellular
   structure system with a periodic arrangement of chiral cells, a distinct
   rotational response will present because of the asymmetrical and
   geometrical configuration. In this article, a tetra-chiral cylindrical
   shell is proposed on the basis of natural plant architecture. This shell
   exhibits a reversible bi-directional twisting deformation in the axial
   compression and tension processes. A theoretical model is proposed via
   the geometrical parameters of cells to describe the relationship between
   twist angle and axial displacement. Two categories of tetra-chiral
   cylindrical shell specimens are fabricated utilizing additive
   manufacturing technique involving the application of nylon and AlSi10Mg
   materials. Uniaxial compressive tests and finite element simulation are
   conducted to reveal the twist deformation mechanism. Results verify that
   the twist characteristics of the chiral-type shell, which are adjustable
   in terms of the rotational direction and angle, are only related to the
   distribution and geometrical sizes of ligaments. The innovative
   chiral-type cylindrical shell provide a new design strategy which can be
   used in engineering applications as compress- or stretch-twist coupled
   smart actuators, biomechanical devices, and micro sensors.}},

Abstract = {{The electric field effect (EFE) in a coaxial cylindrical capacitor

   thermoelectric properties of the semiconductors PbTe and Bi2Te3 as glass

   basis of Poisson equation in cylindrical geometry with corresponding
   boundary conditions. The radial dependences of transport characteristics
   have been calculated for PbTe and Bi2Te3 wires at positive and negative
   polarity of the gate voltage under the assumption that the carrier
   mobility is similar with the bulk material mobility. Some aspects of
   microwire fabrication by different methods as well as some general wire
   characteristics are presented. The first results of experimental
   measurements of wire transport properties under EFE show the increasing
   or decreasing of the average Seebeck coefficient in dependence of gate
   potential polarity in accordance with the theoretical analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Water and hydrous minerals play a key part in geodynamic processes at
   subduction zones(1-3) by weakening the plate boundary, aiding slip and
   permitting subduction - and indeed plate tectonics - to occur(4). The
   seismological signature of water within the forearc mantle wedge is
   evident in anomalies with low seismic shear velocity marking
   serpentinization(5-7). However, seismological observations bearing on
   the presence of water within the subducting plate itself are less well
   documented. Here we use converted teleseismic waves to obtain
   observations of anomalously high Poisson's ratios within the subducted
   oceanic crust from the Cascadia continental margin to its intersection
   with forearc mantle. On the basis of pressure, temperature and
   compositional considerations, the elevated Poisson's ratios indicate
   that water is pervasively present in fluid format pore pressures near
   lithostatic values. Combined with observations of a strong negative
   velocity contrast at the top of the oceanic crust, our results imply
   that the megathrust is a low- permeability boundary. The transition from
   a low- to high- permeability plate interface down dip into the mantle
   wedge is explained by hydrofracturing of the seal by volume changes
   across the interface caused by the onset of crustal eclogitization and
   mantle serpentinization. These results may have important implications
   for our understanding of seismogenesis, subduction zone structure and
   the mechanism of episodic tremor and slip.}},

Abstract = {{Brillouin scattering on surface acoustic waves is a very powerful tool
   to determine the elastic constants of intermediate valent crystals,
   since the method is non-destructive and no mechanical contact is needed.
   A strong evidence for intermediate valence is a negative value of
   Poisson's ratio, which describes the behavior of the volume under
   uniaxial pressure.
   SmS by itself makes a semiconductor-metal transition at a pressure of
   more than 6.5 kbar. When substituting the divalent Sm by a trivalent
   cation, like Y, La or Tm. SmS can become - depending on the doping
   concentration - intermediate valent without any applied, external
   pressure. In this work, we will present measurements of the velocities
   of the surface acoustic waves and the calculation of the elastic
   constants of La-and Tm-doped SmS compounds. We found a clear dependence
   of Poisson's ratio on the doping concentration and on the valence of the
   materials. Furthermore, we will discuss the mechanism leading to
   intermediate valence when substituting Sm. Besides the internal,
   chemical pressure, which is produced by the built in trivalent cations
   with their smaller ionic radii, we have clear evidence, that the free
   electrons in the 5d band, induced by the substituting atoms, also play
   an important role in making doped SmS intermediate valent. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{The frequency-wavenumber spectra of laminated media often exhibit
   anomalous modes with descending branches whose group velocity is
   negative, and these terminate at a minimum point at which the group
   velocity transitions from negative to positive. These minima are
   associated with resonant conditions in the medium, which have been
   clearly observed in experiments and in the nondestructive testing of
   laminated plates. Starting from first principles, this paper provides a
   theoretical analysis on the number and location of such
   zero-group-velocity (ZGV) modes for horizontally layered media bounded
   by any arbitrary combination of external boundaries. It is found that
   these ZGV points are few in number and show up mostly in low-order modes
   which are characterized by a negative second derivative at the cutoff
   frequencies, a condition that can readily be tested. It is also shown
   that the effective number of ZGVs is small even when the ratio of the
   dilatational and shear wave velocity is a rational number and there
   exist coincidences in cutoff frequencies, a condition that at first
   would suggest that the number of ZGVs is infinite. Finally, it is shown
   that the number of ZGVs decreases with the Poisson's ratio. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Cellular materials have a high strength-to-weight ratio, which is good
   for lightweight structural applications. In order to accelerate the
   commercial use of cellular materials in the structural applications, a
   well understanding of fracture behavior of cellular materials is
   required in terms of structural integrity. The objective of the study is
   to develop a predictive model on fracture behavior of orthotropic
   cellular polymers, prepared from an additive manufacturing method, under
   the mode-I macroscopic loading. The constituent material's fracture
   properties are obtained from the three-point bending test of samples
   with a notched crack. Using the base material's properties, a model on
   fracture toughness of hexagonal honeycombs with a varying cell angle is
   developed using a linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) model of a
   cell wall material. Numerical and experimental tests will follow to
   validate the model.}},

Abstract = {{Transformation optics is a powerful concept for designing novel optical
   components such as high transmission waveguides and cloaking devices.
   The selection of specific transformations is a non-unique problem. Here
   we reveal that transformations which allow for all dielectric and
   broadband optical realizations correspond to minimizers of elastic
   energy potentials for extreme values of the mechanical Poisson's ratio
   v. For TE (H-z) polarized light an incompressible transformation v = 1/2
   is ideal and for TM (E-z) polarized light one should use a compressible
   transformation with negative Poissons's ratio v = -1. For the TM
   polarization the mechanical analogy corresponds to a modified Liao
   functional known from the transformation optics literature. Finally, the
   analogy between ideal transformations and solid mechanical material
   models automates and broadens the concept of transformation optics. (c)

Abstract = {{The stability and geometrical, mechanical, and electronic properties of
   monolayer carbon sulfur (CS) systems with honeycomb-like structure are
   studied by using first-principles calculations based on density
   functional theory. The results demonstrate that the honeycomb-like CS
   systems with two types of structure (buckled and puckered) are quite
   stable. It is found that such puckered and buckled CS nanosheets possess
   indirect gaps of 1.952 and 2.325 eV, respectively. Interestingly, both
   puckered and buckled CS monolayer materials exhibit negative
   out-of-plane Poisson's ratio, most likely originating from their
   puckered and buckled nature. Moreover, their bandgap can be effectively
   modulated by altering bond and bond lengths under uni- and biaxial
   strains. Meanwhile, an indirect-to-direct gap transition occurs in both
   monolayers, which is a useful feature for addressing the electron
   transition difficulties observed for intrinsic indirect nanosheets,
   thereby enabling their use in solar cells and light-emitting diodes. In
   particular, the Dirac-like cones of the puckered CS monolayer are
   identified in the band structure on the application of appropriate
   zigzag tensile strain. The results of the present calculations are very
   interesting for the selection of monolayer CS materials for use in
   electronic devices and provide a promising method to engineer their
   electronic characteristics for potential applications in future
   electronic and optoelectronic devices.}},

Abstract = {{A device for supporting soft rock masses combined with a constant
   resistance structure characterized by constant resistance and large
   deformation at the end of a steel bar, known as the constant resistance
   and large deformation (CRLD) bolt, has recently been developed to
   counteract soft rock swelling that often occurs during deep mining. In
   order to further study the mechanical properties of the CRLD bolt, we
   investigated its mechanical properties by comparison with the
   conventional strength bolt (rebar) using static pull tests on many
   aspects, including supporting capacity, elongation, radial deformation,
   and energy absorption. The tests verified that the mechanical defects of
   the rebar, which include the decrease of bolt diameter, reduction of
   supporting capacity, and emergence and evolution of fracture until
   failure during the whole pull process, were caused by the Poisson's
   ratio effect. Due to the special structure set on the CRLD bolt, the
   bolt presents a seemingly unusual phenomenon of the negative Poisson's
   ratio effect, i.e., the diameter of the constant resistance structure
   increases while under-pulling. It is the very effect that ensures the
   extraordinary mechanical properties, including high resistance, large
   elongation, and strong energy absorption. According to the comparison
   and analysis of numerical simulation and field test, we can conclude
   that the CRLD bolt works better than the rebar bolt.}},

   used, including some with negative Poisson's ratio. The bending response
   was investigated and compared with beam-theory predictions. Most of the

   compliance was relatively high and dominated by the face sheets. Two of
   the core configurations were `'soft{''} and exhibited behavior governed
   by core shear. The relative dimensions of the cores evaluated in this

Abstract = {{A micromechanics model and a computational homogenization method were
   developed to examine the macroscopic elastoplasticity and yield behavior
   of closed-cell porous materials with varied inner gas pressures. For the
   uniaxial stress-strain relation of the porous material, the
   micromechanics model coincides well with the numerical homogenization,
   especially for the case of relatively low porosity and gas pressures.
   The effects of the combination of the different gas pressures on the
   uniaxial stress-strain curve, the nominal Poisson's ratio, yield surface
   and initial yield strength of the material are systematically
   investigated. The multiple gas pressures can induce the
   tension-compression asymmetry of the uniaxial stress-strain curves and
   the nominal Poisson's ratio of nonlinear deformation. In particular it
   is shown that when the multiple gas pressures coincide, the yield
   surface of the porous material with inner gas pressures can be simply
   obtained from that of the porous material without inner pressures by a
   shift along the negative direction of the hydrostatic stress axis.
   However, when the multiple pressures are different, in addition to a
   translation along the hydrostatic axis, the yield surface undergoes a
   change in shape and size, and the maximal equivalent stress is lowered
   by a difference in gas pressures. Furthermore, the multiple gas
   pressures have a significant effect to reduce the yield strength of the
   closed cell porous materials. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Mechanical metamaterials are engineered materials whose structures give
   them novel mechanical properties, including negative Poisson's ratios,
   negative compressibilities and phononic bandgaps. Of particular interest
   are systems near the point of mechanical instability, which recently
   have been shown to distribute force and motion in robust ways determined
   by a nontrivial topological state. Here we discuss the classification of
   and propose a design principle for mechanical metamaterials that can be
   easily and reversibly transformed between states with dramatically
   different mechanical and acoustic properties via a soft strain.
   Remarkably, despite the low energetic cost of this transition,
   quantities such as the edge stiffness and speed of sound can change by
   orders of magnitude. We show that the existence and form of a soft
   deformation directly determines floppy edge modes and phonon dispersion.
   Finally, we generalize the soft strain to generate domain structures
   that allow further tuning of the material.}},

Abstract = {{This analysis aims to quantify the effect that the probability of
   bagging game will have on the demand for recreational hunting. A two
   equation structural model has been developed which allows the
   probability of bagging game to be simultaneously entered into the travel
   cost model. The basic model is based on a Poisson distribution for the
   travel cost, and a Negative Binomial distribution is used to deal with
   the issue of overdispersion. Likelihood ratio tests and non-nested model
   selection tests have been adopted to choose the model which best fits
   the data. The results show that a Negative Binomial structural model is
   the best and the probability of bagging game has a significant effect on
   the travel cost model. The welfare per hunting day is around \$300. (C)

Abstract = {{Because of the particular characteristics of layered materials,
   searching for new two-dimensional (2D) structures has become the
   foundation of future device manufacture. Using first-principles
   calculations and theoretical analysis, we identified a new monolayer B2O
   and systematically investigated its fundamental mechanical and
   electronic properties, especially under strain. Due to the complicated
   puckered hinge structure of monolayer B2O, it possesses an intrinsic
   negative Poisson's ratio of -0.021. Moreover, we found that the
   superconducting state of monolayer B2O can be improved, where strain
   plays an effective role in regulating the properties of the 2D material.
   The current results elucidate the structure and corresponding properties
   of monolayer B2O, which may stimulate related fundamental research and

   addition, we introduce a torsion spring to model the crease line of the
   TMP in order to study nonlinear wave dynamics. We derive analytical
   expression of the crease line's motions, where the folding behavior of
   the crease line provides nonlinear force-displacement responses both in
   compression and tension. These unusual characteristics lead to potential
   applications in impact absorption or energy transportation.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To assess the relationship between sense of coherence (SOC)
   and oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) among children aged one
   to three years. Participants: A cross-sectional study was conducted with
   276 mother-child pairs randomly selected from the city of Diamantina,
   Brazil. Method: Information was obtained on socio-demographic factors.
   The short version of Antonovsky's sense of coherence scale (SOC 13) and
   the Early Childhood Oral Health Impact Scale (ECOHIS) were administered.
   The children were examined for dental caries. Statistical analysis
   involved descriptive statistics, the calculation of Spearman's
   correlation coefficients and adjusted Poisson regression models.
   Results: SOC was significantly associated with the child's OHRQoL in the
   multivariate analysis. Children of mothers with high SOC (PR 0.96;
   95\%CI 0.93,0.98; p=0.045) had a lower prevalence of a negative impact
   on OHRQoL. Children with severe dental caries had a greater prevalence
   of a negative impact on OHRQoL (PR 2.53; 95\%CI 1.77,3.62; p<0.001).
   Conclusions: Maternal SOC could be a psychosocial determinant of the
   OHRQoL of children aged one to three years. Severe dental caries was
   associated with poorer quality of life.}},

Abstract = {{Phosphorene, an emerging two-dimensional material, has received
   considerable attention due to its layer-controlled direct bandgap, high
   carrier mobility, negative Poisson's ratio and unique in-plane
   anisotropy. As cousins of phosphorene, 2D group-VA arsenene, antimonene
   and bismuthene have also garnered tremendous interest due to their
   intriguing structures and fascinating electronic properties. 2D group-VA
   family members are opening up brand-new opportunities for their
   multifunctional applications encompassing electronics, optoelectronics,
   topological spintronics, thermoelectrics, sensors, Li-or Na-batteries.
   In this review, we extensively explore the latest theoretical and
   experimental progress made in the fundamental properties, fabrications
   and applications of 2D group-VA materials, and offer perspectives and
   challenges for the future of this emerging field.}},

   macroscale mechanical properties through the three-dimensional
   structural manipulation of low-dimensional subcomponents. Such
   composites could be useful in MEMS actuators based on highly compliant
   mechanisms, or in mechanical metamaterials with highly anisotropic
   mechanical properties (e.g., negative Poisson ratio). The presented
   composites possess a multilayer structure comprising alternating high
   modulus and low modulus subcomponent materials (i.e., permalloy
   (Ni80Fe20) and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) elastomer), within which
   lithographically-patterned pores are present. By controlling the pore
   geometries/orientations and the individual metal/elastomer layer
   thicknesses in the microscale, in-plane and out-of-plane mechanical
   properties (i.e., tensile and bending moduli) are substantially
   tailored.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose Suspected diabetogenic effects or drug indication may increase
   testing for diabetes mellitus (DM), resulting in measurement bias when
   evaluating diabetogenic drug effects. We sought to evaluate the validity
   of electronic health record data in determining DM risk.
   Methods We used time-dependent Cox proportional hazard models within a
   retrospective cohort design to assess associations between use of
   antihypertensives, statins, atypical antipsychotics, and
   antidepressants, and two endpoints: (i) DM onset defined as fasting
   blood glucose (BG) >= 126 mg/dl, random BG >= 200 mg/dl, HbA1c >= 7.0\%,
   or antidiabetic drug initiation; and (ii) first negative DM test. We
   used Poisson regression to assess the influence of these drugs on DM
   testing rates. Patients aged 35-64 years enrolled in Kaiser Permanente
   Northwest between 1997 and 2010 entered the cohort at the first negative
   BG test after >= 6 months without manifest DM.
   Results All drug classes showed significant associations not only with
   DM onset but also with first negative BG test and with DM testing rates.
   Antipsychotics had the greatest diabetogenic risk (adjusted hazard ratio
   {[}HR] = 1.73 {[}1.44-2.08]), the greatest propensity for a first
   negative test (adjusted HR = 1.87 {[}1.74-2.01]), and the highest
   testing rate (adjusted rate ratio = 1.76 {[}1.72-1.81]. Although
   renin-angiotensin system blockers and calcium channel blockers have
   shown no diabetogenic risk in clinical trials, both were associated with
   DM (HR= 1.19 {[}1.12-1.26] and 1.27 {[}1.17-1.38]), a negative glucose
   test (1.38 {[}1.35-1.41] and 1.24 {[}1.20-1.28]), and increased testing
   rates (rate ratio = 1.26 {[}1.24-1.27] and 1.27 {[}1.25-1.28]).
   Conclusion Caution should be used when diabetogenic risk is evaluated
   using data that rely on DM testing in general practice. Copyright (C)

Title = {{Towards an Integrated Methodology for Model and Variable Selection Using
   Count Data: An Application to Micro-Retail Distribution in Urban Studies}},
Journal = {{URBAN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Over the last two decades, a growing number of works in urban studies
   have revealed how micro-retail distribution is significantly related to
   specific properties of the urban built environment. While a wide variety
   of urban form measures have been investigated using sophisticated
   analytical approaches, the same attention has not equally been found in
   statistical procedures. Several essential features of micro-retail
   statistical distribution and modelling assumptions are frequently
   overlooked, compromising the statistical robustness of outcomes. In this
   work we focus on four main aspects: (i) the discrete, non-negative and
   highly skewed nature of store distribution; (ii) its zero-inflation;
   (iii) assessment of the contextual effect; and (iv) the
   multicollinearity generated by the inclusion of highly related urban
   descriptors. To overcome these limitations, we propose an integrated
   methodological framework for both modelling and variable selection
   assessment based on generalized linear models (GLMs) and elastic-net
   (Enet) penalized regression (PR), respectively. The procedure is tested
   via a real case study of the French Riviera, which is described using a
   large dataset of 105 street-based urban form measures. The outcomes of
   this procedure show the superiority of the zero-inflate negative
   binomial count regression approach. A restricted number of urban form
   properties are found to be related to the micro-retail distribution
   depending on the specific scale and morphological context under
   analysis.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the throughput for wireless network with
   full-duplex radios using stochastic geometry. Fullduplex (FD) radios can
   exchange data simultaneously with each other. On the other hand, the
   downside of FD transmission is that it will inevitably cause extra
   interference to the network compared to half-duplex (HD) transmission.
   Moreover, the residual self-interference has negative effects on the
   network throughput. In this paper, we focus on a wireless network of
   nodes with both HD and FD capabilities and derive and optimize the
   throughput in such a network. Our analytical result shows that if the
   network is adopting an ALOHA protocol, the maximal throughput is
   achieved by scheduling all concurrently transmitting nodes to work in
   either FD mode or HD mode depending on one simple condition. Moreover,
   the effects of imperfect self-interference cancellation on the
   signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) loss and throughput are also analyzed
   based on our mathematical model. We rigorously quantify the impact of
   imperfect self-interference cancellation on the throughput gain,
   transmission range, and other metrics, and we establish the minimum
   amount of self-interference suppression needed for FD to be beneficial.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a computational framework for computational
   design and additive manufacturing of spatial free-form periodic
   metasurfaces. The proposed scheme rests on the level-set based topology
   approach and the conformal mapping theory. A 2D unit cell of
   metamaterial with tailored effective properties is created using the
   level-set based topology optimization method. The achieved unit cell is
   further mapped to the 3D quad meshes on a free-form surface by applying
   the conformal mapping method which can preserve the local shape and
   angle when mapping the 2D design to a 3D surface. The proposed level-set
   based optimization methods not only can act as a motivator for design
   synthesis, but also can be seamlessly hooked with additive manufacturing
   with no need of CAD reconstructions. The proposed computational
   framework provides a solution to increasing applications involving
   innovative metamaterial designs on free-form surfaces in different
   fields of interest. The performance of the proposed scheme is
   illustrated through a benchmark example where a negative-Poisson's-ratio
   unit cell pattern is mapped to a 3D human face and fabricated through
   additive manufacturing.}},

Title = {{First-principles studies on the properties of Cu2ZnSnS4 grain-boundaries
   due to photovoltaic effect}},
Journal = {{ACTA PHYSICA SINICA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{64}},
Number = {{23}},
Month = {{DEC 5}},
Abstract = {{Microstructures and electronic structures of Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS)
   grain-boundaries (GB) are studied by the first-principles electronic
   structure method. Some special twist grain-boundaries have low
   grain-boundary energies and exhibit similar electronic structure as that
   in a perfect crystal. The twist grain-boundaries such as Sigma 3{[}221]
   and Sigma 6{[}221] have grain-boundary planes parallel to (112) plane,
   the easiest cleavage plane, so that they have small damages to the
   crystal structure and small influence on the properties of the
   materials. Grain-boundary plays two roles in CZTS thin-films: (1)
   capturing and trapping holes from p-n junctions, and (2) providing fast
   channels for transportation of majority carriers. As the majority of
   carriers, the positively charged holes need override a barrier before
   being trapped by a potential-well in the grain-boundary region. For the
   minority of carriers, the grain boundary is a high barrier to prevent
   electrons from transporting across it. The intrinsic nature of the
   potential barrier is not very clear. By calculating the distributions of
   static potentials across different grain boundaries of CZTS and also by
   comparing them with those across different surfaces, we find that the
   potential barriers at grain boundaries are the remnants of the potential
   barriers of surfaces, which trap the electrons in the bulk and prevent
   the electrons from escaping from the bulk to vacuum. When two surfaces
   get contact to form a grain boundary the corresponding surface barriers
   will be merged together as one potential barrier of the grain boundary.
   It is obvious that if a grain boundary intersects with the surface, the
   escaping work function near the grain boundary is lower than that near
   the prefect crystal surface. Experiment shows the coexistence of Sn4+
   and Sn2+ ions. The Sn4+ ions are located in the bulk by bonding 4 S
   atoms as neighbors. Our results show that Sn2+ ions can appear in the
   grain-boundary regions, on the surfaces or in the bulk with lattice
   defects so that Sn2+ ions have the lower coordination number by bonding
   3 S atoms. The Sn atom is favored to be at the center of S octahedron
   with six neighboring S (or O) atoms in most sulfides (oxides) of tin. In
   CZTS, Sn atom is at the center of tetrahedron with 4 neighboring S atoms
   so that Sn atom is very active to move by structural relaxations. Most
   importantly the conduction-bands in CZTS are formed by the
   hybridizations between the s electrons of Sn and p electrons of S so
   that the conduction-bands of CZTS are sensitively dependent on the
   distributions and properties of Sn atoms. The appearing of Sn2+ ions and
   the strong structural relaxations of Sn atoms in grain-boundary regions
   and on surfaces induce extra in-gap states as a new source for the
   recombination of electron-hole pairs that are un-favored to the
   photo-voltage effects. Generally, the grain boundary plays a negative
   role in brittle photo-voltage materials such as Si and GaAs, and the
   positive role in ductile photo-voltage materials such as CdTe and CIGS
   (Cu(InGa)Se-2). It means that the growth of the hard and brittle films
   is very difficult, the micro-cracks and micro-pores are easily created.
   Our calculations show that CdTe, CIGS and CZTS are all ductile with
   Poisson-ratio greater than 0.33. This means that CZTS can be used as the
   absorber of flexible solar cell.
   By comparing the optical absorption-coefficients of crystals,
   grain-boundaries, surfaces and nano-particles, we find that the internal
   surfaces in thin-films with high pore-ratio can create new energy-levels
   in band-gap, which enhances the recombination between electrons and
   holes and decreases the optical absorption-coefficients (>1.3 eV). As a
   result, the high dense CZTS thin-film is required for high-efficient
   CZTS solar-cell. The positive role of grain boundary is more important
   if the CZTS film has the large, unique oriented grains and the uniform
   distribution of grain sizes. The simple and regular grain-boundary
   network is more beneficial to the coherent transport of majority
   carriers.}},

Abstract = {{Background Type D personality, described as a consistent tendency to
   experience increased levels of social inhibition and negative
   affectivity, has a robust association with negative outcomes following
   myocardial infarction (MI). However, little is known about its
   determinants in our setting. Our aim was to assess the prevalence and
   correlates of Type D personality among survivors following acute MI
   (AMI). Methods Two hundred participants with AMI were recruited over an
   18-month period. Type D scale-14 was used to evaluate the presence of
   Type D personality. Apart from sociodemographic factors, depression,
   anxiety, stress, coping, personality, quality of life, and perceived
   social support were assessed using standard measures. Results Type D
   personality was present in 24\% of samples (n = 48). In multivariate
   Poisson regression analysis, younger age (prevalence ratio {[}PR]:
   0.950, 95\% confidence intervals {[}CIs]: 0.927-0.974), high depression
   (PR: 1.372, 95\% CI: 1.216-1.548), and low family support (PR: 0.898,
   95\% CI: 0.849-0.949) emerged as independent predictors of Type D
   personality in participants with AMI. Conclusion Type D personality is
   seen in a significant proportion of AMI, consistent with global
   literature. Our findings suggest that among Indian patients with AMI,
   the presence or absence of Type D personality may represent two distinct
   subpopulations.}},

Volume = {{20}},
Pages = {{104-111}},

Abstract = {{Inspired by the coupling geometrical relations of left-hand (LH) and
   right-hand (RH) climbing towel gourd tendrils within single branch,
   innovative chiral architected cylindrical tube is proposed, which can
   convert axial compression loads into angular rotation deformation.
   Firstly, two series of tetrachiral cylindrical tube samples with
   rotation disk on the mirror plane (middle cross-section) are designed,
   where the numbers of unit cells and tetrachiral nodes radius are
   different. Secondly, the cylindrical tetrachiral tubes are fabricated
   with Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) nylon sintering techniques, and
   in-situ compression tests are performed for studying the relation
   between axial compression strain and rotation angle of the spinning
   disk. It is found that the proposed innovative tetrachiral cylindrical
   tube is able to generate lateral rotation, and linear relation between
   rotation angle and compression force can be harvested. With the progress
   of micro-and nano-manufacturing techniques, the proposed tetrachiral
   cylindrical tube with compression-twist deformation mechanism
   demonstrates robust mechanical performances for future industrial
   applications, such as: shape memory morphing structures in aerospace
   engineering, smart actuators and propellers, smart flexible
   microelectronics and biomechanical devices. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All

Journal = {{CEMENT \& CONCRETE COMPOSITES}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{85}},
Pages = {{92-104}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Understanding the mechanism of chloride ion diffusion in cement is
   significant to improve the reliability of offshore reinforced concrete
   structures. The chloride ionic diffusivity in cement-based
   microstructures is predicted by pore-scale modeling using a modified
   lattice Boltzmann method. Both the Nernst-Planck equation for ion
   diffusion and the Poisson equation for electrodynamic effect are fully
   solved. The predicted effective diffusivities in cement-based
   microstructures with different porosities are in good agreements with
   the experiment data. The results show that the pore size distribution
   and Zeta potential of cement-based microstructures directly influence
   the effective diffusivities of chloride ions. The cement-based
   microstructure with smaller pore size and higher negative Zeta potential
   hinders chloride ions corrosion more effectively. The electrokinetic
   effect on the chloride ionic transport is negligible when the ratio of
   the maximum-probability pore size and the Debye length is higher than 32
   in the cement-based microstructure. For engineering applications, we
   provide a predictive and easy-to-use formula by up-scaling to correlate
   the effective chloride ion diffusivity with electrokinetic effect in
   cement paste. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In order to evaluate the influence of porosity on the elastic properties
   of crustal rocks at deep crustal pressures, we performed laboratory
   measurements of compressional-wave (Vp) and shear-wave (Vs) velocities
   in a porosity-developed gabbro sample up to 1.0 GPa at room temperature.
   Based on the measured Vp and Vs data, we evaluated the changes in
   velocities, Vp/Vs, Poisson's ratio (sigma), and total porosity of the
   rock as a function of pressure. Compared with the `porosity-free'
   intrinsic elastic values of the gabbro sample, our results suggest that
   the development of porosity in crustal rocks lowers their Vp, Vs, Vp/Vs,
   and Poisson's ratio. Deviations (Delta Vp, Delta Vs, Delta Vp/Vs, and
   Delta sigma) of the measured values from the intrinsic values are
   enhanced with increasing porosity. We evaluated the AVp from previous
   experimental study on the rocks of Tanzawa plutonic complex providing
   constraints on interpretation of the seismic velocity profiles of the
   Izu-Bonin-Mariana (IBM) arc and found a large negative Delta Vp (up to -
   22.7\%) at lower pressures. The intrinsic velocity combined with the
   measured velocity data at in situ pressure conditions suggest that the
   ranges of Vp (6.0-6.5 km/s) in the middle crust of the IBM arc reflect
   the presence of considerable porosity and its closure in intermediate
   rocks and/or the change of composition from felsic to intermediate in
   mid-crustal rocks. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A rigid smooth indentor slides at a constant sub-sonic speed on a
   half-space of an isotropic compressible neo-Hookean material that is
   initially subjected to a pre-stress aligned with the surface. A dynamic
   steady-state situation of plane strain is considered and, following
   Beatty and Usmani and Green and Zerna, is viewed as contact-triggered
   infinitesimal deformations superposed upon finite deformations due to
   pre-stress. The neo-Hookean material treated behaves for small strains
   as a linear elastic solid with Poisson's ratio 1/4. Exact solutions for
   both deformations are presented and, for a range of acceptable
   pre-stress values, these illustrate the anisotropy induced by pre-stress
   and a critical sliding speed corresponding to the Rayleigh speed.
   Imposition of the unilateral Signorini conditions of contact show that
   the Rayleigh speed is the upper bound for sub-sonic sliding. For
   pre-stress levels that fall outside this range, however, either a
   negative Poisson effect occurs, or a Rayleigh wave does not exist and
   the Signorini conditions cannot be satisfied for any sub-sonic speed.

Abstract = {{Simulations of the atomic structure and elastic constants of five
   zeolites with the NAT-type structure, namely, natrolite, mesolite,
   scolecite, metanatrolite, and ammonium-exchanged natrolite, using the
   CVFF force field implemented within Cerius(2), are presented. The
   validity of the simulation method is shown by the excellent agreement
   between simulated and experimental crystal data, including location of
   extraframework ions and water molecules, and for natrolite, the only
   zeolite studied here for which experimental studies of elasticity have
   been reported, the good agreement between the simulated and experimental
   elastic constants. For all materials, an off-axis analysis of the
   elastic constants reveals that the Poisson's ratios nu(xy) and nu(yx)
   become negative when stress is applied at 45 degrees to the
   crystallographic axes. Further simulations of the elastic behavior of
   the materials under stress, using the molecular dynamics method of
   Parrinello and Rahman, reveal that the elastic behavior may be described
   by a ``modified rotating squares{''} model. Here three-dimensional
   structural distortions are reduced to a two-dimensional model where
   square cross-section units of structure both rotate about their hinges
   and undergo change of dimension: the balance of these competing
   processes dictates the resulting Poisson's ratio and is highly dependent
   upon the direction along which stress is applied. We discuss the effect
   that various concentrations of extraframework cations and water have on
   the elastic properties of the NAT-type zeolites.}},

Title = {{Patient-level compared with study-level meta-analyses demonstrate

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY}},

Volume = {{66}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Objective: We compared the performance of aggregate data (AD)-based and
   individual patient data (IPD)-based meta-analyses to synthesize evidence
   on the ability of D-dimer to distinguish recurrence risk in patients
   with unprovoked venous thromboembolism (VTE) who stopped
   anticoagulation.
   Study Design and Setting: We compared the results of the published
   AD-based rate ratio of VTE recurrence for positive vs. negative D-dimer,
   estimated by a mixed-effect Poisson model, with those of the IPD-based
   hazard ratio obtained by a Cox regression stratified by trial. We
   performed three additional analyses to investigate the methodological
   reasons for differences between the two approaches, comparing the IPD
   Cox regression with AD generated from IPD Poisson regression (to control
   for differences in population on study), AD time-to-event meta-analysis,
   and AD generated from IPD meta-regression.
   Results: Published analyses agreed in direction and statistical
   significance when estimating the prognostic value of D-dimer even if IPD
   estimates suggested a stronger effect. The additional analyses suggested
   that differences in study populations might explain this slight
   difference. Poor reporting in published studies precluded a true
   comparison of AD- and IPD-based assessments of heterogeneity sources.
   Conclusion: AD and IPD meta-analyses yielded similar estimates of
   D-dimer effect to distinguish risk for recurrent VTE. The IPD approach
   was justified by the need to investigate sources of heterogeneity. (C)

Abstract = {{Localized deformations in materials and structures are usually due to
   instability and are sensitive to various stochastic imperfections
   introduced during either the manufacturing processes or in-service life.
   As a result, they always occur in an uncertain manner. In this study, a
   two dimensional bistable cellular mechanical metamaterial (CMM) is
   designed, showing highly ordered localized deformation under static
   loading. The metamaterial consists of periodically distributed
   elliptical holes of dual sizes. By varying the geometrical parameters of
   the holes, the CMM can be monostable or bistable. The responses of the
   CMM to uniaxial compression are systematically explored by finite
   element (FE) simulations. It is shown that the monostable CMM can have
   either positive or negative Poisson's ratio and undergo homogeneous
   deformation up to moderate uniaxial compression. However, the bistable
   CMM has negligible Poisson's ratio and, most interestingly, shows highly
   ordered localized deformation zones, similar to the multi-soliton
   feature in fluids and physics. Based upon the unit cell of the CMM, a
   simplified spring chain model is developed. In the continuum limit, the
   model reduces to the Klein-Gordon equation. Analytical trivial solution
   and kink-antikink solution of the spring chain model are obtained. They
   are found to faithfully capture the FE simulated homogeneous deformation
   of the monostable CMM and the ordered localized deformations of the
   bistable CMM. The findings can provide insight into the ordered
   localized deformation, phase transformation, and static topological
   soliton of mechanical metamaterials. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Natrolite (Na16Al16Si24O80 center dot 16H(2)O) at ambient conditions is
   the paradigmatic example of an auxetic material whose behavior under
   pressure can be rationalized using a ``rotating squares{''} model with
   the squares being made up of T5O10 subunits (T = Al, Si). This model
   also rationalizes reversible superhydration where water is inserted
   under pressure ({''}pressure-induced hydration{''}). Using combined
   pressure and temperature in situ synchrotron powder diffraction
   techniques, we have investigated the structural changes occurring in
   ``superhydrated{''} natrolite (Na16Al16Si24O80 center dot 32H(2)O)
   between 20 and 300 K at 1.7(3) GPa. Rietveld refinements allowed us to
   identify significant changes within the sodium-water substructure
   located in the pores of the superhydrated natrolite. Despite the higher
   water content of the superhydrated phase, its thermal volumetric
   expansion coefficient is 15 times larger than that of natrolite at
   ambient pressure. We put forward a structural descriptor relating
   thermal expansion and the rotations of T5O10 units that measures the
   impact of nonframework cations and water contained in the pores on the
   ``rotational squares{''} mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{The presence of gas hydrate in the Ulleung Basin, East Sea (Japan Sea),
   inferred by various seismic indicators, including the widespread
   bottom-simulating reflector (BSR), has been confirmed by coring and
   drilling. We applied the standard AVO technique to the BSRs in
   turbidite/hemipelagic sediments crosscutting the dipping beds and those
   in debris-flow deposits to qualitatively assess the gas hydrate and gas
   concentrations. These BSRs are not likely to be affected by thin-bed
   tuning which can significantly alter the AVO response of the BSR. The
   BSRs crosscutting the dipping beds in turbidite/hemipelagic sediments
   are of low-seismic amplitude and characterized by a small positive
   gradient, indicating a decrease in Poisson's ratio in the gas-hydrate
   stability zone (GHSZ), which, in turn, suggests the presence of gas
   hydrate. The BSRs in debris-flow deposits are characterized by a
   negative gradient, indicating decreased Poisson's ratio below the GHSZ,
   which is likely due to a few percent or greater gas saturations. The
   increase in the steepness of the AVO gradient and the magnitude of the
   intercept of the BSRs in debris-flow deposits with increasing seismic
   amplitude of the BSRs is probably due to an increase in gas saturations,
   as predicted by AVO model studies based on rock physics. The reflection
   strength of the BSRs in debris-flow deposits, therefore, can be a
   qualitative measure of gas saturations below the GHSZ. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{It is a well-known fact that the mechanical properties of coronary
   stents are defined mainly by two components, the constituting material
   and the design pattern of the stent itself. The latter especially has
   attracted the interest of entrepreneurs and scientists alike with a
   plethora of patents being issued for numerous stent designs. Despite
   this widespread interest, the suitability of said designs are seldom
   studied. Accordingly, in this work we have investigated the properties
   of stent designs based on the hexagonal honeycomb geometry. Stent
   patterns based upon re-entrant, non re-entrant, and hybrid honeycomb
   geometries were studied with respect to their behaviour at extremely
   high strains using Finite Element Analysis. The data collected indicates
   that although the non re-entrant and hybrid geometries may be more
   suited to stent designs than the re-entrant geometry in terms of
   tolerance to high strains, none of these systems convey all the ideal
   properties desired in a stent, even if the former two have the potential

Abstract = {{The thermodynamic analysis of viscoelastic constitutive laws makes it
   possible to estimate the class of admissible creep-relaxation functions.
   This set of functions turns out to be larger than it was traditionally
   supposed.  Except for the well known positive definite, monotone
   decreasing functions, the new class also includes the so-called
   non-traditional functions, such as locally non-monotone and even
   non-positive ones, hence involving the effect of the so-called negative
   viscosity.
   It is shown that generalized creep-relaxation functions turn out to be
   effective in the phenomenologic modelling of the complicated materials
   behaviour, like that in homogenization of heterogeneous bodies and in
   modelling of the wave propagation and of the negative Poisson ratio
   phenomena in composites.
   New directions for fundamental and applied research, that are considered
   with the thermodynamic admissibility of viscoelastic models, are
   discussed.  Examples of the application of generalized creep-relaxation
   functions are given, in particular for the dynamics of composites and
   for the thermomechanical modelling of wood.}},

Abstract = {{Pedestrian behaviour is one of the major contributors to road
   fatalities. The negative binomial regression model was found to better
   agree with road fatality data, and this study used this model to assess
   the influence of pedestrian behaviour factors on road fatalities in
   Malawi. The data used in this analysis were crash reports of pedestrian
   behaviour factors and observed fatalities for the period 2000-2015
   obtained from the national database, except for the 2013 data, which
   were disregarded because they appeared to be incomplete. Whereas
   pedestrian behaviour factors of walking on roads, crossing outside
   pedestrian crossings, and other negligent and careless behaviours were
   found to be positively correlated with road deaths, indicating that
   road-related fatalities increased with increasing input data, factors of
   being under the influence of alcohol and crossing at pedestrian
   crossings demonstrated negligible influence. The study also found that
   there was a 1\% increase in the number of crash deaths for every
   additional fatal crash involving pedestrians walking on roads. Moreover,
   an additional 0.5\% increase in the number of fatalities was recorded
   for every fatal crash involving a pedestrian behaviour factor of
   crossing outside the pedestrian crossing or other negligent behaviour.
   An increase of 0.3\% in the number of the fatalities was seen for every
   extra fatal crash caused by crossing carelessly or factors other than
   pedestrian behaviour. Despite coefficient values being small in all
   variables, which is a major limitation of this study, enforcement can
   prioritise those variables that increase road-related fatalities or even
   couple them with other risk factors such as speed.}},

Title = {{A single Rayleigh mode may exist with multiple values of phase-velocity
   at one frequency}},
Journal = {{GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{222}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{582-594}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Other than commonly assumed in seismology, the phase velocity of
   Rayleigh waves is not necessarily a single-valued function of frequency.
   In fact, a single Rayleigh mode can exist with three different values of
   phase velocity at one frequency. We demonstrate this for the first
   higher mode on a realistic shallow seismic structure of a homogeneous
   layer of unconsolidated sediments on top of a half-space of solid rock
   (LOH). In the case of LOH a significant contrast to the half-space is
   required to produce the phenomenon. In a simpler structure of a
   homogeneous layer with fixed (rigid) bottom (LFB) the phenomenon exists
   for values of Poisson's ratio between 0.19 and 0.5 and is most
   pronounced for P-wave velocity being three times S-wave velocity
   (Poisson's ratio of 0.4375). A pavement-like structure (PAV) of two
   layers on top of a half-space produces the multivaluedness for the
   fundamental mode. Programs for the computation of synthetic dispersion
   curves are prone to trouble in such cases. Many of them use
   mode-follower algorithms which loose track of the dispersion curve and
   miss the multivalued section. We show results for well established
   programs. Their inability to properly handle these cases might be one
   reason why the phenomenon of multivaluedness went unnoticed in
   seismological Rayleigh wave research for so long. For the very same
   reason methods of dispersion analysis must fail if they imply wave
   number k(l)(omega) for the lth Rayleigh mode to be a single-valued
   function of frequency.. This applies in particular to deconvolution
   methods like phase-matched filters. We demonstrate that a slant-stack
   analysis fails in the multivalued section, while a Fourier-Bessel
   transformation captures the complete Rayleigh-wave signal. Waves of
   finite bandwidth in the multivalued section propagate with positive
   group-velocity and negative phase-velocity. Their eigenfunctions appear
   conventional and contain no conspicuous feature.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{99}},
Number = {{21}},
Month = {{JUN 7}},
Abstract = {{Emergent crystals are the periodic alignment of ``emergent
   particles,{''} i.e., localized collective behavior of atoms or their
   charges, spins, or orbits. The elasticity of these novel states of
   matter suffering mechanical loads can be strikingly softer than that of
   the underlying material, showing great strain-mediated tunability.
   However, the deformation and possible failure of emergent crystals under
   strong strain, vital for realizing related applications, are hitherto
   unclear. Here we theoretically study the nonlinear elasticity and
   structural transitions of a Skyrmion crystal (SkX) suffering uniaxial
   distortion. Under moderate tension, a SkX behaves like a ductile
   material, with an exotic negative crossover elastic stiffness and a
   negative emergent Poisson's ratio at appropriate conditions of magnetic
   field. Under strong strain, we observe at most six phase transitions,
   generating four novel emergent crystals that are thermodynamically
   metastable. We argue that this nondestructive polymorphism is a general
   feature for any emergent crystals exposed to mechanical loads.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, convection driven by combined thermal and solutal
   concentration buoyancy effects in a lid-driven square cavity is examined
   using velocity-vorticity form of Navier-Stokes equations. The governing
   equations consist of vorticity transport equation, velocity Poisson
   equations, energy equation, and concentration equation. Validation
   results are discussed for convection due to heat and mass transfer in a
   lid-driven square cavity at Re=500, Le=2, and GRT=GRS=100. These results
   indicate that the present velocity-vorticity formulation could predict
   the characteristic parameters of flow, temperature, and solutal
   concentration fields using a much coarser mesh compared to the mesh used
   in a stream function-vorticity formulation. The capability of the
   proposed algorithm to handle complex geometry is demonstrated by
   application to mixed convection in a lid-driven square cavity with a
   square blockage. The effect of buoyancy ratio on the convection
   phenomenon is discussed for buoyancy ratio varying from-100 to 100 at
   Re=100. Under opposing temperature and concentration gradients along the
   vertical direction, the negative buoyancy ratios give rise to aiding
   flows.}},

Abstract = {{We study density-dependent resource harvest patterns due to Bayesian
   foraging for different distributions of resources. We first consider a

   dependance is given by the ratio sigma(2)/mu of the distribution of
   number of food items per patch, Bayesian foraging can therefore lead to
   positive (negative binomial distributional) or negative (binomial
   distribution) density dependent resource harvest and even to density
   independent (Poisson distribution) resource harvest, depending on the
   distribution of resources in the environment. In a second stage we
   incorporate learning about the distribution of resources ire the whole
   environment, The mean of the distribution of number of food items per

Abstract = {{The Helmholtz wave equation is derived for longitudinal waves in an
   elastic plate of arbitrary thickness placed in a rigid gantry ensuring a
   constant width. The whole range of Poisson's ratio allowed for isotropic
   elastic media constrained in this way is considered. The wave speed is
   shown to increase under a constant longitudinal compressive stress
   applied to the front face of the plate and to decrease when the applied
   stress is tensile. The effect is most pronounced for zero Poisson's
   ratio and it vanishes for the limiting permitted values, i.e., 1 or -1.
   The reported results also describe the combined effect of longitudinal
   stress and Poisson's ratio on the wave speed. These findings provide
   guidelines for designing devices aimed at a passive control of
   propagation of longitudinal waves in thin-walled structures. (C) 2015

   piezoelectric up to at least 250 degrees C without losing any actuation.
   The longitudinal piezoelectric coefficient, d(33), is approximate to 45
   to 50 pm V-1 measured from room temperature to 250 degrees C. The
   transverse piezoelectric coefficient, d(31), a key parameter of actuator
   performance, exceeds PZT (Pb1-xZrxTiO3) films at >200 pm V-1. Since the
   d(31) coefficient was found to be positive, this opens up exciting new
   applications opportunities. The possible reasons for d(31) > 0 are
   discussed in the light of 3D strain control in the nanocomposites.}},

Abstract = {{This study aimed to analyze the impact of the Family Health Strategy
   (FHS) on oral health in Northeast Brazil, in 12 municipalities with more
   than 100 thousand inhabitants. The reference was 20 census tracts, 10 of
   which in areas with oral health covered by the FHS for at least a year,
   matched with 10 census tracts without oral health coverage. The total
   sample included 59,221 individuals. Three possible effects were
   considered: negative, positive, and absence of effect on the outcomes,
   based on the prevalence ratio adjusted by Poisson regression. The
   outcomes ``access to collective preventive measures{''} and ``treatment
   of toothache{''} indicate a positive effect in the FHS oral health
   model. However, the outcomes ``coverage of tooth extraction{''} and
   ``restorative treatment{''} showed either a negative effect or no effect
   in the majority of the municipalities in the sample. Evidence indicates
   that within the FHS, the results reflect the local organizational models
   for oral health care.}},

Abstract = {{Nickel titanium, also know as nitinol, is a prototypical shape memory
   alloy, a property intimately linked to a phase transition in the
   microstructure, which allows the meso/macroscopic sample shape to be
   recovered after thermal cycling. Not much is known about the other
   alloys in this binary system, which prompted our computational
   investigation of other compositions. In this work, structures are found
   by probing the potential energy surfaces of NiTi binary systems using a
   minima hopping method, in combination with ab initio electronic
   structure calculations. We find stable structures in 34 different
   stoichiometries and calculate derived physical properties of the low
   energy phases. From the results of this analysis a new convex hull is
   formed that is lower in energy than those in the Materials Project and
   Open Quantum Materials Databases. Two previously unreported phases are
   discovered for the NiTi2 and Ni5Ti compositions, and two metastable
   states in NiTi and NiTi2 shows signs of negative linear compression and
   negative Poisson ratio, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{We consider in this paper a risk reserve process where the claims and
   gains arrive according to two independent Poisson processes. While the
   gain sizes are phase-type distributed, we assume instead that the claim
   sizes are phase-type perturbed by a heavy-tailed component; that is, the
   claim size distribution is formally chosen to be phase-type with large
   probability and heavy-tailed with small probability We analyze the
   seminal Gerber-Shiu function coding the joint distribution of the time
   to ruin, the surplus immediately before ruin, and the deficit at ruin.
   We derive its value as an expansion with respect to powers of with known
   coefficients and we construct approximations from the first two terms of
   the aforementioned series. The main idea is based on the so-called fluid
   embedding that allows to put the considered risk process into the
   framework of spectrally negative Markov-additive processes and use its
   fluctuation theory developed in Ivanovs and Palmowski 2012.}},

Abstract = {{In order to study corona wind flow during the negative corona discharge

   needle-plate coronas. At the respective voltages of -9 kV and -16 kV, an
   experiment was conducted on the velocities of the corona wind flows
   generated from corona electrodes of three different curvature radii. The
   corresponding results show that the corona wind's low velocity at the
   needle point (the site of the corona) increased rapidly along the axial
   direction, leveled off at a certain value, and then dropped down. The
   larger the potential difference between plates, the faster the corona
   wind; the smaller the radius of curvature of the corona, the faster the
   corona wind to be generated around the pole tip.}},

Abstract = {{The homogeneous nucleation rates of light and heavy water have been
   measured in supercooled levitated micro-droplets at different
   temperatures using a temperature jump experiment. Homogeneous nucleation
   times of ice in supercooled water follow the Poisson statistics. The
   nucleation rate has a negative temperature coefficient; it increases
   strongly with decreasing temperature. At the same degree of
   supercooling, the nucleation in heavy water is faster than in light
   water.
   The discussion of the experimental results is based on kinetic arguments
   in the frame of a two-state model of liquid water. The homogeneous
   nucleation rate J is tantamount to a volume-normalized apparent
   first-order rate constant J{*} which can be described by the product of
   the genuine rate constant j and an overall equilibrium constant K. K
   describes a large number of pre-equilibria, which are coupled to the
   rate-determining step of nucleation and influence the apparent
   nucleation rate J of formation of the critical germ. (c) 2005 Elsevier

Abstract = {{We describe a fast and globally convergent fully four-dimensional
   incremental gradient (4DIG) algorithm to estimate the continuous-time
   tracer density from list mode positron emission tomography (PET) data.
   Detection of 511-keV photon pairs produced by positron-electron
   annihilation is modeled as an inhomogeneous Poisson process whose rate
   function is parameterized using cubic B-splines. The rate functions are
   estimated by minimizing the cost function formed by the sum of the
   negative log-likelihood of arrival times, spatial and temporal roughness
   penalties, and a negativity penalty. We first derive a computable bound
   for the norm of the optimal temporal basis function coefficients. Based
   on this bound we then construct and prove convergence of an incremental
   gradient algorithm. Fully 4-D simulations demonstrate the substantially
   faster convergence behavior of the 4DIG algorithm relative to
   preconditioned conjugate gradient. Four-dimensional reconstructions of
   real data are also included to illustrate the performance of this
   method.}},

Abstract = {{The Donnan osmotic pressure of a solution containing charged colloidal
   entities is divided into electrostatic and non-electrostatic
   contributions. The expression adopted for the former contribution is
   obtained from a general thermodynamic treatment of the diffuse double
   layer. Expressions are derived which allow for specific binding and
   which also provide a definition of amounts bound electrostatically. When
   the approximation is made that the electrostatic binding of indifferent
   coions-GAMMA-coions is negligible the equations which result have the
   same form as those that apply to non-interacting uncharged systems and
   can be handled in the same way. The treatment provides a basis for a
   successful but somewhat arbitrary approach developed previously. In
   particular an expression for the activity coefficient of unbound
   counterions and coions is justified. The prediction (based on the
   application of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation to cell models) that
   GAMMA-coions is negative is contradicted by work concerning the
   significance of single ionic chemical potentials.}},

Abstract = {{A one-dimensional continuum model is presented for a dc-glow-discharge
   in an electronegative gas between parallel plates. It is based on the
   local balance equations for particle densities and fluxes of electrons,
   positive and negative ions, the local electron energy balance and the
   Poisson equation for the self-consistent electric field. These equations
   are supplemented by suitably chosen boundary conditions and are solved
   by the finite difference procedure HEMODES (HEnyey Method Ordinary
   Differential Equation Solver) which, in particular, can successfully
   handle the singular point occuring if the inertia term in the ion
   momentum balance equation is taken into account. Since not all data
   needed within this treatment for the simulation of realistic
   electronegative gases were available, a fictitious argon-like gas has
   been considered which nevertheless can demonstrate the characteristic
   features of such a discharge. In particular, the influence of variations
   of the attachment and the ion-ion recombination coefficients on the
   physical variables has been studied.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a method to design the periodic microstructure of a
   material to obtain specified constitutive parameters. The problem can be
   called an inverse homogenization problem and is formulated as an
   optimization problem of finding the microstructure with the lowest
   possible weight which fulfills the specified behavioural requirements. A
   full ground structure known from topology optimization of trusses is
   used as starting guess for the optimization algorithm, which implies
   that the optimal microstructure of a base cell is found from a truss
   structure with 120 possible members in the 2-dimensional case and 2016
   possible members in the 3-dimensional case. The material parameters are
   found by a numerical homogenization method using finite elements to
   model the representative base cell, and the optimization problem is
   solved by an optimality criteria method.
   Numerical examples in two and three dimensions show that it is possible
   to design materials with many different properties, including isotropic
   materials with Poisson's ratio close to -1 and 0.5, using base cells
   modelled as truss structures. Some of the proposed base cells have been
   tested as macro models and methods to produce them in practice are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Although Cox proportional hazards regression is the default analysis for
   time to event data, there is typically uncertainty about whether the
   effects of a predictor are more appropriately characterized by a
   multiplicative or additive model. To accommodate this uncertainty, we
   place a model selection prior on the coefficients in an
   additive-multiplicative hazards model. This prior assigns positive
   probability, not only to the model that has both additive and
   multiplicative effects for each predictor, but also to sub-models
   corresponding to no association, to only additive effects, and to only
   proportional effects. The additive component of the model is constrained
   to ensure non-negative hazards, a condition often violated by current
   methods. After augmenting the data with Poisson latent variables, the
   prior is conditionally conjugate, and posterior computation can proceed
   via an efficient Gibbs sampling algorithm. Simulation study results are
   presented, and the methodology is illustrated using data from the
   Framingham heart study.}},

Abstract = {{Topological defects can markedly alter nanomaterial properties. This
   presents opportunities for ``defect engineering,{''} where desired
   functionalities are generated through defect manipulation. However,
   imaging defects in working devices with nanoscale resolution remains
   elusive. We report three-dimensional imaging of dislocation dynamics in
   individual battery cathode nanoparticles under operando conditions using
   Bragg coherent diffractive imaging. Dislocations are static at room
   temperature and mobile during charge transport. During the structural
   phase transformation, the lithium-rich phase nucleates near the
   dislocation and spreads inhomogeneously. The dislocation field is a
   local probe of elastic properties, and we find that a region of the
   material exhibits a negative Poisson's ratio at high voltage. Operando
   dislocation imaging thus opens a powerful avenue for facilitating
   improvement and rational design of nanostructured materials.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES. The effect of luminance range compression on the visual
   threshold of a target in a computed tomographic (CT) scan was
   investigated in eight experiments.
   METHODS. Both visual increment thresholds of a hot target and visual
   decrement thresholds of a cold target were obtained. Realistic noisy CT
   images simulating a scan reconstruction and partial volume blurring were
   tested as representative of complex medical images. Negative versions,
   high luminance versions, and noise-free versions of these CT images also
   were tested.
   RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS. In all the noisy images, as the luminance range
   of the image was compressed, proportionately smaller physical luminance
   differences between the target and its local background were needed to
   reach visual threshold. However, the thresholds were the same in terms
   of the difference in CT numbers between target and background. Noise in
   terms of CT numbers sets the threshold for a wide range of display
   conditions. In the noise-free CTs, as the luminance range was
   compressed, the luminance differences between the target and background
   needed to reach threshold also decreased, but only marginally. However,
   in terms of CT numbers, the thresholds were increased.}},

Title = {{Exploring the dynamics of hourglass shaped lattice metastructures}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Continuous demand for the improvement of mechanical performance of
   engineering structures pushes the need for metastructures to fulfil
   multiple functions. Extensive work on lattice-based metastructure has
   shown their ability to manipulate wave propagation and producing
   bandgaps at specific frequency ranges. Enhanced customizability makes
   them ideal candidates for multifunctional applications. This paper
   explores a wide range of nonlinear mechanical behavior that can be
   generated out of the same lattice material by changing the building
   block into dome shaped structures which improves the functionality of
   material significantly. We propose a novel hourglass shaped lattice
   metastructure that takes advantage of the combination of two oppositely
   oriented coaxial domes, providing an opportunity for higher
   customizability and the ability to tailor its dynamic response. Six new
   classes of hourglass shaped lattice metastructures have been developed
   through combinations of solid shells, regular honeycomb lattices and
   auxetic lattices. Numerical simulation, analytical modelling, additive
   layer manufacturing (3D printing) and experimental testing are
   implemented to justify the evaluation of their mechanics and reveal the
   underlying physics responsible for their unusual nonlinear behaviour. We
   further obtained the lattice dependent frequency response and damping
   offered by the various classes of hourglass metastructures. This study
   paves the way for incorporating hourglass based oscillators to be used
   as building block of future mechanical metamaterials, leading to a new
   class of tunable metamaterial over a wide range of operating
   frequencies. The proposed class of metastructure will be useful in
   applications where lightweight and tunable properties with broadband
   vibration suppression and wave attenuation abilities are necessary.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICS OF PLASMAS}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The fluid-Poisson equations coupled with the Monte Carlo method were
   used to simulate the spatio-temporal behavior of a needle-like argon
   electron-beam plasma. Based on the Monte Carlo simulation, three coupled
   parameters characterizing the electron beam propagation for initial
   energies above several keV were expressed using a universal
   dimensionless shape function given in terms of the beam range multiplied
   by a normalized coefficient. Therefore, a single run of the Monte Carlo
   code was sufficient for the simulations over a wide range of conditions.
   The spatial potential as a function of space and time was studied from
   the fluid-Poisson equations. The results indicate that the time
   evolution of the spatial potential was influenced by the presence of the
   slowed-down electrons and the flying beam electrons, whereas the
   potential in quasi-equilibrium was mainly determined from the spatial
   distribution of the secondary electron. The potential in
   quasi-equilibrium was positive near the beam entrance and most negative
   along the tip of the beam range, which was a result of ambipolar
   diffusion. When the enclosing boundary surfaces were moved within the
   beam range, the potential was nearly positive everywhere. The
   calculation on the diffusion-drift flux indicated that the net current
   of the secondary electrons flowing back to the incident plane in
   quasi-equilibrium balanced the incident beam current, which was the
   so-called return current in the three-dimensional space. Published by

Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{In this work, seven novel phases of phosphorene were predicted to be
   existent by first-principles calculations, including six kinds of
   enantiomers corresponding to three kinds of structures with chirality.
   It is the first time to introduce chirality into two-dimensional (2D)
   phosphorus. The Poisson's ratios have been investigated and show normal
   behavior, rather than the negative one of monolayer or bulk black
   phosphorus, due to the structures being non-puckered. Phase
   transformations of these enantiomers have been studied, revealing that
   there exists the possibility of transformations between them because of
   the energy barriers being low, which opens doors to possible
   applications in shape memory devices. This work may inspire new ideas of
   developing novel applications based on 2D phosphorus nanomaterials.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, the Timoshenko beam, and generalizations thereof, have been
   considered as models for the vibration of single and multiple walled
   carbon nanotubes. Further, it has been shown that, in some instances,
   nanotubes and nanotube sheets possess the remarkable property that their
   Poisson's ratio is negative. In these cases, the degenerate case of the
   Timoshenko beam problem, where E = k'G, becomes physically realizable.
   The asymptotic derivation of the vibration spectrum in this case is
   qualitatively different from that for the non-degenerate case. We
   perform such a derivation, and we compare the asymptotic results with
   numerical results for values of the parameters for which E approaches
   k'G. The results suggest that the degenerate case is robust, in an
   asymptotic sense.}},

Abstract = {{The electron transport through the triple-barrier resonant tunnelling
   diode (TBRTD) has been studied by the self-consistent numerical method
   for the Wigner-Poisson problem. The electron flow through the TBRTD can
   be controlled by the gate voltage applied to one of the potential well
   regions. For different gate voltage values we have determined the
   current-voltage characteristics, potential energy profiles and electron
   density distribution. We have found the enhancement of the
   peak-to-valley ratio (up to similar to 10), the appearance of the linear
   current versus bias voltage behaviour within the negative-differential
   resistance region and the bistability of the current-voltage
   characteristics. We provide a physical interpretation of these results
   based on the analysis of the self-consistent potential profiles and

Abstract = {{We derive a theory for the elastic characterization of multicracked
   solids based on a homogenization technique. We consider a material
   containing a two-dimensional arbitrary distribution of parallel slit
   cracks which is elastically equivalent to a crystal with orthorhombic
   symmetry. We obtain explicit expressions for the macroscopic elastic
   stiffness tensor which is found to depend upon both the density of
   cracks and their angular distribution, here described by a suitable
   order parameter. For the isotropic case, we find that the degradation
   depends exponentially on the crack density. In addition, we show an
   unusual elastic behavior of a multicracked medium in the plane strain
   condition: for a negative Poisson ratio, we obtain an effective Young
   modulus greater than the actual value of the host matrix.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we propose self-triggered thermomechanical metamaterials
   (ST-MM) by applying thermomechanical materials in mechanical
   metamaterials designed with asymmetric structures (i.e., microstructural
   hexagons and chiral legs). The thermomechanical metamaterials are
   observed with programmable mechanical response under thermal
   excitations, which are used in mechanical metamaterials to obtain chiral
   tubes with negative Poisson's ratio and microgrippers with
   temperature-induced grabbing response. Theoretical and numerical models
   are developed to analyze the thermomechanical response of the ST-MM from
   the material and structural perspectives. Finally, we envision advanced
   applications of the ST-MM as chiral stents and thermoresponsive
   microgrippers with maximum grabbing force of approximately 101.7 N. The
   emerging ST-MM provide a promising direction for the design and
   perception of smart mechanical metamaterials.}},

Abstract = {{Background: We studied the association between HIV infection,
   antiretroviral medications, and the risk of spontaneous intracranial
   hemorrhage. Methods: We performed a cohort and nested case control study
   in an administrative database. We selected all HIV-positive individuals
   presenting between 1985 and 2007. Each HIV-positive subject was matched
   with 4 HIV-negative individuals. We used a Poisson regression model to
   calculate rates of intracranial hemorrhage according to HIV status. We
   conducted a case -control study nested within the cohort of HIV-positive
   individuals to look at the effect of antiretroviral medications. Odds
   ratios for antiretroviral exposure were obtained using conditional
   logistic regression. Results: There were 7,053 HIV-positive and 27,681
   HIV-negative subjects, representing 138,704 person-years. There were 49
   incident intracranial hemorrhages, 29 in HIV-positive and 20 in
   HIV-negative individuals. The adjusted hazard ratio for intracranial
   hemorrhage in HIV-positive compared to HIV-negative patients was 3.28
   (95\% confidence interval {[}CI] 1.75-6.12). The effect was reduced to
   1.99 (95\% CI 0.92-4.31) in the absence of AIDS-defining conditions, and
   increased to 7.64 (95\% CI 3.78-15.43) in subjects with AIDS-defining
   conditions. Hepatitis C infection, illicit drug or alcohol abuse,
   intracranial lesions, and coagulopathy were all strongly associated with
   intracranial hemorrhage (all P < .001). In the case control study, 29
   cases of ICH in HIV-positive individuals were matched to 228
   HIV-positive controls. None of the antiretroviral classes were
   associated with an increase in the odds ratio of intracranial
   hemorrhage. Conclusions: The risk of intracranial hemorrhage in
   HIV-positive individuals seems to be mostly associated with
   AIDS-defining conditions, other comorbidities, or lifestyle factors. No
   association was found between use of antiretroviral medications and
   intracranial hemorrhage.}},

Abstract = {{Chiral metastructures consisting of ring (polygonal or cubic) nodes and
   elastic bending ligaments exhibit excellent design flexibility for
   compliant structures. In this paper, based on rigid cubic node rotation
   and the kinematic geometrical relations of a three-dimensional (3D)
   isotropic anti-tetrachiral structure, an analytical expression for the
   modulus of the 3D isotropic anti-tetrachiral structure is derived from
   strain energy analysis. The nylon powder Selected Laser Sintering (SLS)
   additive manufacturing technique is employed for fabricating two types
   of 3D isotropic anti-tetrachiral specimens with different geometrical
   parameters; then comparison between experiments, finite element analysis
   (FEA), and theoretical studies is performed for verifying the analytical
   formula. The mechanical properties of 3D isotropic anti-tetrachiral
   structures can be tuned with two independent dimensionless geometrical
   parameters. The proposed 3D anti-tetrachiral structures can be employed
   for designing advanced structures against impact damages, realizing
   flexibility of industrial components, and optimizing the vibration
   attenuation abilities of engineering structures.}},

Pages = {{173-183}},
Abstract = {{Cytokine ELISPOT assays have emerged as a powerful tool for the
   detection of rare antigen-specific T cells in freshly isolated cell
   material, such as blood. While ELISPOT assays allow one to directly
   visualize and count extremely low frequencies of cytokine-secreting T
   cells among millions of nonsecreting bystander cells, the interpretation
   of ELISPOT data can become ambiguous when (a) spot numbers in
   antigen-containing wells are low, (b) spot counts in negative control
   wells are elevated, and particularly (c) when both of the above occur
   simultaneously. Thus, the primary task, even before statistics are
   employed, must be the optimization of the basic assay parameters and
   reagents such that the assay yields low background signal in the
   negative-control wells and the maximal number of antigen-induced spots
   in test wells, i.e., the signal-to-noise ratio is maximized.
   Furthermore, the use of proper spot-size gating parameters for data
   analysis is indispensable for screening out irrelevant background spots,
   and thus increasing the signal-to-noise ratio. The goal of most ELISPOT
   experiments is to identify, positive T-cell responses as defined by a
   significantly elevated spot count in antigen-stimulated wells over the
   nonstimulated medium-control or negative-control antigen. In this
   chapter, we conclude that - with some limitations - the T-Test and
   related statistical methods which rely on the assumption of normal
   distribution are suitable for identifying positive ELISPOT results.}},

Title = {{Explaining two-lane highway crash rates using land use and hourly
   exposure}},
Journal = {{ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{32}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the estimation of Poisson regression models for
   predicting both single and multi-vehicle highway crash rates as a
   function of traffic density and land use, as well as ambient light
   conditions and time of day. The study focuses on seventeen rural,
   two-lane highway segments, each one-half mile in length with varying
   land use patterns and where actual hourly exposure values are available
   in the form of observed traffic counts. Land-use effects are represented
   by the number of driveways of various types on each segment. Hourly
   exposure is represented for single-vehicle crashes as the total vehicle
   miles traveled and volume/capacity ratio; for multi-vehicle crashes it
   is the product of the hourly volumes on the main highway and the roads
   intersecting it along the study segment. For single-vehicle crashes, the
   following variables were found to be significant, with a positive or
   negative effect as noted: daytime (06:00-19:00 h, negative effect), the
   natural log of the segment volume/capacity ratio (negative), percent of
   the segment with no passing zones (positive), shoulder width (positive),
   number of intersections (negative), and driveways (mixed effects by
   type). Good multi-vehicle crash prediction models had guile different
   variables: daylight conditions from 10:00;-15:00 and 15:00-19:00 h
   (positive), number of intersections (negative), and driveways (positive
   for all types). The results show that traffic intensity explains
   differences in crash rates even when controlling for time of day and
   light conditions, and that these effects are quite different for single
   and multi-vehicle crashes. Suggestions for future research are also
   given. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Our aim was to evaluate the factors affecting the mortality of patients
   who underwent nontraumatic major lower limb amputation due to ischemic
   and/or diabetic causes. A total of 100 patients were included in the
   study. Among these patients, 70 (70\%) underwent below-knee amputation,
   whereas 30 (30\%) underwent above-knee amputation. Eleven (15.7\%) of
   the 70 patients who underwent below-knee amputation and 12 (40\%) of the
   30 patients who underwent above-knee amputation (P = .008) were
   deceased. After multivariable Poisson regression analysis, female gender
   (risk ratio {[}RR] = 2.00, 95\% CI = 1.07-3.74) and a neutrophil
   lymphocyte ratio (NLR) less than 6.8 (RR = 5.12, 95\% CI = 1.86-14.08)
   were found to be independent risk factors for mortality. The value of
   6.8 was used as a cutoff point for the NLR (area under the curve = 0.73,
   95\% CI = 0.62-0.85), with a sensitivity, specificity, positive
   predictive value, and negative predictive value of 83\%, 66\%, 57\%, and
   92\%, respectively. The NLR and female gender were found to be
   independent factors that are related to increased mortality in patients
   who underwent lower limb amputation due to diabetic and/or ischemic
   causes. The coexistence of congestive heart failure and the amputation
   level (above knee) were found to be predictors of mortality in
   univariable analysis, but significance could not be demonstrated in
   multivariable analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Apple scab (Venturia inaequalis) causes important economic losses in
   many apple production areas of the world. The disease is controlled by
   numerous fungicide applications regardless of the presence of ascospores
   in the orchard. Airborne ascospore concentration (AAC) can be measured
   in real time to time fungicide applications. However, the level of
   heterogeneity of the AAC in commercial orchards was unknown.
   Consequently, the spatial distribution of V. inaequalis ascospores was
   studied in a commercial apple orchard of 0.43 ha. The potential
   ascosporo dose (PAD) and AAC were measured in 40 quadrats each of 108
   m(2). In each quadrat, the AAC was monitored during the major rain
   events in spring 1999 and 2000 using spore samplers. The
   variance-to-mean ratio for the PAD and for most of the AAC sampling
   dates was >1, indicating an aggregated pattern of distribution. None of
   the frequency distributions of the most important ascospore ejection
   events followed the Poisson probability distribution, indicating that
   the pattern of distribution was not random. For all events, AAC had an
   aggregated pattern of distribution as suggested by the negative binomial
   distribution. The PAD followed neither the Poisson nor the negative
   binomial distribution. Geostatistical analyses confirmed the aggregated
   pattern of distribution. The cultivars had an effect on the PAD and AAC
   distribution pattern, but both PAD and AAC were not uniformly
   distributed within a block of the same cultivar. Therefore, the number,
   location, and height of samplers required to estimate AAC in orchards
   need to be investigated before using information on AAC for decision
   making.}},

Abstract = {{Background and objectives Despite colistin's longstanding reported
   association with nephrotoxicity, the attributable risk and timing of
   toxicity onset are still unknown. Whether substantial toxicity occurs
   during the initial 72 hours of exposure has important implications for
   early treatment decisions. The objective of this study was to compare
   colistin-exposed patients with a matched control group given other broad
   spectrum antibiotics.
   Design, setting, participants, \& measurements We conducted a
   retrospective cohort study in patients treated for multidrug-resistant
   Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, or Acinetobacter spp. Colistin-exposed patients
   were matched to unexposed controls using propensity scores. AKI was
   defined according to the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes
   creatinine criteria. Incidence rate ratios and risk differences of AKI
   in the matched cohort were estimated with the generalized estimating
   equation Poisson regression model. Risk factors for AKI were tested for
   effect modification in the matched cohort.
   Results The study included 150 propensity-matched pairs with similar
   types of infection, similar delays to effective treatment, and similar
   baseline characteristics. Incidence of AKI was 77 of 150 (51\%) in the
   colistin group versus 33 of 150 (22\%) in matched controls (risk
   difference, 29\%; 95\% confidence interval, 19 to 39), corresponding to
   a number needed to harm of 3.5. Early toxicity was apparent, because AKI
   risk was higher in colistin-exposed patients at 72 hours of exposure
   (incidence rate ratio, 1.9; 95\% confidence interval, 1.1 to 3.5). In
   both groups, hospital mortality in patients who experienced AKI was
   lower if kidney function returned to baseline during hospitalization.
   The effect of colistin exposure on AKI risk varied inversely according
   to baseline hemoglobin concentration.
   Conclusions Colistin is associated with substantial excess AKI that is
   apparent within the first 72 hours of treatment. Colistin's toxicity
   varied according to baseline hemoglobin concentration.}},

Abstract = {{Linear elastic Hookean solids can be strong but become brittle in
   general as their strength-to-modulus ratio is higher about 1/100 due to
   the well-known inverse strength-ductility relationship. Combined with
   the first-order reversible martensitc transformation, they can be
   functional but their mechanical and functional properties are sensitive
   to temperature, for example, superelasticity and zero/negative thermal
   expansion are limited in a narrow temperature range of about 100 Kelvin.
   Here we report a group of titanium alloys which are strong, ductile,
   flexible together with superelasticity and tunable thermal expansion
   from positive, via zero, to negative across a wide temperature range
   from below 4.2 K to 625 K. This is attributed to its nonlinear
   elasticity obeying a highorder Hooke's law due to a continuous and
   reversible atomic rearrangement at a large scale up to phase transition
   strain. Such novel mechanism distinguishes completely from the previous
   elastic and martensitic mechanisms ruled by Poisson ratio and sharp
   crystal structure change, respectively. We demonstrate that the
   atomic-level mechanism is organized adaptively by a nanoscale
   compositional modulation, which is created by a spinodal decomposition.
   These findings pave a way to design new solids through a nanoscale
   periodical distribution in chemistry.}},

Title = {{Chiral constrained stent: Effect of structural design on the mechanical
   and intravascular stent deployment performances}},
Journal = {{MECHANICS OF MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{148}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The high mortality of atherosclerosis-caused cardiovascular disease has
   promoted the requirement of designing novel intravascular stents with
   comprehensive robust mechanical performances, which is critical for
   re-constructing the blocked artery and recovering the biomechanical
   functions of artery vessels during vascular interventional therapy
   procedures. In this study, a chiral constrained structure with
   zero/negative Poisson's ratio and robust expansion transformation
   ability is proposed through combining the axial constraint effect of
   tetrachiral element and the good stretchability of oscillating wave
   element along circumferential direction. Afterwards, through applying
   the theoretical prediction, experimental tests and finite element
   analysis, the mechanical properties and stenting performances of the
   chiral constrained structure are explored. The modified tetrachiral
   topology shows strong orthotropic after integration of oscillating wave
   strut profile, indicating its capability of handling radial loads
   without great longitudinal recoil (foreshortening). Finally, stent
   deployment performances have been evaluated through a highly nonlinear
   coupling analysis of the stenosed vessels system, in terms of
   transformation characteristics, dogboning, radial recoil,
   foreshortening, and plaque prolapse ratio, etc. Especially, remarkable
   non-conventional performances of anti-dogboning and anti-foreshortening
   are identified in chiral constrained stent. Synthetically index is
   generated to compensate the competing behaviors among the above terms,
   and to improve the comprehensive mechanical performances of chiral
   constrained stent. These results show the potential in generating a new
   family of the intravascular stent with chiral mechanical metamaterials
   and provide a promising clinical application in curing atherosclerosis.}},

   Perceptions Questionnaire (CPQ) and examined for oral health conditions.
   Contextual variables were obtained from school coordinators regarding
   the social environment. Data analysis was performed through multilevel
   Poisson regression. A high negative impact on OHRQoL was found for
   participants who were girls, older, had very severe malocclusion, had
   dental trauma and caries, and had mothers with less schooling. A
   negative impact on OHRQoL was also found for children who attended
   schools in which police security was required (rate ratios {[}RR] =

   in the last year (RR = 1.17; 95\% CI: 1.02-1.35). The need for police
   security was associated with a negative impact on the emotional

   negative impact on the oral symptoms, functional limitations, and social

Abstract = {{A study of childhood malignancies in North Humberside for 1974-1986 has
   revealed significant spatial aggregations1.  Though no specific reason
   was found, certain geographical areas, tumour groups and putative risks
   were identified for further study.  One possible risk was a tin smelter
   to the west of Hull.  A new method of analysis (Stone's conditional
   Poisson maximum2,3) was used and showed some evidence of increased risk
   close to the smelter.  This was accounted for by the solid tumours
   (primarily central nervous system malignancies) and was not apparent for
   the leukaemias.
   The Poisson maximum method is a special case of isotonic regression; a
   more general isotonic regression method, also due to Stone, Maximum
   Likelihood Ratio (MLR), is also available, and for reasons described
   elsewhere4 we prefer the more general method.  The present study begins
   by applying this to the childhood data and then to data for
   corresponding adult disease (leukaemias and central nervous system
   tumours) in the same area and time period.  In both children and adults
   the results are negative for the leukaemias.  For the remaining tumour
   categories, there is a significant increase in risk close to the
   smelter, but it is not possible to identify any aspect of the smelter or
   features in its vicinity as causative.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated the spatial distribution of Tetramicra
   brevifilum spores in the musculature of infected turbot Scophthalmus
   maximus, with the aim of identifying the most appropriate body locations
   for diagnostic assays. A PCR protocol optimized for the detection of T.
   brevifilum spores in turbot muscle is also described. In fish showing
   low- and moderate-intensity infection, the spatial distribution of
   spores was best fitted by a negative binomial distribution, indicating a
   clumped spatial pattern; the negative binomial coefficient k was lower
   for fish with low-intensity infection, indicating a more markedly
   clumped pattern in these fish. In fish with high-intensity infection,
   the spatial distribution of spores was best fitted by the Poisson
   distribution, indicating a random pattern. In both low- and
   moderate-intensity infection, spores were present at highest density in
   the musculature adjoining the dorsal fins. Samples for PCR were
   therefore obtained from this location. PCR amplification was of the
   small subunit ribosomal DNA (SSUrDNA), using a pair of species-specific
   primers that amplify, the 1250 bp product. The PCR protocol developed
   showed better sensitivity than microscopical techniques (detection rate
   by microscopy 25\% versus 42\% by PCR), suggesting that it may be useful
   for routine screening for Tetramicra brevifilum infection in cultured
   turbot.}},

Abstract = {{This article examines the relationship between personality disorder (PD)
   symptoms and personality traits using a variety of distributional
   assumptions. Prior work in this area relies almost exclusively on linear
   models that treat PD symptoms as normally distributed and continuous.
   However, these assumptions rarely hold, and thus the results of prior
   studies are potentially biased. Here we explore the effect of varying
   the distributions underlying regression models relating PD
   symptomatology to personality traits using the initial wave of the
   Longitudinal Study of Personality Disorders (N = 250; Lenzenweger,
   1999), a university-based sample selected to include PD rates resembling
   epidemiological samples. PD symptoms were regressed on personality
   traits. The distributions underlying the dependent variable (i.e., PD
   symptoms) were variously modeled as normally distributed, as counts
   (Poisson, Negative-Binomial), and with two-part mixture distributions
   (zero-inflated, hurdle). We found that treating symptoms as normally
   distributed resulted in violations of model assumptions, that the
   negative-binomial and hurdle models were empirically equivalent, but
   that the coefficients achieving significance often differ depending on
   which part of the mixture distributions are being predicted (i.e.,
   presence vs. severity of PD). Results have implications for how the
   relationship between normal and abnormal personality is understood.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a computational framework for computational
   design and additive manufacturing of free-form periodic metasurfaces.
   The proposed scheme rests on the level-set-based topology approach and
   the conformal mapping theory. A metamaterial with pre-specified
   performance is created using a level-set-based topology optimization
   method. The achieved unit cell is further mapped to the 3D quad meshes
   on a free-form surface by applying the conformal mapping method which
   can preserve the local shape and angle during the mapping. With embedded
   geometric information, the proposed level-set-based optimization methods
   not only can act as a motivator for design synthesis, but also can be
   seamlessly hooked with additive manufacturing without the need of CAD
   reconstructions. The current computational framework provides a solution
   to increasing applications involving innovative metamaterial designs on
   free-form surfaces for different fields of interests. The performance of
   the proposed scheme is illustrated through two benchmark examples where
   a negative-Poisson's-ratio unit cell pattern, and a stiff and light
   inner structure are mapped to 3D free-form surfaces and fabricated
   through additive manufacturing. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A rigid smooth indentor slides at a constant speed on a compressible
   isotropic neo-Hookean half-space that is subjected to pre-stress aligned
   with the surface and sliding direction. A dynamic steady-sliding
   situation of plane strain is treated as the superposition of
   contact-triggered infinitesimal deformations superposed upon finite
   deformations due to pre-stress. The neo-Hookean material behaves for
   small mains as a linear elastic solid with Poisson's ratio 1 : 4. Exact
   solutions are presented for both deformations and, for a range of
   acceptable pre-stress values, the infinitesimal component exhibits the
   typical non-isotropy induced by pre-stress, and several critical speeds.
   In view of the unilateral constraints of contact, these speeds serve to
   define the sliding speed ranges for which physically acceptable
   solutions arise. A Rayleigh speed is the upper bound for subsonic
   sliding, and transonic sliding can occur only at a single speed. For the
   generic parabolic indentor, contact zone traction continuity is lost at
   the zone leading edge for trans- and supersonic sliding. For pre-stress
   levels that fall outside the acceptable range, either a negative Poisson
   effect occurs, or a Rayleigh speed does not exist and the unilateral
   constraints cannot be satisfied for any subsonic sliding speed.}},

Volume = {{32}},
Abstract = {{The aim of the present study was to evaluate the prevalence and impact
   of malocclusion on oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) among
   schoolchildren aged 8 to 10 years and their parents in Diamantina, a
   town in the southeast of Brazil. A cross-sectional study was conducted
   with a sample of 390 randomly selected children who were subjected to a
   clinical oral examination. The Dental Aesthetic Index was used to
   diagnose malocclusion and the need for orthodontic treatment. The Child
   Perceptions Questionnaire (CPQ (8-10)) was used to evaluate the impact
   of malocclusion on OHRQoL. The children's parents answered the Brazilian
   Economic Criterion Questionnaire for the socioeconomic classification.
   Data analysis involved the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test and
   Spearman's correlation coefficients. The variables were grouped into a
   hierarchy of categories ranging from distal to proximal determinants.
   Poisson regression analysis with robust variance was performed at each
   level to correlate the total CPQ (8-10) score with the independent
   variables. The prevalence of malocclusion was 78.7\%. Crossbite remained
   significantly a ssociated with a negative impact on OHRQoL (PR = 1.28;
   95\%CI:1.17-1.39; p < 0.001). The prevalence of malocclusion was high in
   the sample investigated and exerted a negative impact on OHRQoL.}},

Abstract = {{The vector generalized linear and additive model (VGLM/VGAM) classes of
   statistical regression models implement general maximum likelihood
   estimation and smoothing. The VGLM/VGAM framework is very general and is
   shown to include many popular fisheries regression models such as GLMs
   and GAMs, the negative binomial (NB), the zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP)
   and ZINB, the zero-altered Poisson (ZAP) and ZANB as special cases. The
   primary purpose of this article is to introduce the VGLM/VGAM
   methodology into fisheries science. To this end, data from the 2008
   FIPS-MOUCHE World Fly Fishing Championships is used to illustrate the
   chief advantages of the framework, viz. its large size and its ability
   to fit each model in a very flexible manner. Having a large framework
   leads to greater efficiencies in the practical modelling of data. The
   specific questions examined fall under two categories: (i) what
   distribution do the fish lengths have in each of the sectors? (ii) can
   fish catch reduction be detected and if so, how can the effects be
   ameliorated? As well as the above models, the utility of several other
   seemingly disparate regression models to fisheries research are
   presented, such as the bivariate odds-ratio model, the generalized
   extreme value distribution, and several quantile regression techniques.

Abstract = {{Objective Faecal immunochemical tests (FITs) are replacing guaiac faecal
   occult blood tests (gFOBTs) for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening.
   Incidence of interval colorectal cancer (iCRC) following a negative
   stool test result is not yet known. We aimed to compare incidence of
   iCRC following a negative FIT or gFOBT.
   Design We searched Ovid Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, Science
   Citation Index, PubMed and Google Scholar from inception to 12 December
   2017 for citations related to CRC screening based on stool tests. We
   included studies on FIT or gFOBT iCRC in averagerisk screening
   populations. Main outcome was pooled incidence rate of iCRCs per 100 000
   person-years (p-y). Pooled incidence rates were obtained by fitting
   randomeffect Poisson regression models.
   Results We identified 7 426 records and included 29 studies.
   Meta-analyses comprised data of 6 987 825 subjects with a negative test
   result, in whom 11 932 screen-detected CRCs and 5 548 gFOBT or FIT iCRCs
   were documented. Median faecal haemoglobin (Hb) positivity cut-off used
   was 20 (range 10-200) mu g Hb/g faeces in the 17 studies that provided
   FIT results. Pooled incidence rates of iCRC following FIT and gFOBT were
   20 (95\% CI 14 to 29; I2= 99\%) and 34 (95\% CI 20 to 57; I2= 99\%) per
   100 000 p-y, respectively. Pooled incidence rate ratio of FIT versus
   gFOBT iCRC was 0.58 (95\% CI 0.32 to 1.07; I2= 99\%) and 0.36 (95\% CI
   0.17 to 0.75; I2= 10\%) in sensitivity analysis. For every FIT iCRC, 2.6
   screen-detected CRCs were found (ratio 1: 2.6); for gFOBT, the ratio
   between iCRC and screen-detected CRC was 1: 1.2. Age below 60 years and
   the third screening round were significantly associated with a lower
   iCRC rate.
   Conclusion A negative gFOBT result is associated with a higher iCRC
   incidence than a negative FIT. This supports the use of FIT over gFOBT
   as CRC screening tool.}},

Abstract = {{Mechanical metamaterials exhibit properties and functionalities that
   cannot be realized in conventional materials. Originally, the field
   focused on achieving unusual (zero or negative) values for familiar
   mechanical parameters, such as density, Poisson's ratio or
   compressibility, but more recently, new classes of metamaterials -
   including shape-morphing, topological and nonlinear metamaterials - have
   emerged. These materials exhibit exotic functionalities, such as pattern
   and shape transformations in response to mechanical forces,
   unidirectional guiding of motion and waves, and reprogrammable stiffness
   or dissipation. In this Review, we identify the design principles
   leading to these properties and discuss, in particular, linear and
   mechanism-based metamaterials (such as origami-based and kirigami-based
   metamaterials), metamaterials harnessing instabilities and frustration,
   and topological metamaterials. We conclude by outlining future
   challenges for the design, creation and conceptualization of advanced

Title = {{Mechanics of unusual soft network materials with rotatable structural
   nodes}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICS AND PHYSICS OF SOLIDS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{146}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Soft network materials consisting of filamentary horseshoe
   microstructures represent a class of architected materials of practical
   interest in flexible, bio-integrated electronics, because they can be
   tailored to reproduce accurately nonlinear stress-strain responses of
   biological tissues. The previous studies of these bio-inspired soft
   network materials focused mostly on the intriguing mechanical responses
   (e.g., J-shaped stress-strain curves and negative Poisson's ratios)
   before their fracture, and paid little attention on their utmost
   strength and stretchability. The development of soft network materials
   that can offer both a high stretchability (e.g., > 100\%) and a
   relatively high strength (e.g., > 50 MPa) remains challenging. This
   paper presents the design, mechanics modeling and experimental
   measurement of a novel type of soft network materials that introduce
   rotatable structural lattice nodes (either with ring or disk shapes) to
   offer an enhanced deformability. Based on the analyses of the periodic
   building-block structure, we develop a nonlinear mechanics model of
   unusual soft network materials made of elastic constituent materials.
   Validated by finite element analyses (FEA) and experiments, this
   theoretical model can well predict the J-shaped stress-strain curves and
   deformed configurations of unusual soft network materials with a variety
   of geometric parameters. The results based on the developed model
   provide insights into the underlying relationship between nonlinear
   mechanical properties and key geometric parameters. For unusual soft
   network materials made of metals, an Ashby plot in terms of the strength
   and the stretchability is presented, highlighting the advantages of
   developed network materials over the existing network materials and
   typical soft materials. Moreover, computational models based on
   representative unit cells with periodic boundary conditions allow
   precise predictions of the utmost strength and stretchability, which can
   thereby serve as a reliable design tool. Due to the combined mechanical
   attributes of high stretchability, relatively high strength, and
   negative Poisson's ratio, the proposed unusual soft network materials
   can be used in various device systems of bio-integrated electronics.}},

Abstract = {{We employ a combination of the single chain in mean field simulation
   approach with the solution of Poisson's equation to study the influence
   of charge heterogeneities on the structure of protein-polyelectrolyte
   complexes. By adopting a coarse-grained model of representing proteins
   as charged nanoparticles, we studied the influence of the pattern of
   charge heterogeneities, net charge, ratio of positive to negative
   charges on the patches, and the volume fraction of the particles on the
   structural and aggregation characteristics of proteins in
   polyelectrolyte solutions. Our results demonstrate that the pattern of
   charge heterogeneities can exert a significant influence on the
   resulting characteristics of the aggregates, in some cases leading to a
   transformation from polymer-bridged complexes into direct particle
   aggregates driven by the attraction between oppositely charged patches.}},

Abstract = {{Experimental data on a cracked medium exhibiting high acoustic
   nonlinearity is a commonly observed phenomenon. Here a physical model of
   a medium with cracks is suggested to explain the observed phenomena. The
   model is based on the assumption of uniform stress that is valid for a
   low concentration of cracks. The crack behavior is described using the
   model in which a crack is represented as an elastic contact of two rough
   surfaces, pressed one to the other under the action of internal stresses
   in the surrounding solid. Linear and nonlinear acoustic constants of the
   fractured medium are calculated. It is shown that, in this medium,
   negative values of the Poisson's ratio and anomalously high values of
   the nonlinear constants are possible. (C) 1997 Acoustical Society of

Abstract = {{This paper discusses the real-time prediction of queue lengths from
   probe vehicles for the Bunch arrival headways at an isolated
   intersection for undersaturated conditions. The paper incorporates the
   bunching effect of the traffic into the evaluation of the accuracy of
   the predictions as a function of proportion of probe vehicles to entire
   vehicle population. Formulations are presented for predicting the
   expected queue length and its variance based on Negative Exponential and
   Bunched Exponential vehicle headways. Numerical results for both vehicle
   headway types are documented to show how prediction errors behave by the
   volume to capacity ratio and probe proportions. It is found that the
   Poisson arrivals generate conservative confidence intervals and demand
   higher probe proportions compared to Bunched Exponential headways at the
   same arrival rate and probe proportion.}},

Journal = {{PLASMA SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},

Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, a 1D fluid model is developed to study the
   characteristics of a discharge in argon with small admixtures of oxygen
   at atmospheric pressure. This model consists of a series of equations,
   including continuity equations for electrons, positive ions, negative
   ions and neutral particles, the energy equation, and the Poisson
   equation for electric potential. Special attention has been paid to the
   electron energy dissipation and the mechanisms of electron heating,
   while the admixture of oxygen is in the range of 0.1\%-0.6\%. It is
   found that when the oxygen-to-argon ratio grows, the discharge is
   obviously divided into three stages: electron growth, electron reduction
   and the electron remaining unchanged. Furthermore, the cycle-averaged
   electric field, electron temperature, electron Ohmic heating, electron
   collisionless heating, electron energy dissipation and the net electron
   production are also studied in detail, and when the oxygen-toargon ratio
   is relatively larger (R = 0.6\%), double value peaks of electron Ohmic
   heating appear in the sheath. According to the results of the numerical
   simulation, various oxygen-to-argon ratios result in different amounts
   of electron energy dissipation and electron heating.}},

Abstract = {{The change in the frequency of a rare mutant allele under constant
   sex-differentiated viability selection in an infinite, partial full-sib
   mating population is studied. The diplo-diploid and haplo-diploid
   polygynous models are considered with a Poisson distribution for the
   number of offspring produced by every mated female. Reproduction is
   followed by weak selection among the offspring and then mating to form
   the next generation. It is shown that the rate of change with respect to
   the frequency of the mutant allele and the intensity of selection can be
   expressed in terms of costs or benefits of substituting the mutant type
   for the wild type, which correspond to average excesses in viability in
   females and males, multiplied by coefficients of relatedness to the
   individuals affected by such a substitution and reproductive values
   associated to the sexes of these individuals. This reveals hidden
   interactions between mated individuals and between males for mating, the
   former having positive effects on the reproductive success of related
   individuals and the latter having negative effects. Such interactions
   are the result of reproductive constraints when a fixed proportion of
   females must mate with a male sib and all females are fertilized as long
   as one mate is available. However, they affect the change in allele
   frequency because there is inbreeding or relatedness between mates and
   more generally relatedness between interacting individuals.
   Surprisingly, the effects of these interactions cancel out in a diploid
   population when the number of offspring is large enough so that the
   possibility for a female to have no male sib to mate with can be
   neglected and the viability differences are the same in both sexes.}},

Abstract = {{Solids exhibit transverse shrinkage when they are stretched, except
   auxetics that abnormally demonstrate lateral expansion instead. Graphene
   possesses the unique normal-auxeticity (NA) transition when it is
   stretched along the armchair direction but not along the zigzag
   direction. Here we report on the anisotropic temperature-dependent NA
   transitions in strained graphene using molecular dynamics simulations.
   The critical strain where the NA transition occurs increases with
   respect to an increase in the tilt angle deviating from armchair
   direction upon uniaxial loading. The magic angle for the NA transition
   is 10.9 degrees, beyond which the critical strain is close to fracture
   strain. In addition, the critical strain decreases with an increasing
   temperature when the tilt angle is smaller than the NA magic angle. Our
   results shed lights on the unprecedented nonlinear dimensional response
   of graphene to the large mechanical loading at various temperatures. (C)

Title = {{Model selection and multimodel inference for standardizing catch rates

Abstract = {{One key issue for standardizing catch per unit effort (CPUE) of bycatch
   species is how to model observations of zero catch per fishing
   operation. Typically, the fraction of zero catches is high, and catch
   counts may be overdispersed. In this study, we develop a model selection
   and multimodel inference approach to standardize CPUE in a case study of
   oceanic whitetip shark (Carcharhinus longimanus) bycatch in the
   Hawaii-based pelagic longline fishery. Alternative hypotheses for shark
   catch per longline set were characterized by the variance to mean ratio
   of the count distribution. Zero-inflated and non-inflated Poisson,
   negative binomial, and delta-gamma models were fit to fishery observer
   data using stepwise variable selection. Alternative hypotheses were
   compared using multimodel inference. Results from the best-fitting
   zero-inflated negative binomial model showed that standardized CPUE of
   oceanic whitetip sharks decreased by about 90\% during 1995-2010 because
   of increased zero catch sets and decreased CPUE on sets with positive
   catch. Our model selection approach provides an objective way to address
   the question of how to treat zero catches when analyzing bycatch CPUE.}},

Abstract = {{Concentration of molecules within the tips of nanopipettes when applying
   a DC voltage is herein investigated using finite-element simulations.
   The ion concentrations and fluxes due to diffusion, electro-migration,
   and electro-osmotic flow, and the electric potential are determined by
   the simultaneous solution of the Nernst-Planck, Poisson, and
   Navier-Stokes equations within the water solution containing sodium and
   chloride ions and negatively charged molecules. The electric potential
   within the pipette glass wall is at the same time determined by the
   Poisson equation together with appropriate boundary conditions and
   accounts for a field effect through the wall. Fixed negative surface
   charge on both the internal and external glass surfaces of the
   nanopipette is included together with the field effect through the glass
   wall to account for the electric double layer and the electro-osmosis.
   The inclusion of the field effect through the pipette wall is new
   compared to previous modeling of similar structures and is shown to be
   crucial for the behavior at the tip. It is demonstrated that the
   concentration of molecules is a consequence of ionic charge accumulation
   at the tip screening the electric field, thereby slowing down the
   electrophoretic motion of the molecules, which is further slowed down or
   stopped by the oppositely directed electro-osmosis. It is also shown
   that the trapping is very sensitive to the properties of the molecule,
   that is, its electrophoretic mobility and diffusion coefficient, the
   properties of the pipette, the ionic strength of the solution, and the
   applied electric field.}},

   computational form of the asymptotic distribution of the change-point
   mle is derived for the case of known parameter situation only.
   Simulations show that the distribution for the known case applies very
   well to the case where the parameters are estimated. Further, it is seen
   from simulations that the derived unconditional mle shows better
   performance compared to the conditional solution of Cobb. Application of

Abstract = {{Since diplomatic relations were established between China and Korea, the
   two countries have expanded their relationships, especially in trading
   commodities and services. However, in recent years, as tariff levels
   have fallen, China has sought to implement other protectionist
   mechanisms. The use of non-tariff measures has added another dimension
   to international trade activities that need to be better understood. The
   paper analyses the impacts that two forms of non-tariff measures,
   technical barriers to trade (TBT) and sanitary and phytosanitary
   measures, have on Korean exports to China. To measure the impacts, we
   use an adapted version of the gravity model and the Poisson
   pseudo-maximum likelihood method. The results show that Chinese sanitary
   and phytosanitary measures, estimated using both the coverage ratio and
   the frequency index, have positive correlations with Korean agricultural
   exports; however, Chinese TBT measures, when estimated by the coverage
   ratio, were found to depress Korean manufacturing exports and exports as
   a whole. However, using the frequency index, Chinese TBT measures were
   found to have a statistically insignificant negative impact on Korean
   exports to China.}},

   membranes}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{376-383}},
Abstract = {{A two-region model for describing the conductivity of porous fixed
   charge membranes is proposed. In the surface region, the conductivity is
   due to the mobile positive ions (counterions) around the negative fixed
   charges. In the pore center region, the conductive properties resemble
   those of the external electrolyte solution because the fixed charges are
   assumed to be effectively neutralized by the counterions in the surface
   region. Activation energies and surface diffusion coefficients are
   estimated by assuming that the counterion jump from a fixed charge group
   is the rate limiting process for surface transport. The barrier energy
   for this jump is calculated using a simple electrostatic model with two
   microscopic parameters, the sum of the counterion and fixed charge
   hydration radii and the local dielectric constant. The bulk conductivity
   is obtained from experimental data. The total membrane conductivity and
   the counterion transport number are then calculated as functions of the
   external solution concentration for several pore radii and membrane
   fixed charge concentrations. The results are compared with those given
   by the Donnan model for homogeneous membranes and by the numerical
   solution of a continuous model based on the Poisson Boltzmann equation
   extended to finite size ions. The study of the membrane conductivity for
   a series of electrolytes allows to distinguish clearly between the
   mechanism characteristic of the bulk ionic conductivity and that of
   surface conductivity. The surface conductivity is found to be
   significant for narrow pores at low external solution concentrations.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents results from an analysis of traffic measurements
   taken at the G(b) interface of a GPRS network. Data was captured in one
   week long data sets between November 2002 to March 2004. This paper
   provides new results, based on three of these data sets, and extends on
   the work presented in {[}5]. The data was analysed to characterise the
   aggregate workload statistics, including marginal distribution and
   autocorrelation, and identify any trends over this timeframe. A study of
   models that adequately characterise the traffic was also undertaken.
   We find that the aggregate work process (Bytes ``departing{''} the SGSN)
   has a marginal distribution closely matching a negative exponential;
   however, this does not allow us to conclude that the packet arrival or
   departure processes are Poisson. The ``burstiness{''} of the traffic
   (i.e. the Coefficient of Variation) was found to become smaller over
   time, i.e. the traffic became smoother. This occurred due to a greater
   level of aggregation, as a direct result of more ``low traffic{''} users
   connecting to the network This may be indicative of an increase in WAP
   and mobile e-mail usage
   Four potential models for the aggregate work process were investigated
   The latest data shows that the trend towards a more Gaussian-type
   marginal distribution model continues. Of the four models studied, the
   Poisson Pareto Burst Process gave the best fit to the queueing
   performance compared with the recorded traffic traces. The fit to the
   most recent data traffic measurements has substantially improved
   compared with the earlier results.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Social media monitoring during TV broadcasts dedicated to
   vaccines can provide information on vaccine confidence. We analyzed the
   sentiment of tweets published in reaction to two TV broadcasts in Italy
   dedicated to vaccines, one based on scientific evidence {[}Presadiretta
   (PD)] and one including anti-vaccine personalities {[}Virus (VS)].
   Methods: Tweets about vaccines published in an 8-day period centred on
   each of the two TV broadcasts were classified by sentiment. Differences
   in tweets' and users' characteristics between the two broadcasts were
   tested through Poisson, quasi-Poisson or logistic univariate regression.
   We investigated the association between users' characteristics and
   sentiment through univariate quasi-binomial logistic regression.
   Results: We downloaded 12 180 tweets pertinent to vaccines, published by
   5447 users; 276 users tweeted during both broadcasts. Sentiment was
   positive in 50.4\% of tweets, negative in 37.7\% and neutral in 10.1\%
   (remaining tweets were unclear or questions). The positive/negative
   ratio was higher for VS compared to PD (6.96 vs. 4.24, P<0.001).
   Positive sentiment was associated to the user's number of followers (OR
   1.68, P<0.001), friends (OR 1.83, P<0.001) and published tweets (OR
   1.46, P<0.001) and to being a recurrent user (OR 3.26, P<0.001).
   Conclusions: Twitter users were highly reactive to TV broadcasts
   dedicated to vaccines. Sentiment was mainly positive, especially among
   very active users. Displaying anti-vaccine positions on TV elicited a
   positive sentiment on Twitter. Listening to social media during TV shows
   dedicated to vaccines can provide a diverse set of data that can be
   exploited by public health institutions to inform tailored vaccine
   communication initiatives.}},

Abstract = {{This paper analyses the distribution of longline catches of swordfish,
   Xiphias gladius, and six species of pelagic elasmobranchs, during a
   fishing voyage in the tropical eastern Atlantic. Seven scales of
   sampling units, ranging from about 0.72 to 7.2 km were used. Observed
   frequencies of appearance of each species in the basic sampling unit,
   were compared with theoretical frequencies obtained from the Poisson and
   negative binomial distributions. For the study of the interspecific
   relationships. contingency tables were used and the degree of
   association was estimated using the chi-2-test and the coefficient v of
   Kendall. The catch distribution of the swordfish and the devil ray
   (Mobula sp.) can be explained by both randomness and a slight trend to
   association. For the pelagic sharks, a clear trend towards intraspecific
   clustering was found. Catches of two species of the genus Carcharhinus
   showed the most positive trends to interspecific association, especially
   in short ranges, probably due to attraction to previously hooked fish.
   The possible causes of these distributions are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this work was to investigate the effect of the membrane
   fixed-charge concentration on the electrochemical impedance of
   ion-exchange membrane systems and the specific properties of the
   impedance of ion-exchange systems with weakly charged membranes. The
   systems under study are constituted by a membrane with a homogeneous
   distribution of negative fixed-charge and two diffusion boundary layers
   on both sides of the membrane. The ionic transport processes of a binary
   electrolyte are theoretically described by the Nernst-Planck and Poisson
   equations not only in the ion-exchange membrane but also in the two
   diffusion boundary layers. The electrochemical impedance for different
   values of the anion diffusion coefficients and the direct component of
   the applied electric current has been obtained by using the network
   simulation method as a function of the membrane fixed-charge
   concentration. New results are presented in relation with the evolution
   of the characteristic frequency of the diffusion impedance and the dc
   resistance of the system with the uniform concentration of the
   fixed-charge inside the membrane.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The objective of the study is 2-fold. First, it estimates the 2019 new
   coronavirus disease (COVID19) flattening curve using Panel Random
   Coefficient Model. This allows each country to have its trajectory while
   allowing for random error effects to transfer across countries. Second,
   it calculates the expected number of days to reach the flattening point
   of COVID19 curve and estimate the empirical effectiveness of government
   policies around the world using Poisson regression. This study avails
   global COVID19 incidence data for 190 countries between January 22, 2020
   and May 11, 2020. In the absence of a vaccine or of more appropriate
   treatment options, non-pharmaceutical approaches must be used to control
   the spread of the COVID19. This study proposed that the contact tracing,
   stay at home restrictions and international movement restrictions are
   most effective in controlling the spread and flattening the COIVD19
   curve. At the same time, habits that hurt the immune system like smoking
   have a negative effect on the flattening of the curve. The government
   should integrate these policies in their lockdown plan to make it smart
   lockdown.}},

Abstract = {{The continuous extension of a discrete random variable is amongst the
   computational methods used for estimation of multivariate normal
   copula-based models with discrete margins. Its advantage is that the
   likelihood can be derived conveniently under the theory for copula
   models with continuous margins, but there has not been a clear analysis
   of the adequacy of this method. We investigate the asymptotic and
   small-sample efficiency of two variants of the method for estimating the
   multivariate normal copula with univariate binary, Poisson, and negative
   binomial regressions, and show that they lead to biased estimates for
   the latent correlations, and the univariate marginal parameters that are
   not regression coefficients. We implement a maximum simulated likelihood
   method, which is based on evaluating the multidimensional integrals of
   the likelihood with randomized quasi-Monte Carlo methods. Asymptotic and
   small-sample efficiency calculations show that our method is nearly as
   efficient as maximum likelihood for fully specified multivariate normal
   copula-based models. An illustrative example is given to show the use of
   our simulated likelihood method. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Fluctuations of conserved quantities such as baryon number, charge, and
   strangeness are sensitive to the correlation length of the hot and dense
   matter created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions and can be used to
   search for the QCD critical point. We report the first measurements of
   the moments of net-kaon multiplicity distributions in Au+Au collisions
   at root s(NN) = 7.7, 11.5, 14.5, 19.6, 27, 39, 62.4, and 200 GeV. The
   collision centrality and energy dependence of the mean (M), variance
   (sigma(2)), skewness (S), and kurtosis (kappa) for net-kaon multiplicity
   distributions as well as the ratio sigma(2)/M and the products S sigma
   and kappa sigma(2) are presented. Comparisons are made with Poisson and
   negative binomial baseline calculations as well as with UrQMD, a
   transport model (UrQMD) that does not include effects from the QCD
   critical point. Within current uncertainties, the net-kaon cumulant
   ratios appear to be monotonic as a function of collision energy. (c)

Abstract = {{Single-stream recycling is currently an extremely labor intensive
   process due to the need for manual object sorting. Soft robotics offers
   a natural solution as compliant robots require less computation to plan
   paths and grasp objects in a cluttered environment. However, most soft
   robots are not robust enough to handle the many sharp objects present in
   a recycling facility. In this work, we present a soft sensorized robotic
   gripper which is fully electrically driven and can detect the difference
   between paper, metal and plastic. By combining handed shearing auxetics
   with high deformation capacitive pressure and strain sensors, we present
   a new puncture resistant soft robotic gripper. Our materials classifier
   has 85\% accuracy with a stationary gripper and 63\% accuracy in a
   simulated recycling pipeline. This classifier works over a variety of
   objects, including those that would fool a purely vision-based system.}},

Abstract = {{This paper enables the synthesis of flexure-based transmission
   mechanisms that possess multiple decoupled inputs and outputs of any
   type (e.g., rotations, translations, and/or screw motions), which are
   linked by designer-specified transmission ratios. A comprehensive
   library of geometric shapes is utilized from which a multiplicity of
   feasible concepts that possess the desired transmission characteristics
   may be rapidly conceptualized and compared before an optimal concept is
   selected. These geometric shapes represent the mathematics of screw
   theory and uniquely link a body's desired motions to the flexible
   constraints that enable those motions. This paper is significant to the
   design of nano-positioners, motion stages, and optical mounts. It is
   also significant to the design of transmission-based microstructural
   architectures for creating new materials with extraordinary mechanical
   properties. The microstructural architecture for a material that
   achieves a negative Poisson's ratio as well as a hand-actuated two
   degree of freedom (DOF) microscopy stage are designed as case studies to
   demonstrate the utility of this theory. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{We used cross-sectional data on 2,660 black and 2,611 Mexican-American
   adult participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination
   Survey (1999-2006) to investigate the association between
   metropolitan-level racial/ethnic residential segregation and obesity and
   to determine whether it was mediated by the neighborhood socioeconomic
   environment. Residential segregation was measured using the black and
   Hispanic isolation indices. Neighborhood poverty and negative income
   incongruity were assessed as mediators. Multilevel Poisson regression
   with robust variance estimates was used to estimate prevalence ratios.
   There was no relationship between segregation and obesity among men.
   Among black women, in age-, nativity-, and metropolitan
   demographic-adjusted models, high segregation was associated with a 1.29
   (95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.00, 1.65) times higher obesity
   prevalence than was low segregation; medium segregation was associated
   with a 1.35 (95\% CI: 1.07, 1.70) times higher obesity prevalence.
   Mexican-American women living in high versus low segregation areas had a
   significantly lower obesity prevalence (prevalence ratio, 0.54; 95\% CI:
   0.33, 0.90), but there was no difference between those living in medium
   versus low segregation areas. These associations were not mediated by
   neighborhood poverty or negative income incongruity. These findings
   suggest variability in the interrelationships between residential
   segregation and obesity for black and Mexican-American women.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: This study aimed to establish the prevalence, pattern and
   nature of coaches' verbal behaviour at children's (ages 6-12 years) team
   sports events. The study draws upon the motivational model presented by
   Mageau and Vallerand (2003) to examine the influence of global (gender),
   contextual (sport related), and social (athlete gender) factors on coach
   comments.
   Design: A cross-sectional observational study of coaches stratified
   across four team sports: Rugby Union, Netball, Association Football and
   Touch Rugby.
   Method: The Observation Instrument at Sports Events was used to
   categorise covertly recorded verbal comments made by coaches at
   organised team sports games.
   Results: Overall, 10,697 comments were recorded at 72 games at a rate of
   3.71 comments/minute; 35.4\% were categorised as positive, 21.6\% as
   negative, and 43.0\% as neutral. Significant differences in negative
   comments were identified between sport (p<.001) with rugby coaches
   recording the highest percentage of negative comments and the lowest
   percentage of positive comments; by coach gender (p<.001), with male
   coaches recording higher rates of negative comments; and by athlete
   gender (p<.001), with coaches of male-only teams recording higher rates
   of negative comments. When simultaneously included in a Poisson
   regression model the difference in negative comments between sports
   remained statistically significant (p<.001) whereas coach gender was no
   longer significant.
   Conclusions: The ratio of negative coach comments for all sports gives
   cause for concern. These findings suggest that sports of national and
   cultural significance are a key driver of coaching behaviours in a
   competitive environment. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Attitudes associated with behavioral predictors of serious road traffic

Abstract = {{Objectives: To test the hypothesis that behavioral predictors of serious
   road traffic crashes (RTC) are correlated with unfavorable attitudes
   towards traffic safety.
   Design: Prospective and cross-sectional cohort study.
   Setting: France Participants: 13 447 of the 19 894 living members of the
   GAZEL cohort, workers and recent retirees of a French national utility
   company followed up since 1989.
   Main outcomes measures: Driving behavior and attitudes towards traffic
   safety in 2001 by questionnaire. Serious RTCs were recorded over the
   subsequent 3 years using the cohort annual questionnaire. Behavioral
   predictors of serious RTCs were assessed using generalized linear
   Poisson regression models with time-dependent covariates. Factor scores
   extracted from the first four attitudinal factors of principal component
   analysis were saved and then regressed on behavioral predictors as
   independent variables.
   Results: After controlling for potential confounders, the best
   predictors of serious RTCs were: ``exceeding speed limits on rural
   roads{''}, ``risky use of cellular phone{''}, and ``sleepy driving{''}.
   The adjusted rate ratio ranged from 1.47 to 2.16. Predictors of
   contravention of the highway code ( the first two predictors) were found
   to be strongly associated with negative attitudes towards
   ``enforcement{''} and ``speed limitations{''} with an adjusted odds
   ratio ranging from 1.31 to 2.02.
   Conclusion: Our study supports the view that individuals with a high
   propensity for driving behaviors associated with an increased risk of
   RTCs were more likely to have negative attitudes towards traffic safety.
   Changing drivers' negative or distorted opinions of traffic
   ``enforcement{''} as well as ``speed limitations{''} and ``alcohol
   prohibition on roads{''} could improve their compliance with road
   traffic rules.}},

Abstract = {{The interaction between glucose oxidase (GOx) and phospholipid
   monolayers is studied at the 1, 2-dichloroethane/water interface by
   electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Electrochemical experiments show
   that the presence of GOx induces changes in the capacitance curves at
   both negative and positive potentials, which are successfully explained
   by a theoretical model based on the solution of the Poisson-Boltzmann
   equation. These changes ore ascribed to a reduced partition coefficient
   of GOx and on increase of the permittivity of the lipid hydrocarbon
   domain. Our results show that the presence of lipid molecules enhances
   the adsorption of GOx molecules at the liquid/liquid interface. At low
   lipid concentrations, the adsorption of GOx is probably the first step
   preceding its penetration into the lipid monolayer. The experimental
   results indicate that GOx penetrates better and forms more stable
   monolayers for lipids with longer hydrophobic toils. At high GOx
   concentrations, the formation of multilayers is observed. The phenomenon
   described here is strongly dependent on 1) the GOx and lipid
   concentrations, 2) the nature of the lipid, and 3) the potential drop
   across the interface.}},

Abstract = {{The discovery of ferroelectrics induced by peculiar magnetic structures
   brought about extensive theoretical and experimental studies. The key
   driving force for these magnetic ferroelectrics appears to lie in the
   inverse Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction in magnets with
   long-wavelength ``noncollinear{''} spin structures. In this Brief
   Report, we report the magnetodielectric effect in dysprosium iron garnet
   which has a noncollinear spin structure within a single unit cell,
   through the same DM interaction. The distinct effects of magnetism on
   the lattice are also demonstrated by the unprecedented magnetostriction
   with a negative Poisson ratio. We attribute the observed
   magnetodielectric effects and the huge magnetostriction to the
   magnetic-field-induced spin reorientation from noncollinear to
   collinear, which possibly weakens the proposed antiferroelectric-type
   lattice distortion. Our results suggest an additional class of
   magnetodielectrics and enrich the theoretical understanding of phenomena
   related to peculiar magnetic structures.}},

Abstract = {{Background Active tuberculosis (TB) risk increases during anti-tumor
   necrosis factor (TNF) therapy; therefore, latent TB infection (LTBI)
   screening is recommended in potential TNF inhibitor users. It is unclear
   whether anti-TNF therapy increases the risk of active TB infection even
   after standard LTBI treatment.
   Objective The objective of this study was to compare the risk of active
   TB development in LTBI-positive versus LBTI-negative TNF inhibitor users
   following the current national LTBI treatment guidelines for LTBI.
   Methods We retrospectively studied 949 TNF inhibitor users with
   immune-mediated inflammatory diseases from 2005 to 2012 at the Yonsei
   University Health System. We compared the incidence of active TB among
   LTBI-positive TNF inhibitor users treated according to national
   guidelines (n = 256) and LTBI-negative TNF inhibitor users (n = 521),
   using Poisson regression.
   Results The active TB incidence was 1107 per 100,000 patient-years in
   LTBI-positive TNF inhibitor users who received standard LTBI treatment
   and 490 per 100,000 patient-years in LTBI-negative TNF inhibitor users.
   Analysis showed that despite this numerical trend active TB risk was not
   statistically significantly elevated in LTBI-positive versus
   LTBI-negative TNF inhibitor users (incidence risk ratio, 2.15; P = 0.24;
   95\% confidence interval, 0.6-7.7).
   Conclusions This study demonstrated no statistically significantly
   increased risk of active TB in LTBI-positive TNF inhibitor users who
   received standard LTBI treatment compared with LTBI-negative TNF
   inhibitor users.}},

Abstract = {{We analyze the electrostatic and hydrodynamic properties of a nuclease
   from the pathogenic gram-negative bacterium Serratia marcescens using
   finite-difference Poisson-Boltzmann methods for electrostatic
   calculations and a bead-model approach for diffusion coefficient
   calculations.
   Electrostatic properties are analyzed for the enzyme in monomeric and
   dimeric Sol ms and also in the context of DNA binging by the nuclease.
   Our preliminary results show that binding of a double-stranded DNA
   dodecamer by nuclease causes an overall shift in the charge of the
   protein by approximately three units of elementary charge pet monomer,
   resulting, in a positively charged protein? at physiologic pH. In these
   calculations,the free enzyme was found to have a negative (-1 e) charge
   per monomer at pH 7. The most dramatic shift in pK(a) involves His 89
   whose pK(a) increases by three pH units upon DNA binding. This shift
   leads to a protonated residue at pH 7, in contrast to the unprotonated
   form in the free enzyme. DNA binding also leads to a decrease in the
   energetic distances between the most stable protonation states of the
   enzyme. Dimerization has no significant effect on the electrostatic
   properties of each of the monomers for both free enzyme and that bound
   to DNA.
   Results of hydrodynamic calculations are consistent with the dimeric
   form of the enzyme in solution. The computed translational diffusion
   coefficient for the dimer model of the enzyme is in very good agreement
   with measurements from light scattering experiments. Preliminary
   electrooptical calculations indicate that the dimer should possess a
   large dipole moment (appr- oximately 600 Debye units) as well as
   substantial optical anisotropy (limiting reduced linear electric
   dichroism of about 0.3). Therefore, this system may serve as a good
   model for investigation of electric and hydrodynamic properties by
   relaxation electrooptical experiments. (C) 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.}},

   study of the structural, electronic, vibrational, and elastic properties
   of monolayer MgB2, based on ab initio methods. First-principles
   calculations reveal the importance of reduction of dimensionality on the
   properties of MgB2 and thoroughly describe the properties of this novel
   2D material. The presence of a negative Poisson ratio, higher density of
   states at the Fermi level, and a good dynamic stability under strain
   make the MgB2 monolayer a prominent material, both for fundamental
   research and application studies.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to investigate factors associated with
   negative self-rated oral health. Elderly subjects from the Brazilian
   Ministry of Health's oral health survey (2002-2003) who rated their own
   oral health as bad or very bad were compared to those who rated their
   oral health as excellent, good, or fair, using prevalence ratios based
   on Poisson regression. The minority (870; 17\%) gave their own oral
   health a negative rating. Negative self-rated oral health was less
   prevalent among those with 1-9 teeth and the edentulous, and more
   prevalent among blacks, mixed-race, and indigenous, those who had never
   used dental service, with soft tissue alterations, who reported little
   pain or medium to intense pain, rated their own appearance and chewing
   as fair or bad or very bad, reported that their oral health limited
   their social interaction a little or considerably, and reported needing
   dental treatment (PR = 1,47; 95\% CI: 1.20-1.79). Despite their
   precarious oral conditions, the majority gave their oral health a
   positive rating. Subjective conditions were more heavily associated with
   self-rated oral health than were objective conditions. The findings
   suggest unequal oral health conditions and allow orienting public
   policies aimed at oral health and quality of life.}},

Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, a theoretical model is proposed to predict the initial
   failure location and the failure progression of the lattice structures
   made from the elastic-brittle bulk materials. The effects of size and
   topology on the tensile failure behavior of multiple representative
   lattice structures (2D auxetic, 2D diamond, 2D triangularl and 2D
   triangular2), under various geometry design conditions (including cell
   topology, cell size and number of unit cells), are systematically
   investigated through the proposed analytical model. From the results, it
   was shown that the 2D bending-dominated structures with lower nodal
   connectivity (number of struts that meet in joints) (2D auxetic and 2D
   diamond) exhibited a relatively progressive crack propagation pattern,
   while the 2D stretching-dominated structures with higher nodal
   connectivity (2D triangularl and 2D triangular2) appear to exhibit
   rather catastrophic brittle fracture failure. During the failure
   fracture propagation, the energy absorption of the 2D
   stretching-dominated structures were significantly higher than that of
   the 2D bending-dominated structures. Moreover, for all lattice designs,
   the tensile failure behaviors tend to converge to more consistent
   patterns when the unit cell numbers increase beyond certain limitations.}},

Abstract = {{Hydraulic fracturing plays an important role in the exploitation of oil,
   shale gas and coal seam gas resources-all of which contain natural
   fractures. We systematically explore the role of the pre-existing
   texture of such natural fractures on the form of the resulting
   stimulated reservoir volume (SRV). A blocky discrete element model (DEM)
   coupled with fluid flow is used to explore this response. Numerical
   predictions for the evolution of fluid pressure and fracture width at
   the well are compared with first-order analytical approximations of the
   zero-toughness solution (FMO). We then construct four typical joint
   system models separately comprising orthogonal, staggered, diagonal and
   randomly oriented joints and conduct the virtual hydraulic fracturing
   simulations via DEM. This defines the influence of structure on
   breakdown pressure and fracture propagation and allows the analysis of
   the main factors that influence behavior and resulting SRV. Results for
   the four forms of jointed rock mass show that: (1) the aggregate/mean
   extension direction of the fractures is always along the direction of
   the maximum principal stress but significant deviations may result from
   the pre-existing fractures; (2) there are negative correlations between

Title = {{Uncovering the deformation mechanisms of origami metamaterials by
   introducing generic degree-four vertices}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{94}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{OCT 24}},
Abstract = {{Origami-based design holds promise for developing new mechanical
   metamaterials whose overall kinematic and mechanical properties can be
   programmed using purely geometric criteria. In this article, we
   demonstrate that the deformation of a generic degree-four vertex (
   4-vertex) origami cell is a combination of contracting, shearing,
   bending, and facet-binding. The last three deformation mechanisms are
   missing in the current rigid-origami metamaterial investigations, which
   focus mainly on conventional Miura-ori patterns. We show that these
   mechanisms provide the 4-vertex origami sheets and blocks with new
   deformation patterns as well as extraordinary kinematical and mechanical
   properties, including self-locking, tridirectional negative Poisson's
   ratios, flipping of stiffness profiles, and emerging shearing stiffness.
   This study reveals that the 4-vertex cells offer a better platform and
   greater design space for developing origami-based mechanical
   metamaterials than the conventional Miura-ori cell.}},

Title = {{Chronic musculoskeletal pain and occupational aspects among Brazilian
   teachers}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND ERGONOMICS}},
Abstract = {{Objectives. This study aimed to determine the association between
   working conditions and chronic musculoskeletal pain (CMP) in regions of
   the body in teachers. Methods. A cross-sectional study was performed
   with 958 teachers from Brazil. Outcomes were chronic pain in the upper
   limbs, lower back and lower limbs. Independent variables were
   characteristics and perceptions about the work. Poisson regression
   models were adjusted by socio-demographic, lifestyle and co-morbidity
   variables. Results. After adjustments, strong associations were observed
   between a negative perception regarding writing on the board and pain in
   the upper limbs (prevalence ratio {[}PR] = 4.65; 95\% confidence
   interval {[}CI] {[}2.02, 10.70]) and lower back pain (PR = 2.10; 95\% CI
   {[}1.06, 4.15]) and between a negative perception of standing duration
   and pain in the lower limbs (PR = 3.98; 95\% CI {[}1.54, 10.26]).
   Additionally, the number of workplaces, number of students and
   conditions for carrying teaching material were associated with pain in
   the upper limbs. Time in the profession and a negative perception of
   work-life balance were associated with pain in the lower limbs.
   Conclusions. Different work conditions were associated with CMP in
   different body regions. Policies to improve teachers' working
   conditions, such as providing furniture that meets teachers' ergonomic
   needs, are needed to reduce CMP.}},

Title = {{The mechanistic analysis of founder virus data in challenge models}},
Journal = {{STATISTICS IN MEDICINE}},
Abstract = {{Repeated low-dose challenge studies provide valuable information when
   evaluating candidate vaccines since they resemble the typical exposure
   of natural transmission and inform on the number of exposures prior to
   infection. Traditionally, the number of challenges to infection has been
   used as the outcome. This work uses the number of infecting viruses, or
   founder viruses at the time of infection, to more efficiently
   characterize a vaccine's mechanism of action. The vaccine mechanisms of
   action we consider are a Null mechanism (the vaccine offers no
   protection), a Leaky mechanism in which the number of founder viruses is
   reduced by some factor in vaccinated subjects, the All-or-None mechanism
   in which the vaccine randomly provides either complete protection or no
   protection in vaccinated subjects, and a Combination mechanism with both
   Leaky and All-or-None components. We consider two discrete marked
   survival models where the number of founder viruses follows a Poisson
   distribution with either a fixed mean parameter (Poisson model), or a
   random mean parameter that follows a Gamma distribution (negative
   binomial model). We estimate the models using maximum likelihood and
   derive likelihood ratio testing procedures that are accurate for small
   samples with boundary parameters. We illustrate the performance of these
   methodologies with a data example of simian immunodeficiency virus on
   nonhuman primates and a simulation study.}},

Abstract = {{Polarisation orientation effects in piezo-active composites based on
   relaxor-ferroelectric single crystals of
   (1-x)Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O-3-xPbTiO(3) open up new possibilities to vary the

   present paper the hydrostatic performance of 2-2 parallel-connected
   single crystal / auxetic polymer composites is studied for x = 0.28 -
   0.33 and two poling directions of the single-crystal component, {[}001]

   The effect of the orientation of the main crystallographic axes in the
   single-crystal component on the hydrostatic piezoelectric coefficients
   d{*}(h), e(h){*} and squared figure of merit d{*}(h)g(h){*} is analysed
   for three rotation modes in single crystals and at various anisotropy of
   their piezoelectric and elastic properties. The role of the auxetic
   polymer component is emphasised in the context of the large hydrostatic
   parameters and anisotropy of squared figures of merit d{*}(3j)g(3j){*}
   (j = 1, 2 and 3). The largest maximum values of d{*}(h) and e{*}(h)

Title = {{Identifying the determinants and associated factors of mortality under
   age five in Ethiopia}},
Journal = {{BMC PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 28}},
Abstract = {{BackgroundMortality rate under the age of five is the proportion of
   deaths of children below the age of 5 years out of 1000 live births. It
   is related with the living standard of a population, and it is taken as
   one of the health and socioeconomic status deterioration index.
   Mortality rate under the age of five also indicates a poor quality life
   standards of a population. It is very significantly high in Sub-Saharan
   African countries. Ethiopia is one of these Sub-Saharan African
   countries where mortality rate under the age five is high. This research
   work aims to identify the determinants and associated factors of
   under-five mortality in Ethiopia.MethodsThe data for this paper were
   gathered from the EDHS 2016, collected by CSA. In this study, count
   family models such as Poisson, negative binomial, zero-inflated Poisson
   and zero-inflated negative binomial regression were applied for
   analyzing the data. Each of these count models were compared with
   different statistical tests like log-likelihood ratio test, Akaike
   information criteria, mean absolute difference, Vuong test and observed
   versus predicted probability plot.ResultsThe study revealed that as
   mothers' age at first birth increased by one unit, the average number of
   under-five mortality rate decreased by 2.69\%. In the same way the
   number of under-five mortality of Afar, Benishangul Gumuz and Dire Dawa
   were 1.3446, 1.6429 and 1.3320 times more likely to Tigray respectively.
   The risk of under-five mortality for primary and secondary education
   level of the mother was 28.31 and 40.96\% less likely than to mothers
   who have no education respectively.ConclusionFrom the result we found
   that, there were overabundance zeros and broad heterogeneity in the
   non-zero outcomes. Zero-inflated negative binomial regression model was
   found to best fit the data, and from the regression model, age of
   mothers at first birth, mother's education level, place of residence and
   region were statistically significant factors of under-five mortality
   per mother.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon materials with full sp(2)-hybridized bonding, e.g.
   zero-dimensional (0D) fullerenes, 1D carbon nanotubes, and 2D graphene,

   experimental exploration of other types of novel sp(2) carbon
   allotropes, especially with 3D architectures, is always a compelling
   scientific theme. Here we proposed a class of low-energy 3D sp(2)
   carbons with exceptional properties, not only possessing excellent
   mechanical properties such as high 3D strength, rubber-like
   ultra-stretchability, and negative Poisson's ratio, but also including
   the electronic properties of graphite-like metallicity and graphene-like
   Dirac cone, which are the desirable properties across a broad range of
   potential applications. Furthermore, a design route was suggested to
   access these 3D sp(2) carbons by the polymerization of
   edge-functionalized graphene nanoribbon arrays.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Although acquired immune deficiency syndrome-associated
   morbidity has diminished due to excellent viral control, multimorbidity
   may be increasing among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected
   persons compared with the general population.
   Methods. We assessed the prevalence of comorbidities and multimorbidity
   in participants of the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS) compared with the
   population-based CoLaus study and the primary care-based FIRE (Family
   Medicine ICPC-Research using Electronic Medical Records) records. The
   incidence of the respective endpoints were assessed among SHCS and
   CoLaus participants. Poisson regression models were adjusted for age,
   sex, body mass index, and smoking.
   Results. Overall, 74 291 participants contributed data to prevalence
   analyses (3230 HIV-infected; 71 061 controls). In CoLaus, FIRE, and
   SHCS, multimorbidity was present among 26\%, 13\%, and 27\% of
   participants. Compared with nonsmoking individuals from CoLaus, the
   incidence of cardiovascular disease was elevated among smoking
   individuals but independent of HIV status (HIV-negative smoking:
   incidence rate ratio {[}IRR] = 1.7, 95\% confidence interval {[}CI] =
   1.2-2.5; HIV-positive smoking: IRR = 1.7, 95\% CI = 1.1-2.6;
   HIV-positive nonsmoking: IRR = 0.79, 95\% CI = 0.44-1.4). Compared with
   nonsmoking HIV-negative persons, multivariable Poisson regression
   identified associations of HIV infection with hypertension (nonsmoking:
   IRR = 1.9, 95\% CI = 1.5-2.4; smoking: IRR = 2.0, 95\% CI = 1.6-2.4),
   kidney (nonsmoking: IRR = 2.7, 95\% CI = 1.9-3.8; smoking: IRR = 2.6,
   95\% CI = 1.9-3.6), and liver disease (nonsmoking: IRR = 1.8, 95\% CI =
   1.4-2.4; smoking: IRR = 1.7, 95\% CI = 1.4-2.2). No evidence was found
   for an association of HIV-infection or smoking with diabetes mellitus.
   Conclusions. Multimorbidity is more prevalent and incident in
   HIV-positive compared with HIV-negative individuals. Smoking, but not
   HIV status, has a strong impact on cardiovascular risk and
   multimorbidity.}},

Abstract = {{Polymer-based sandwich composites have found increasing applications in
   the marine industry, where they are at an ever-increasing risk of
   encountering high-intensity underwater (UNDEX) or in air (AIREX)
   explosive loading. This review presents the current state of the art in
   achieving adequate blast mitigation, employing polymeric composites. An
   attempt has been made to highlight the differences in loading mechanisms
   between AIREX and UNDEX and segregate the mechanisms through which
   polymers can mitigate these two loading modes. This understanding
   facilitates the development of a tailored design approach to blast
   mitigation. Furthermore, recent blast mitigation research related to
   composite sandwich architecture is discussed in detail, focusing on
   various components' effect on mitigation performance. Finally,
   additively manufactured applications, auxetics, and other foam
   metamaterial constructions are also presented in relation to the
   mitigation effort. The recent interest in such materials for use as the
   core in polymeric sandwich construction against blast loading is covered
   cohesively with the rest of the discussion.}},

Journal = {{GUT}},

Volume = {{60}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Objective Enteric pathogens have been implicated in the aetiology of
   inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but increased rates of stool testing
   of patients with unclear gastrointestinal symptoms might cause detection
   bias. Hence, the objective of this study was to analyse incidence rates
   of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis among patients with
   Salmonella- or Campylobacter-positive and negative stool tests and to
   study the incidence of positive and negative stool tests among patients
   already diagnosed with IBD.
   Methods The Danish population was followed for 94.3 million person-years
   during 1992-2008 using national registers to identify persons with
   positive and negative stool tests and patients with IBD. Using Poisson
   regression, incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for IBD after positive or
   negative stool tests and, conversely, IRRs for positive and negative
   stool tests following IBD, were calculated.
   Results IRRs for IBD were significantly high in the first year after
   Salmonella- or Campylobacter-positive stool tests (IRRs 5.4-9.8), and
   they remained moderately increased 1-10 years later (IRRs 1.6-2.2), and
   less so > 10 years later (IRRs 0.8-1.8). However, IRRs for IBD < 1 year
   after a negative stool test were several-fold higher (IRRs 53.2-57.5),
   and a decreasing incidence pattern over time was parallel to that
   following positive test results. Among patients with IBD, IRRs for
   subsequent positive and-most notably-negative stool test results were
   also significantly high.
   Conclusion Similarities in temporal risk patterns for IBD following
   positive or negative stool tests indicate that the increased occurrence
   of Salmonella- or Campylobacter-positive results around the time of
   first IBD hospitalisation results from detection bias.}},

Abstract = {{In the design of sandwich panels with cellular cores for energy
   absorption, the geometrical effect of the cellular core design has not
   been investigated in details previously. In this work three cellular
   core designs, including re-entrant auxetic, octet-truss, and BCC
   lattice, were experimentally investigated for their performance under
   low-energy impact as sandwich structures. Samples with different
   cellular core designs were fabricated by laser sintering additive
   manufacturing process using Nylon 12 as material, and evaluated by drop
   weight testing under multiple strikes and at two levels of elevated
   temperatures (93 degrees C and 121 degrees C). It was found that beside
   relative densities, the geometrical design of the cellular cores could
   also significantly influence the impact energy absorption performance of
   the sandwich structures. It was also found that the impact energy
   absorption of the cellular structures investigated in this study does
   not have a significant correlation with either the quasi-static
   mechanical properties or the temperature. In addition, the auxetic
   cellular structure exhibits optimal overall energy absorption
   performance compared to both the octet-truss and the BCC lattice. (C)

Abstract = {{Diabetic foot is a common complication of diabetes with a significant
   symptom of excessive plantar pressure. Studies have shown that reducing
   plantar pressure can effectively lower the incidence of diabetic foot.
   In this work, a new design method is proposed to reduce plantar pressure
   by dividing the orthotic insole into two areas. Support area is under
   the midfoot and shares a part of plantar pressure compared to flat
   structure. Soft area helps in decreasing the plantar pressure of the
   forefoot region and rearfoot region by low young's modulus structure.
   Honeycomb structure and auxetic structure are applied in the novel
   porous insole. The orthotic insoles were manufactured by
   fused-deposition modeling. Finite element analyses show that the auxetic
   structure of soft area enhances larger deformation than ordinary flat
   structure by 18\% under pressure. Results show that the support area
   reduces the pressure of the forefoot region and rearfoot region by 30\%
   during upright position. The scene of wearing orthotic insoles with
   pressure sensors is explored. Consequently, the novel porous insoles can
   be used to bring better plantar pressure reduction for the treatment of
   diabetic foot.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives To estimate exposures to asbestos fibres of specific sizes
   among asbestos textile manufacturing workers exposed to chrysotile using
   data from transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and to evaluate the
   extent to which the risk of lung cancer varies with fibre length and
   diameter.
   Methods 3803 workers employed for at least 1 day between 1 January 1950
   and 31 December 1973 in any of three plants in North Carolina, USA that
   produced asbestos textile products and followed for vital status through
   31 December 2003 were included. Historical exposures to asbestos fibres
   were estimated from work histories and 3578 industrial hygiene
   measurements taken in 1935-1986. Exposure-response relationships for
   lung cancer were examined within the cohort using Poisson regression.
   Results Indicators of fibre length and diameter obtained by TEM were
   positively and significantly associated with increasing risk of lung
   cancer. Exposures to longer and thinner fibres tended to be most
   strongly associated with lung cancer, and models for these fibres fit
   the data best. Simultaneously modelling indicators of cumulative mean
   fibre length and diameter yielded a positive coefficient for fibre
   length and a negative coefficient for fibre diameter.
   Conclusions The results support the hypothesis that the risk of lung
   cancer among workers exposed to chrysotile asbestos increases with
   exposure to longer fibres. More research is needed to improve the
   characterisation of exposures by fibre size and number and to analyse
   the associated risks in a variety of industries and populations.}},

   for the cases where the material of which they are constructed is either
   orthotropic or of various Poisson's ratios. Large deflections and

   Timoshenko beam theory thereby allowing non-zero shear strains to

   Mn3GaN is ductile material with a metallic bond. The thermodynamic

Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{86}},
Number = {{11, SI}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Two-dimensional hexachiral lattices belong to the family of
   honeycomb-like mechanical metamaterials such as triangular, hexagonal,
   and kagome lattices. The common feature of this family of beam-based
   metamaterials is their six-fold rotational symmetry which guarantees
   their (transversely-) isotropic elastic response. In the case of
   hexachiral lattices, a single geometric parameter may be introduced to
   control the degree of chirality such that the elastic Poisson's ratio
   can be adjusted between 0.33 and -0.8. Detailed finite element
   simulations are performed to establish the structure-property
   relationships for hexachiral lattices for relative densities ranging
   from 1\% to 45\%. It is shown that both the Young's and shear moduli are
   always lower for hexachiral structures than for optimal lattices
   (triangular and kagome). This result is in line with the general
   understanding that stretching-dominated architectures outperform
   bending-dominated architectures. The same conclusions may be drawn from
   the comparison of the tensile yield strength. However, hexachiral
   structures provide a lower degree of plastic anisotropy than
   stretching-dominated lattices. Furthermore, special hexachiral
   configurations have been identified that exhibit a slightly higher shear
   yield strength than triangular and kagome lattices, thereby presenting
   an example of bending-dominated architectures outperforming
   stretching-dominated architectures of equal mass. Tensile specimens have
   been additively manufactured from a tough PLA polymer and tested to
   partially validate the simulation results.}},

Abstract = {{Plane-wave theory for fluid-embedded isotropic plates is often used in
   ultrasonic guided-wave applications, and to estimate wall thickness,
   corrosion, or sound velocities in plates and pipes. In such structures,
   measured ultrasonic transmission through the solid material is affected
   by acoustic beam diffraction effects, and the results may deviate from
   plane-wave descriptions, which are insufficient to describe the complex
   effects that occur. When exciting a fluid-embedded steel plate with a
   pulsed ultrasonic beam at normal incidence, resonance frequency
   downshift, axial sound pressure level increase, and beam narrowing have
   been observed, for measured resonance peaks in the frequency regions of
   certain leaky Lamb mode branches of the plate. In the ranges of other
   leaky Lamb mode branches, the observed effects are different.
   Measurements, finite element, and angular spectrum modeling are used to
   indicate a close connection between these beam diffraction phenomena and
   the backward wave characteristics of certain leaky Lamb mode pairs, in
   the frequency and Poisson's ratio regions around coincidence of two Lamb
   mode cutoff frequencies of similar symmetry. In particular, such
   observations made for the steel plate's fundamental
   thickness-extensional (TE) mode appear to be caused by acoustic beam
   excitation of the backward wave regions of the S--2(vl) and S-2(vl)
   leaky Lamb modes.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, the Timoshenko beam, and generalizations thereof, have been
   considered as models for the vibration of single and multiple walled
   carbon nanotubes. Further, it has been shown that, in some instances,
   carbon nanotubes and nanotube sheets possess the common property that
   their Poisson's ratio is negative. In these cases, the degenerate case
   of the Timoshenko beam problem, where E = k'G, becomes physically
   realizable. The asymptotic derivation of the vibration spectrum in this
   case is qualitatively different from that for the nondegenerate case. We
   performed such a derivation, and we compared the asymptotic results with
   numerical results. Further, we performed parameter studies based on the
   exact frequency equation for the undamped case for values of E/k'G on
   intervals including E/k'G = 1. The results show very interesting and
   complex behavior throughout a fairly large interval about E/k'G = 1.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate prediction of gas planar distribution is crucial to selection
   and development of new CBM exploration areas. Based on seismic
   attributes, well logging and testing data we found that seismic
   absorption attenuation, after eliminating the effects of burial depth,
   shows an evident correlation with CBM gas content; (positive) structure
   curvature has a negative correlation with gas content; and density has a
   negative correlation with gas content. It is feasible to use the
   hydrocarbon index (P{*}G) and pseudo-Poisson ratio attributes for
   detection of gas enrichment zones. Based on seismic multiple-attribute
   analyses, a multiple linear regression equation was established between
   the seismic attributes and gas content at the drilling wells.
   Application of this equation to the seismic attributes at locations
   other than the drilling wells yielded a quantitative prediction of
   planar gas distribution. Prediction calculations were performed for two
   different models, one using pre-stack inversion and the other one
   disregarding pre-stack inversion. A comparison of the results indicates
   that both models predicted a similar trend for gas content distribution,
   except that the model using pre-stack inversion yielded a prediction
   result with considerably higher precision than the other model.}},

   heterostructure. The stacking configurations induced electronic
   structures, and the mechanical flexibility of h-BP/BlueP heterostructure
   was studied systematically. Their negative formation energy and binding
   energy as well as excellent lattice match guarantee structural
   stability. The calculated band structure shows that largest band gap is
   AB stacking pattern with a direct band gap of 1.07 eV. Additionally, the
   AB pattern is the most stable one. The biggest band gap can be observed
   (such as delta = 3\%). Compared with stretch, the energy gap is more
   sensitive under compression. The ultimate strains of h-BP/BlueP
   heterostructure are 14\% in the AB pattern. Furthermore, the different
   strains of h-BP/BlueP heterostructure have been studied; we found that

Title = {{A New Type of Hierarchical Honeycomb in-Plane Impact Study}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Honeycomb materials have low density, high specific strength and
   stiffness, impact resistance, and good sound insulation effect, and
   therefore are widely used in aerospace, automobile, and ship field
   applications. In this paper, we study the in-plane impact response of a
   second-order hierarchical honeycomb (SHH) material. Its main structure
   is a hexagonal honeycomb, and the substructure is composed of an
   augmented double arrow honeycomb (ADAH) negative Poisson's ratio unit.
   Through a finite element simulation, the failure stress of an
   hierarchical honeycomb in two directions of quasi-static crushing and
   dynamic crushing was analyzed; the failure stress of the hierarchical
   honeycomb under different densities, different speeds, and different
   substructures was discussed; and the theoretical failure stress was
   verified. The numerical analysis results show that a second-order
   hierarchical honeycomb (SHH) has better collapse stress than a
   first-order regular hexagonal honeycomb (FHH) and an augmented double
   arrow honeycomb (ADAH).}},

Abstract = {{The over all regression function in a semi-parametric model involves a
   partly specified regression function in some primary covariates and a
   non-parametric function in some other secondary covariates. This type of
   semi-parametric models in a longitudinal setup has recently been
   discussed extensively both for repeated Poisson and negative binomial
   count data. However, when it is appropriate to interpret the
   longitudinal binary responses through a binary dynamic logits model, the
   inferences for semi-parametric Poisson and negative binomial models
   cannot be applied to such binary models as these models unlike the count
   data models produce recursive means and variances containing the dynamic
   dependence or correlation parameters. In this paper, we consider a
   general multinomial dynamic logits model in a semi-parametric setup
   first to analyze nominal categorical data in a semi-parametric
   longitudinal setup, and then modify this model to analyze ordinal
   categorical data. The ordinal responses are fitted by using a cumulative
   semi-parametric multinomial dynamic logits model. For the benefits of
   practitioners, a step by step estimation approach is developed for the
   non-parametric function, and for both regression and dynamic dependence
   parameters. In summary, a kernel-based semi-parametric weighted
   likelihood approach is used for the estimation of the non-parametric
   function. This weighted likelihood estimate for the non-parametric
   function is shown to be consistent. The regression and dynamic
   dependence parameters of the model are estimated by maximizing an
   approximate semi-parametric likelihood function for the parameters,
   which is constructed by replacing the non-parametric function with its
   consistent estimate. Asymptotic properties including the proofs for the
   consistency of the likelihood estimators of the regression and dynamic
   dependence parameters are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The dynamic behavior of two-dimensional nanostructures is important to
   the future application of nano devices. The vibrational behaviors of
   single-layered hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) are studied by molecular
   dynamics simulation and continuum plate model. The bending stiffness and
   Poisson's ratios of h-BN along zigzag direction and armchair direction
   are calculated. H-BN is softer compared with graphene. The continuum
   plate model can predict the vibration of h-BN with four edge-clamped
   boundary conditions well. The electric fields in different directions
   have obvious influence on the vibration of h-BN. The natural frequency
   of h-BN changes linearly with the electric field intensity along the
   polarization direction. The natural frequency of h-BN decreases with the
   increase of electric field intensity along both positive and negative
   non-polarization direction. While the natural frequency of h-BN
   increases with the increase of electric field intensity along both
   positive and negative transverse electric field. (c) 2018 The Authors.

Abstract = {{On 2016 February 6 the South Taiwan earthquake (M-w 6.4) occurred in the
   Meinong District of Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan, at a depth of 17 km. It
   caused 117 fatalities and widespread damage to infrastructures,
   especially in the Tainan city. To clarify the generating mechanism of
   this damaging earthquake, we determined high-resolution 3-D images of P-
   and S-wave velocity (V-P, V-S) and Poisson's ratio (sigma) in the
   epicentral area. We used 105 712 P-and 61 250 S-wave arrival times of
   8279 local earthquakes (1.5 <= M <= 6.4) recorded at 41 seismic stations
   in South Taiwan during 2000-2011. In the upper crust (depth <= 10 km),
   the most remarkable feature is low-VP, low-VS and high-s anomalies in
   areas with known active faults in the southwestern and easternmost parts
   of Taiwan. In contrast, high-VP, high-VS and low-s anomalies become
   dominant in the lower crust. The hypocentre of the 2016 South Taiwan
   earthquake is located in a boundary zone where seismic velocity and
   Poisson's ratio change drastically in both the horizontal and vertical
   directions. Furthermore, the hypocentre is underlain by a vertically
   elongated high-s anomaly at depths of 23-40 km, which may reflect
   ascending fluids from the upper (or uppermost) mantle. The low-V and
   high-sigma anomalies in the upper crust coincide with areas of low heat
   flow, negative Bouguer gravity anomaly, and low magnetotelluric
   resistivity, which may reflect crustal fluids contained in the young
   fold-and-thrust belt. These results suggest that the 2016 South Taiwan
   earthquake was triggered by ascending fluids from dehydration of the
   subducting Eurasian slab, invading into active faults with a high
   loading rate.}},

Abstract = {{The Hyuganada region, a forearc region of Southwest Japan, is
   characterized by several interesting geological and geophysical
   features, i.e., significant aseismic crustal uplift of similar to 120m
   during the past similar to 120 thousand years at the Miyazaki Plain,
   negative free-air gravity anomalies with the maximum magnitude of - 130
   mgal, and relatively less cohesive interplate coupling compared with
   that for off the Shikoku and Kii Peninsula. In order to examine the
   causes of these observations, we determined a detailed three-dimensional
   seismic velocity structure based on the seismic data observed by ocean
   bottom seismometers (OBS) and land stations. P- and S-wave tomographic
   velocity structures clearly indicate the subducting slab and also the
   zones of high Poisson's ratio at 25-35 km depth along the coastline of
   the northeastern part of the Hyuganada. The region with high Poisson's
   ratio may correspond to the serpentinized mantle wedge as suggested for
   other mantle wedges, and appears to be coincident with the zone for
   observed aseismic slips such as the slow-slip and after-slip events.
   Also, the detection may be related to a relatively weak interplate
   coupling in the Hyuganada region. The tomographic structures also
   indicate low velocity zones with a horizontal scale comparable to the
   Kyushu-Palau Ridge in and around the subducting slab. If we assume that
   the low velocity zones correspond to the subducted Kyushu-Palau Ridge,
   then the predicted gravity anomaly due to the density contrast between
   the low velocity zones and the surrounding region can explain about 60\%
   of the gravity anomaly in the Hyuganada region. The buoyancy is probably
   an important factor for the crustal uplift observed in the Miyazaki
   Plain, the steep bending of the subducting slab and the normal
   fault-type earthquakes around the Hyuganada region. (C) 2008 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The measurements of particle multiplicity distributions have generated
   considerable interest in understanding the fluctuations of conserved
   quantum numbers in the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) hadronization
   regime, in particular near a possible critical point and near the
   chemical freeze-out. Net-protons and net-kaons have been used as proxies
   for the net-baryon number and net-strangeness, respectively. We report
   the measurement of efficiency- and centrality-bin width-corrected
   cumulant ratios (C-2/C-1,C-3/C-3) of net-A distributions, in the context
   of both strangeness and baryon number conservation, as a function of
   collision energy, centrality, and rapidity. The results are for Au + Au
   collisions at five beam energies (root s(NN) = 19.6, 27, 39, 62.4, and
   200 GeV) recorded with the Solenoidal Tracker at RHIC (STAR). We compare
   our results to the Poisson and negative binomial (NBD) expectations, as
   well as to ultrarelativistic quantum molecular dynamics (UrQMD) and
   hadron resonance gas (HRG) model predictions. Both NBD and Poisson
   baselines agree with data within the statistical and systematic
   uncertainties. UrQMD describes the measured net-A C-1 and C-3 at 200 GeV
   reasonably well but deviates from C-2, and the deviation increases as a
   function of collision energy. The ratios of the measured cumulants show
   no features of critical fluctuations. The chemical freeze-out
   temperatures extracted from a recent HRG calculation, which was
   successfully used to describe the net-proton, net-kaon, and net-charge
   data, indicate A freeze-out conditions similar to those of kaons.
   However, large deviations are found when comparing with temperatures
   obtained from net-proton fluctuations. The net-A cumulants show a weak
   but finite dependence on the rapidity coverage in the acceptance of the
   detector, which can be attributed to quantum number conservation.}},

Abstract = {{Searching and designing two-dimensional (2D) materials with unique
   topological structures and physical and chemical properties is extremely
   significant in the field of materials science. Here we report the design
   of 2D MnBx (x = 1, 2, 3, 6) monolayers containing quasi-planar
   hypercoordinate motifs by means of density functional theory (DFT)
   computations and particle swarm optimization technique. These systems
   exhibit high cohesive energy as well as good kinetic and thermal
   stability, indicating that the MnBx monolayers can be prepared in
   experiments. Bond order analyses suggest that the abundance of
   multi-center bonds contributes to the stability of MnBx monolayers.
   Among them, MnB3 monolayer has nonmagnetic ground state while others
   exhibit ferromagnetic metallic properties. Moreover, MnB6 monolayer
   exhibits high spin polarization and negative Poisson's ratio, which
   endows MnB6 with many special applications to cushioning and
   nanoelectronics. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A series of new phosphorene allotropes, alpha beta-P, beta gamma-P,
   gamma delta-P, alpha gamma-P, alpha delta-P, and beta delta-P, produced
   via phase combination of four basic phosphorenes alpha-P, beta-P,
   gamma-P, and delta-P, are predicted using first-principles calculations.
   Their thermodynamic stabilities are confirmed by cohesive energy
   calculations. Their band alignments compared with the O-2/O-2(-) redox
   potential suggest an improved chemical stability toward oxidative
   degradation in ambient conditions. These new mixed-phase phosphorene
   allotropes show attractive anisotropric electronic and mechanical
   properties. In particular, gamma delta-P shows the narrowest band gap
   (0.80 eV based on HSE06 calculations) and the highest negative Poisson
   ratio among all mixed and basic phosphorenes reported to date. The gamma
   delta-P allotrope additionally exhibits tunable electronic properties
   and a semiconductor-to-metal transition that can be induced via uniaxial
   strain.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: We evaluated work-related injuries involving a hand or
   fingers and associated costs among a cohort of 24,830 carpenters between
   1989 and 2008. Methods: Injury rates and rate ratios were calculated by
   using Poisson regression to explore higher risk on the basis of age,
   sex, time in the union, predominant work, and calendar time. Negative
   binomial regression was used to model dollars paid per claim after
   adjustment for inflation and discounting. Results: Hand injuries
   accounted for 21.1\% of reported injuries and 9.5\% of paid lost time
   injuries. Older carpenters had proportionately more amputations,
   fractures, and multiple injuries, but their rates of these more severe
   injuries were not higher. Costs exceeded \$21 million, a cost burden of
   \$0.11 per hour worked. Conclusions: Older carpenters' higher proportion
   of serious injuries in the absence of higher rates likely reflects
   age-related reporting differences.}},

   programmability in mechanical metamaterials}},
Journal = {{NATURE PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{14}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The architecture of mechanical metamaterials is designed to harness
   geometry(1-6), nonlinearity(7-11) and topology(11-15) to obtain advanced
   functionalities such as shape morphing(7,9,16-21),
   programmability(18,22,23) and one-way propagation(11,13,14). Although a
   purely geometric framework successfully captures the physics of small
   systems under idealized conditions, large systems or heterogeneous
   driving conditions remain essentially unexplored. Here we uncover strong
   anomalies in the mechanics of a broad class of metamaterials, such as
   auxetics(2,5,24), shape changers(16-21) or topological
   insulators(11-13,15); a non-monotonic variation of their stiffness with
   system size, and the ability of textured boundaries to completely alter
   their properties. These striking features stem from the competition
   between rotation-based deformations-relevant for small systems-and
   ordinary elasticity, and are controlled by a characteristic length scale
   which is entirely tunable by the architectural details. Our study
   provides new vistas for designing, controlling and programming the
   mechanics of metamaterials.}},

   image}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{64}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{PET images often suffer poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Our objective
   is to improve the SNR of PET images using a deep neural network (DNN)
   model and MRI images without requiring any higher SNR PET images in
   training. Our proposed DNN model consists of three modified U-Nets
   (3U-net). The PET training input data and targets were reconstructed
   using filtered-backprojection (FBP) and maximum likelihood expectation
   maximization (MLEM), respectively. FBP reconstruction was used because
   of its computational efficiency so that the trained network not only
   removes noise, but also accelerates image reconstruction. Digital brain
   phantoms downloaded from BrainWeb were used to evaluate the proposed
   method. Poisson noise was added into sinogram data to simulate a 6 min
   brain PET scan. Attenuation effect was included and corrected before the
   image reconstruction. Extra Poisson noise was introduced to the training
   inputs to improve the network denoising capability. Three independent
   experiments were conducted to examine the reproducibility. A lesion was
   inserted into testing data to evaluate the impact of mismatched MRI
   information using the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR). The negative impact
   on noise reduction was also studied when miscoregistration between PET
   and MRI images occurs. Compared with 1U-net trained with only PET
   images, training with PET/MRI decreased the mean squared error (MSE) by
   31.3\% and 34.0\% for 1U-net and 3U-net, respectively. The MSE reduction
   is equivalent to an increase in the count level by 2.5 folds and 2.9
   folds for 1U-net and 3U-net, respectively. Compared with the MLEM
   images, the lesion CNR was improved 2.7 folds and 1.4 folds for 1U-net
   and 3U-net, respectively. The results show that the proposed method
   could improve the PET SNR without having higher SNR PET images.}},

Journal = {{ANNALI DI MATEMATICA PURA ED APPLICATA}},
Year = {{1996}},
Volume = {{171}},
Pages = {{313-377}},
Abstract = {{In this paper we find an expression for Green's function for the
   operator Delta(2) in a planar circular annulus with Dirichlet boundary
   conditions (clamped elastic plate). We likewise determine the
   corresponding Poisson type kernels and the harmonic Bergman kernel.
   These results come in terms of certain new transcendental functions
   which in a natural way generalize the Weierstrass zeta function. They
   are analogous to the result of R. COURANT - D. HILBERT (Methoden der
   Mathematischen Physik I (3. Aufl.), Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Heidelberg,
   New York (1968), pp. 335-337) and H. VILLAT (Rend. Circ. Mat. Palermo,
   33 (1912), pp. 134-175) respectively. As an application we show that,
   regardless of the sire of the ratio of the radii of the bounding
   circles, the Green's function always assumes negative values, which
   constitutes another rather striking counter-example to the well-known
   Boggio-Hadamard conjecture.}},

Abstract = {{Mechanical cleavage, chemical intercalation and chemical vapor
   deposition are the main methods that are currently used to synthesize
   nanosheets or monolayers. Here, we propose a new strategy, thermal
   exfoliation for the fabrication of silica monolayers. Using a variety of
   state-of-the-art theoretical calculations we show that a stoichiometric
   single-layer silica with a tetragonal lattice, T-silica, can be
   thermally exfoliated from the stishovite phase in a clean environment at
   room temperature. The resulting single-layer silica is dynamically,
   thermally, and mechanically stable with exceptional properties,
   including a large band gap of 7.2 eV, an unusual negative Poisson's
   ratio, a giant Stark effect, and a high breakdown voltage. Moreover,
   other analogous structures like single-layer GeO2 can also be obtained
   by thermal exfoliation of its bulk phase. Our findings are expected to
   motivate experimental efforts on developing new techniques for the
   synthesis of monolayer materials.}},

   for dynamic loading of the specimens. Experiments were observed using a
   pair of high-speed cameras for imaging of loading process in sufficient
   quality. Custom developed evaluation DIC tool implemented in Matlab,
   open-source Matlab tool (NCorr) and commercial DIC software (ISTRA 4D)
   were all used for evaluation of image sequences recorded by high-speed

Abstract = {{Actinic keratoses (AKs) are highly dynamic lesions and AK activity has
   been shown to be associated with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). We
   sought to explore risk factors which may affect the 12-month turnover of
   AKs in organ transplant recipients (OTRs). The number of incident AKs,
   regressed AKs and net change in AK counts were calculated. Negative
   binomial regression and Poisson regression models were used to estimate
   rate ratios (RR) for these 3 outcomes. Among 150 renal and 89 liver
   OTRs, those who spent > 50\% of a typical weekday in the sun had a lower
   rate of AK regression than those who spent minimal time in the sun
   during a typical weekday. Age, parents' country of origin, hair colour,
   skin cancer history and recent AK treatment were all significantly
   associated with AK turnover. Clinically, these risk factors may be used
   to monitor OTRs at increased risk of SCC.}},

Title = {{Dynamic steady-state crack propagation in a transversely isotropic

Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{131}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{107-129}},

Abstract = {{The problem considered herein is the dynamic, subsonic, steady-state
   propagation of a semi-infinite, generalized plane strain crack in an
   infinite, transversely isotropic, linear viscoelastic body. The
   corresponding boundary value problem is considered initially for a
   general anisotropic, linear viscoelastic body and reduced via transform
   methods to a matrix Riemann-Hilbert problem. The general problem does
   not readily yield explicit closed form solutions, so attention is
   addressed to the special case of a transversely isotropic viscoelastic
   body whose principal axis of material symmetry is parallel to the crack
   edge. For this special case, the out-of-plane shear (Mode III), in-plane
   shear (Mode II) and in-plane opening (Mode I) modes uncouple. Explicit
   expressions are then constructed for all three Stress Intensity Factors
   (SIF). The analysis is valid for quite general forms for the relevant
   viscoelastic relaxation functions subject only to the thermodynamic
   restriction that work done in closed cycles be non-negative. As a
   special case, an analytical solution of the Mode I problem for a general
   isotropic linear viscoelastic material is obtained without the usual
   assumption of a constant Poisson's ratio or exponential decay of the
   bulk and shear relaxation functions. The Mode I SIF is then calculated
   for a generalized standard linear solid with unequal mean relaxation
   times in bulk and shear leading to a non-constant Poisson's ratio.
   Numerical simulations are performed for both point loading on the crack
   faces and for a uniform traction applied to a compact portion of the
   crack faces. In both cases, it is observed that the SIF can vanish for
   crack speeds well below the glassy Rayleigh wave speed. This phenomenon
   is not seen for Mode I cracks in elastic material or for Mode III cracks
   in viscoelastic material.}},

   chalcogenides MX2 and M2X3 where M = Ni or Pd and X = S, Se or Te. For

   giant negative Poisson's ratios. For M2X3, on the other hand, it
   presents no hexagonal but another orthorhombic structure with highly
   anisotropic mechanical and electronic features. These orthorhombic MX2
   and M2X3 are semiconducting with band gaps ranging from 1.05 to 2.40 eV,
   and they are hyperbolic materials operating in a broad range of the
   electromagnetic spectrum from infrared to ultraviolet. Moreover, by
   joint analysis of band gaps, band edges and optical absorption, Ni2Se3,

Abstract = {{Searching for the Dirac materials with ultrasoftness is crucial for
   flexible electronics applications. Based on first-principles
   calculations, we propose a new carbon allotrope (named as ph-graphene)
   with a penta-hexagonal framework, which is energetically more favorable
   than the penta-graphene composing surely of pentagons and some of
   already-synthesized carbon allotropes. Ph-graphene has an in-plane
   stiffness of 27.75 GPa.nm, smaller than those of graphene and
   penta-graphene by one order. The famous isotropic Dirac cones are well
   preserved in the ultrasoft ph-graphene, exhibiting delocalized feature
   of p(z) orbits with the Fermi velocity of 2.8 x 10(5) m/s. Additionally,
   surface hydrogenation alters drastically the electronic and mechanical
   properties of ph-graphene, resulting in electronic spin-polarization and
   anisotropic negative Poisson's ratios sequentially with the increase of
   hydrogenation concentrations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{During the sound transmission loss test in the standing-wave tube, the
   unavoidable reflected wave from the termination of downstream tube would
   affect the precision measurement of sound transmission loss(TL).
   However, it can be solved by defining the non-reflected boundary
   conditions when modeling based on the finite element method. Then, the
   model has been validated by comparing with the analytical method. Based
   on the present model, the sound insulation performance of two types of
   honeycomb-hole coatings have been analyzed and discussed. Moreover, the
   changes of parameters play an important role on the sound insulation
   performance of honeycomb-hole coating and the negative Poisson's ratio
   honeycomb-hole coating has better sound insulation performance at
   special frequencies. Finally, it is summarized that sound insulation
   performance is the result of various factors that include the impedance
   changes, the waveform transformation and so on.}},

Abstract = {{Excesses of digestive and respiratory cancers have been reported
   previously in association with exposure to machining fluids, agents in
   widespread use as coolants and lubricants in machining operations.
   Previous studies have had limited power to distinguish the effects of
   the different types of machining fluids in use. In a cohort of over 30
   000 workers employed at two automotive plants in Michigan, mortality
   patterns were studied in relation to exposure to each of the three major
   fluid types - straight oils, soluble oils, and synthetic fluids.
   Standardized mortality ratios were estimated for subgroups of the cohort
   ever exposed to each of the three fluid types, and Poisson regression
   analyses were used to assess trends in risk with duration of exposure.
   The data suggest modest positive associations between exposure to
   straight oils and rectal, laryngeal, and prostatic cancer and a negative
   association between soluble and synthetic fluid exposure and lung
   cancer.}},

   Reporting System and Discharge Abstract Database. Regression models
   based on spatial area incorporated human infection data with livestock
   and weather covariates. A variety of regression models were applied
   (i.e. least squares, spatial lag/error, Poisson, negative binomial) to
   test the most appropriate approach. Ratios for the total number of
   calves, bulls and beef cows to human population were highlighted as
   significant cattle density variables in all final best-fitting models.
   Weather variables were not significant in final regression models
   averaged over the full study period. Our results provide evidence of a
   significant association between measures of cattle density and human E.

   Non-Equilibrium Green's Function (NEGF) frame work with tight-binding
   Hamiltonian and 2-D Poisson equations were solved self-consistently for
   device study. The interesting feature in this device is that it is an
   all graphene RID with band gap engineered graphene antidot tunnel
   baniers. Another interesting new finding is that it shows negative
   differential resistance (NDR), which involves the resonant tunneling m
   the graphene quantum well through both the electron and hole bound
   states. The Graphene Antidot Lattice (GAL) harriers in this device
   efficiently improved the Peak to Valley Ratio to approximately 20 even
   at room temperature. A new fitting model is developed for the number of

   help in determining effective barrier width of any size of actual

Abstract = {{In this work we present concepts and prototypes of a novel class of
   chiral honeycomb core with embedded sensing characteristics for
   potential structural health monitoring (SHM) and other multifunctional
   applications. The cellular structure concepts, all having negative

   support embedded on the surface, or within the unit cell plates. Both
   the sensors and the infrastructure provide not only the capability of
   detecting signals proportional to the external mechanical loading, but
   act also as load-bearing units. The honeycombs have been produced using
   vacuum-casting techniques and resin transfer moulding methods, with
   micro fibre composites (MFCs) embedded in their cell walls. The sensing
   and mechanical performance of the prototypes are evaluated using finite
   element simulations, static tests, broadband vibration excitation and
   impact at low kinetic energy levels using an airgun. (C) 2009 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The anisotropy strain effects on black phosphorus and the IV-VI
   monolayer analogues have been widely investigated due to their potential
   applications in solar energy conversion and opto-electronics. Although
   the coupling effects of strain on structural and electronic properties
   might be important in flexible monolayer materials they were neglected
   in most cases. In this paper, we investigated the strain effect on the
   properties of SnS via strain induced potential energy surface and band
   profiles. Our firstprinciples calculations predict different types of
   low-dimensional phases under ununiformed biaxial strain of 19.09 N
   m(-1), with either strain induced semiconductor-metal transitions,
   indirect-direct bandgap transitions or negative Poisson's ratio. Our
   calculations suggest a new method to illuminate the strain effect beyond
   the axis direction, demonstrating that the coupling of strain effect
   plays an important role in the search for new properties for flexible
   materials and cannot be neglected.}},

Title = {{Compressive deformation mechanism of honeycomb-like graphene aerogels}},
Journal = {{CARBON}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{134}},
Pages = {{398-410}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Graphene aerogels (GAs) are a kind of advanced graphene assemblies,
   which are quite elastic and can easily restore their original form after
   compression. The macroscale compression behavior of the GAs is the
   result of microstructural evolution of the graphene sheets. In this
   paper, the microstructural compression response of honeycomb-like GAs is
   investigated via coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) method. Based
   on the coarse-grained (CG) model of a single-layer graphene,
   honeycomb-like structures can be built and arranged layer-by-layer to
   form the complete GA model. CGMD simulations presented in this work are
   carried out with a TersoffCG potential, which was developed specifically
   for single-layer graphene. The effects of layer number, size of the
   graphene sheets and the interlaminar overlap pattern on the compressive
   behavior of the GAs are studied. Moreover, the stress distribution in
   graphene networks of the GAs during the compression process is analyzed.
   Different microscale strain concentrations and stress localizations are
   discovered in the GAs with different network patterns. Furthermore, a
   negative Poisson's ratio of the models within a certain range of
   compressive strain is found, which is related to both the
   microstructural arrangement and the deformation of graphene sheet. (C)

Title = {{Analysing recurrent hospitalizations in heart failure: a review of

Abstract = {{Aims Heart failure is characterized by recurrent hospitalizations, but
   often only the first event is considered in clinical trial reports. In
   chronic diseases, such as heart failure, analysing all events gives a
   more complete picture of treatment benefit. We describe methods of
   analysing repeat hospitalizations, and illustrate their value in one
   major trial.
   Methods and results The Candesartan in Heart failure Assessment of
   Reduction in Mortality and morbidity (CHARM)-Preserved study compared
   candesartan with placebo in 3023 patients with heart failure and
   preserved systolic function. The heart failure hospitalization rates
   were 12.5 and 8.9 per 100 patient-years in the placebo and candesartan
   groups, respectively. The repeat hospitalizations were analysed using
   the Andersen-Gill, Poisson, and negative binomial methods. Death was
   incorporated into analyses by treating it as an additional event. The
   win ratio method and a method that jointly models hospitalizations and
   mortality were also considered. Using repeat events gave larger
   treatment benefits than time to first event analysis. The negative
   binomial method for the composite of recurrent heart failure
   hospitalizations and cardiovascular death gave a rate ratio of 0.75
   {[}95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.62-0.91, P = 0.003], whereas the
   hazard ratio for time to first heart failure hospitalization or
   cardiovascular death was 0.86 (95\% CI 0.74-1.00, P = 0.050).
   Conclusions In patients with preserved EF, candesartan reduces the rate
   of admissions for worsening heart failure, to a greater extent than
   apparent from analysing only first hospitalizations. Recurrent events
   should be routinely incorporated into the analysis of future clinical
   trials in heart failure.}},

   combine household survey data with census derived classification of
   social vulnerability of each household s census tract The dependent
   variable was utilization of physician services in the prior 12 months,
   and the independent variables included predisposing factors health
   needs, enabling factors, and context Prevalence ratios and 95\%
   confidence intervals were estimated by the Hurdle regression model,
   which combined Poisson regression analysis of factors associated with
   any doctor visas (dichotomous variable) and zero-truncated negative
   binomial regression for the analysis of factors associated with the
   number of visas among those who had at least one Results indicate that
   the use of health services was greater among women and increased with
   age, and was determined primarily by health needs and whether the
   individual had a regular doctor, even among those living in areas of the
   city with the worst socio environmental indicators The experience of

Title = {{Improving the strength and toughness of macroscale double networks by
   exploiting Poisson's ratio mismatch}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JUN 24}},
Abstract = {{We propose a new concept that utilizes the difference in Poisson's ratio
   between component materials as a strengthening mechanism that increases
   the effectiveness of the sacrificial bond toughening mechanism in
   macroscale double-network (Macro-DN) materials. These Macro-DN
   composites consist of a macroscopic skeleton imbedded within a soft
   elastic matrix. We varied the Poisson's ratio of the reinforcing
   skeleton by introducing auxetic or honeycomb functional structures that
   results in Poisson's ratio mismatch between the skeleton and matrix.
   During uniaxial tensile experiments, high strength and toughness were
   achieved due to two events: (1) multiple internal bond fractures of the
   skeleton (like sacrificial bonds in classic DN gels) and (2)
   significant, biaxial deformation of the matrix imposed by the functional
   skeleton. The Macro-DN composite with auxetic skeleton exhibits up to
   4.2 times higher stiffness and 4.4 times higher yield force than the sum
   of the component materials. The significant improvement in mechanical
   performance is correlated to the large mismatch in Poisson's ratio
   between component materials, and the enhancement is especially
   noticeable in the low-stretch regime. The strengthening mechanism
   reported here based on Poisson's ratio mismatch can be widely used for
   soft materials regardless of chemical composition and will improve the
   mechanical properties of elastomer and hydrogel systems.}},

Abstract = {{The relation curve between the apparent velocity of S wave and the
   filter-parameter is obtained by low-pass filtering the radial and
   vertical receiver function, then it is transformed into the S velocity
   structure beneath the station with empirical formula; moreover, the S
   velocity structure will be regarded as initial model for receiver
   function inversion. The numerical simulation indicated that the
   inversion processes would approach quickly to the true model once the
   initial S velocity can supply the effective constraint to inversion,
   even if the depth of Moho is not accurate. In addition, for the same
   initial S structure, the inversion results also approach to the true
   model quickly, even adding 10\% of random noises to the ``observed{''}
   receiver function, and 5\% of positive and negative perturbation to the
   velocity ratio (corresponding to the Poisson's ratio of 0.27 and 0.23)
   respectively. We processed the teleseismic receiver function recorded by
   Baoshan station. The result from our method is similar to that of
   sounding section. These confirmed that the inversion processes of
   receiver function are not sensitive to the initial P velocity if the
   initial S wave velocity can provide the effective constraint
   information.}},

Abstract = {{Control of human papillomavirus (HPV)-related cancers by inclusion of
   HPV vaccination into national vaccination programmes is likely. One open
   question is replacement of the vaccine types with other high-risk (hr)
   HPV types in the vaccination era. We studied occurrence of HPV types in
   adolescent females participating in a population-based vaccination
   trial. A total of 4,808 16- to 17-year-old females from Finland were
   enrolled in the 1:1 randomized phase III (PATRICIA) trial of the
   efficacy of vaccination with the AS04-adjuvanted HPV-16/18 virus-like
   particle vaccine as compared to hepatitis A virus (HAV) vaccine. HPV
   infection was assessed from cervical samples taken every 6 months for 4
   years post-vaccination by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for genital
   oncogenic HPV types 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 58, 59, 66, 68,
   and 73 as well as low-risk types HPV-6 and HPV-11. The HPV-16/18 vaccine
   coverage ranged between 1 and 22\% by age-cohort and study community.
   Odds ratios (ORs) for infections with different HPV types in baseline
   PCR negative HPV-16/18 vs. HAV vaccinated women, and Poisson regression
   derived HPV incidence rate ratios (IRRs) in baseline positive vs.
   negative women were calculated. The OR and IRR estimates for acquisition
   of any genital HPV types showed no excess risk neither in baseline HPV
   DNA-negative HPV-16/18-vaccinated women compared to baseline HPV
   DNA-negative HAV vaccinated women nor in HPV-16/18-vaccinated baseline
   HPV-16/18-positive women compared to baseline HPV-16/18-negative women.
   In the HAV-vaccinated, baseline HPV-18-positive women showed an
   increased risk of acquiring other clade A7 HPV types (39, 45, 59, 68)
   (IRR 1.8, 95\% confidence interval = 1.01.-3.1). We found no increased
   occurrence of non-vaccine HPV types suggestive of type-replacement 14
   years post-vaccination among HPV-16/18-vaccinated Finnish adolescents.}},

Abstract = {{The electrical response of an electrolytic cell to an external ac
   excitation is analysed by solving the equations of the
   Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) continuum model for two ions (ambipolar) and
   one mobile ion diffusive systems. The theoretical predictions of the
   ambipolar system, formed by positive ions of mobility mu(p) and negative
   ions of mobility mu(m), are investigated in the limit in which one of
   the mobilities goes to zero. The analysis reveals that these predictions
   correspond to the ones arising from the one mobile ion diffusive system
   only in the frequency range omega >> omega(D)mu(m)/mu(p), in which
   omega(D) is the Debye's frequency. For very low frequencies, it shows
   that the physical system formed by two mobile ions, one of which has a
   very low mobility, is clearly distinct from the physical system in which
   just one of the ions is mobile. We argue that apparent deviations of the
   experimental spectra from the predictions of the PNP model in the low
   frequency region, usually interpreted as an interfacial property, may be
   connected with the difference in the diffusion coefficients of cations
   and anions.}},

Abstract = {{The oral health status of children with special health care needs (SHCN)
   can affect their quality of life wich domains of the Brazilian version
   of the Early Childohood Oral Health Impact Scale (B-ECOHIS). A
   cross-sectional study was conducted in children with SHCN (aged 1 to 9
   years), who underwent an oral examination for the assessment of dental
   caries severity. Parents/caregivers answered two questionnaires, one on
   oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) - B-ECOHIS, and one on
   socioeconomic characteristics. Statistical analyses were performed using
   the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, Mann-Whitney U-test, Poisson regression,
   Point-biserial correlation coefficient, and Cronbach's alpha. A total of
   128 children participated in the study and OHRQoL was affected in
   68.75\% of them. The function domain in the Child Impact Section (CIS)
   had a higher mean value. Caries severity was associated with worse
   quality of life (p=0.001). Severe dental caries was associated with a
   negative impact on the OHRQoL of disabled children and of their
   families. The impact of untreated dental caries and severity of dental
   caries was associated with the CIS domains (except for the
   self-image/social interaction domain).}},

Abstract = {{A kinetic formulation is developed to investigate low-frequency dust ion
   acoustic waves (DIAWs) and dust acoustic waves (DAWs) as well as
   numerically for a four-component, collisionless, unmagnetized dusty
   plasma, using the linearized Vlasov-Poisson model for species obeying
   the Maxwellian distribution. In particular, the dynamics of
   low-frequency DIAWs is investigated by considering two cases. In the
   first case, ions and positive dust particles are assumed to be
   dynamically adiabatic while the negative dust particles are static in
   the background. In second case, the ions are taken adiabatic, while both
   positive and negative dust particles are static in the background. For
   DAWs, the ions are assumed to be isothermal, while both positive and
   negative dust species are considered adiabatic. Electrons are assumed to
   be isothermal in all cases. The linear characteristics and Landau
   damping rates for DIAWs and DAWs are investigated with effects of the
   dust particle concentrations and different temperature ratios. It is
   noted that for higher values of positive dust concentration, DIAWs
   (DAWs) are less (more) damped. It is also observed that the damping rate
   increases (decreases) as T-i approaches T-e for DIAWs (DAWs). It is
   worth adding here that the theoretical results presented here are
   supported by numerical analyses and illustrations. The relevance of the
   study to laboratory and cosmic plasmas is also pointed out.}},

Abstract = {{A microphysics-agnostic meta-model of rotational glitches in
   rotation-powered pulsars is developed, wherein the globally averaged
   internal stress accumulates as a Brownian process between glitches, and
   a glitch is triggered once a critical threshold is surmounted. Precise,
   falsifiable predictions are made regarding long-term event statistics in
   individual pulsars. For example, the Spearman cross-correlation
   coefficient between the size of a glitch and the waiting time until the
   next glitch should exceed 0.25 in all pulsars. Among the six pulsars
   with the most recorded glitches, PSR J0537-6910 and PSR J0835-4510 are
   consistent with the predictions of the meta-model, while PSR J1740-3015
   and PSR J0631+1036 are not. PSR J0534+2200 and PSR J1341-6220 are only
   consistent with the meta-model, if there exists an undetected population
   of small glitches with small waiting times, which we do not resolve. The
   results are compared with a state-dependent Poisson process, another
   microphysics-agnostic meta-model in the literature. The results are also
   applied briefly to recent pulse-to-pulse observations of PSRJ0835-4510,
   which appear to reveal evidence for a negative fluctuation in rotation
   frequency just prior to the 2016 glitch.}},

Title = {{Can outside CEO successors bring innovation to firms? Evidence from

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{14}},

Abstract = {{Purpose
   This paper aims to examine the effect of outside chief executive officer
   (CEO) succession on firm innovation in Chinese companies and to explore
   the mechanism behind the process. By analyzing the motivation of CEO
   successors of different origins in the context of selection, this paper
   identifies the factors affecting outside CEO successors' decision-making
   on post-succession firm innovation.
   Design/methodology/approach
   A Poisson regression model is used on a sample of 1,084 firm-year
   observations taken from Chinese listed companies that endured CEO
   succession during the period of 2009-2016. Fixed-effect Poisson
   regression modeling was performed after likelihood ratio and Hausman
   testing to assess the robustness of the findings.
   Findings
   The results show that outside CEO successions are significantly and
   negatively associated with post-succession firm innovation. Moreover,
   the authors found a negative effect of outside CEO succession on
   post-succession firm innovation when the predecessor has a long tenure
   or the successor is older.
   Originality/value
   .This study contributes to the literature on CEO succession, CEO-board
   relationships and firm innovation by shedding light on how agency, human
   capital and career-concerning theories in the CEO selection context
   apply to corporate governance and strategy. Moreover, by exploring the
   factors influencing CEO successors' decision-making in terms of firm
   innovation in the Chinese social and cultural context, this paper
   identifies ways to promote firm innovation for Chinese companies from
   the concept of leadership succession.}},

Abstract = {{This paper analyzes the stability, margin, and performance of
   Ultra-Thin-Body (UTB) SOI 6T/8T SRAM cells operating in subthreshold
   region. An analytical SNM model for UTB SOI 6T/8T SRAM cells operating
   in the subthreshold region is presented to investigate the Read SNM
   (RSNM) and Write SNM (WSNM). Our results indicate that back-gating
   technique is more effective in the subthreshold region than in the
   superthreshold region for improving RSNM and WSNM. The UTB SOI 6T SRAM
   cell with back-gating technique to increase the strength of the pull-up
   transistors and decrease the strength of the pass-gate transistors shows
   comparable RSNM in the subthreshold region with the 10T bulk
   subthreshold SRAM cell and an improvement in RSNM variation. Due to
   better electrostatic integrity, back-gating technique (pull-up PFET with
   positive back-gate bias, pull-down/pass-gate NFET's with negative
   back-gate bias) mitigates the 6T UTB SOI SRAM RSNM variation
   significantly with some improvement in RSNM. Increasing cell beta-ratio
   shows limited improvement on RSNM and has no benefit on SNM variability
   for subthreshold operation. The UTB SOI 8T SRAM cell exhibits RSNM 2X
   larger than the 6T SRAM cell in the subthreshold region. Mixed-mode
   device/circuit simulations show that 6T/8T UTB SOI SRAMs operating in
   the subthreshold region can meet/support the stability, leakage/density,
   and frequency requirements for intended application space of
   subthreshold SRAMs.}},

Abstract = {{Objective
   To identify the main dietary patterns in type 2 diabetes patients and
   study their association with glycemic indexes.
   Methods
   This is a cross-sectional study carried out in a diabetes treatment
   reference institution located in the city of Fortaleza (CE). Two R24h
   were applied, as well as 12h fast blood glucose tests and anthropometric
   assessments in 188 diabetic patients. The principal components factor
   analysis method was applied together with a Varimax orthogonal rotation
   method to identify dietary patterns. The Poisson Regression and the
   Spearman coefficient were used to test the association with glycemic
   indexes.
   Results
   A hundred eighty eight diabetic patients were evaluated, of which 51.1\%
   patients had decompensated glucose values. Five main dietary patterns
   were identified: traditional Brazilian, energy-dense, infusion and
   wholegrain cereal, sandwich and dairy, and healthy diets, which
   explained 37.2\% of the total variance in intake. A negative correlation
   with glucose was found for the traditional Brazilian diet (p=0.018;
   r=-0.173).
   Conclusion
   Out of the five identified dietary patterns consumed by the type 2
   diabetes patients studied, a higher adherence to the traditional
   Brazilian dietary patterns resulted in lower blood glucose levels.}},

Abstract = {{In-depth understanding of flow and pumping characteristics of the
   nanofluids in a narrow fluidic channel is required for accurate control
   of micropumps. The present paper studies the nanofluids flow driven by
   the combined effects of peristaltic pumping and external electric field
   through microchannel. Double diffusive convection in nanofluids is
   examined. Buoyancy effects due to change in temperature, solute
   concentration and nanoparticle volume fraction are also taken into
   account. Poisson-Boltzmann, momentum, energy, solute concentration, and
   nanoparticle volume fraction equations are considered to govern the
   nanofluids flow. Governing equations are simplified under the
   lubrication theory and Debye-Huckel linearization. Influences of Joule
   heating, electric double layer thickness, electroosmostic velocity,
   Grashof numbers, thermophoresis and Brownian motion on flow
   characteristics, pumping characteristics, and skin friction coefficient
   are computed using Mathematica software. Trapping phenomenon is also
   examined under the effects of pertinent parameters. Present analysis
   reveals that flow characteristics and pumping characteristics improve
   with negative Joule heating effects. The findings of present analysis
   can be utilized in clinical implications like drug delivery systems,
   cell therapeutics, and particles filtrations etc. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Men who have sex with men (MSM), who have heterogeneous HIV-acquisition

   initially HIV-negative MSM participants for more than 1378.5
   person-years, to develop an empiric risk score for targeting PrEP
   delivery. Independent predictors of incident HIV-1 infection in this
   cohort were an age of 18-24 years, having only male sex partners, having
   receptive anal intercourse, having any unprotected sex, and having group
   sex. Poisson model coefficients were used to assign a numeric score to
   each statistically significant predictor. A risk score of ae 1
   corresponded to an HIV-1 incidence of ae 2.2 {[}95\% confidence interval
   (CI) 1.2-4.1] and identified 81.3\% of the cohort participants as being
   at high risk for HIV-1 acquisition. The area under the receiver
   operating characteristic curve was 0.76 (95\% CI 0.71-0.80). This
   empiric risk score may help Kenyan health care providers to assess HIV-1
   acquisition risk and encourage PrEP uptake by high-risk MSM.}},

Abstract = {{Let p be a probability measure on the real line with finite moments of
   all orders. Suppose the linear span of polynomials is dense in L-2(mu).
   Then there exists a sequence \{P-n\}(n=0)(infinity) of orthogonal
   polynomials with respect to mu such that Pn is a polynomial of degree n
   with leading coefficient 1 and the equality (x - alpha(n))P-n(x) =
   Pn+1(x) + omega(n)P(n-1)(x) holds, where alpha(n) and omega(n) are
   Szego-Jacobi parameters. In this paper we use the concepts of
   pregenerating function, multiplicative renormalization, and generating
   function to derive \{P-n, alpha(n), omega(n)\} from a given mu. Two
   types of pre-generating functions are studied. We apply our method to
   the special distributions such as Gaussian, Poisson, gamma, uniform,
   arcsine, semi-circle, and beta-type to derive \{P-n, alpha(n),
   omega(n)\}. Moreover, we show that the corresponding polynomials P-n's
   are exactly the classical polynomials such as Hermite, Charlier,
   Laguerre, Legendre, Chebyshev of the first kind, Chebyshev of the second
   kind, and Gegenbauer. We also apply our method to study the negative
   binomial distributions.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate theoretically that the presence of ions in insulating
   materials such as nematic liquid crystals may be responsible for the
   dielectric spectroscopy behavior observed experimentally. It is shown
   that, at low frequencies, an essentially non-Debye relaxation process
   takes place due to surface effects. This is accomplished by
   investigating the effects of the adsorption-desorption process on the
   electrical response of an electrolytic cell when the generation and
   recombination of ions is present. The adsorption-desorption is governed
   by a non-usual kinetic equation in order to incorporate memory effects
   related to a non-Debye relaxation and the roughness of the surface. The
   analysis is carried out by searching for solutions to the
   drift-diffusion equation that satisfy the Poisson equation relating the
   effective electric field to the net charge density. We also discuss the
   effect of the mobility of the ions, i.e., situations with equal and
   different diffusion coefficients for positive and negative ions, on the
   impedance and obtain an exact expression for the admittance. The model
   is compared with experimental results measured for the impedance of a
   nematic liquid crystal sample and a very good agreement is obtained.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate the network properties of the South Korean
   dialects. Among 153 words in ``The Linguistic Atlas of Korea{''}, 33
   words satisfying our criteria were surveyed. We set 138 basic
   administrative districts that make up South Korea as nodes and construct
   a language network by using a defined procedure. The network shows
   neither a small-world (small-world coefficient < 5) nor a scale-free
   (degree distribution forms like a unimodal Poisson) property in the
   general complex network. Also, the assortativity is seen to show
   transition from negative to positive at about the threshold value of 15.
   The number of Korean linguistic groups, which is the most import result
   in this study, is constantly four with s-curved Newman modularity in the
   threshold range 13 similar to 22. The Korean dialect division by using a
   network modularity method is almost identical to the classification of
   traditional linguists (Central, Southwest, Southeast, and Jeju).
   Furthermore, subgroups can be obtained by performing a hierarchical
   dialect division. As a result, South Korean dialects are classified into
   seven minor groups, and some regions (e.g., Southern Gang-won) belong to
   groups different from those of the traditional classification method.}},

Abstract = {{The growth behaviour of barium on silver(111) at room temperature is
   investigated by AES. XPS, MEIS. TDS, Work function measurements and by
   monitoring the secondary-electron-emission crystal current. It is shown
   that, for low coverage, initially a 2D monolayer is formed. For higher
   coverages the overlayer formed resembles a structure formed by Poisson
   or Stranski-Krastanov growth with small islands. As evaporation
   continues the islands become very large or the sticking coefficient
   drops to zero. Annealing the Ag with more than one monolayer of Ba on
   top shows a large work function decrease of 0.6 eV to an unusually low
   value of 1.9 eV. The lowering of the work function can partly be
   explained by the formation of large clusters. Coadsorption experiments
   with H-2 indicate that the H-2 Sticking coefficient on Ba/Ag(111) is
   constant and that the H-2 adsorbs dissociatively into one binding state.
   From the experiments an inelastic mean free path of 11 +/- 1 angstrom
   for 351 eV electrons and 17 +/- 1 angstrom for 1113 eV and 1119 eV
   electrons is deduced.}},

Abstract = {{Associated to a square matrix all of whose entries are real Laurent
   polynomials in several variables with no negative coefficients is an
   ordered ``dimension{''} module introduced by Tuncel, with additional
   structure, which acts as an invariant for topological Markov chains, and
   is also an invariant for actions of tori on AF C{*}-algebras. In
   describing this invariant, we are led naturally to eventually positivity
   questions, which in turn lead to descriptions of the Poisson boundaries
   ( of random walks affiliated with these processes). There is an
   interplay between the algebraic, dynamical, and probabilistic aspects,
   for example, if the ( suitably defined) endomorphism ring of the
   dimension module is noetherian, then the boundary is more easily
   described, the asymptotic behaviour of powers of the matrix is
   tractible, and the order-theoretic aspects of the dimension module are
   less difficult to deal with than in general. We also show that under
   relatively modest conditions, the largest eigenvalue function is a
   complete invariant for finite equivalence ( early results of Marcus and
   Tuncel showed that it is not a complete invariant in general, but is so
   if the large eigenvalue is a polynomial).}},

Abstract = {{In order to clarify the effects of tilt- or suction-cast processing and
   microalloying of minor Si on the three-point bending fracture toughness
   of the Zr-based bulk metallic glasses (BMGs), the tilt-cast and
   suction-cast Zr53-based and Zr48-based BMGs with and without Si were
   studied. The results revealed that the tilt-cast specimens present much
   better fracture toughness than the suction-cast counterparts as a result
   of their lower degrees of residual porosity. In addition, the
   microalloying of Si to 0.75 at.\% in these BMGs would impose negative
   effects on their fracture toughness. The highest fracture toughness of
   120 MPa root m was achieved for the tilt-cast Zr53Cu30Ni9Al8. Moreover,
   the morphology of fracture surface, the calculated fracture energy, and
   the Poisson's ratio show the similar trend to prove that the tilt-cast
   Zr-53 BMG without Si possesses the best fracture toughness among these
   BMGs in this study. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To investigate the relationship between utilisation of
   service mammography screening and breast cancer mortality in New South
   Wales (NSW) women.
   Setting: Population-based biennial mammography screening was
   progressively introduced in NSW from 1988, with active recruitment and
   re-invitation for women aged 50-69 years, and reached full geographic
   coverage by 1996. Biennial mammography screening participation has
   varied widely over time and by municipality.
   Methods: Breast cancer mortality by age, period and municipality was
   obtained from the NSW Central Cancer Registry. Biennial mammography
   screening rates for the same strata were obtained from the BreastScreen
   NSW database. Temporal changes in breast cancer mortality for NSW were
   summarised as annual average declines using Poisson regression. Breast
   cancer mortality for 1997-2001 was examined in relation to lagged
   biennial screening rates by municipality, adjusted for age, area
   socio-economic and geographic indicators, and breast cancer incidence,
   also using Poisson regression.
   Results: For the 50-69 year age group, the mean annual breast cancer
   mortality decline was 0.8\% (not significant) for 1988-1994, and 4.4\%
   (p < 0.0001) for 1995-2001. Statistically significant negative
   associations between breast cancer mortality in 1997-2001 and lagged
   biennial screening rates were found with the highest significance at a
   four-year lag for women aged 50-69 years (p = 0.0003) and also for women
   aged 50-79 years (p = 0.0002). From the regression coefficient, a 70\%
   biennial screening rate is associated with 32\% lower breast cancer
   mortality (compared to zero screening).
   Conclusions: The effect of population-based mammography screening on
   breast cancer mortality in NSW inferred using this method is consistent
   with results of trials and other service studies. This suggests that
   population-based mammography screening programs can achieve significant
   reductions in breast cancer mortality with adequate participation.}},

Abstract = {{Kerogen content and kerogen porosity play a significant role in elastic
   properties of organic-rich shales. We construct a rock physics model for
   organic-rich shales to quantify the effect of kerogen content and
   kerogen porosity using the Kuster and Toksoz theory and the
   self-consistent approximation method. Rock physics modeling results show
   that with the increase of kerogen content and kerogen-related porosity,
   the velocity and density of shales decrease, and the effect of kerogen
   porosity becomes more obvious only for higher kerogen content. We also
   find that the Poisson's ratio of the shale is not sensitive to kerogen
   porosity for the case of gas saturation. Finally, for the seismic
   reflection responses of an organic-rich shale layer, forward modeling
   results indicate the fifth type AVO responses which correspond to a
   negative intercept and a positive gradient. The absolute values of
   intercept and gradient increase with kerogen content and kerogen
   porosity, and present predictable variations associated with velocities
   and density.}},

Abstract = {{The objectives of this study were to estimate influenza vaccination
   coverage in the elderly and identify factors associated with vaccination
   uptake. A cross-sectional population-based study was conducted with data
   collected in 2006 by the Health, Well-Being, and Aging study. The sample
   consisted of 1,399 elderly in the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil. The
   association between vaccine uptake and independent variables was
   assessed with prevalence ratios, estimated by Poisson regression.
   Self-reported vaccination was 73.8\%. In the final explanatory model,
   influenza vaccination was associated with older age, presence of chronic
   diseases, and use of health care in the previous year. A negative
   association was observed with hospitalization during the previous year.
   The study concludes that it is necessary to encourage vaccination of
   elderly less than 70 years of age and those without chronic diseases, as
   well as to orient health professionals to expand coverage in groups with
   lower uptake during vaccination campaigns.}},

Pages = {{159-174}},
Abstract = {{Mechanical properties of oil shales as a function of temperature and
   pressure are reviewed. Implications of evolution of these properties for
   in situ exploitation and basin modelling are explored. Mechanical
   properties at room temperature are well known. The existing data suggest
   a positive correlation between oil shale grade (organic matter content)
   and Poisson ratio, whereas tensile and compressive strength as well as
   modulus of elasticity show negative correlations. These properties are
   strongly affected by temperature. An increase in temperature results in
   loss of strength and decrease in Young's modulus. Strength follows a
   logarithmic decrease with increasing temperature, depending on grade.
   Creep is much enhanced by elevated temperature. Extrapolation of
   laboratory data to nature suggests that tensile fracturing may occur
   more easily during petroleum generation, and creep is more prominent in
   oil shales than in other rocks at this depth in the crust. More
   high-temperature experiments are required to validate these conclusions.}},

Journal = {{MECHANICS OF MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{145}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Non-linear homogenization of hyperelastic materials is reviewed and
   adapted to topology optimization. The homogenization is based on the
   method of multiscale virtual power in which the unit cell is subjected
   to either macroscopic deformation gradients or equivalently to Bloch
   type displacement boundary conditions. A detailed discussion regarding
   domain symmetry of the unit cell and its effect on uniaxial loading
   conditions is provided. The density approach is used to formulate the
   topology optimization problem which is solved via the method of moving
   asymptotes. The adjoint sensitivity analysis considers response
   functions that quantify both the displacement and incremental
   displacement. Notably, the transfer of the sensitivities from the
   microscale to the macroscale is presented in detail. A periodic filter
   and thresholding are used to regularize the topology optimization
   problem and to generate crisp boundaries. The proposed methodology is
   used to design hyperelastic microstructures comprised of Neo-Hookean
   constituents for maximum load carrying capacity subject to negative
   Poisson's ratio constraints.}},

   Our framework can be applied to obtain capacity upper bounds for any
   repetition distribution (the deletion and Poisson repeat channels
   corresponding to the special cases of Bernoulli and Poisson
   distributions). Our techniques essentially reduce the task of proving
   capacity upper bounds to maximizing a univariate, real valued, and often
   concave function over a bounded interval. The corresponding univariate
   function is carefully designed according to the underlying distribution
   of repetitions and the choices vary depending on the desired strength of
   the upper bounds as well as the desired simplicity of the function
   (e.g., being only efficiently computable versus having an explicit
   closed-form expression in terms of elementary, or common special,
   functions).
   Among our results, we show that the capacity of the binary deletion
   channel with deletion probability d is at most (1 - d) log phi for d >=
   1/2, and, assuming the capacity function is convex, is at most 1 - d
   log(4/(phi) ford < 1/2, where rp = (1 + root 5)/2 is the golden ratio.
   This is the first nontrivial capacity upper bound for any value of d
   outside the limiting case d > 0 that is fully explicit and proved
   without computer assistance.
   Furthermore, we derive the first set of capacity upper bounds for the
   Poisson-repeat channel. Our results uncover further striking connections
   between this channel and the deletion channel, and suggest, somewhat
   counter-intuitively, that the Poisson-repeat channel is actually
   analytically simpler than the deletion channel and may be of key
   importance to a complete understanding of the deletion channel.
   Finally, we derive several novel upper bounds on the capacity of the
   deletion channel. All upper bounds are maximums of efficiently
   computable, and concave, univariate real functions over a bounded
   domain. In turn, we upper bound these functions in terms of explicit
   elementary and standard special functions, whose maximums can be found
   even more efficiently (and sometimes, analytically, for example for d =
   1/2).
   Along the way, we develop several new techniques of potentially
   independent interest. For example, we develop systematic techniques to
   study channels with mean constraints over the reals. Furthermore, we
   motivate the study of novel probability distributions over non-negative
   integers as well as novel special functions which could be of interest
   to mathematical analysis.}},

Abstract = {{3D printing has had a significant impact on the research in structural
   dynamics. In recent years this research has been primarily focused on
   periodic structures where the 3D printing was used to develop advanced
   meta-materials with properties classical materials do not have (e.g.
   acoustic stop-band filters, negative Poisson ratio). This research is
   focused on fused filament fabrication (FFF) 3D printing technology,
   where, recently introduced conductive PLA (Polylactic Acid) filaments,
   have been researched for the effect of piezoresistivity in dynamics
   measurements (e.g. strain measurement). Piezoresistivity denotes the
   phenomenon where electrical resistivity changes under the influence of
   mechanical strain and can be therefore used for dynamic sensing.
   However, several difficulties arise when FFF is used, such as
   heterogenity, anisotropy, and high influence of process parameters. In
   this research, the theoretical principles of piezoresistive sensing of
   FFF structures are presented. Additionally, the importance of high
   conductivity of 3d printed conductors is disscussed.}},

   19832008 were analysed. Poisson regression analyses were used to
   estimate temporal trends in hospital admissions and mortality. Zero

   hospitalisation rates increased for scalds (incident rate ratio (IRR)
   1.01, 95\% CI: 1.001.02) and contact burns (IRR 1.05, 95\% CI: 1.031.07)
   while a significant reduction in flame hospitalisation rates (IRR 0.93,
   95\% CI: 0.920.94) was estimated. No significant changes in length of

Journal = {{MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{In the present paper, a novel cellular metamaterial that was based on a
   tensegrity pattern is presented. The material is constructed from
   supercells, each of which consists of eight 4-strut simplex modules. The
   proposed metamaterial exhibits some unusual properties, which are
   typical for smart structures. It is possible to control its mechanical
   characteristics by adjusting the level of self-stress or by changing the
   properties of structural members. A continuum model is used to identify
   the qualitative properties of the considered metamaterial, and to
   estimate how the applied self-stress and the characteristics of cables
   and struts affect the whole structure. The performed analyses proved
   that the proposed structure can be regarded as a smart metamaterial with
   orthotropic properties. One of its most important features are unique
   values of Poisson's ratio, which can be either positive or negative,
   depending on the applied control parameters. Moreover, all of the
   mechanical characteristics of the proposed metamaterial are prone to
   structural control.}},

Abstract = {{The energetic homogenization procedure for the determination of the
   effective elasticity tensor of grid structures as proposed in an earlier
   paper is extended to the analysis of general hexagonal and quadrilateral
   grid structures. The method is based on the assumption that for
   macroscopically equal deformation the same strain energy has to be
   stored in a representative volume element whether the given
   microstructure or the effective homogenized medium is considered. The
   components of the effective elasticity tensor are determined by partial
   derivation of the strain energy density with respect to the macroscopic
   strain components. The analysis is performed comparatively by an
   analytical approach and by means of the finite element method. Standard
   commercial sandwich core geometries are considered as well as highly
   non-orthotropic grid structures. The influence of the cell geometry on
   the effective properties is discussed in detail. Special interest is
   directed to negative Poisson's ratios as well as to effectively
   non-orthotropic elastic behaviour. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Title = {{Effect of pressure on pull-off of flat cylindrical punch adhered to
   circular membrane}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ADHESION}},
Abstract = {{Pressure can sometimes be utilized to increase or decrease the strength
   of adhesion. This phenomenon is analyzed for pull-off of a flat,
   circular cylindrical punch from a circular membrane. The pressure is
   applied, and then the punch is pulled upward. Both force control and
   displacement control are considered, and the pressure may be positive
   (acting upward) or negative (acting downward) on the membrane. The
   membrane is assumed to be linearly elastic, and Foppl-von Karman theory
   is used to allow moderate displacements. The JKR theory of adhesion is
   adopted. A transversality (debonding) condition is derived, and then the
   effects of the work of adhesion, Poisson's ratio, residual stress, and
   the relative radius of the punch to that of the membrane are
   investigated. With an increase in pressure, the pull-off force
   decreases, the pull-off deflection of the punch relative to the initial
   flat membrane level increases, and the total pull-off punch deflection
   from the pressurized membrane may increase or decrease.}},

Abstract = {{Cell nuclei experience and respond to a wide range of forces, both in
   vivo and in vitro. In order to characterize the nuclear response to
   physical stress, we developed a microfluidic chip and used it to apply
   mechanical stress to live cells and measure their nuclear deformability.
   The device design is optimized for the detection of both nucleus and
   cytoplasm, which can then be conveniently quantified using a
   custom-written Matlab program. We measured nuclear sizes and strains of
   embryonic stem cells, for which we observed negative Poisson ratios in
   the nuclei. In addition, we were able to detect changes in the nuclear
   response after treatment with actin depolymerizing and chromatin
   decondensing agents. Finally, we showed that the device can be used for
   biologically relevant high-resolution confocal imaging of cells under
   compression. Thus, the device presented here allows for accurate
   physical phenotyping at high throughput and has the potential to be
   applied to a range of cell types.}},

Abstract = {{To address the fundamental question, ``How is the thickness of an
   embryonic epithelium determined?{''} equations of force equilibrium are
   derived and used to construct a theory applicable to embryonic epithelia
   and other labile monolayers, including confluent cultured cells. Under
   typical physiological conditions, the underlying mathematical
   relationships can be reworked into one simple algebraic equation. The
   theory shows that sheet thickness is determined by mechanical
   interactions between microfilaments, microtubules, cell adhesion systems
   and in-plane loading. It also explains the perplexing negative in-plane
   Poisson's ratio observed in some uniaxial tensile tests of embryonic
   epithelia. Thickness anomalies can affect phenotype, and the equations
   make it possible to calculate the degree to which gene expression,
   signalling pathways or other factors must alter the forces at work in
   order to produce a specified change in sheet thicknesses. Key findings
   are confirmed using a cell-based finite element model. Crown Copyright

Abstract = {{Many mechanisms have been proposed to explain the piezoelectric response
   of poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF), but none of these are adequate to
   explain why d32 is so much less than d31. Although it has been suggested
   that this difference could relate to the anisotropy of Poisson's ratios,
   direct measurement of the latter show that this explanation is not
   correct. The other viable explanation is that there are changes in
   crystallinity under stress. This possibility is tested in the present
   investigation using broad-line nuclear magnetic resonance measurements
   to estimate the change in crystallinity when drawn oriented samples are
   subjected to a tensile stress applied parallel or perpendicular to the
   draw direction. The results show that the crystallinity increases for a
   stress applied parallel to the draw direction and decreases for a stress
   applied perpendicular to the draw direction. The crystallinity changes
   give a positive contribution to d31 and a negative contribution to d32,
   which can explain the relatively low figure for d32 compared with d31.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 1}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of numerical simulation of a dielectric
   barrier discharge (DBD) plasma actuator and shows its effectiveness to
   control air flow around the NACA(National Advisory Committee for
   Aeronautics)0015 airfoil. The actuator consists of two tape electrodes
   separated by a dielectric layer, and it is mounted on the suction side
   of the airfoil at 18\% of the chord length. An alternating voltage with
   20 kV magnitude and 10 kHz frequency is applied between both electrodes.
   The physical model of the DBD includes the drift of two ionic species,
   positive and negative, and the Poisson equation for the electric
   potential distribution. The spatio-temporal distribution of the electric
   field, the space charge density in the ambient air, and the surface
   charge density on the dielectric layer have been determined. The time
   average electric body force was entered into the air flow model, which
   was solved using the Spalart-Allmaras turbulence technique. The
   simulation of the air flow was performed for the free-stream velocities
   between 5 m/s and 20 m/s (Reynolds numbers 1.65 x 10(5)-6.61 x 10(5)
   based on the chord length). The results of computations show the effect
   of the electrohydrodynamic actuation on the flow pattern, the lift and
   drag coefficients, the pressure coefficient, and the flow fluctuation
   near the airfoil. The ability of the DBD actuation to effectively
   control the aerodynamic airfoil characteristics has been confirmed, and
   its limitations for the discussed case have been determined.}},

Abstract = {{The processes of elastoplastic deformation in single-crystal alloys
   characterized by cubic symmetry of properties are investigated. Using
   the heat-resistant single-crystal alloy VZhM8 used to create gas turbine
   engine blades by directional crystallization as an example, the
   dependences of deformation processes on the orientation of loading
   directions with respect to crystallographic axes are shown. Significant
   anisotropy of mechanical properties, including the presence of negative
   Poisson's ratios, in heat-resistant nickel alloys is maintained up to a
   temperature of 1150 degrees C. Therefore, over the entire range of
   operating temperatures, the propagation velocities of elastic and
   plastic waves in single-crystal heat-resistant nickel alloys depend on
   the propagation direction. On the example of a VZhM8 single-crystal
   alloy under dynamic loading in a three-dimensional formulation, the
   differences in the processes of deformation realized in a single crystal
   under loading along the {[}011], {[}111] and {[}001] axes are

Abstract = {{First-principles calculations were performed to study the alloying
   stability and electronic structure of the Al-based intermetallic
   compounds AlCu3, AlCu2Zr and AlZr3. The results show that the lattice
   parameters obtained after the full relaxation of the crystalline cells
   are consistent with the experimental data, and these intermetallics have
   a strong alloying ability and structural stability due to their negative
   formation energies and their cohesive energies. A further analysis
   revealed that the single-crystal elastic constants at zero-pressure
   satisfy the requirements for the mechanical stability of cubic crystals.
   The calculations on Poisson's ratio show that AlCu3 is much more
   anisotropic than the other two intermetallics. In addition, calculations
   on the densities of states indicate that the valence bonds of these
   intermetallics are attributed to the valence electrons of Cu 3d states
   for the AlCu3, Cu 3d and Zr 4d states for AlCu2Zr, and Al 3s, Zr 5s and
   4d states for AlZr3, respectively. In particular, the electronic

Abstract = {{Atomic structure, thermodynamic and mechanical behaviours of the
   penta-silicene (p-silicene) obtained by cooling from the melt are
   studied by the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We find
   thatp-silicene can `naturally' form from the liquid state using the
   appropriate interatomic potential, density and buckling. The
   charge-optimised many body (COMB) potential is employed. Depending on
   the cooling rate used in simulations, `crystalline' or
   amorphousp-silicene can be obtained. `Crystallisation' and glass
   transition temperatures (TX=1620KandTg=1230K, respectively) have
   reasonable values compared to those of the hexa-silicene (h-silicene).
   We find that the Poisson's ratio of the obtained `crystalline'p-silicene
   is positive unlike the negative one found for thep-graphene. The reasons
   for the formation ofp-silicene instead of tetra-silicene (t-silicene)
   are analysed and discussed, i.e. 2D liquid silicene with COMB potential
   has a significant fraction of pentagons which grow with decreasing

Abstract = {{Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar observations often provide maps
   of vertical displacement that can be integrated to estimate an uplift
   volume. Relating this measure to source processes requires a model of
   the deformation. Bignami et al. (2019) argue that the negative uplift
   volume associated with the 2016 Amatrice-Norcia, central Italy,
   earthquake sequence requires a coseismic volume collapse of the hanging
   wall. Using results for dip-slip dislocations in an elastic half-space
   we show that V-uplift = (P/4) (1 - 2 nu) sin(2 delta), in which P is the
   seismic potency, nu is the Poisson's ratio, and delta is the fault dip,
   consistent with an earlier result of Ward (1986). For reasonable
   estimates of net potency for the 2016 Amatrice-Norcia sequence, this
   simple formula yields uplift volume estimates close to that observed. We
   conclude that the data are completely consistent with elastic
   dislocation theory and do not require a volume collapse at depth.}},

Abstract = {{The objectives of this study were to estimate influenza vaccination

   uptake. A cross-sectional population-based study was conducted with data
   collected in 2006 by the Health, Well-Being, and Aging study. The sample
   consisted of 1,399 elderly in the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil. The
   association between vaccine uptake and independent variables was
   assessed with prevalence ratios, estimated by Poisson regression.
   Self-reported vaccination was 73.8\%. In the final explanatory model,
   influenza vaccination was associated with older age, presence of chronic
   diseases, and use of health care in the previous year. A negative
   association was observed with hospitalization during the previous year.
   The study concludes that it is necessary to encourage vaccination of
   elderly less than 70 years of age and those without chronic diseases, as
   well as to orient health professionals to expand coverage in groups with

Abstract = {{Theoretical investigations were performed to study on alloying
   stability, and electronic structure of (AlCu3, AlCu2Zr and AlZr3). The
   results show that the lattice parameters obtained after full relaxation
   of crystalline cells are consistent with experimental data, and these
   intermetallics have a strong alloying ability and structural stability
   due to the negative formation energies and the cohesive energies. The
   further analysis find out that single-crystal elastic constants at
   zero-pressure satisfy the requirement of mechanical stability for cubic
   crystals. The calculations on Poisson's ratio show that AlCu3 is much
   more anisotropic than the other two intermetallics. In addition,
   calculations on densities of states indicates that the valence bonds of
   these intermetallics are attributed to the valence electrons of Cu 3d
   states for AlCu3, Cu 3d and Zr 4d states for AlCu2Zr, and Al 3s, Zr 5s
   and 4d states for AlZr3, respectively; in particular, the electronic
   structure of the AlZr3 shows the strongest hybridization.}},

Abstract = {{Under certain biasing conditions, the intersubband energy separation in
   a quantum wire can match the optical phonon energy, thereby enhancing
   the scattering of charge carriers. We provide direct theoretical
   evidence that an anomalous negative differential transconductance (NDT)
   recently observed in an array of quantum wires at high temperatures is
   caused by resonant intersubband optical phonon scattering.
   Self-consistent 2D solutions of the Schrodinger and Poisson equations
   with a subsequent Monte Carlo analysis of intersubband scattering reveal
   a strong resonant polar optic phonon coupling between subbands at the
   gate bias indicated by the experimental data. The peak-to-valley ratio
   of the NDT exhibits a maximum near 170 K, thereby confirming the
   predictions of several theoretical investigations. The observation of
   resonant scattering is only possible because the quasi-1D form of
   Gauss's law shows an opposite trend to that for 2D systems in the
   dependence of the eigenenergy spectrum on gate bias.}},

Abstract = {{Miniaturizing piezoelectric devices calls for the rational design of
   two-dimensional (2D) materials with outstanding piezoelectric response
   and good synthetic feasibility. Here we propose a new ternary 2D
   pentagonal structure named penta-CNP by assembling the precursor of
   1,2,4-azadiphosphole molecule. Based on state-ofthe-art theoretical
   calculations, we find that penta-CNP is dynamically, thermally and
   mechanically stable with a direct band gap of 2.62 eV, and is
   anisotropic in its mechanical properties with a negative Poisson's ratio
   in the {[}1 1 0] direction. Due to its non-centrosymmetric geometry and
   semiconducting characteristic, penta-CNP possesses a large spontaneous
   polarization of 4.33 x 10(-10) C/m and significant intrinsic
   piezoelectric response with d(16) = 1.80 pm/V, surpassing the previously
   reported penta-BCN because of the larger size of phosphorous atom. This
   study expands the family of 2D ternary pentagonal structures for
   piezoelectric applications.}},

Abstract = {{We study a paradigm of active learning we call cost effective active
   search, where the goal is to find a given number of positive points from
   a large unlabeled pool with minimum labeling cost. Most existing methods
   solve this problem heuristically, and few theoretical results have been
   established. Here we adopt a principled Bayesian approach for the first
   time. We first derive the Bayesian optimal policy and establish a strong
   hardness result: the optimal policy is hard to approximate, with the
   best-possible approximation ratio bounded below by Omega(n(0.16)). We
   then propose an efficient and nonmyopic policy, simulating future search
   progress using the negative Poisson binomial distribution. We propose
   simple and fast approximations for its expectation, which serves as an
   essential role in our proposed policy. We conduct comprehensive
   experiments on drug and materials discovery datasets and demonstrate
   that our proposed method is superior to a popular (greedy) baseline.}},

Abstract = {{A complete set of second and third order elastic constants of the cubic
   austenite phase in CuA/Ni shape memory alloy was determined by
   ultrasonic pulse-echo method. Because of the very high elastic
   anisotropy of the austenite phase (A = 12.02), a negative Poisson ratio
   V is obtained for loading the crystal in certain directions, e.g. nu(12)
   = nu(21) = -0.62 in the coordinate system {[}110], {[}110], {[}001].
   Measurements of the third order elastic constants were carried out in
   nine selected specimen geometries (acoustic modes). The wave velocity
   was highly sensitive to the applied stress only in two shear modes. The
   onset of the stress-induced martensitic transformation (MT) was detected
   by acoustic emission (AE), ultrasonic wave velocity and attenuation
   measurements in given order. The acoustic emission was thus the most
   sensitive acoustic method for detection of early stages of the
   transformation. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{186}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Main chain liquid crystalline polymers (MCLCP) offer strong potential to
   exhibit auxetic properties. However, the first synthesized molecules did
   not show the expected results. To address this issue, simulation
   provides an interesting advantage as it can grasp the molecular reasons
   why the auxetism is not reached, and thus it can guide the synthesis of
   successful candidates. However, the crucial step of validation is
   mandatory. In this study, we report the simulation of MCLCP at the
   coarse-grained level. Interactions are represented by an hybrid
   GayBerne/Lennard Jones (GB/LJ) potential which is particulary adapted in
   the simulation of anisotropic systems. Energies stemming from different
   configurations of pairs of ellipsoids are computed at the MP2 level, and
   are fitted using the GB potential. The methylene groups are represented
   by spheres whose interactions are depicted by the LJ potential.
   Molecular dynamics in the NPT ensemble (number of particles, pressure
   and temperature are kept constant) are thus carried out beginning at 800
   K to 375 K, by cooling the system by 25 K steps. It is shown that the
   smectic A phase emerges at about 500 K, and the smectic B phase at about
   425 K. Such mesophases occur without the use of any external stimulus.
   These findings pave the way to simulate LCP which have been specifically
   designed to potentially exhibit auxetic properties.}},

Abstract = {{The flexural vibration of nano-meter sized single layer graphene sheets
   is studied using a REBO potential based atomistic structural model for a
   wide range of graphene sheets sizes and chiralities, and with
   consideration for different boundary conditions, as well as the effects

   vibration of graphene sheets are examined and discussed. A novel
   nonlocal couple stress thin plate model is then proposed for single
   layer graphene sheet and is iteratively fitted to the earlier obtained
   atomistic results to obtain estimations of the scale effect parameters.
   In addition to the nonlocal parameter, the equivalent Poisson's ratio of
   the plate model of graphene sheet in flexure is also shown to be a scale
   effect parameter having mostly negative values. This phenomenon is
   discussed to corroborate the use of couple stress theory in developing
   the current thin plate model for graphene sheets. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{The effect of in-plane strain on monolayer InSe has been systematically
   investigated by using first-principles calculations. It is found that
   monolayer InSe exhibits superior mechanical flexibility, which can
   sustain a tensile strain up to 27\% in the armchair direction. More
   importantly, a new phase with inversion symmetry denoted as phase-II is
   obtained when the tensile strain increases over 25\% along the zigzag
   direction, which is predicted to be metallic and thermodynamically
   stable at room temperature. And the phase-II InSe could show an
   out-of-plane negative Poisson's ratio after the uniaxial tensile strain
   is larger than 5\%. Moreover, both uniaxial and biaxial compressive
   strains can trigger the indirect-to-direct band gap transition in the
   pristine monolayer InSe and its band gap decreases monotonously with the
   applied tensile strain, which offers an effective method to tune the
   electronic properties of monolayer InSe for its promising application in
   electronics and optoelectronics.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: The aim of this study was to explore factors associated with
   the perceived availability of, and reported participation in workplace
   health promotion activities implemented in the Tasmanian State Service,
   Australia. Methods: Data from 3228 employees were collected in 2013 on
   sociodemographic and work characteristics, health-related behaviors, and
   employee-reported availability of and participation in health-related
   activities. Ratios of prevalence for reported availability and
   participation by each factor were estimated using negative binomial
   regression (availability) and Poisson regression (participation).
   Results: Significant differences in availability of different activity
   types were found for numerous factors. Compared with the reference
   categories, only administrative staff or respondents reporting any
   leisure-time physical activity were more likely to participate, and
   smokers and respondents with variable work schedules or cardiometabolic
   conditions were less likely. Conclusions: Employees with suboptimal
   health-related factors were less likely to engage with activities
   offered through this comprehensive workplace health promotion
   initiative.}},

Abstract = {{This research performed a study of newly signalized intersections in
   Florida to evaluate the impacts of signalization on crashes. Crash data
   from the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) crash database were
   used. Statistical crash prediction models were developed to estimate
   average number of crashes in terms of all crashes and types of crashes
   at intersections before and after signalization. Seven predictor
   variables were finally considered for the models, which included Average
   Daily Traffic (ADT), surrounding land use, location type, number of
   lanes, posted speed, median, and shoulder type. Poisson regression and
   negative binomial regression were used during modeling. The
   goodness-of-fit of developed models were evaluated based on Pearson's
   R-square and likelihood ratio index. Furthermore, average number of
   crashes at an intersection before and after signalization could be
   estimated with the developed models given the intersection
   characteristics to determine the impacts of signalization through the
   changes of crash frequencies.}},

Title = {{Temporal evolution and spatial distribution of maternal death}},
Journal = {{REVISTA DE SAUDE PUBLICA}},

Volume = {{48}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To analyze the temporal evolution of maternal mortality and
   its spatial distribution.
   METHODS: Ecological study with a sample made up of 845 maternal deaths
   in women between 10 and 49 years, registered from 1999 to 2008 in the
   state of Rio Grande do Sul, Southern Brazil. Data were obtained from
   Information System on Mortality of Ministry of Health. The maternal
   mortality ratio and the specific maternal mortality ratio were
   calculated from records, and analyzed by the Poisson regression model.
   In the spatial distribution, three maps of the state were built with the
   rates in the geographical macro-regions, in 1999, 2003, and 2008.
   RESULTS: There was an increase of 2.0\% in the period of ten years (95\%
   CI 1.00; 1.04; p = 0.01), with no significant change in the magnitude of
   the maternal mortality ratio. The Serra macro-region presented the
   highest maternal mortality ratio (1.15, 95\% CI 1.08; 1.21; p < 0.001).
   Most deaths in Rio Grande do Sul were of white women over 40 years, with
   a lower level of education. The time of delivery/abortion and postpartum
   are times of increased maternal risk, with a greater negative impact of
   direct causes such as hypertension and bleeding.
   CONCLUSIONS: The lack of improvement in maternal mortality ratio
   indicates that public policies had no impact on women's reproductive and
   maternal health. It is needed to qualify the attention to women's
   health, especially in the prenatal period, seeking to identify and
   prevent risk factors, as a strategy of reducing maternal death.}},

Abstract = {{Rationale: National guidelines have laid out a process to conflict
   resolution in cases of potentially inappropriate medical interventions.
   Objectives: To determine the association between information about a
   process-based approach and lay public perceptions of the appropriateness
   of withholding medically inappropriate interventions.
   Methods: Respondents from a nationwide sample completed a survey with
   two adult intensive care unit-based vignettes: one about advanced cancer
   where doctors told the family that additional chemotherapy would not be
   offered, and a second case of multiorgan failure after brain hemorrhage
   where dialysis would not be offered. Participants were randomly assigned
   to see or not see information about a detailed process for the
   determination to withhold (second opinion, ethics consultation,
   exploring transfer to another institution). The primary outcome was the
   perceived appropriateness of not providing the treatment (four-point
   scale, dichotomized for analysis, modified Poisson regression), and the
   secondary outcome was the negative emotional reaction to the case
   positive and negative affect schedule, range 1-5, higher is greater
   negative emotional response, linear regression).
   Results: A total of 1,191 respondents were included. Providing detailed
   process information increased the perceived appropriateness of
   withholding treatment by approximately 10 percentage points in each
   vignette: (chemotherapy, 75.7-85.4\%; dialysis, 68.0-79.3\%). Process
   information remained associated with perceived appropriateness of
   withholding treatment after adjustment for order effects and
   prespecified respondent characteristics (chemotherapy: prevalence ratio,
   1.13; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI], 1.07-1.19) (dialysis: prevalence
   ratio, 1.17; 95\% CI, 1.10-1.25). Process information was not associated
   with emotional response to the cases (chemotherapy: beta = -0.04; 95\%
   CI, -0.16 to 0.09) (dialysis: beta = -0.02; 95\% CI, -0.14 to 0.10; both
   adjusted for order effects).
   Conclusions: Providing process-based conflict resolution information
   increased public acceptance of determinations of medical futility,
   supporting the practice outlined in national consensus statements.}},

Abstract = {{The lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) is applied to investigate the liquid
   junction potential (LJP) at an interface between two electrolyte layers.
   The Poisson equation for electrostatic field is solved to extend the
   applicable range to micro- and nanoscales in which electroneutrality
   does not hold. The LBM solutions are validated against analytical and
   finite difference method (FDM) results for evolution of concentration,
   net charge density and electrostatic potential. Noticeable separation of
   the concentration profiles of positive and negative ions occurs for
   kappa d less than 67 in simulation, where kappa is the inverse of the
   thickness of electrical double layer and d is the system length.
   Parametric study is performed for the peak potential and the time to
   reach the peak with respect to kappa d and xi which is the initial
   thickness ratio of the lower concentration to entire stream. Simple
   coding and easy parallelization will allow the LBM to make an efficient

   with a higher count of strikes, and strikes of longer duration in each
   plant. Higher tariffs on imported vehicles also had a positive effect on
   strikes. However, the ratio of exports to national production in each

Abstract = {{(Symbolic calculus and integral calculus, from Lagrange to Cauchy)
   In a paper published in the year 1774, Lagrange used methods which were
   based on the analogy of positive powers and differences, and negative
   powers and integrals, which enabled him to obtain various formulae of
   integration. Then other authors entered into this way. Problems of
   integral calculus played an important part in the development of various
   methods of symbolical calculus and this one proved his efficiency in
   this matter: it made it possible to generalize or to quickly re-find
   former results, it introduced clarity into practices of numerical
   integration, it unified procedures of integration of different types of
   linear equations, it led to the solving of new partial differential
   equations. However the notations and the foundations themselves of the
   new processes remained for a long time subjects of interrogations. In
   the 1820s, Cauchy provided an answer in accordance with his conception
   of rigour: by using Fourier's integral formula, he gave the symbols of
   operation a precise meaning, and thus he dealt with the different types
   of linear equations with constant coefficients.}},

Abstract = {{The High-Resolution Research Tomograph (HRRT) is a dedicated human brain
   positron emission tomography ( PET) scanner. Recently, a 3D filtered
   backprojection (3D-FBP) reconstruction method has been implemented to
   reduce bias in short duration frames, currently observed in 3D ordinary
   Poisson OSEM (3D-OP-OSEM) reconstructions. Further improvements might be
   expected using a new method of variance reduction on randoms (VRR) based
   on coincidence histograms instead of using the delayed window technique
   (DW) to estimate randoms. The goal of this study was to evaluate VRR in
   combination with 3D-OP-OSEM and 3D-FBP reconstruction techniques. To
   this end, several phantom studies and a human brain study were
   performed. For most phantom studies, 3D-OP-OSEM showed higher accuracy
   of observed activity concentrations with VRR than with DW. However, both
   positive and negative deviations in reconstructed activity
   concentrations and large biases of grey to white matter contrast ratio
   (up to 88\%) were still observed as a function of scan statistics.
   Moreover 3D-OP-OSEM+VRR also showed bias up to 64\% in clinical data,
   i.e. in some pharmacokinetic parameters as compared with those obtained
   with 3D-FBP+VRR. In the case of 3D-FBP, VRR showed similar results as DW
   for both phantom and clinical data, except that VRR showed a better
   standard deviation of 6 -10\%. Therefore, VRR should be used to correct
   for randoms in HRRT PET studies.}},

Title = {{Poroelastic relaxation indentation of whey protein hydrogels}},
Journal = {{FOOD HYDROCOLLOIDS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{B}},

Abstract = {{Many solid food matrices contain high amounts of solvent, typically
   water, yet the time dependent mechanical characterization of foods has
   typically been analyzed following a viscoelastic approach, omitting the
   effect of the solvent. In solvent rich solids the solvent can flow
   internally, for example as it is compressed, which is typically
   understood using poroelastic theory. A poroelastic approach allows the
   determination of hydrogel parameters, such as the Darcy's diffusivity or
   the intrinsic permeability, that have a physical meaning. Recently, it
   has been proposed for polymeric hydrogels a novel experimental
   methodology, based on relaxation after indentation, that greatly
   simplifies the poroelastic analysis. This methodology is applied and
   tested to heat induced whey protein hydrogels. Finite element analysis
   was performed to simulate the particularities of the indentation
   experiments. Relaxation data suggest, after a pure poroelastic analysis,
   that there is also a small fast viscoelastic relaxation in whey protein
   hydrogels. Poroviscoelastic relaxation was simulated with finite
   elements modeling, and a forward regression methodology was implemented.
   Results show that the water diffusivity in the protein hydrogels is
   larger that the self-diffusivity of water, as expected in a matrix with
   large pores where solvent flow occurs by convection. Whey protein
   hydrogels swollen to different degrees using different salt
   concentrations relaxed to different proportions. This result was
   unexpected as it leads, in poroelastic theory, to different drained
   Poisson's ratio, with even negative values for the less swollen gels.

   Mechanical Properties}},
Journal = {{ADVANCED MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Origami, the ancient Japanese art of paper folding, is not only an
   inspiring technique to create sophisticated shapes, but also a
   surprisingly powerful method to induce nonlinear mechanical properties.
   Over the last decade, advances in crease design, mechanics modeling, and
   scalable fabrication have fostered the rapid emergence of architected
   origami materials. These materials typically consist of folded origami
   sheets or modules with intricate 3D geometries, and feature many unique
   and desirable material properties like auxetics, tunable nonlinear
   stiffness, multistability, and impact absorption. Rich designs in
   origami offer great freedom to design the performance of such origami
   materials, and folding offers a unique opportunity to efficiently
   fabricate these materials at vastly different sizes. Here, recent
   studies on the different aspects of origami materials-geometric design,
   mechanics analysis, achieved properties, and fabrication techniques-are
   highlighted and the challenges ahead discussed. The synergies between
   these different aspects will continue to mature and flourish this
   promising field.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives:A large portion of anogenital cancers is caused by high-risk
   human papillomavirus (hrHPV) infections, which are especially common in
   HIV-infected men. We aimed to compare the incidence and clearance of
   anal and penile hrHPV infection between HIV-infected and HIV-negative
   MSM.Design:Analyses of longitudinal data from a prospective cohort
   study.Methods:MSM aged 18 years or older were recruited in Amsterdam,
   the Netherlands, and followed-up semi-annually for 24 months. At each
   visit, participants completed risk-factor questionnaires. Anal and
   penile self-samples were tested for HPV DNA using the SPF10-PCR
   DEIA/LiPA(25) system. Effects on incidence and clearance rates were
   quantified via Poisson regression, using generalized estimating
   equations to correct for multiple hrHPV types.Results:Seven hundred and
   fifty MSM with a median age of 40 years (interquartile 35-48) were
   included in the analyses, of whom 302 (40\%) were HIV-infected. The
   incidence rates of hrHPV were significantly higher in HIV-infected
   compared with HIV-negative MSM {[}adjusted incidence rate ratio (aIRR)
   1.6; 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.3-2.1 for anal and aIRR 1.4; 95\%CI
   1.0-2.1 for penile infection]. The clearance rate of hrHPV was
   significantly lower for anal {[}adjusted clearance rate ratio (aCRR)
   0.7; 95\%CI 0.6-0.9], but not for penile infection (aCRR 1.3; 95\%CI
   1.0-1.7). HrHPV incidence or clearance did not differ significantly by
   nadir CD4(+) cell count.Conclusion:Increased anal and penile hrHPV
   incidence rates and decreased anal hrHPV clearance rates were found in
   HIV-infected compared with HIV-negative MSM, after adjusting for sexual
   behavior. Our findings suggest an independent effect of HIV infection on
   anal hrHPV infections. Copyright (C) 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{30}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, thermoelastic and free vibration responses of hybrid
   Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) and E-glass fiber-reinforced composites are
   investigated using finite element analysis. We consider four composites
   for analysis and comparison of performances, (1) single layer SMA
   fiber-reinforced hybrid composite (unimorph SMAHC), (2) a two-layer
   (cross-ply) SMA fiber-reinforced hybrid composite (bimorph SMAHC), (3)
   single layer SMA fiber-reinforced with a honeycomb core, and (4) single
   layer SMA fiber-reinforced with reentrant-honeycomb or auxetic core. We
   analyze the bending response of all the aforementioned composite
   structures, focusing on the bimorph anticlastic and synclastic bending
   with negative and positive Gaussian curvatures, respectively. The
   uniqueness of this work is utilizing the shape memory effect of the SMA
   fibers to achieve active shape control of low-stiffness and lightweight
   auxetic composite structures. We investigated the free vibration
   response and analyzed the effect of the fiber volume fraction and the
   fiber orientation angle on the natural frequency of the system. Further,
   the role of the reentrant angle and stiffness of honeycomb struts on the
   overall effective mechanical properties of the ply is also studied.
   Results confirm the non-linearity of the parametric combination and the
   importance of optimization of these parameters for improved Gaussian
   curvature. The findings are envisaged to be useful for the design of
   lightweight rigidizable space structures and tensairity structures.}},

Abstract = {{Usual lightweight soft robotic bodies built with elastomer materials
   show lack of structural stiffness that limits their use in many
   practical applications. Herein, an architectured robotic body design
   with deformable cellular structures, which is easy to fabricate,
   lightweight, mechanically durable, and compliant while maintaining its
   resilience, is proposed. The cellular body design overcomes not only the
   stiffness limitation but also other drawbacks of most common soft bodies
   that may damage from high pressure or impact. An artificial cellular
   finger is printed together with embedded pressure sensors on the
   fingertip to form a functional system in a single-building process with
   the advantage of multi-material 3D printing. The integrated
   architectured grippers, composed of cellular fingers with a repeatable,
   reliable bending profile, demonstrate maximum gripping force as 16N on
   actuation, with gripping capability of various objects. 3D cellular
   designs open up new possibilities for architectured robotic bodies that

Abstract = {{Recent research has established the effectiveness of sandwich structures
   with metallic cellular cores for blast mitigation. The choice of core
   architecture can enhance sandwich performance, dissipating energy
   through plastic core compression and exploiting fluid-structure
   interaction effects to reduce the momentum imparted to the structure by
   the blast. In this paper we describe the first analysis of a novel
   sandwich core concept for blast mitigation: the stacked folded core. The
   core consists of an alternating stacked sequence of folded sheets in the
   Miura (double-corrugated) pattern, with the stack oriented such that the
   folding kinematics define the out-of plane compressive strength of the
   core. It offers a number of distinct characteristics compared to
   existing cellular cores. (i) The kinematics of collapse of the core by a
   distinctive folding mechanism give it unique mechanical properties,
   including strong anisotropy. (ii) The fold pattern and stacking
   arrangement is extremely versatile, offering exceptional freedom to
   tailor the mechanical properties of the core. This includes freedom to
   grade the core properties through progressive changes in the fold
   pattern. (iii) Continuous manufacturing processes have been established
   for the Miura folded sheets which make up the core. The design is
   therefore potentially more straightforward and economical to manufacture
   than other metallic cellular materials. In this first investigation of
   the stacked folded core, finite element analysis is used to investigate
   its characteristics under both quasi-static and dynamic loading. A
   dynamic analysis of an impulsively loaded sandwich beam with a stacked
   folded core reveals the versatility of the concept for blast mitigation.
   By altering the fold pattern alone, the durations of key phases of the
   dynamic sandwich response (core compression, beam bending) can be
   controlled. By altering both fold pattern and sheet thickness in the
   core, the same is achieved without altering the density of the core or
   the mass distribution of the sandwich beam. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Experimental study on the damage of hexagonal honeycombs under in plane
   shear loading does not appear to be available in the literature. In this
   paper, shear damage behaviors of five different hexagonal mesostructures
   are investigated with rapid prototyped polycarbonate (PC) honeycomb
   coupon samples and proper design of a fixture for shear loading.
   Effective shear stress-strain curves of PC honeycomb coupons are
   generated for each shear test and the corresponding local cell wall
   failure is investigated. Two different failure modes of PC honeycombs
   were observed primarily depending on the cell wall thickness: The PC
   honeycombs having a lower cell wall thickness induce the plastic post
   buckling, resulting in preventing propagation of initial cracks through
   the cell wall end up with higher plastic load bearing. On the other
   hand, the failure mode of the honeycombs having a high cell wall
   thickness is the cell wall fracture by crack propagation through wall
   without severe buckling.}},

Abstract = {{Background This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of negative
   impacts of oral health conditions on the quality of life ofquilombolaand
   non-quilombolarural adolescents and identify associated factors. Methods
   This cross-sectional study was carried out in a rural area in the
   countryside of Bahia, Brazil, in 2015. Participants were asked to
   complete the Oral Impacts on Daily Performance Questionnaire. Prevalence
   and prevalence ratios (PR) were estimated together with their respective
   95\% confidence intervals. Multiple analysis was conducted using Poisson
   regression with robust error variance and hierarchical entry of
   variables. Results Of the 390 rural adolescents who took part in the
   study, 42.8\% werequilombolas, and 45.6\% of all participants reported a
   negative impact of their oral health conditions on their quality of
   life. The most prevalent impact was difficulty eating (32.6\%). After
   adjusted analysis, the following factors were found to be associated
   with the negative impact of oral health conditions on quality of life:
   age (PR = 1.04), feeling lonely (PR = 1.42), worst evaluation of oral
   health (PR = 1.52), need of dental care (PR = 1.33), and occurrence of
   toothache in the last 6 months (PR = 1.83).Quilombolasand
   non-quilombolaspresented with a different prevalence of discomfort when
   brushing their teeth and had different factors associated with the
   negative impact of oral health conditions on their quality of life.
   Bothquilombolaand non-quilombolarural adolescents showed a high
   prevalence of negative impact of oral health conditions on their quality
   of life. Conclusions These results support the need for improved oral
   healthcare for specific populations like thequilombolas. Furthermore,
   the results illustrate the importance of incorporating oral healthcare
   strategies that take into consideration the sociocultural context of
   adolescents.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Male circumcision is associated with reduced HIV
   acquisition.
   Methods: HIV acquisition was determined in a cohort of 5507 HIV-negative
   Ugandan men, and in 187 HIV-negative men in discordant relationships.
   Transmission was determined in 223 HIV-positive men with HIV-negative
   partners. HIV incidence per 100 person years (py) and adjusted rate
   ratios (RR) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated by Poisson
   regression. HIV-1 serum viral load was determined for the seropositive
   partners in HIV-discordant couples.
   Results: The prevalence of circumcision was 16.5\% fbr all men; 99.1\%
   in Muslims and 3.7\% in non-Muslims. Circumcision was significantly
   associated with reduced HIV acquisition in the cohort as a whole (RR
   0.53, CI 0.33-0.87), but not among non-Muslim men. Prepubertal
   circumcision significantly reduced HIV acquisition (RR 0.49, CI
   0.26-0.82), but postpubertal circumcision did not. In discordant couples
   with HIV-negative men, no serconversions occurred in 50 circumcised men,
   whereas HIV acquisition was 16.7 per 100 py in uncircumcised men (P =
   0.004). In couples with HIV-positive men, HIV transmission was
   significantly reduced in circumcised men with HIV viral loads less than
   50 000 copies/ml (P = 0.02).
   Interpretation: Prepubertal circumcision may reduce male HIV acquisition
   in a general population, but the protective effects are confounded by
   cultural and behavioral factors in Muslims. In discordant couples,
   circumcision reduces HIV acquisition and transmission. The assessment of
   circumcision for HIV prevention is complex and requires randomized
   trials. (C) 2000 Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins.}},

   used to design 3D models is so symmetrical that the axial properties of
   it are equivalent, so we have only focused on geometry features. In this
   work, an extended study is conducted in order to find a more efficient
   method to design 3D structures with evident negative compressibility.
   Through theoretical modeling, the compressibility properties of three 3D
   models made from hinging hexagonal truss mechanism are analyzed and the
   conditions for negative compressibility to be exhibited are discussed.
   The study shows that in addition to the geometry features, negative
   compressibility effects can also be significantly affected by the
   arrangement of the framework and layout orientations of 2D mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To evaluate the prevalence of signs and symptoms of
   temporomandibular disorders (TMD) in children and the impact on their
   oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL).
   Methods: Data were collected by means of a questionnaire to evaluate the
   presence of TMD symptoms in eight to 10-year-old children. For those who
   answered at least one of the four questions in a positive manner, a
   clinical exam was done to confirm the diagnosis. The Child Perceptions
   Questionnaire (CPQ8-10) was applied to evaluate the OHRQoL. Poisson
   regression was used to associate the total scores and individual domains
   of the CPQ8-10 with sociodemographic factors and clinical conditions.
   Results: A total of 245 children participated in this cross-sectional
   study. One hundred and twenty-one (49.4 percent) were diagnosed with
   TMD; 57.9 percent were females and 42.1 percent were males. Children
   with a diagnosis of disc displacement with reduction had a negative
   impact on the domain of functional limitations (rate ratio=2.61, 95

Abstract = {{Background: Injection drug users (IDUs) have estimated mortality rates
   over 10 times higher than the general population; much of this excess
   mortality is HIV-associated. Few mortality estimates among IDUs from
   developing countries, including India, exist.
   Methods: IDUs (1158) were recruited in Chennai from April 2005 to May
   2006; 293 were HIV positive. Information on deaths and causes was
   obtained through outreach workers and family/network members. Mortality
   rates and standardized mortality ratios were calculated; multivariate
   Poisson regression was used to identify predictors of mortality.
   Results: We observed 85 deaths over 1998 person-years (p-y) of follow-up
   {[}mortality rate (MR) 4.25 per 100 p-y; 95\%. confidence interval (CI)
   = 3.41-5.23]. The overall standardized mortality ratio was 11.1; for
   HIV-positive IDUs, the standardized mortality ratio was 23.9. Mortality
   risk among HIV-positive IDUs (MR: 8.88 per 100 p-y) was nearly three
   times that of negative IDUs (MR: 3.03 per 100 p-y) and increased with
   declining immune status (CD4 cells > 350: 5.44 per 100 p-y vs. CD4 cells
   <= 200: 34.5 per 100 p-y). This association persisted after adjustment
   for confounders. The leading causes of mortality in both HIV negative
   and positive IDUs were overdose (n = 22), AIDS (n = 14), tuberculosis (n
   = 8) and accident/trauma (n = 9).
   Conclusion: Substantial mortality was observed in this cohort with the
   highest rates among HIV-positive IDUs with CD4 counts of less than 350
   cells/mu l. Although, in these 2 years, non-AIDS deaths outnumbered
   AIDS-related deaths, the relative contribution of AIDS-associated
   mortality is likely to increase with advancing HIV disease progression.
   These data reinforce the need for interventions to reduce the harms
   associated with drug use and increase HAART access among IDUs in
   Chennai. (C) 2009 Wolters Kluwer Health vertical bar Lippincott Williams

   perceptions of parents/caregivers regarding the oral health of
   individuals with DS. Parents/caregivers completed a questionnaire
   containing sociodemographic information and answered the 20 questions of
   the Brazilian version of the Oral Health Scale for People with DS.
   Intra-oral clinical exam of children/adolescents was performed to assess
   dental caries, periodontal disease, and malocclusion. Descriptive
   statistics, bivariate analyses, and Poisson regression model analyses
   were carried out. Results Conclusion In this study, 55.1\% of the
   parents/caregivers showed a positive perception regarding the oral
   health of their children/adolescents. Parents/caregivers of individuals
   between 4 and 9 years old (Prevalence Ratio (PR) = 1.13; Confidence
   Interval (CI), 1.04 - 1.23; p = 0.003) and parents/caregivers of those
   with definite malocclusion (PR = 1.14; CI, 1.00 - 1.31; p = 0.047) had a
   higher prevalence of reporting a more negative perception of their
   children's/adolescents' oral health. DS individuals' age and the
   severity of malocclusion were indicators of a more negative perception
   of parents/caregivers regarding their sons'/daughters' oral health.}},

Title = {{Modeling of the effect of local material imperfection to the structural
   mechanical property variability of 2D fi nite -size cellular structures}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{262}},
Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{Understanding the effect of local material property fluctuation on the
   overall structural properties of cellular structures is not only
   important for more effective designs, but also critical for their
   adoption in load bearing applications. In this work, an analytical
   modeling approach based on direct stiffness method was adopted, which
   allows for the implementation of heterogeneous material imperfection at
   full-scale cellular structure level. Three representative 2D cellular
   designs including auxetic, diamond and triangular structures were
   modeled and analyzed. The material property imperfection was represented
   by 3 levels of variabilities (2\%, 5\% and 10\%) for both elastic
   modulus and strength, defined at local cellular element level.
   Experimental verification using Ti6Al4V cellular structures fabricated
   via laser powder bed fusion additive manufacturing demonstrated the
   potential of the established model in providing accurate predictions to
   the mechanical property variability of the cellular structures. In
   addition, the results also revealed new insights into the
   topology-material imperfection coupling relationships for the cellular
   structures. The auxetic structures exhibit the lowest material
   imperfection tolerance, whereas the stretching-dominated triangular
   structures exhibit the highest material imperfection sensitivity. The
   contribution of elastic modulus and ultimate strength imperfections at
   material level to the overall structural performance were established.
   Ultimately, this work could help ?re-establishing? the fundamental
   understanding of design factors for finite-size cellular structures with
   imperfect material properties.}},

Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{38}},
Pages = {{7569-7576}},
Abstract = {{Open structures can display a number of unusual properties, including a
   negative Poisson's ratio, negative thermal expansion, and holographic
   elasticity, and have many interesting applications in engineering.
   However, it is a grand challenge to self-assemble open structures at the
   colloidal scale, where short-range interactions and low coordination
   number can leave them mechanically unstable. In this paper we discuss
   the self-assembly of three-dimensional open structures using triblock
   Janus particles, which have two large attractive patches that can form
   multiple bonds, separated by a band with purely hard-sphere repulsion.
   Such surface patterning leads to open structures that are stabilized by
   orientational entropy (in an order-by-disorder effect) and selected over
   close-packed structures by vibrational entropy. For different patch
   sizes the particles can form into either tetrahedral or octahedral
   structural motifs which then compose open lattices, including the
   pyrochlore, the hexagonal tetrastack and the perovskite lattices. Using
   an analytic theory, we examine the phase diagrams of these possible open
   and close-packed structures for triblock Janus particles and
   characterize the mechanical properties of these structures. Our theory
   leads to rational designs of particles for the self-assembly of
   three-dimensional colloidal structures that are possible using current
   experimental techniques.}},

Volume = {{111}},

Abstract = {{Results derived from exact linear homogeneous elastodynamic theory are
   used for two-dimensional unloaded plates in order to understand certain
   features generated by proper symmetric Lamb modes. It is shown that S,
   modes for all elastic materials have a phase velocity defined below the
   usual critical frequency and which initially exhibits anomalous
   dispersion (has a negative slope with respect to frequency). Over a
   certain range, it has a phase velocity that is double valued. In
   addition, there are an infinite number of proper symmetric Lamb modes
   that have this characteristic for materials with a Poisson ratio equal
   to 1/3. It also appears that all A(3n) modes are anomalous when V(L)less
   than or equal to2V(T). The cause and implication of these effects are
   examined, including an associated negative group velocity over a small
   frequency zone for these modes. Further, it is noted that all proper
   symmetric Lamb modes have a plateau region in phase velocity with
   respect to wave number. It is shown that this always occurs for a phase
   velocity corresponding to the longitudinal bulk velocity of the elastic
   material. These issues are examined along with how one may obtain
   material parameters and possibly plate thickness from their dispersion
   curves. (C) 2002 Acoustical Society of America.}},

Abstract = {{The main objective of this paper is to reinvestigate the impacts of
   non-tariff measures (NTMs) on bilateral exports among Regional
   Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) countries. The study adds to
   the literature in two areas. First, we calculate coverage ratios for
   NTMs related to specific sustainable development goals (SDGs) imposed on
   bilateral trade between RCEP member countries. Second, to avoid
   aggregation bias, the analysis covers four major sectors, namely
   agrifood, health, logistics, and other manufacturing. The results of a
   Poisson pseudo maximum likelihood (PPML) regression in a gravity model,
   using average import data from 2016 to 2018 at the Harmonized Commodity
   Description and Coding Systems (HS) two-digit level (97 subsectors),
   show that the effects of SDG-related NTMs vary by sector. NTMs related
   to SDG 3 (good health and well-being) distort trade in health but
   enhance trade in logistics. NTMs related to SDG 12 (responsible
   consumption and production) have a negative impact on logistics but a
   positive impact on other manufacturing exports. The findings provide new
   perspectives on the varying impacts of SDG-related NTMs on trade.
   Interestingly, the study finds that NTMs addressing SDGs 3 and 12 have
   positive trade impacts. Policymakers should, however, regulate NTM
   implementation, to minimize negative impacts and ensure that domestic
   firms comply to promote sustainable production.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To test the association between maternal perception about
   child's oral health and child dental caries experience and maternal
   self-perception about oral health. Materials and methods: A
   cross-sectional study was performed with mothers and their children aged
   six to 13 years. A questionnaire was applied to mothers. Children were
   dentally examined using the DMF-T/dmf-t Index. For analysis, Poisson
   regression models with robust variance were employed for each variable
   of interest (child dental caries experience and maternal self-report
   about oral health). Magnitudes of associations were estimated through
   Prevalence Ratio (PR) as effect measure with 95\% confidence intervals
   (CI). A significant level of p <= .05 was adopted. Results: Overall, 131
   mothers-children dyads were included. Most of children were girls
   (52.7\%) and aged between 10 to 13 years (60.3\%). Negative maternal
   perception about child's oral health was associated to maternal negative
   self-perception about oral health (PR 2.54; 95\%CI 1.54-4.30) and to
   higher child dental caries experience (PR 2.21; 95\%CI 1.41-3.47).
   Conclusion: Maternal perception about child oral health was associated
   to child dental caries and to maternal self-report about oral health.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection causes genital warts,
   penile cancer and cervical cancer. Africa has one of the highest rates
   of penile and cervical cancers, but there are little data on high-risk
   human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) prevalence in heterosexual men. Knowledge
   of HR-HPV prevalence, risk factors and genotype distribution among
   heterosexual men is important to establish risk-reduction prevention
   strategies.
   Methods 1578 uncircumcised men aged 15-49 years who enrolled in male
   circumcision trials in Rakai, Uganda, were evaluated for HR-HPV from
   swabs of the coronal sulcus/glans using Roche HPV Linear Array. Adjusted
   prevalence risk ratios (adjPRRs) were estimated using modified Poisson
   multivariable regression.
   Results HPV prevalence (either high risk or low risk) was 90.7\%
   (382/421) among HIV-positive men and 60.9\% (596/978) among HIV-negative
   men (PRR 1.49, 95\% CI 1.40 to 1.58). HIV-positive men had a
   significantly higher risk of infection with three or more HR-HPV
   genotypes (PRR = 5.76, 95\% CI 4.27 to 7.79). Among HIV-positive men,
   high-risk sexual behaviours were not associated with increased HR-HPV
   prevalence. Among HIV-negative men, HR-HPV prevalence was associated
   with self-reported genital warts (adjPRR 1.57, 95\% CI 1.07 to 2.31).
   Among all men (both HIV negative and HIV positive), HR-HPV prevalence
   was associated with more than 10 lifetime sexual partners (adjPRR 1.30,
   95\% CI 1.01 to 1.66), consistent condom use (adjPRR 1.31, 95\% CI 1.08
   to 1.60) and HIV infection (adjPRR 1.80, 95\% CI 1.60 to 2.02). HR-HPV
   prevalence was lower among men who reported no sexual partners during
   the past year (adjPRR 0.47, 95\% CI 0.23 to 0.94).
   Conclusion The burden of HR-HPV infection is high among heterosexual men
   in sub-Saharan Africa and most pronounced among the HIV-infected
   individuals.}},

Abstract = {{The crystal structure, elastic properties and the Raman spectrum of the
   layered calcium uranyl silicate pentahydrate mineral uranophane-beta,
   Ca(UO2)(2)Si2O6(OH)(2)center dot 5H(2)O, are studied by means of
   first-principles solid-state methods and compared with the corresponding
   information for the alpha polymorph. The availability of the energy
   optimized full crystal structure of uranophane-beta, including the
   positions of the hydrogen atoms, made possible the computation of its
   elastic properties and the Raman spectrum by using the theoretical
   methodology. An extended set of relevant mechanical data is reported.
   Uranophane-beta is shown to be a weak and ductile mineral and,
   consequenty, is mechanically very different from the alpha polymorph
   which is a hard and brittle material. Uranophane-beta exhibits the
   important negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) and negative linear
   compressibility (NLC) phenomena. The experimental Raman spectrum of
   uranophane-beta obtained from a natural mineral sample from pegmatite
   Perus, Sao Paulo, Brazil, is compared with the spectrum determined
   theoretically. Since both spectra are in very good agreement, the
   theoretical methods are employed to assign the Raman spectrum. Three
   weak bands of the experimental spectrum of this mineral, located at the
   wavenumbers 2302, 2128 and 2042 cm(-1), are identified as combination
   bands. The Raman spectrum of uranophane-beta is also compared with that
   of the alpha polymorph. While they are rather similar, a detailed
   analysis reveals a significant number of differences. Finally, the
   relative thermodynamic stability of the alpha and beta polymorphs is
   evaluated. The alpha polymorph is more stable than the beta polymorph at
   zero pressure and temperature by -12.0 kJ mol(-1).}},

Abstract = {{Purpose
   To explore the relationship of HIV, hepatitis C (HCV), and alcohol
   abuse/dependence to risk for hepatocellular carcinoma and non-Hodgkin's
   lymphoma (NHL).
   Patients and Methods
   Male veterans ( n = 14,018) with a first HIV diagnosis in the Veterans
   Affairs Healthcare System from October 1997 to September 2004; and
   28,036 age-, race-, sex-, and location-matched HIV-negative veterans
   were identified. We examined the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma
   and NHL and presence of HCV and alcohol abuse/dependence using
   International Classification of Diseases, ninth revision (ICD-9-CM)
   codes. HIV-positive to HIV-negative incident rate ratios (IRRs) and 95\%
   CIs for the occurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma and NHL were
   calculated using Poisson regression models.
   Results
   HIV-positive veterans were at greater risk for hepatocellular carcinoma
   than HIV-negative veterans (IRR = 1.68; 95\% CI, 1.02 to 2.77). After
   adjusting for HCV infection and alcohol abuse/ dependence, HIV status
   was not independently associated with hepatocellular cancer ( IRR =
   0.96; 95\% CI, 0.56 to 1.63). HIV-positive veterans had 9.71 times (
   95\% CI, 6.99 to 13.49) greater risk of NHL than HIV-negative veterans.
   After adjusting for HCV and alcohol abuse/ dependence, the IRR for NHL
   comparing HIV-positive with HIV-negative veterans is similar ( IRR =
   10.03, 95\% CI, 7.19 to 13.97).
   Conclusion
   HIV-positive veterans have a higher relative incidence of hepatocellular
   carcinoma and NHL than HIV-negative veterans. For hepatocellular
   carcinoma, this association appears to be largely explained by the
   higher prevalence of HCV and alcohol abuse/ dependence. Efforts to
   decrease hepatocellular carcinoma among persons with HIV should focus
   primarily on detecting and treating HCV and reducing heavy alcohol use.}},

Month = {{FEB 14}},
Abstract = {{Introducing architected cuts is an attractive and simple approach to
   tune mechanical behaviors of planar materials like thin films for
   desirable or enhanced mechanical performance. However, little has been
   studied on the effects of architected cuts on functional materials like
   piezoelectric materials. We investigated how architected cut patterns
   affect mechanical and piezoelectric properties of polyvinylidene
   fluoride thin films by numerical, experimental, and analytical studies.
   Our results show that thin films with architected cuts can provide
   desired mechanical features like enhanced compliance, stretchability,
   and controllable Poisson's ratio and resonance frequency, while
   maintaining piezoelectric performance under static loadings. Moreover,
   we could observe maximum; 30\% improvement in piezoelectric conversion
   efficiency under dynamic loadings and harvest energy from low frequency
   (<100 Hz) mechanical signals or low velocity (<5 m/s) winds, which are
   commonly existing in ambient environment. Using architected cuts doesn't
   require changing the material or overall dimensions, making it
   attractive for applications in self-powered devices with design
   constraints.}},

   has the potential to develop novel lab-on-a-chip devices (LOCs) for a

   describes a broad family of fabrication methods that typically employ

   multi-length scales. This review focuses on light-assisted direct-write
   fabrication for generating 3D functional scaffolds with precise
   micro-and nano-architecture, using both synthetic as well as naturally
   derived biomaterials. Two bioprinting approaches are discussed in detail
   - projection printing and laser-based systems - where each method is
   capable of modulating multiple scaffold parameters, such as 3D
   architecture, mechanical properties (e. g. stiffness), Poisson's ratio,
   chemical gradients, biological cell distributions, and porosity. The
   light-assisted direct-writing techniques described in this review
   provide the reader with alternative approaches to fabricate 3D

Abstract = {{Among the options to control Alabama argillacea (Hubner, 1818) and
   Heliothis virescens (Fabricius, 1781) on cotton, insecticide spraying
   and biological control have been extensively used. The GM `Bt' cotton
   has been introduced as an extremely viable alternative, but it is yet
   not known how transgenic plants affect populations of organisms that are
   interrelated in an agroecosystem. For this reason, it is important to
   know how the spatial arrangement of pests and beneficial insect are
   affected, which may call for changes in the methods used for sampling
   these species. This study was conducted with the goal to investigate the
   pattern of spatial distribution of eggs of A. argillacea and H.
   virescens in DeltaOpal (TM) (non-Bt) and DP90B (TM) Bt cotton cultivars.
   Data were collected during the agricultural year 2006/2007 in two areas
   of 5,000 m(2), located in in the district of Nova America, Caarapo
   municipality. In each sampling area, comprising 100 plots of 50 m(2), 15
   evaluations were performed on two plants per plot. The sampling
   consisted in counting the eggs. The aggregation index (variance/mean
   ratio, Morisita index and exponent k of the negative binomial
   distribution) and chi-square fit of the observed and expected values to
   the theoretical frequency distribution (Poisson, Binomial and Negative
   Binomial Positive), showed that in both cultivars, the eggs of these
   species are distributed according to the aggregate distribution model,
   fitting the pattern of negative binomial distribution.}},

Abstract = {{Positron emission tomography (PET) is a widely used imaging modality in
   clinical environment and research studies. In clinical, long-scanned
   dynamic PET is usually adopted for an acceptable image quality with
   increasing radioactive risk. Therefore, low-dose PET (LdPET) has
   attracted much attention, recently model-based image reconstruction
   (MBIR) and convolutional neural network (CNN) have been demonstrated the
   efficiency of noise reduction. In this study, we employed a deep
   learning based Poisson negative log-likelihood problem to model the
   physical PET imaging. Following that, model was solved and split into
   three sub-problems by Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM)
   algorithm with convergence guarantee. Then multiple ADMM iterations were
   mapped in a deep network architecture for optimizing each sub-problem,
   i.e., reconstruction, nonlinear and multiplier modules, dubbed as
   ADMM-net. For data acquisition, human brain data was acquired. In
   training phase, data pairs of Poisson down sampled sinogram and
   full-dose MLEM reconstructed image were used as network input and ground
   truth. The learnable parameters were optimized by minimizing the loss
   function of normalized mean square error (NMSE) using Adam. In order to
   demonstrate the generalization ability of proposed network, we trained
   network with 2D data pairs and tested it with sinograms. Moreover,
   different down sampling ratio were applied in training and testing. In
   results, our proposed ADMM-net outperformed the traditional EM
   reconstruction and existing algorithms for LdPET, such as nonlocal mean
   (NLM) and TV regularized methods in terms of MSE, as well as improved
   the computational speed.}},

   examples exist in which the low strain rate mechanical responses of
   materials have been tailored, extensions to dynamic, high strain rate,
   large strain conditions have been scarcely explored. Here, we present
   the results of traditional plate impact methods applied to organized
   polymer architectures, using velocimetry and X-ray phase contrast
   imaging at the Advanced Photon Source. These methods allowed for the
   characterization of the mechanisms of shock wave propagation,
   localization, and compaction in the structures. In particular, we have
   investigated the role of interfaces on stress localization within the
   structures. The experimental results will be discussed in the context of
   finite element simulations of the same structures, including progress on
   topological optimization for desired dynamic response.}},

Abstract = {{In this research, the various physical properties of Nb-doped SrFeO3
   were investigated using the density functional theory (DFT), which was
   not experimentally investigated and reported in the previous literature.
   This is the first detailed theoretical study about these properties of
   this doped system. The calculated lattice parameters exhibited excellent
   conformity with the experimental data. In addition, the structural and
   mechanical stability of the studied compound was confirmed by the
   negative value of formation enthalpy and elastic constants (fulfilled
   the Born stability criteria), respectively. The metallic nature of
   SrFe0.5Nb0.5O3 was revealed by their band structure and the density of
   states. A strong hybridization was observed among Fe-3d, Nb-4p, and O-2p
   states at the Fermi level, reflecting the covalent bonding of Fe/Nb-O.
   Furthermore, the mechanical properties including the elastic moduli,
   Poisson ratio, Pugh's ratio, hardness, and machinability index of
   SrFe1-xNbxO3 (x=0.4, 0.5, and 0.6), were also studied in depth, and
   showed considerable effects of doping. Finally, a high level of
   anisotropy was noticed for SrFe0.5Nb0.5O3. Therefore, our simulation
   output clearly illustrated the influence of Nb doping in the theoretical
   results of the physical properties of the presently studied strontium
   ferrite.}},

Abstract = {{Aims This study explores the differences in sickness absence trends in
   women according to reproductive age group and medical diagnoses. Methods
   Data were obtained from two administrative registries: the Continuous
   Working Life Sample and the Catalonian Institute of Medical Evaluations
   from 2012 to 2014, containing 47,879 female employees. Incidence rates
   and incidence risk ratios derived from Poisson and negative binomial
   models were calculated to compare sickness absence trends among
   reproductive age groups based on Catalonian birthrates:
   early-reproductive (25-34 years old), middle-reproductive (35-44) and
   late-reproductive (45-54), according to diagnostic groups, selected
   diseases, type of contract, occupational category, and country of
   origin. Results Younger women show a higher incidence of overall
   sickness absence compared to late-reproductive-aged women. Incidence
   risk ratios of sickness absence decreased significantly from
   early-reproductive to late-reproductive age for low back pain,
   hemorrhage in early pregnancy, nausea and vomiting, and abdominal and
   pelvic pain. Discussion The higher incidence of sickness absence due to
   pregnancy-related health conditions in early-reproductive women compared
   to other reproductive age groups, may explain the sickness absence
   differences by age in women. Proper management of sickness absence
   related to pregnancy should be a goal to reduce the sickness absence gap
   between younger and older women.}},

Title = {{Assessing remedies for missing weekly individual exposure in sport
   injury studies}},
Journal = {{INJURY PREVENTION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{177-182}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Background In sport injury epidemiology research, the injury incidence
   rate (IR) is defined as the number of injuries over a given length of
   participation time (exposure, eg, game hours). However, it is common
   that individual weekly exposure is missing due to requirements of
   personnel at every game to record exposure information. Ignoring this
   issue will lead to an inflated injury rate because the total exposure
   serves as the denominator of IR, where the number of injury cases were
   captured accurately.
   Purpose This paper used data collected from a large community cohort
   study in youth ice hockey as an example, and compared six methods to
   handle missing weekly exposure of individual players.
   Methods The six methods to handle missing weekly exposures include
   available case analysis, last observation carried forward, mean
   imputation, multiple imputation, bootstrapping and best/worst case
   analysis. To estimate injury rate ratios (IRRs) between Alberta and
   Quebec, as in the original study, three statistical models were applied
   to the imputed datasets: Poisson, zeroinflated Poisson and negative
   binomial regression models.
   Results The final sample for imputation included 2098 players for whom
   12.5\% of weekly game hours were missing. Estimated IRs and IRRs with
   CIs from different imputation methods were similar when the proportion
   of missing was small. Simulations showed that mean and multiple
   imputations provide the least biased estimates of IRR when the
   proportion of missing was large.
   Conclusions Complicated methods, like multiple imputation or bootstrap,
   are not superior over the mean imputation, a much simpler method, in
   handling missing weekly exposure of injury data where exposures were
   missing at random.}},

Abstract = {{Considering the SD (strength differential) effect on compressive
   strength and tensile strength in zirconia ceramic material, a yield
   criterion with a special parameter is introduced. In addition, by
   analogy with associated flow rule, the constitutive model of phase
   transformation ceramic material has been established. Under generalized
   plane strain condition, the theoretical toughening expressions of
   mixed-mode I-III stationary cracks and steady-state growing cracks have
   been developed with the constitutive model. The crack toughening effect
   has been discussed in detail with the Poisson ratio, parameters k /
   alpha. (the ratio of nominal yield strength and SD effect factor) and.
   (the scale factor of mode I crack and mode III). The integral
   calculation shows that phase transformation toughening of stationary
   cracks is negative shielding effect and the toughening effect of the
   steady-state growing cracks change obviously with the increase of
   parameter k / alpha. Comparison between experimental data and
   theoretical data indicates that the yield criterion is in accord with
   the actual characteristics of the zirconia ceramic, when the expression
   of mixed-mode I-III crack is reduced to mode I crack. The results
   obtained in present paper can provide the useful theoretical reference

Title = {{Reconfiguring maritime networks due to the Belt and Road Initiative:
   impact on bilateral trade flows}},
Journal = {{MARITIME ECONOMICS \& LOGISTICS}},
Abstract = {{This paper aims to analyse the potential effects on bilateral trade
   movements of the reconfiguration of maritime networks brought about by
   the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). The gravity model of international
   trade is applied to examine the hypothesized impact of maritime network
   reconfiguration on the bilateral trade between nine exporting countries
   (Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Israel, Panama, Colombia, Costa Rica, Singapore,
   Malaysia and Indonesia) and their 128 trading partners. The panel data
   on the five components of the Liner Shipping Bilateral Connectivity
   Index, the export value, the gross domestic product (GDP) of the nine
   exporting countries, the GDP of their trading partners and the maritime
   distance linking them to these 128 trading partners for each of the
   years from 2008 to 2016 are used in the analysis. The results show that
   the estimated coefficient for the number of transhipments is negative,
   revealing an inverse relationship between transhipments and bilateral
   exports, reconfirming that a redesign of the maritime supply chain
   network in response to the BRI could significantly improve bilateral
   export values. Furthermore, a reduction in the number of required
   transhipments, because of a reconfiguration of maritime networks with
   BRI trading partners, will improve the maritime network structure
   between countries located along the three strategic chokepoints: the
   Suez Canal, the Panama Canal, and the Strait of Malacca. In general
   terms, the BRI-driven reconfiguration of maritime supply networks is
   linked to an improvement in the productivity of nine exporting
   countries. An innovative gravity-based econometric model, estimated on a
   large set of panel data, is introduced below, aiming at the modelling of
   the effect of BRI on supply chain network reconfiguration.}},

Pages = {{124-132}},
Abstract = {{Most current research analyzing traffic crashes is done at either the
   spot level or the regional level. Less attention is placed at the
   community level. In addition, the effects of changes in land use,
   population growth, and transportation networks on community traffic
   safety have not been systematically studied. Although a number of
   studies have defined some variables to describe the influence of the
   built environment on traffic crashes, no research has looked at this
   problem through a comprehensive framework of relevant built-environment
   variables. This study explored a geographic information system-based
   community-level method to understand the effects of the built
   environment on traffic crashes. The census block group was selected as
   the analysis unit for the study. The framework of D transportation
   variables, including the dimensions of density, diversity, design,
   destination accessibility, and distance to transit, was used to
   characterize the built environment. The crash and built-environment data
   were processed in a geographic information system, and the negative
   binomial model was applied. The results showed that density had little
   influence on any type of crash; however, the mixed land use was
   positively associated with all crash categories. Furthermore, street
   length and number of segments under the design variables resulted in
   positive coefficients. However, the number of intersections was negative
   to all crash types. Moreover, whereas the number of bus stops showed a
   positive influence on crashes, the coefficient that designated the
   distance of crashes from bus stops and commercial sites was negative.}},

   positive zeta potential) at the IDEs reduce the geometrical resistance
   to less than half, and the time constant for the HN relaxation to less
   than one-fourth. These changes propose doubled diffusion coefficient and
   mobility of the charged species, and reduced dielectric relaxation time
   constant. The diffusion modeling suggests insignificant increase in
   charged mobile species upon DND seeding. It is hypothesized that the
   DNDs, which have a positive zeta potential, when seeded on gold and
   oxide surfaces with a negative zeta potential, reduce the electrostatic
   force acting on the diffuse layer ions, and increase their mobility. (C)

Abstract = {{Despite the wealth of studies reporting mechanical properties of liquid
   crystal elastomers (LCEs), no theory can currently describe their
   complete mechanical anisotropy and nonlinearity. Here, we present the
   first comprehensive study of mechanical anisotropy in an all-acrylate
   LCE via tensile tests that simultaneously track liquid crystal (LC)
   director rotation. We then use an empirical approach to gain a deeper
   insight into the LCE's mechanical responses at values of strain, up to
   1.5, for initial director orientations between 0 degrees and 90 degrees.
   Using a method analogous to time-temperature superposition, we create
   master curves for the LCE's mechanical response and use these to deduce
   a model that accurately predicts the load curve of the LCE for stresses
   applied at angles between 15 degrees and 70 degrees relative to the
   initial LC director. This LCE has been shown to exhibit auxetic behavior
   for deformations perpendicular to the director. Interestingly, our
   empirical model predicts that the LCE will further demonstrate auxetic
   behavior when stressed at angles between 54 degrees and 90 degrees to
   the director. Our approach could be extended to any LCE; so it
   represents a significant step forward toward models that would aid the
   further development of LCE theory and the design and modeling of
   LCE-based technologies. (c) 2019 The Authors. Journal of Polymer Science

Abstract = {{Determining the criterion for critical limits is always one of the
   essential challenges for traffic safety authorities. The purpose of
   identifying accident hotspots is to achieve high-priority locations in
   order to effectively allocate the safety budgets as well as to promote
   more efficient and faster safety at the road network level. In recent
   years, human, vehicle, road and environment have been recognized as the
   three main effective elements of the road transportation in the
   occurrence of accidents. In the present study, with combining the
   parameters related to accidents, geometric parameters of the accident
   location and traffic parameters, hotspots were identified. At the
   present research, were used the superior methods of Poisson regression
   and negative binomial distribution and based on the combined criteria of
   frequency and severity of accidents and equivalent injury factors by a
   floating segmentation of road. Then using Time Series Models in ANN,
   result were compared and validated. The results of ANN models
   demonstrate that the frequency method of accidents tends toward places
   with high traffic volume. MATLAB and STATA software were used.
   Non-native plumbing, curvature, slope, section length and residential
   area had more significance, and their coefficients indicated the
   significant effect of these parameters on the occurrence of the
   frequency and severity of accidents in hotspot locations.}},

Abstract = {{To maximize the public health benefits of voluntary medical male
   circumcision (VMMC) in real-world settings, sexual abstinence is
   recommended for six weeks following VMMC to ensure complete wound
   healing. We determined the frequency and predictors of early resumption
   of sex among a cohort of HIV-negative, sexually active men 18-49 years
   who underwent VMMC within a public-sector clinic in Botswana.
   Multivariate robust Poisson regression methods were used to identify
   predictors of having any sexual intercourse in the last six weeks since
   undergoing VMMC. In total, 433/519 (83\%) men had data available on
   sexual activity at six weeks post-VMMC. Median age was 27 years, 57\%
   had a higher than secondary education, 72\% were employed, and 9\% were
   married. Overall, 122/433 (28\%) men had sexual intercourse within the
   six weeks since VMMC, of whom 36\% reported inconsistent condom use.
   Compared to men >= 34 years, men aged <30 years (adjusted risk ratio
   {[}aRR] = 1.71, 95\% CI 0.95-3.08) and men 30-34 years had a two-fold
   higher likelihood of resuming sexual activity early in multivariate
   analyses (aRR = 2.31, 95\% CI 1.26-4.25, Wald p = 0.018). Employed men
   were more likely to resume sexual activity early than unemployed men
   (aRR = 1.58, 95\% CI 1.02-2.44, p = 0.039). Additional interventions are
   needed to encourage abstinence until complete wound healing.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES}},

Abstract = {{Ballistic penetration is a serious threat to military vehicles.
   Honeycomb structure is one of the most focused solution to improve the
   ballistic performance due to its great lightweight design and high
   resistant against impact. There are lots of honeycomb structure
   topologies. However, no comprehensive comparison on out-of-plane
   ballistic performance between common honeycomb types had been conducted
   to our knowledge. Therefore, hexagonal, reentrant, square, triangle and
   two circular (CS and CH types) honeycomb structures with identical mass
   and thickness are developed and modelled in this paper. Their relative
   densities are firstly calculated. Their numerical models and the
   Lambert-Jonas ballistic model are established. The ballistic
   performances of these six cases impacted by a blunt nose cylinder
   projectile from out-of-plane direction are detailed compared through
   numerical method. Their dynamic response, elastic and plastic
   deformation, failure mechanism and energy absorption capability are
   researched. Relations between initial velocity and residual velocity of
   projectile and the ballistic limit velocities of all cases are also
   compared. The results indicated that reentrant, square and triangular
   cases perform worse than hexagonal honeycomb. The fascinating
   deformation mechanism of CS and CH cases results in a long elastic
   deformation time and high strength after elastic deformation, which
   leads to a large decrease in residual velocity. Compared with hexagonal
   honeycomb, ballistic limit velocities of CS and CH type are improved by
   15.2\% and 25.0\%, respectively. This comparison research provides a
   useful reference for sandwich honeycomb core design.}},

Abstract = {{Monte Carlo simulations and analytical approximations for a primitive
   model of the metal/solid electrolyte interface are presented. The mobile
   positive and negative point charges in the solid electrolyte are
   restricted to the corresponding sites of a NaCl lattice (Schottky
   defects). Single imaging of the mobile charges in the metal was
   considered. This model of the metal/solid electrolyte interface differs
   substantially from the primitive model metal/liquid electrolyte
   interface as a direct result of the discrete spatial locations available
   to the charges. When the temperature or the dielectric constant of the
   electrolyte is high, the potential and charge decay monotonically with
   distance from the interface. The diffuse layer is however less evident
   than in an analogous primitive model of the metal/liquid electrolyte
   interface. At high values of the ratio (qe)(2)/T epsilon, an oscillation
   in the charge density profile is observed as in primitive model
   simulations of liquid electrolytes, This phenomenon is however more
   marked for solid electrolytes, which can be rationalized in terms of the
   discrete spatial locations occupied by the charges in the electrolyte,
   As a direct consequence of the charge oscillation, the interfacial
   capacitance may exceed the Helmholtz capacitance calculated using the
   lattice parameters of the solid electrolyte, a phenomenon which has been
   observed experimentally.(16-18) The Monte Carlo data can be fitted
   approximately by a simple modification of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation
   in which an exponentially decaying function of distance proportional to
   the total interfacial potential drop is added to the potential in the
   Boltzmann factor.}},

   hospitalized (odds ratio of 0.62, 95\% CI 0.39 to 0.95), compared with
   those who did not see a GP in the past year, after adjusting for
   confounders.
   Conclusion We found that insulin-dependent patients with diabetes who
   saw GPs more frequently were hospitalized less commonly compared with
   those who did not see a GP in the past year. Further research is needed
   to examine relationships with other types of follow-up, ideally using a
   longitudinal design.}},

Title = {{A generalized Schmidt star formation law: Observational constraints .2.}},

Abstract = {{This paper aims to see whether the observed distribution of the Roberts
   time for different samples of late-type galaxies of a given class
   (normal, active) may be fitted by a single theoretical distribution, and
   what additional constraints are put on models obeying a generalized
   Schmidt star formation law. We find that an extended Poisson
   distribution with expected value k{*} = 2.5 Gyr and median value
   k(double dagger) = 2.83 Gyr is consistent with five different samples of
   normal galaxies, provided systems with Roberts time T-R greater than or
   similar to 7 Gyr are excluded, and an extended Poisson distribution with
   expected value k{*} = 0.05 Gyr and median value k(double dagger) = 0.52
   Gyr is consistent with both a sample of active galaxies and a sample of
   compact HII regions. In this view, active galaxies and `'normal''
   galaxies with T-R greater than or similar to 7 Gyr should be regarded as
   merger products in different stages of evolution. In dealing with a
   generalized Schmidt star formation law, we take into consideration
   closed, comoving models of chemical evolution. The history of a galaxy
   is described by two main phases: contraction (which produces the
   extended component) and equilibrium (which gives the disk). Negative
   values of the ratio of contraction time to age of a galaxy, T-c/T,
   relate with present-day, fractional star formation rates C-D less than
   or similar to 0.025 Gyr(-1) and Roberts times T-R greater than or
   similar to 5 Gyr but, in general, the reverse is not true. Again, an
   extended Poisson distribution with expected value k{*} = 2.5 Gyr and
   median value k(double dagger) = 2.83 Gyr is consistent with two
   different samples (for which total masses also are reported and then
   ratios T-c/T can be calculated) of normal galaxies, provided systems for
   which T-c/T less than or equal to 0 are excluded. In this view, active
   galaxies and `'normal'' galaxies for which T-c/T less than or equal to 0
   should be regarded as mergers products in different stages of evolution.
   Further analysis provides additional support to two conclusions already
   established in a previous paper, namely: (i) models where star formation
   obeys a pure Schmidt law cannot fit the whole set of observations; and
   (ii) for assumed T-R = k(double dagger);T-c/T > 0 for normal galaxies;
   and T-c/T < 0.5 for at least a fraction of large-mass (M > 10(11)
   m(circle dot)) normal galaxies; a generalized Schmidt star formation law
   with an exponent n approximate to 1 is favoured over one with n
   approximate to 2. More precisely, 1 less than or similar to n less than
   or similar to 1.8 with a preferred value n approximate to 1.2, which
   makes a generalized Schmidt star formation law with n approximate to 1
   consistent with the observations. Finally, a stochastic process of star
   formation, related to a Poisson distribution, is briefly outlined.}},

Journal = {{STATA JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{17}},

Pages = {{89-115}},
Abstract = {{One typically analyzes clustered data using random- or fixed-effects
   models. Fixed-effects models allow consistent estimation of the effects
   of level-one variables, even if there is unobserved heterogeneity at
   level two. However, these models cannot estimate the effects of
   level-two variables. Hybrid and correlated random-effects models are
   flexible modeling specifications that separate within and
   between-cluster effects and allow for both consistent estimation of
   level-one effects and inclusion of level-two variables. In this article,
   we elaborate on the separation of within- and between-cluster effects in
   generalized linear mixed models. These models present a unifying
   framework for an entire class of models whose response variables follow
   a distribution from the exponential family (for example, linear, logit,
   probit, ordered probit and logit, Poisson, and negative binomial
   models). We introduce the user-written command xthybrid, a shell for the
   meglm command. xthybrid can fit a variety of hybrid and correlated
   random-effects models.}},

Abstract = {{Malgaigne fractures are the most common and widespread pelvic injuries
   resulting from the shear forces the action mechanism of which has not
   been explained in the literature yet. Military accidents with improvised
   explosive devices (IED) perfectly reflect this type of pelvic fracture.
   The finite element (FE) model of lumbar-pelvic complex (LPC) was
   developed based on computed tomography (CT) scans with the seat
   including steel frame, padding and soft tissue. The correlation
   coefficients of both low (100 N) and high (500 N) loads were greater
   than that currently obtained in the literature due to the presence of
   muscle force, pubic symphysis and joint cartilage. The dynamic analysis
   was performed to determine the influence of varying kinds of foam
   materials i.e. polyurethane, aluminium honeycomb structured and
   polyurethane auxetic foam on the stress/strain distribution in LPC under
   vertical impact load with the velocity of 7 m/s. Performed analysis
   showed the first fracture occurred in the L5 vertebrae resulting in the
   sacroiliac ligaments disruption and stress concentration in the pelvic
   ring causing further fractures of the wing of ilium, pubis and ischium
   bones. This results clearly explain the inconclusive findings about the
   second fracture that occurs in the pelvic area under a vertical impact
   load. The applied seat padding foam significantly reduced the stresses
   transmitted to the anatomical structures, thereby avoiding the risk of
   pelvic fracture. The analysis has proven that the auxetic polyurethane
   foam can be used as a good energy absorber.}},

Title = {{Contribution of industrial density and socioeconomic status to the
   spatial distribution of thyroid cancer risk in Hangzhou, China}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{613}},
Pages = {{679-686}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{Background: The thyroid cancer (TC) incidence in China has increased
   dramatically during the last three decades. Typical in this respect is
   the case of Hangzhou city (China), where 7147 new TC cases were
   diagnosed during the period 2008-2012. Hence, the assessment of the TC
   incidence risk increase due to environmental exposure is an important
   public health matter.
   Methods: Correlation analysis, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Poisson
   regression were first used to evaluate the statistical association
   between TC and key risk factors (industrial density and socioeconomic
   status). Then, the Bayesian maximum entropy (BME) theory and the
   integrative disease predictability (IDP) criterion were combined to
   quantitatively assess both the overall and the spatially distributed
   strength of the ``exposure-disease{''} association.
   Results: Overall, higher socioeconomic status was positively correlated
   with higher TC risk (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.687, P < 0.01).
   Compared to people of low socioeconomic status, people of median and
   high socioeconomic status showed higher TC risk: the Relative Risk (RR)
   and associated 95\% confidence interval (CI) were found to be,
   respectively, RR = 2.29 with 95\% CI = 1.99 to 2.63, and RR = 3.67 with
   95\% CI = 3.22 to 4.19. The ``industrial density-TC incidence{''}
   correlation, however, was non-significant. Spatially, the
   ``socioeconomic status-TC{''} association measured by the corresponding
   IDP coefficient was significant throughout the study area: the mean IDP
   value was -0.12 and the spatial IDP values were consistently negative at
   the township level. It was found that stronger associations were
   distributed among residents mainly on a stripe of land from northeast to
   southwest (consisting mainly of sub-district areas). The ``industrial
   density-TC{''} association measured by its IDP coefficient was spatially
   non-consistent.
   Conclusions: Socioeconomic status is an important indicator of TC risk
   factor in Hangzhou (China) whose effect varies across space. Hence,
   socioeconomic status shows the highest TC risk effect in sub-district
   areas. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Journal = {{GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY REPORTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{31}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Our objective was to determine how HIV infection impacts cervical cancer
   stage at presentation and overall survival (OS) among Ugandan women.
   This was a prospective study of 149 women diagnosed with cervical cancer
   from 2013 to 2015 at the Uganda Cancer Institute. Poisson regression
   models were fit to calculate prevalence ratios (PR) for the association
   between HIV infection and late stage at cancer diagnosis. The
   association between HIV infection and OS after cervical cancer diagnosis
   was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards models. The cohort included
   53 HIV-positive and 96 HIV-negative participants. Median age at
   diagnosis was 44 years for HIV-positive and 54 years for HIV-negative
   participants. Seventy-seven percent of HIV-positive participants
   received antiretroviral therapy. Median baseline CD4 count was 373
   cells/mm3 for HIV-positive participants versus 926 cells/mm3 for
   HIV-negative participants. Thirty-two percent of HIV-positive
   participants were diagnosed with late stage cervical cancer (III-IV)
   versus 39\% of HIV-negative participants. No association was found
   between late stage at cancer diagnosis and HIV infection (PR adjusted
   for age, parity and transport cost 1.0, 95\%CI 0.6-1.8). Most women
   presenting for care received cancer treatment, though almost half who
   received radiotherapy did not complete treatment. The median OS was 13.7
   months for HIV-positive participants and 24.3 months for HIV-negative
   participants. After adjusting for age and stage, HIV infection was
   weakly associated with OS (HR 1.3, 95\%CI 0.8-2.2). In Uganda, cervical
   cancer is often incompletely treated and survival remains poor. HIV
   infection was not associated with cervical cancer stage at diagnosis,
   but may be weakly associated with shorter survival.}},

Abstract = {{Background. We examined the epidemiology of community-associated
   methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) nasal colonization
   among 3 groups of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected and 1
   group of HIV-negative outpatients.
   Methods. We determined prevalence and risk factors associated with MRSA
   colonization among women, recently incarcerated, and Hispanic
   HIV-infected patients and HIV-negative patients; isolates were typed by
   pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Relative prevalence was calculated
   using Poisson regression, and logistic regression was used for
   multivariate analysis.
   Results. Of 601 patients, 9.3\% were colonized with MRSA; 11\% of
   HIV-infected and 4.2\% of HIV-negative patients were colonized (relative
   prevalence, 2.6; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI], 1.12-6.07; P = .03).
   Among HIV-infected patients, recently incarcerated patients had the
   highest colonization prevalence (15.6\%) followed by women (12\%);
   Hispanic patients had the lowest (2.8\%). Eighty percent of confirmed
   MRSA isolates were identified as USA300.
   On multivariate analysis, history of incarceration or residence in
   alternative housing (odds ratio {[}OR], 2.3; 95\% CI, 1.1-4.7; P = .03)
   was associated with MRSA colonization; Hispanic ethnicity was negatively
   associated (OR, 0.3; 95\% CI, .11-.98; P = .045). There was a trend (OR,
   1.6; 95\% CI, .9-3.0; P = .097) toward geographic location of residence
   being associated with colonization. After controlling for incarceration,
   residence, and geography, HIV status was no longer significantly
   associated with colonization.
   Conclusions. The CA-MRSA and HIV epidemics have intersected. Examination
   of networks of individuals released from incarceration, both HIV
   positive and negative, is needed to assess the role of social networks
   in spread of CA-MRSA and inform prevention strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Protective armors are widespread in nature and often consist of periodic
   arrays of tile-like building blocks that articulate with each other
   through undulating interfaces. To investigate the mechanical
   consequences of these wavy tessellations, especially in instances where
   the amplitude of the undulations is near the scale of the constituent
   tiles as is found in the seedcoats of many plant species, an approach
   that integrates parametric modeling and finite element simulations with
   direct mechanical testing on their 3D-printed multi-material structural
   analogues is presented. Results from these studies demonstrate that
   these tiled arrays of largely isotropic star-like unit cells exhibit an
   unusual combination of mechanical properties including auxeticity and
   mutually amplified strength and toughness which can be systematically
   tuned by varying the waviness of the sutural tessellation.}},

Abstract = {{Soil strength nonlinearity and dilatancy have significant impacts on the
   stability of a slope. In the present analysis, a seismic stability
   analysis of a three-dimensional two-stage slope considering the joined
   influences of soil strength nonlinearity and dilatancy is conducted.
   Based on the limit analysis method, the external work rates by soil
   weight and the seismic forces as well as the internal energy
   dissipations are calculated and thereafter the critical height of the
   slope is derived. In virtue of the nonlinear optimization procedure, the
   stability factor of a 3D slope subjected to seismic forces is captured.
   The effects of slope geometry, seismic forces, soil strength
   nonlinearity and dilatancy on the slope stability are investigated by
   parameter analysis. It is found from the results that, the depth
   coefficient alpha(1) and dilative parameter n have positive effects on
   the stability of a two-stage slope while the other factors such as the
   seismic coefficient k(h) and the nonlinear coefficient m have negative
   effects on it. In addition, the effect of soil nonlinearity on slope
   stability aggravates when the seismic force coefficient k(h) and the
   dilative parameter n increase.}},

Title = {{Delayed Graft Function in Simultaneous Liver Kidney Transplantation}},
Journal = {{TRANSPLANTATION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{104}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{542-550}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Background.
   Delayed graft function (DGF) is associated with inferior posttransplant
   outcomes in kidney transplantation. Given these adverse outcomes, we
   sought to determine the incidence, unique risk factors, and
   posttransplant outcomes for simultaneous liver kidney (SLK) transplant
   recipients developing DGF.
   Methods.
   We studied 6214 adult SLK recipients from March 2002 to February 2017
   using the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients. We determined
   associations between risk factors and DGF using Poisson multivariate
   regression and between DGF and graft failure and mortality using Cox
   proportional hazard analysis.
   Results.
   The overall rate of DGF was 21.8\%. Risk factors for DGF in the
   hepatitis C virus (HCV)-negative recipient population included
   pretransplant dialysis (adjusted incident rate ratio {[}aIRR] 3.26, P =
   0.004), donor body mass index (aIRR 1.25 per 5 kg/m(2), P = 0.01), and
   transplantation with a donation after circulatory death (aIRR 5.38, P =
   0.001) or imported donor organ (regional share aIRR 1.69, P = 0.03;
   national share aIRR 4.82, P < 0.001). DGF was associated with a 2.6-fold
   increase in kidney graft failure (adjusted hazard ratio {[}aHR] 2.63, P
   < 0.001), 1.6-fold increase in liver graft failure (aHR 1.62, P <
   0.001), and 1.6-fold increase in mortality (aHR 1.62, P < 0.001).
   Conclusions.
   In HCV-negative SLK recipients, recipient pretransplant dialysis and
   components of kidney graft quality comprise significant risk factors for
   DGF. Regardless of HCV status, DGF is associated with inferior
   posttransplant outcomes. Understanding these risk factors during
   clinical decision-making may improve prevention of DGF and may represent
   an opportunity to improve posttransplant outcomes.}},

   tension compression}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTIONAL STEEL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{167}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Steel-Concrete-Steel (SCS) composite wall is being used for different
   purposes for its improved performances. Some analytical and finite
   element models have been presented in the past to predict the behavior
   of such walls. In this paper, an attempt is made to develop an iterative
   membrane model to analyze SCS wall panels subjected to in-plane membrane
   forces in the principal directions. The model accounts for the
   post-cracking Poisson effects of concrete as the Zhu/Hsu ratio.
   Individual behaviors of concrete and steel plates in an SCS panel are
   studied in which confinement in principal tensile direction accompanied
   by negative uniaxial tensile strain in concrete is observed. To explain
   this behavior, a detailed perspective for uniaxial strain in principal
   tensile direction is proposed and the conventional stressstrain
   trajectory of concrete in tension is extended to incorporate any
   confinement developed in the concrete. Constitutive law of concrete in
   compression is also modified to incorporate the observed confining
   behavior of the concrete. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Many countries around the world are implementing
   Public-Private-Partnership (PPP) contacts to manage road infrastructure.
   In some of these contracts the public sector introduces economic
   incentives to the private operator to foster the accomplishment of
   social goals. One of the incentives that have been introduced in some
   PPP contracts is related to safety in such a way that the better the
   safety outcome the greater will be the economic reward to the
   contractor. The aim of this paper is at identify whether the incentives
   to improve road safety in highway PPPs are ultimately effective in
   improving safety ratios. To this end Poisson and negative binomial
   regression models have been applied using information from highway
   sections in Spain. The findings indicate that even though road safety is
   highly influenced by variables that are not much controllable by the
   contractor such as the Average Annual Daily Traffic and the percentage
   of heavy vehicles, the implementation of safety incentives in PPPs has a
   positive influence in the reduction of fatalities, injuries and

Abstract = {{We consider an optimal design of composite hydrophones consisting of
   parallel piezoelectric PZT rods that are embedded in a porous polymer
   matrix. Given the material properties of the polymer and PZT ceramic, we
   have optimally designed the piezocomposite to maximize the hydrostatic
   coupling factor, hydrophone figure of merit, or electromechanical
   coupling factor, using the methods of homogenization theory. The optimal
   composite is obtained by using a two-step procedure: (i) first we find
   the ideal structure of the matrix material by weakening the polymer by
   an optimal arrangement of pores, and (ii) then we embed the PZT rods in
   this matrix. The design parameters are the shape, volume fraction, and
   spatial arrangement of the piezoceramic rods, and the structure of the
   matrix material. It turns out that the optimal matrix is highly
   anisotropic and is characterized by negative Poisson's ratios in certain
   directions. The optimal composites possess performance characteristics
   that are significantly higher than those of a piezocomposite with an
   isotropic polymer matrix. The results can be viewed as theoretical upper
   bounds on the hydrophone performance. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The occurrence of a negative dynamic mass density is a striking property
   of metamaterials. It appears when an inner local resonance is present.
   Results coming from an asymptotic theory are recalled briefly, showing
   the scaling of physical properties leading to inner resonance in elastic
   composites containing homogeneous soft inclusions, with negligible
   scattering of waves traveling through the matrix. This appears for a
   large contrast of elastic properties between matrix and inclusion. The
   frequency-dependent dynamic mass density depends on the resonance
   frequencies of the inner inclusions and on their related participation
   factors. Having solved the dynamic elasticity problem, these physical
   quantities are provided in the case of homogeneous cylindrical and
   spherical inclusions. It is shown that numerous resonance frequencies do
   not contribute to the dynamic mass density or have small participation
   factors, which simplifies significantly the physics involved in the
   concerned inner resonance phenomena. Finally, non-dimensional resonance
   frequencies and participation factors are given for both cases of
   inclusions as functions of the Poisson's ratio, defining completely the
   dynamic mass density. (C) 2017 Acoustical Society of America.}},

Abstract = {{This investigation examines the transient deformation and heat
   generation of a solid polyurethane subjected to dynamic compression. A
   special method is presented to prepare the solid polyurethane from raw

   physical properties of the solid polyurethane. High-speed optical and

   images during impact tests. Under quasi-static compression, the solid
   polyurethane presents a good performance in toughness. This is confirmed
   by its Poisson's ratio. Under impact compression, the adiabatic heat
   generation are identified statistically. Temperature distribution
   confirms the fact of transient heat generation in specimens. Adiabatic
   self heating mechanism provides a consideration to understand the
   negative strain-rate effect and post yield softening effect found in the
   solid polyurethane. Mechanical properties including quasi-static and

Abstract = {{The stability, electronic and phonon structures, mechanical and

   was found to be lower compared to that for TiB2 (43.5 GPa) and ZrB2
   (43.1 GPa). The calculated elastic moduli and Poisson ratio exhibit the

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study is to explore a new type of structure design
   and injecting material selection of the composite sandwich bulletproof
   system. A reentrant hexagonal honeycomb with the negative Poisson's
   ratio effect was designed. Thermoplastic polyurethanes (TPU),
   polypropylene (PP) and polycarbonate (PC) were chosen to inject into the
   re-entrant honeycomb structure by injection molding to form the
   composite sandwich layers. The total bulletproof system was later
   constructed with the boron carbide ceramic plates and aluminum alloy
   plates. The mechanical behaviors and energy absorption characteristics
   of different composite sandwich layers were investigated by quasi-static
   and dynamic compression tests. The dynamic responses of different
   structured layers were analyzed via numerical simulations in
   ANSYS/LS-DYNA, which employed 7.62 mm projectiles. The results indicated
   that the injection-molded composite sandwich layer shows excellent
   compressive strength and energy absorption capacity. The bulletproof
   performance of the injection-molded system has been greatly improved
   comparing with the non-injected molded system. Compared with TPU and PP,
   the composite injected with PC presents optimal penetration resistance.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, free-standing buckypapers (BPs) made up of a
   three-dimensional network of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) that
   are branched, cross-linked, and share common walls, defined henceforth
   as multi-walled carbon nanostructures (MWCNSs) are characterized to
   obtain their electrical, thermal and mechanical properties. Two types of
   free-standing sheets are studied, namely uncompressed buckypapers (UBPs)
   and compressed buckypapers (CBPs). Both are processed via a vacuum
   filtration method, with subsequent compressive force applied between
   platen presses to obtain CBP. CBPs are found to exhibit improved thermal
   and electrical conductivities since higher density of CNT networks leads
   to more conductive pathways. However, mechanical properties of CBPs and
   UBPs are approximately the same. Local anisotropic behavior of both BPs
   allows them to have either positive or negative Poisson's ratio. While
   UBP is suitable for membrane applications due to its mechanical
   stability and well-defined pore characteristics, the CBP offers a
   compact structure that can reduce penetration of the polymer matrix in
   composite applications such as for integrated circuit packaging and EMI
   shielding. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To estimate the prevalence of HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV)
   and hepatitis B virus (HBV) coinfections and current risk behaviors
   among HIV-positive and -negative injection drug users (IDUs) in Chennai,
   India.
   Methods: Cross-sectional analysis of a convenience sample of 912 IDUs
   recruited between March 2004 and April 2005. Specimens were tested for
   HIV, HBV, and HCV Adjusted prevalence ratios (PRs) were estimated using
   Poisson regression with robust variance estimates.
   Results: The prevalence of HIV, hepatitis B surface antigen, and
   anti-HCV were 29.8\%, 11.1\%, and 62.1\%, respectively. Among
   HIV-infected IDUs, prevalence of coinfection with anti-HCV and hepatitis
   B surface antigen/anti-HCV were 86\% and 9.2\%, respectively. In
   multivariate analysis, injecting at a dealer's place (PR: 1.57) and
   duration of injection drug use >= 11 years (PR: 3.02) were positively
   associated with prevalent HIV infection. Contrastingly, alcohol
   consumption >= 1 per week (PR: 0.55) was negatively associated with HIV
   HIV-positive IDUs were as or more likely compared with HIV-negative IDUs
   to report recent high-risk injection-related behaviors.
   Conclusions: There is a high burden of HIV HCV and HBV among IDUs that
   needs to be addressed by improving access to therapies for these
   infections; furthermore, preventive measures are urgently needed to
   prevent further spread of HIV, HBV, and HCV in this vulnerable

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{98}},
Number = {{24}},
Month = {{DEC 17}},
Abstract = {{In contrast to the well-defined lattices of various two-dimensional (2D)
   systems, the atomic structure of borophene is sensitive to growth
   conditions and type of the substrate which results in rich polymorphism.
   By employing ab initio methods, we reveal a thermodynamically stable
   borophene polymorph without vacancies which is a semiconductor unlike
   the other known boron sheets, in the form of an asymmetric
   centered-washboard structure. Our results indicate that asymmetric
   distortion is induced due to Peierls instability which transforms a
   symmetric metallic system into a semiconductor. We also show that
   applying uniaxial or biaxial strain gradually lowers the obtained band
   gap and the symmetric configuration is restored following the closure of
   the band gap. Furthermore, while the Poisson's ratio is calculated to be
   high and positive in the semiconducting regime, it switches to negative
   once the metallicity is retrieved. The realization of semiconducting
   borophene polymorphs without defects and tunability of its electronic
   and mechanical response can extend the usage of boron sheets in a
   variety of nanoelectronic applications.}},

   residents of the municipality of Natal (Northeast Brazil), diagnosed
   with BC and submitted to oncological treatment. Data collection took
   place between July/2015 and May/2016 from medical records and
   individuals' interviews, and from theMedical Outcome Study-Social
   Support Survey.Descriptive, bivariate and multivariate statistics were
   carried out through Poisson's regression with robust variance and
   significance level 0.05. Prevalence of LSS in women with BC was 22.8\%
   with confidence interval 14.6-39.94. Type of access to public services
   (p< .03), prevalence ratio (PR) 1.84 and negative self-rated health (p<
   .001), PR 4.47 were associated with LSS. These results were obtained
   after adjustments by the variables age and presence of chronic diseases.
   The associations established herein could have been mostly related to
   fragilities of the Brazilian health system, and can contribute to the

Abstract = {{The paper investigates the in-plane elastic wave propagation in
   hierarchical lattices. The hierarchical organization is obtained by
   removing a certain amount of cells successively from a general hexagonal
   lattice that involves the re-entrant configuration with negative
   Poisson's ratio. The symmetry reduction caused by the alteration of the
   internal angle and the formed vertexes with stacking hexagons gives rise
   to a significant effect on the dispersion properties of the structure
   materials. Results show that the lattices with different hierarchy
   levels possess a stable behavior of the band gap in the position near
   the resonant frequency of the cell walls, and the gap width has an
   evident increase in the re-entrant hierarchical structures. In addition,
   band structure in the low frequency range has an unchanged performance
   for the varying parameters of cell walls, and the reason is owing to the
   steady of the structure vibration pattern for the Bloch modes. The
   authors' findings of the dispersion behaviors in the hierarchical
   lattices provide a broad design space for the lightweight materials in
   the wave manipulation and vibration control.}},

Journal = {{BMC PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2011}},

Month = {{OCT 10}},
Abstract = {{Background: Fertility is high in rural Ethiopia. Women in the
   reproductive age group differed in various characteristics including
   access to food and encounter to drought which requisite the assessment
   of determinants of fertility.
   Methods: Reproductive age women were recruited from a DSS, the Butajira
   DSS database. A DHS maternity history questionnaire was administered on
   9996 participants. Data quality was assured besides ethical clearance.
   Poisson regression crude and adjusted Incidence Rate Ratio with 95
   Confidence Interval were used to identify determinants of fertility.
   Results: Delayed marriage, higher education, smaller family, absence of
   child death experience and living in food-secured households were
   associated with small number of children. Fertility was significantly
   higher among women with no child sex preference. However, migration
   status of women was not statistically significant.
   Conclusions: Policy makers should focus on hoisting women secondary
   school enrollment and age at first marriage. The community should also
   be made aware on the negative impact of fertility on household economy,
   environmental degradation and the country's socio-economic development
   at large.}},

Abstract = {{Conductive rubber nanocomposites have been attracting interest for
   strain sensing applications owing to their large deformation and high
   sensitivity. In this paper, the strain sensing behavior of room
   temperature vulcanized (RTV) hybrid silicone rubber composites
   containing carbon nanotubes and graphene was systematically
   investigated. We studied the effects of the nanofiller content and
   strain amplitude on the strain sensing behavior of the nanocomposites,
   and found good stability and durability during cyclic loading. The
   shoulder peaks appeared in the cyclic loading curves owing to the
   competition between the reconstruction process of the conductive network
   during deformation and time-dependent features of the polymer material.
   Furthermore, our test results of different loading histories indicated
   that a sufficient recovery time could reduce or even eliminate the
   shoulder peak. Finally, the mechanical structure with a negative
   Poisson's ratio is designed to regulate the resistance response of the
   RTV nanocomposites, exhibiting a monotonic and more sensitive resistance
   response. Our research results explain the main factors contributing to
   the shoulder peak phenomenon of conductive nanocomposites and provide a
   regulation strategy for achieving a monotonic and highly sensitive
   resistance response.}},

   of free recombination among sites. We also discuss the coverage of
   confidence intervals on the basis of two standard-likelihood methods. We
   find that the LRT has high power to detect deviations from neutrality
   and that the maximum-likelihood estimation performs very well when the
   ancestral states of all mutations in the sample are known. When the
   ancestral states are not known, the test has high power to detect

Abstract = {{Silica aerogels are attractive for thermal insulation due to their low
   thermal conductivity and good heat resistance performance. However, the
   fabrication of silica aerogels with temperature-invariant
   superelasticity and ultralow thermal conductivity has remained extremely
   challenging. Herein, we designed and synthesized a hierarchical cellular
   structured silica nanofibrous aerogel by using electrospun SiO2
   nanofibers (SNFs) and SiO2 nanoparticle aerogels (SNAs) as the matrix
   and SiO2 sol as the high-temperature nanoglue. This pathway leads to the
   intrinsically random deposited SNFs assembling into a fibrous cellular
   structure, and the SNAs are evenly distributed on the fibrous cell wall.
   The unique hierarchical cellular structure of the ceramic nanofibrous
   aerogels endows it with integrated performances of the ultralow density
   of similar to 0.2 mg cm(-3), negative Poisson's ratio, ultralow thermal
   conductivity (23.27 mW m(-1) K-1), temperature-invariant superelasticity
   from -196 to 1100 degrees C, and editable shapes on a large scale. These
   favorable multifeatures present the aerogels ideal for thermal
   insulation in industrial, aerospace, and even extreme environmental
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{This article sets out to evaluate the prevalence and associated factors
   with the lack of breastfeeding upon discharge from hospital in a public
   maternity facility in Maceio, Alagoas, Brazil. It involved a
   cross-sectional study performed with women who had recently given birth
   at the moment of discharge from the maternity ward of a university
   hospital in the capital. Prevalence ratios (PR) and confidence intervals
   of 95\% (CI95\%) were calculated by Poisson regression with the use of a
   hierarchical model. Approximately 20\% of mothers did not breastfeed.
   Smoking during pregnancy {[}PR = 5.20; (CI95\% = 1.75 to 15.33), p =
   0.003]; complications during pregnancy {[}PR = 3.50; (CI95\% = 1.04 to
   11.77), p = 0.042] and insufficient information about breastfeeding
   during prenatal care {[}PR = 5.44; (CI95\% 1.78 to 16.67); p = 0.003]
   were the major negative factors associated with the lack of
   breastfeeding. Breastfeeding in the maternity ward was lower than ideal.
   Guidelines on smoking prevention and encouragement of breastfeeding must
   be highlighted during prenatal care, especially for women with
   complications during pregnancy.}},

Abstract = {{The scope of this study was to describe the prevalence of, and analyze
   factors associated with, linear growth retardation in children. The
   baseline study analyzed 2040 children under the age of five,
   establishing a possible association between growth delay (height/age
   index <= 2 scores Z) and variables in six hierarchical blocks:
   socioeconomic, residence, sanitary, maternal, biological and healthcare
   access. Multivariate analysis was performed using Poisson regression
   with the robust standard error option, obtaining adjusted prevalence
   ratios with a CI of 95\% and the respective significant probability
   values. Among non-binary variables, there was a positive association
   with roof type and number of inhabitants per room and a negative
   association with income per capita, mother's schooling and birth weight.
   The adjusted analysis also indicated water supply, visit from the
   community health agent, birth delivery location, internment for
   diarrhea, or for pneumonia and birth weight as significant variables.
   Several risk factors were identified for linear growth retardation
   pointing to the multi-causal aspects of the problem and highlighting the
   need for control measures by the various hierarchical government agents.}},

Abstract = {{Microscopic rotations can play a very important role in the molecular
   crystals or in some dielectric crystals where atoms are joined in
   comparatively rigid clusters and the inter-cluster interactions are
   comparatively weak. The range of unusual phenomena observed in such
   materials is fascinating, from incommensurate phase to negative Poisson
   ratio. Here we focus on the topological soliton dynamics in such
   materials and describe a number of effects, such as the trigger off and
   propagation of autowaves, soliton multiplication in the metastable
   media, soliton collisions and annihilations. All these phenomena are
   addressed in frame of the elastically hinged molecule (EHM) model having
   microscopic particles with rotational degrees of freedom. For this model
   we construct various continuum approximations. New important features of
   the continuum models for media with microscopic rotations are the
   increase in number of equations of motion due to the increase in number
   of degrees of freedom and the appearance of the higher gradient terms in
   the resulting equations. We also construct the multi-field continuum
   approximation capable of description not only long but also short waves.}},

Abstract = {{It is now almost 100 years since Hugh Campbell Ross began his
   experiments on white blood cells and cancer. By suspending peripheral
   blood cells in a solution of agar gel, he was able to observe changes in
   them provoked by various natural and artificial substances, which he
   named auxetics, kinetics, or augmentors, depending on the effects they
   produced. After his early experience he focused his attention
   particularly on lymphocytes in peripheral blood samples; he claimed to
   have observed rapid division in them, although at that time they were
   looked upon as end cells without a future. He contended that his results
   challenged what had become the orthodox view of the role of the nucleus
   in mitosis, asserting that cytologists had been led astray by relying on
   examination of fixed, dead structures. When doubt was cast on his claim
   to have induced cell division, his brother Ronald, Nobel laureate in
   physiology or medicine, came to his defense, but to no avail, and
   although he continued his experiments for a number of years they were
   quietly forgotten. Fifty years later the occurrence of mitotic division
   of peripheral blood lymphocytes was established beyond any doubt by
   Nowell and Hirschhorn.}},

Abstract = {{The present work deals with the assessment of Tersoff potential with
   different sets of empirical parameters for the two-dimensional noncarbon
   beta N (beta: B, Al, Ga and In) hexagonal monolayer lattice structures
   in the framework of Cauchy-Born rule. The deformations at atomistic and
   continuum scale are coupled thorough Cauchy-Born rule accounting for
   curvature effects. The interatomic potentials are assessed to
   demonstrate their accuracy for predicting the elastic properties,
   bending rigidity, cohesive energy and bond length when compared with
   those predicted from experimental studies and first-principle
   calculations. The elastic properties and bending rigidity predicted with
   different sets of empirical parameters for interatomic potentials are
   found to be scattered in a significant manner and best set of parameters
   is identified here and recommended for further use in multiscale
   simulations. Few of the parameter sets for the Tersoff potential
   predicted a negative value of the Poisson's ratio through multiscale
   simulation. Furthermore, the bending rigidity of the rest of the three
   nanomaterials, except boron nitride nanomaterial, is reported for the

   method. C6B2 is a hypothetical hexagonal compound, which consists of two
   B-C layers and two C-C layers. All calculated electronic band structures
   are metallic. C6B2 has unoccupied flat bands close to the Fermi level at
   the Gamma-A line. These flat bands correspond to unoccupied sigma-bands
   of MgB2 at the Gamma-A line. Displacements of B atoms along a B-C bond
   split unoccupied flat bands at the F-A line into two subbands. A total
   energy change with displacements of B atoms indicates anharmonicity of a
   B-C stretching mode. We investigate C6B2 under various compression
   conditions. The change in the electronic band structure under a, b-axis
   compression (P,,) is small. In contrast, it is quite remarkable under
   e-axis compression.(P-z). We find the lattice anomaly of C6B2 under a,
   b-axis compression. This anomaly shows a kind of negative Poisson
   ratios. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this work is to numerically investigate the
   elastic-plastic deformation of closed-cell foams incorporating the
   effect of inner gas pressure. Both body-centered cubic (BCC) and
   face-centered cubic (FCC) arrangements of pores are considered in
   analysis. It is seen that the inner gas pressure has a significant
   effect on the plastic deformation of closed-cell foams, which is
   different for the foams with different microstructures and is discussed
   in detail. The inner gas pressure results in the asymmetry of uniaxial
   tensile-compressive stress-strain curves and the nominal Poisson's
   ratio. It is shown that the inner gas pressure makes the yield surface
   move to the negative direction of the hydrostatic axis in the plane of
   equivalent and hydrostatic stresses, and the moving distance is equal to
   the magnitude of inner gas pressure in the foams. Moreover, a new yield
   function incorporating the effect of inner gas pressure is developed for
   closed-cell foams. The material constants in the yield function depend
   on the microstructures of the foams.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate temporal variations in teleseismic receiver functions
   using 11 yr of data at station PKD near Parkfield, California, by
   stacking power spectral density (PSD) functions within 12-month windows.
   We find that PSD levels for both radial and transverse components drop
   by similar to 5 dB following the 2003 San Simeon (M 6.5) earthquake,
   with a persistent reduction in background levels of similar to 2 dB,
   relative to the pre-2003 levels, after the 2004 Parkfield (M 6)
   earthquake, corresponding to an estimated decrease in shear-wave
   velocity of similar to 0.12 and similar to 0.06 km/sec, respectively, or
   equivalent negative changes in Poisson's ratio of similar to 0.02 and
   similar to 0.01. Our results suggest that the perturbation originates at
   middle to lower crustal levels, possibly caused by the redistribution of
   crustal pore fluids, consistent with increased and sustained tremor
   activity near Parkfield following both earthquakes. This study shows
   that we can resolve temporal variations in crustal scattering structure
   near a major seismogenic fault using the receiver function method.}},

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional multiferroic materials have attracted great attention
   owing to their promising prospects for miniaturized electronic and
   memory devices. Here, we propose a highly stable 2D multiferroic VOF
   monolayer which is an intrinsic ferromagnetic half semiconductor with
   large spin polarization similar to 2 mu(B)/V and significant uniaxial
   magnetic anisotropy along the a-axis (410 mu eV/V). Meanwhile, it shows
   excellent ferroelectricity with a large spontaneous polarization of 32.7
   mu C cm(-2) and a moderate energy barrier (similar to 43 meV per atom)
   between two ferroelectric states, which can be ascribed to the
   Jahn-Teller distortions. Moreover, the VOF monolayer harbors an
   ultra-large negative Poisson's ratio in the in-plane direction (similar
   to-0.34). The Curie temperature evaluated from Monte Carlo simulations
   based on the Ising model is about 215 K, which can be further enhanced
   to room temperature by 4\% compressive biaxial strain. The combination
   of ferromagnetism and ferroelectricity in the VOF monolayer could
   provide a promising platform for future study of multiferroic effects

Abstract = {{BackgroundGender appears to play a role in incidence and disease course
   of multiple sclerosis (MS).
   ObjectiveThe objective was to determine whether male and female patients
   with MS respond differently to interferon-beta treatment in terms of
   reduction in relapse rates.
   MethodsWe included all 2033 patients with relapsing-remitting MS who
   started treatment with interferon-beta from 1996 to 2003, identified
   from the Danish Multiple Sclerosis Treatment Register. We defined
   neutralizing antibody (NAb)-positive and NAb-negative periods in the
   single patient by the results of the NAb tests. Patients served as their
   own controls, and relapse rates were compared between NAb-negative and
   NAb-positive periods.
   ResultsNAbs significantly abrogated the interferon-beta treatment
   efficacy in both genders. The all-over women:men relapse rate ratio
   irrespective of NAb status was 1.47 (95\%CI; 1.28-1.68). In a
   generalized linear Poisson models analysis with relapse counts as
   response variable, the main effects NAbs, sex, age at treatment start
   and number of relapses in 2years before treatment start were strongly
   significant, but the effect of NAbs on relapse rates did not differ
   significantly between men and women.
   ConclusionAs NAbs influenced the on-treatment relapse rates strongly in
   both sexes but without statistical significant difference, there is no
   indication of different effects of interferon-beta in men or women.}},

Abstract = {{Graphene and fullerene, two types of C allotropes with very different
   structures and properties, have attracted considerable attention from
   the scientific community as new forms of carbon for several decades. It
   will be a great advantage to combine the geometrical features of the
   two. Herein, we report a series of novel two-dimensional carbon
   allotropes that possess fullerene-like hollow structures (bubbles)
   embedded in a graphene sheet. These carbon allotropes are both thermally
   and dynamically stable. Calculations using hybrid functionals show that
   these two-dimensional carbon allotropes could be metals or
   semiconductors depending on the size and the pattern of the bubbles. The
   band gap can be as large as 166 eV. Due to the unique atomic
   configuration, some bubble-wrap carbons have unusual negative Poisson's
   ratios. The combination of graphene and fullerenes provides an appealing
   approach to design carbon-based materials with dexterous properties. For
   example, the insertion of the metal atoms inside the bubbles may greatly
   enhance the functions of such materials in photovoltaics and catalysis.}},

Abstract = {{The arts of origami and kirigami inspired numerous examples of macro
   scale hierarchical structures with high degree of reconfigurability and
   multiple functionalities. Extension of kirigami and origami patterning
   to micro-, meso-, and nanoscales enabled production of nanocomposites
   with unusual combination of properties, transitioning these art forms to
   the toolbox of materials design. Various subtractive and additive
   fabrication techniques applicable to nanocomposites and out-of-plane
   deformation of patterns enable a technological framework to negotiate
   often contradictory structural requirements for materials properties.
   Additionally, the long searched possibility of patterned
   composites/parts with highly predictable set of properties/functions
   emerged. In this review, we discuss foldable/ stretchable composites
   with designed mechanical properties, as exemplified by the negative
   Poisson's ratio, as well as optical and electrical properties, as
   exemplified by the sheet conductance, photovoltage generation, and light
   diffraction. Reconfiguration achieved by extrinsic forces and/or
   intrinsic stresses enables a wide spectrum of technological applications
   including miniaturized biomedical tools, soft robotics, adaptive optics,

   autumn and spring were 1.02 (0.95-1.09), 1.01 (0.94-1.08) and 0.99
   (0.92-1.06), respectively. Significant seasonal variations were observed
   in the rates of peritonitis caused by coagulase-negative Staphylococci
   (spring and summer peaks), corynebacteria (winter peak) and
   Gram-negative organisms (summer and autumn peaks). There were trends to
   seasonal variations in fungal peritonitis (summer and autumn peaks) and
   pseudomonas peritonitis (summer peak). No significant seasonal
   variations were observed for other organisms. Peritonitis outcomes did
   not significantly vary according to season.
   Conclusions. Seasonal variation has no appreciable influence on overall
   PD peritonitis rates or clinical outcomes. Nevertheless, significant
   seasonal variations were observed in the rates of peritonitis due to
   specific microorganisms, which may allow institutions to more precisely
   target infection control strategies prior to higher risk seasons.}},

Title = {{Penta-BxNy sheet: a density functional theory study of two-dimensional
   material}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{AUG 19}},
Abstract = {{By using density functional theory with generalized gradient
   approximation, we have carried out detailed investigations of
   two-dimensional BxNy nanomaterials in the Cairo pentagonal tiling
   geometry fully composed of pentagons (penta-BxNy). Only penta-BN and BN2
   planar structures are dynamically stable without imaginary modes in
   their phonon spectra. Their stabilities have been further evaluated by
   formation energy analysis, first-principles molecular dynamics
   simulation, and mechanical stability analysis. Penta-BN2 is superior to
   penta-BN in structural stability. Its stability analysis against
   oxidization and functional group adsorption as well as its synthesizing
   reaction path analysis show possibilities in fabricating penta-BN2 on
   experiment. Furthermore, the penta-BN2 could be transferred from
   metallic to semiconducting by ionizing or covalently binding an electron
   per dinitrogen. Also, it has been found to have superior mechanical
   properties, such as the negative Poisson's ratio and the comparable
   stiffness as that of hexagonal h-BN sheet. These studies on the
   stabilities, electronic properties, and mechanical properties suggest
   penta-BN2 as an attractive material to call for further studies on both
   theory and experiment.}},

Title = {{Inequalities in self-rated oral health in adults}},
Journal = {{REVISTA DE SAUDE PUBLICA}},

Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To investigate the link between self-rated oral health and
   socio-demographic inequalities.
   METHODS: Cross-sectional study, carried out with 2,016 adults between 20
   and 59 years of age in 2009, in Florianopolis, SC, Southern Brazil. We
   adopted a two-stage sampling design (census tracts and households). Data
   were collected through face-to-face interviews, conducted in the
   participants' households. The outcome was self-rated oral health. The
   exploratory variables were demographic characteristics, indicators of
   socioeconomic position, dental service utilization and adverse
   self-reported oral health conditions. Analysis was performed using
   multivariable poisson regression, which allowed the estimation of
   prevalence ratios and 95\% confidence intervals.
   RESULTS: The prevalence of negative self-rated oral health was 33.2\%
   (95\% CI 29.8; 36.6). In the adjusted analysis, being of an older age,
   self-classifying as light-skinned black, lower education, the most
   recent dental appointment being three years or more ago, attending
   public dental surgeries, having less than 10 natural teeth in at least
   one arch, self-reporting need for dental treatment, reporting dry mouth,
   and difficulty eating due to tooth problems were associated with
   negative self-rated oral health.
   CONCLUSIONS: Self-rated oral health reflects social inequalities in
   health, and it is associated with low socioeconomic status, less
   frequent use of dental services and poorer self-reported oral health
   conditions.}},

Journal = {{AIAA JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{58}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{939-948}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Elishakoff et al. once proposed a novel physics-based, low-frequency
   correction to the Timoshenko-Ehrenfest beam theory. The corrected beam
   theory is simpler than the classical one because it leads to a single
   frequency series in the vibrating analysis, without loss of the effect
   of shear deformation and rotary inertia. In this paper, a further
   modification is proposed based on Elishakoff's correction such that the
   resulting single frequency series fits quite well with the first branch
   of the Timoshenko-Ehrenfest beam theory up to a relatively high
   frequency (i.e., the cutoff frequency of Timoshenko-Ehrenfest beams).
   Most strikingly, the present modification is found to be suitable not
   only for homogeneous and uniform beams but also for a wide class of beam
   structures with axial inhomogeneity and/or variable cross section. An
   inhomogeneous and nonuniform beam with two sharp ends is analytically
   studied in detail using several different engineering beam models, which
   fully verifies the necessity and high accuracy of the present
   modification, particularly for beam structures composed of materials
   with negative Poisson's ratio.}},

Title = {{Fit of aggregation models to the distribution of group sizes in
   Northwest Atlantic seabirds}},
Journal = {{MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{425}},
Pages = {{261-268}},
Abstract = {{Many species of animals live in groups, but the mechanisms responsible
   for the formation and cohesion of groups are not well known and have not
   often been quantified. Different models of aggregations, all making
   unique assumptions about rates of arrivals to and departures from
   groups, produce different group size distributions. Fitting such models
   to empirical distributions of group sizes can provide insights into the
   mechanisms that underlie aggregations in animals. Four models predicting
   the distribution of group sizes (the power law, Poisson, exponential and
   negative binomial models) were tested in 7 species of Northwest Atlantic
   seabirds using maximum-likelihood estimation and a random factor to
   control for differences in mean group size among seabird surveys. Of the
   4 models tested, the power law ranked first in most species in terms of
   raw Akaike's information criterion values. Nevertheless,
   likelihood-ratio tests revealed that the power law and the negative
   binomial model, which ranked second in most species, often provided a
   statistically similar fit to the data. Goodness-of-fit tests revealed a
   rather good fit of these models to the data. The finding that
   aggregation models can apply to the distribution of group sizes offers
   the opportunity to examine quantitatively the mechanisms or underlying
   processes that give rise to aggregations in seabirds and possibly other
   animals.}},

Abstract = {{The spatio-temporal patterns of spotted wilt disease in peanut, caused
   by thrips-vectored tomato spotted wilt tospovirus (TSWV), were analyzed
   by several methods. The spatial distributions of symptomatic plants were
   mapped at 2-wk intervals during two consecutive years in fields of the
   susceptible peanut cultivar Florunner and in the resistant cultivar
   Southern Runner. The disease frequency data were subjected to quadrat
   analyses, including indices of dispersion (variance/mean ratio and the
   negative binomial k parameter), comparison of frequency distributions of
   symptomatic plants to expected distributions derived from several models
   of spatial dispersion (binomial, Poisson, and negative binomial), and
   two-dimensional distance class analysis at each sampling interval.
   Although significant spatial aggregation of diseased plants was detected
   in most samples, random or nearly random clusters of infected plants
   that apparently arose from a continuous immigration of viruliferous
   vectors dominated spatial aspects of epidemic progress. Aside from
   smaller incidence of disease in the resistant compared to the
   susceptible cultivar, no effect of cultivar was noted in relation to
   spatial or temporal patterns of disease development in this pathosystem.
   Spotted wilt temporal progress was well described by monomolecular
   models of disease progress in each cultivar and year. The data and
   analyses were consistent with the hypothesis that most infections arise
   as a result of primary transmission and that there is limited secondary
   spread of TSWV after it becomes established in the field.}},

   between 2000 and 2016 for 4900 AIPA and 482 250 NHW cases diagnosed

   women, increased with age and the rate of increase declined after age of
   46 years. AIPA women were diagnosed at significantly younger age (mean
   (SD) = 54.5 (13.3) years) than NHW women (mean (SD) = 62 (14) years, P <

Abstract = {{Architected materials that consist of periodic arrangements of nodes and
   struts are lightweight and can exhibit combinations of properties (such
   as negative Poisson ratios) that do not occur in conventional solids.
   Architected materials reported previously are usually constructed from
   identical `unit cells' arranged so that they all have the same
   orientation. As a result, when loaded beyond the yield point, localized
   bands of high stress emerge, causing catastrophic collapse of the
   mechanical strength of the material. This `post-yielding collapse' is
   analogous to the rapid decreases in stress associated with dislocation
   slip in metallic single crystals. Here we use the hardening mechanisms
   found in crystalline materials to develop architected materials that are
   robust and damage-tolerant, by mimicking the microscale structure of
   crystalline materials-such as grain boundaries, precipitates and phases.
   The crystal-inspired mesoscale structures in our architected materials
   are as important for their mechanical properties as are crystallographic
   microstructures in metallic alloys. Our approach combines the hardening
   principles of metallurgy and architected materials, enabling the design
   of materials with desired properties.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To estimate the prevalence and severity of malocclusion and
   test a possible association with negative impacts on quality of life of
   schoolchildren in Tubarao, Brazil.
   Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on a
   representative sample (n = 389) of schoolchildren. Data on oral
   health-related quality of life were obtained through the Oral Impacts on
   Daily Performance (OIDP) scale. The malocclusion indicator was the
   Dental Aesthetic Index (DAI). Prevalence ratios were estimated using
   log-linear Poisson regression with a robust estimator.
   Results: The prevalence of class II, III, and IV malocclusion was
   57.3\%. The most common dental condition was overjet greater than 3 mm.
   Girls and older schoolchildren showed statistically significantly higher
   prevalence of all classes of malocclusion. There were no statistically
   significant associations between the most frequent malocclusions and
   dimensions of the impact indicator, except for the presence of overjet
   greater than 3 mm that was associated the `cleaning teeth' dimension.
   Conclusion: The prevalence of malocclusion was high, but was not
   statistically significantly associated with impact on oral
   health-related quality of life.}},

   GaN/AlGaN(0001) two-barrier structures are studied by solving the

   the internal fields manifest themselves in the asymmetry of the

   well compensate each other, resulting in smaller shifts of potential and
   resonance levels in the active region with voltage, in the higher
   resistance of the structure, and in the linear current-voltage
   dependence within a wide range of voltages. When the internal and

Abstract = {{Electroviscous and thermal effects on steady, fully developed, combined
   pressure driven and electroosmotic flow of power-law liquids through a
   uniform microannulus subject to uniform wall heat flux are studied
   numerically by solving the Poisson-Boltzmann, momentum and energy
   equations using a finite difference method. Considering the
   Poisson-Boltzmann equation in the exact form without using the
   Debye-Huckel approximation and taking into account phenomena such as
   viscous dissipation and Joule heating in the energy equation, influences
   of major parameters, namely, the radius ratio of the annuli, flow
   behavior index, dimensionless pressure gradient, dimensionless electric
   force, dimensionless wall zeta potential, Debye-Huckel parameter,
   Brinkman number, and Joule number on the velocity and temperature
   distributions as well as the Nusselt number are discussed. The results
   reveal that higher velocities exist in case of pressure assisted flow
   compared to the purely electroosmotic and pressure opposed flows.
   Moreover, in the presence of a favorable pressure gradient, the system
   experiences the maximum absolute dimensionless temperature. Also, at
   higher values of the Debye-Huckel parameter, the effect of the
   non-Newtonian behavior on the thermal characteristics of the flow
   reduces. As for the Nusselt number, depending on the value of the flow
   parameters some singularities may occur in the Nusselt profile at the
   inner wall for the pressure assisted shear-thinning and shear-thickening
   flows in case of wall cooling. In addition, the effect of Joule heating
   on the inner Nusselt number diminishes as the value of the dimensionless
   electric force approaches relatively high positive or negative values,
   independent of the value of the flow behavior index. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Aim: To investigate the relationship between maternal depression and
   childhood caries in a cohort of adolescent mothers. Methods: This
   cross-sectional study nested in a cohort evaluated a sample of 538
   mother/child dyads. When the children were 24-36 months of age, data
   regarding oral health from children and mothers were collected by
   clinical dental examination. A mother's major depressive disorder was
   assessed by using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview
   (MINI {[}Plus]), at the current moment. Independent variables were
   obtained by using questionnaires. The outcome on dental caries
   experience was dichotomized by using 2 cut points: dmfs >= 1 and dmfs >=
   3. Poisson regression analysis, using a hierarchical approach, was
   applied to assess the association between major depressive disorder in
   mothers with and those without caries experience and the outcome.
   Results: The prevalence of dental caries in children was 15.1\% (n =
   82). The mean dmfs index was 1.12 (SD = 3.72). The prevalence of major
   depressive disorder was 32.6\% (n = 168). An interaction between caries
   status and depressive disorder was found, and after adjusted analysis,
   children from mothers with major depressive disorder with negative
   caries experience presented a higher caries prevalence (prevalence ratio
   4.00, 95\% confidence interval 1.29-12.41). Conclusion: Our findings
   suggest that maternal psychiatric disorders could have a negative impact
   on children's oral health. (C) 2016 S. Karger AG, Basel}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the present study was to assess the impact of malocclusion on
   oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) among preschool children
   and their families. This study involved 732 preschoolers.
   Parents/caregivers filled out the Brazilian version of the Early
   Childhood Oral Health Impact Scale (B-ECOHIS) and a questionnaire
   addressing sociodemographic data. Overbite, overjet, and crossbite were
   recorded during the clinical examination. Bivariate and multiple Poisson
   regression analyses were performed and prevalence ratio (PR) were
   calculated (alpha=5\%). The prevalence of negative impact from
   malocclusion on OHRQoL was 27.6\% among the children and 22.3\% among
   the families. Mother's schooling (PR=1.37; 95\% CI: 1.10-1.70),
   parent's/caregiver's assessment of child's oral health (PR=2.07; 95\%
   CI: 1.60-2.58), history of toothache (PR=3.84; 95\% CI: 2.34-6.30), and
   visits to the dentist (PR=0.59; 95\% CI: 0.37-0.94) remained
   significantly associated with OHRQoL in the final model for the
   children, whereas parent's/caregiver's assessment of child's oral health
   (PR=2.32; 95\% CI: 1.71-3.14) and history of toothache (PR=2.28; 95\%
   CI: 1.69-3.09) remained significantly associated with OHRQoL for the
   families. Malocclusion was not associated with a negative impact on
   OHRQoL. In contrast, parents'/caregivers' perceptions regarding the oral
   health of their children and a history of toothache were predictors of a
   negative impact on the OHRQoL.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To establish whether multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, who

   neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) and subsequently revert from a
   NAb-positive to a NAb-negative state under continued IFN-beta-1b
   therapy, regain clinical effect after reversion.
   Background Several studies have shown that a significant proportion of
   patients treated with IFN-beta develop NAbs that hamper or abolish the
   therapeutic effect of IFN-beta. However, some patients, who become
   NAb-positive under treatment with IFN-beta-1b, may revert to a
   NAb-negative state under continuous treatment.
   Methods We identified 40 patients from the Danish IFN protocol, who
   fulfilled the criteria: NAb-positive status for at least 12 months
   followed by reversion to NAb-negative state for at least 12 months. For
   comparison, we included 64 matching cases that had remained NAb-negative
   during an observation time of at least 36 months. The two groups were
   clinically and demographically alike. We measured NAb-neutralizing
   capacity using a clinically validated cytopathic effect assay. A blood
   sample with a neutralizing capacity of 20\% or more was considered as
   NAb-positive. A patient was defined as NAb-positive after two
   consecutive blood tests separated by at least 6 months. Reversion to a
   NAb-negative state required at least two consecutive negative tests. To
   allow for the confounding effect of time we employed a mixed Poisson
   model.
   Results Patients who had been NAb-positive and reverted to a
   NAb-negative state regained treatment effect with the relapse rate as
   before the NAb-positive period adjusting for the effect of time, and the
   relapse rate was the same as in the permanently NAb-negative patients in
   corresponding time periods. The relapse rate ratio comparing the
   NAb-positive with the NAb-negative periods was 1.98 (95\% confidence
   interval: 1.32 -2.97).
   Conclusion Under NAb-positive periods, the clinical effect of IFN-beta
   was abolished. When NAbs disappeared spontaneously under continued
   treatment, patients regained the full effect of INF-beta-1b therapy with
   no negative carry-over effect from the previous NAb-positive period.}},

Abstract = {{Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were carried out to study the
   stress-strain diagrams of crystalline and amorphous silica under
   different nonequilibrium conditions. The responses of a tensile load
   were recorded in two cases. In one case, the system was not allowed to
   relax along the transverse direction (null Poisson's ratio), while in
   the other case, the deformations were allowed in directions
   perpendicular to the strained one. The higher strength of crystalline
   silica as compared to amorphous silica resulted from a different
   distribution of ring sizes. The results obtained for the inert failure
   strains and intrinsic strength of the silica glass were in good
   agreement with the experimental data, and the nonlinear elastic behavior
   of the glass was reproduced along with the effects of strain rate and
   temperature variation. Elastic properties extracted from stress-strain
   diagrams also were compared with the properties calculated by means of
   static methods and with experimental data.}},

Abstract = {{Collapsibility deals with the conditions under which a conditional (on a
   covariate W) measure of association between two random variables Y and X
   equals the marginal measure of association. In this paper, we discuss
   the average collapsibility of certain well-known measures of
   association, and also with respect to a new measure of association. The
   concept of average collapsibility is more general than collapsibility,
   and requires that the conditional average of an association measure
   equals the corresponding marginal measure. Sufficient conditions for the
   average collapsibility of the association measures are obtained. Some
   interesting counterexamples are constructed and applications to linear,
   Poisson, logistic and negative binomial regression models are discussed.
   An extension to the case of multivariate covariate W is also analyzed.
   Finally, we discuss the collapsibility conditions of some dependence
   measures for survival models and illustrate them for the case of linear
   transformation models.}},

Title = {{Topological design of microstructures using periodic material- fi eld
   series-expansion and gradient-free optimization algorithm}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{199}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{Light-weight cellular materials with periodic repetitive microstructures
   are widely used in various fields due to their superior
   mechanical/multi-physical performances. As the microstructural design
   problem is known to have multiple local minima, most gradient-based
   topology optimization methods significantly depend on the initial guess
   of the microstructural geometry, thus requiring the designer's
   experiences. This paper presents an effective gradient-free framework
   for periodic microstructure design, which exhibits powerful global
   searching capabilities and requires no sensitivity information. The
   proposed framework combines the material-field series-expansion (MFSE)
   topology representation of periodic microstructures and the sequential
   Kriging-based optimization algorithm. The MFSE method decouples the
   topological representation from the finite element discretization, and
   describes a relatively complex microstructural topology with
   high-quality boundary description using a greatly reduced number of
   design variables. Based on the Kriging surrogate model, a solution
   scheme is suggested to solve material microstructural topology
   optimization successively in a sequence of sub optimization problems
   with self-adaptive design spaces. With the present gradient-free
   optimization method, high-performance cellular materials that approach
   the H-S upper bound with porosities from 0.2 to 0.6, or that achieve
   negative Poisson's ratios of-0.94 in the principal directions for
   materials with square symmetry, are obtained without prior knowledge of
   the optimum microstructural topology.

Abstract = {{Soil nitrogen and phosphorus are commonly limiting elements affecting
   plant species richness in temperate zones. Our species
   richness-ecological study was performed in alder-dominated forests
   representing temperate floodplains (streamside alder forests of Alnion
   incanae alliance) and swamp forests (alder carrs of Alnion glutinosae
   alliance) in the Western Carpathians. Species richness (i.e., the number
   of vascular plants in a vegetation plot) was analyzed separately for
   native and alien vascular plants in 240 vegetation plots across the
   study area covering Slovakia, northern Hungary and southern Poland. The
   relationship between the species richness of each plant group and total
   soil nitrogen content, plant-available phosphorus and carbon to nitrogen
   (C/N) ratio was analyzed by generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) with
   Poisson error distribution and log-link function. The number of recorded
   native and alien species was 17-84 (average 45.4) and 0-9 (average 1.5)
   species per plot, respectively. The GLMMs were statistically significant
   (p < 0.001) for both plant groups, but the total explained variation was
   higher for native (14\%) than alien plants (9\%). The richness of native
   species was negatively affected by the total soil nitrogen content and
   plant-available phosphorus, whereas the C/N ratio showed a positive
   impact. The alien richness was predicted only by the total soil nitrogen
   content showing a negative effect.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of dental
   caries experience and the components of the decayed, missing and filled
   teeth (DMFT) index on oral health related quality of life (OHRQoL) among
   adolescents in southern Brazil. A cross-sectional study was conducted
   with 509 adolescents aged 11-14 years enrolled at public schools in the
   municipality of Osorio (southern Brazil). A calibrated examiner
   performed the clinical examination for caries (World Health
   Organization: DMFT index), malocclusion (Dental Aesthetic Index) and
   traumatic dental injuries {[}Andreasen et al., 2007]. The participants
   answered the Brazilian version of the Child Perceptions Questionnaire
   (CPQ(11.-14)) - Impact Short Form, and their parents/guardians answered
   a structured questionnaire addressing demographic and socioeconomic
   characteristics. Data analysis involved Poisson regression with robust
   variance, with the calculation of rate ratios adjusted for potential
   confounding variables. High severity of dental caries experience exerted
   a significant impact on OHRQoL, even after controlling for socioeconomic
   and clinical factors (rate ratio 1.30; 95\% confidence interval, CI
   1.12-1.51). All OHRQoL domains were affected by untreated dental caries.
   The multivariate analysis demonstrated that the CPQ(11-14) scores were
   33\% higher among adolescents with untreated caries (rate ratio 1.33;
   95\% Cl 1.17-1.50) and 24\% higher among those with missing teeth (rate
   ratio 1.24; 95\% Cl 1.06-1.47). No difference in OHRQoL was found
   between adolescents with filled teeth and those without dental caries.
   In conclusion, dental caries experience, untreated dental caries and
   missing teeth exerted a negative impact on OHRQoL among the adolescents.

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{JUN 17}},
Abstract = {{Introduction Men who have sex with men and transgender individuals
   (MSM/TG) carry a disproportionately high burden of HIV, including in
   South Africa. However, there are few empirical population-representative
   estimates of viral suppression and the HIV care cascade including HIV
   testing among this population, nor of factors associated with these
   outcomes. Methods We conducted a respondent driven sampling (RDS) survey
   among 301 MSM/TG in Johannesburg in 2017. Participants gave blood
   samples for HIV testing and viral load. Participants self-completed a
   survey including sociodemographics, HIV testing history, and engagement
   in care. We calculated RDS-II weighted estimates of the percentage of
   HIV-negative MSM/TG reporting HIV testing in the previous 6 months,
   their testing experience and preferences. Among those HIV-positive, we
   estimated the percentage status-aware, on ART, and virally suppressed
   (<50 viral copies/ml plasma). We conducted RDS-weighted robust Poisson
   regression to obtain weighted prevalence ratios of factors associated
   with 1) HIV testing among those HIV-negative; and 2) viral suppression
   among those HIV-positive. Results There were 118/300 HIV-positive
   MSM/TG, (37.5\%). Of the HIV-negative MSM/TG, 61.5\% reported that they
   had tested for HIV in the previous 6 months, which was associated with
   selling sex to men (Prevalence Ratio = 1.67, 95\% CI 1.36-2.05). There
   were 76/118 HIV-positive MSM/TG (56.5\%) who reported having previously
   tested positive for HIV and 39/118 (30.0\%) who reported current ART.
   There were 58/118 HIV-positive MSM/TG with viral loads <50 copies/ml
   plasma (46.9\%). Viral suppression was associated with older age
   (adjusted PR = 1.03, 95\% CI 1.00-1.06 for each year), neighbourhood,
   and having bought sex from men (adjusted PR = 1.53, 95\% CI 1.12-2.08).
   Conclusions HIV prevalence was very high. Viral suppression among those
   HIV-positive was similar to the general male population in South Africa,
   but remains far short of national and international targets. A majority
   of HIV-negative MSM/TG had HIV tested in the previous 6 months, though
   there is room for improvement.}},

Abstract = {{Background HIV acquisition is significantly higher during pregnancy than
   in the postpartum period. We did a prospective study to estimate HIV
   incidence rates during pregnancy and lactation.
   Methods We assessed 2188 HIV-negative sexually active women with 2625
   exposure intervals during pregnancy and 2887 intervals during
   breastfeeding, and 8473 non-pregnant and non-lactating women with 24 258
   exposure intervals. Outcomes were HIV incidence rates per 100 person
   years and incidence rate ratios estimated by Poisson multivariate
   regression, with the non-pregnant or non-lactating women as the
   reference group. We also assessed the husbands of the married women to
   study male risk behaviours.
   Findings HIV incidence rates were 2.3 per 100 person years during
   pregnancy, 1.3 per 100 person years during breastfeeding, and 1.1 per
   100 person years in the non-pregnant and non-lactating women. The
   adjusted incidence rate ratios were 2.16 (95\% Cl 1 . 39-3.37) during
   pregnancy and 1 . 16 (0.82-1.63) during breastfeeding. Pregnant women
   and their male partners reported significantly fewer external sexual
   partners than did the other groups. in married pregnant women who had a
   sexual relationship with their male spouses, the HIV incidence rate
   ratio was 1.36 (0.63-2.93). in married pregnant women in HIV-discordant
   relationships (ie, with HIV-positive men) the incidence rate ratio was
   1.76 (0.62-4.03).
   Interpretation The risk of HIV acquisition rises during pregnancy. This
   change is unlikely to be due to sexual risk behaviours, but might be
   attributable to hormonal changes affecting the genital tract mucosa or
   immune responses. HIV prevention efforts are needed during pregnancy to
   protect mothers and their infants.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of feature selection in text classification is to choose highly
   distinguishing features for, improving the performance of a classifier.
   The well-known text classification feature selection metric named
   balanced accuracy measure (ACC2) (Forman, 2003) evaluates a term by
   taking the difference of its document frequency in the positive class
   (also known as true positives) and its document frequency in the
   negative class (also known as false positives). This however results in
   assigning equal ranks to terms having equal difference, ignoring their
   relative document frequencies in the classes. In this paper we propose a
   new feature ranking (FR) metric, called normalized difference measure
   (NDM), which takes into account the relative document frequencies. The
   performance of NDM is investigated against seven well known feature
   ranking metrics including odds ratio (OR), chi squared (CHI),
   information gain (IG), distinguishing feature selector (DFS), gini index
   (GINI),balanced accuracy measure (ACC2) and Poisson ratio (POIS) on
   seven datasets namely We-bACE(WAP,K1a,K1b), Reuters (REO, RE1),spam
   email dataset and 20 newsgroups using the multinomial naive Bayes (MNB)
   and supports vector machines (SVM) classifiers. Our results show that
   the NDM metric outperforms the seven metrics in 66\% cases in terms of
   macro-Fl measure and in 51\% cases in terms of micro F1 measure in our
   experimental trials on these datasets. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{If a solid body is deformed along one direction, by a uniaxial applied
   stress for instance, then strains will also be induced in perpendicular
   directions.  The negative ratio of the induced strain to the applied
   strain is known as the Poisson ratio.  Analysis of the elasticity tensor
   relating stress and strain within a solid shows that if the induced
   strain is restricted, then a greater stress is required to produce the
   same strain; it appears stiffer.  Many biological materials with a
   mechanical function are subject to forces which are primarily uniaxial. 
   This mechanism appears to be used to maximize the uniaxial load-bearing
   properties of some of these materials.  Muscles are commonly surrounded
   by strong sheets of connective tissue which will constrain the lateral
   expansion of the muscle as it contracts.  This increases the stress in
   the muscle for a given strain, and hence the load it can support. 
   Similarly, cancellous bone is normally surrounded by a shell of much
   stronger compact bone and this effectively increases the stiffness of
   the cancellous bone without the penalty of increasing the mass, as would
   be the case if the same stiffening was produced by increasing the degree
   of calcification.  It also has important implications for the failure of
   bone, which is largely a function of strain rather than stress.}},

Abstract = {{Background The incidence of non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSCs), including
   basal cell (BCC) or squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), is not well
   documented among HIV-positive (HIV+) individuals.
   Methods We identified 6560 HIV+ and 36 821 HIV(-)negative (HIV-)
   non-Hispanic white adults who were enrolled and followed up in Kaiser
   Permanente Northern California from 1996 to 2008. The first
   biopsy-proven NMSCs diagnosed during follow-up were identified from
   pathology records. Poisson models estimated rate ratios that compared
   HIV+ (overall and stratified by recent CD4 T-cell counts and serum HIV
   RNA levels) with HIV(-)subjects and were adjusted for age, sex, smoking
   history, obesity diagnosis history, and census-based household income.
   Sensitivity analyses were adjusted for outpatient visits (ie, a proxy
   for screening). All statistical tests were two-sided.
   Results The NMSC incidence rate was 1426 and 766 per 100 000
   person-years for HIV+ and HIV- individuals, respectively, which
   corresponds with an adjusted rate ratio of 2.1 (95\% confidence interval
   {[}CI] = 1.9 to 2.3). Similarly, the adjusted rate ratio for HIV+ vs
   HIV- subjects was 2.6 (95\% CI = 2.1 to 3.2) for SCCs, and it was 2.1
   (95\% CI = 1.8 to 2.3) for BCCs. There was a statistically significant
   trend of higher rate ratios with lower recent CD4 counts among HIV+
   subjects compared with HIV- subjects for SCCs (P-trend < .001).
   Adjustment for number of outpatient visits did not affect the results.
   Conclusion HIV+ subjects had a twofold higher incidence rate of NMSCs
   compared with HIV(-)subjects. SCCs but not BCCs were associated with
   immunodeficiency. J Natl Cancer Inst; 2013;105:350-360}},

Abstract = {{The authors investigated the association between schizophrenia and
   rheumatoid arthritis.
   The design is a population-based case-control and follow-up study. The
   cases were 20495 patients admitted for schizophrenia and registered in
   the Danish Psychiatric Case Register. A total of 204912 persons matched
   on age and gender and chosen from the general population served as
   controls. Admissions for rheumatoid arthritis and other non-autoimmune,
   musculoskeletal disorders were checked in the Danish National Patient
   Register. Odds ratios and relative risks were estimated by the
   Mantel-Haenszel estimator and Poisson regression. The same analyses were
   carried out for 10242 patients with bipolar affective disorder and
   102420 controls for comparison. Individuals with schizophrenia had a
   reduced risk for being admitted with rheumatoid arthritis {[}odds ratio
   0.44 (CI 0.24-0.81)] in the case-control study. A similar result was
   found in the follow-up study, but the incidence of the degenerative
   disorders in the musculoskeletal system was equally significantly lower
   in both studies. The incidence of rheumatoid arthritis among the bipolar
   patients was the same as in the control population. The negative
   association between schizophrenia and rheumatoid arthritis may thus be
   the result of ascertainment bias and selection due to under reporting
   and treatment of the medical illness. Clinicians are reminded of the
   difficulties in detecting medical illness among individuals with
   schizophrenia. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The anode region of the vacuum-arc discharge in an external magnetic
   field is studied with allowance for the dependence of the negative anode

   v (i) {*} (0)of ions incoming to the anode layer at which the electric
   field vanishes at a single point inside the layer. The velocity v (i)
   {*} (0) determines the boundary of the existence of the stationary anode

Abstract = {{Background Cross-sectional studies have shown that intimate partner
   violence and gender inequity in relationships are associated with
   increased prevalence of HIV in women. Yet temporal sequence and
   causality have been questioned, and few HIV prevention programmes
   address these issues. We assessed whether intimate partner violence and
   relationship power inequity increase risk of incident HIV infection in
   South African women.
   Methods We did a longitudinal analysis of data from a previously
   published cluster-randomised controlled trial undertaken in the Eastern
   Cape province of South Africa in 2002-06. 1099 women aged 15-26 years
   who were HIV negative at baseline and had at least one additional HIV
   test over 2 years of follow-up were included in the analysis. Gender
   power equity and intimate partner violence were measured by a sexual
   relationship power scale and the WHO violence against women instrument,
   respectively. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of HIV acquisition at 2 years
   were derived from Poisson models, adjusted for study design and herpes
   simplex virus type 2 infection, and used to calculate population
   attributable fractions.
   Findings 128 women acquired HIV during 2076 person-years of follow-up
   (incidence 6.2 per 100 person-years). 51 of 325 women with low
   relationship power equity at baseline acquired HIV (8.5 per 100

Title = {{Practical assessment of the models for identification of defect-prone

Abstract = {{The goal of this paper is to investigate and assess the ability of
   explanatory models based on design metrics to describe and predict
   defect counts in an object-oriented software system. Specifically, we
   empirically evaluate the influence of design decisions to defect
   behavior of the classes in two products from the commercial software
   domain. Information provided by these models can help in resource
   allocation and serve as a base for assessment and future improvements.
   We use innovative statistical methods to deal with the peculiarities of
   the software engineering data, such as non-normally distributed count
   data. To deal with overdispersed data and excess of zeroes in the
   dependent variable, we use negative binomial (NB) and zero-inflated NB
   regression in addition to Poisson regression.
   Furthermore, we form a framework for comparison of models' descriptive
   and predictive ability. Predictive capability of the models to identify
   most critical classes in the system early in the software development
   process can help in allocation of resources and foster software quality
   improvement. In addition to the correlation coefficients, we use
   additional statistics to assess a models' ability to explain high
   variability in the data and Pareto analysis to assess a models' ability
   to identify the most critical classes in the system.
   Results indicate that design aspects related to communication between
   classes and inheritance can be used as indicators of the most
   defect-prone classes, which require the majority of resources in
   development and testing phases. The zero-inflated negative binomial
   regression model, designed to explicitly model the occurrence of zero
   counts in the dataset, provides the best results for this purpose. (C)

   Observational Study}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 5}},
Abstract = {{We evaluated the relationship between breast cancer survival and
   deprivation using data from the Irish National Cancer Registry.
   Cause-specific survival was compared between five area-based
   socioeconomic deprivation strata using Cox regression. Patient and
   tumour characteristics and treatment were compared using modified
   Poisson regression with robust variance estimation. Based on 21356
   patients diagnosed 1999-2008, age-standardized five-year survival
   averaged 80\% in the least deprived and 75\% in the most deprived
   stratum. Age-adjusted mortality risk was 33\% higher in the most
   deprived group (hazard ratio 1.33, 95\% CI 1.21-1.45, P<0.001). The most
   deprived groups were more likely to present with advanced stage, high
   grade or hormone receptor-negative cancer, symptomatically, or with
   significant comorbidity, and to be smokers or unmarried, and less likely
   to have breast-conserving surgery. Cox modelling suggested that the
   available data on patient, tumour and treatment factors could account
   for only about half of the survival disparity (adjusted hazard ratio
   1.18, 95\% CI 0.97-1.43, P = 0.093). Survival disparity did not diminish
   over time, compared with the period 1994-1998. Persistent survival
   disparities among Irish breast cancer patients suggest unequal use of or
   access to services and highlight the need for further research to
   understand and remove the behavioural or other barriers involved.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Klebsiella pneumoniae causes serious, life-threatening
   infections in humans in endemic and epidemic settings. The objective of
   this study was to determine whether the incidence of K. pneumoniae
   bloodstream infection (BSI) was higher during warm months.
   Methods. We analyzed surveillance data from 2001-2006 at 4 hospitals
   located on 4 continents. Incidence rates (IRs) and IR ratios (IRRs) were
   determined using multivariable Poisson regression.
   Results. In total, 1189 cases of K. pneumonia BSIs occurred during
   6,671,337 patient-days. The IR of K. pneumoniae BSI during the 4 warmest
   months of the year was 2.23/10,000 patient-days, whereas the IR of K.
   pneumoniae BSI for the other 8 months was 1.55/10,000 patient-days (IRR,
   1.46 {[}95\% confidence interval, 1.04-2.06]; P = .03). In contrast, no
   seasonal variation was identified in rates of BSI due to Enterobacter or
   Serratia species. Using Poisson regression, we showed that temperature
   (P < .0001) and dew point (a marker for relative humidity; P < .0001)
   were both linearly predictive of increasing rates of K. pneumoniae BSI.
   Conclusions. Environmental pressures may lead to an increase in the IR
   of K. pneumoniae BSI during the warmest months of the year.}},

Journal = {{SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{151}},
Number = {{1-3}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Randomized trials targeting cannabis use disorders in
   patients with psychosis have generally been unsuccessful. One of the
   largest such trials was the CapOpus trial, which had an impact on the
   number of monthly joints used, but not on the number of days with
   cannabis use or positive or negative symptoms.
   Objective: To investigate the effects of CapOpus on psychiatric
   treatment.
   Methods: Six-month randomized trial on participants meeting ICD-10
   criteria for cannabis use disorder and schizophrenia-spectrum psychosis.
   Participants were randomized to treatment as usual (TAU, n = 51) alone
   versus TAU plus CapOpus (n = 52) consisting of motivational interviewing
   and cognitive behavior therapy. Data regarding psychiatric treatment was
   obtained from complete nationwide registers. Analyses were
   intention-to-treat. Cox and poisson regression were used as appropriate.
   Results: Compared with treatment as usual, participants in the CapOpus
   group had an overall higher risk of having a psychiatric emergency room
   contact (hazard ratio 2.02, 95\% confidence interval 1.22-3.34).
   Participants in CapOpus also had more contacts with psychiatric
   emergency rooms (incidence rate ratio 3.47 (2.64-4.57)) and more
   admissions to psychiatric hospitals (incidence rate ratio 2.24
   (1.65-3.03)); conversely, CapOpus-participants spent fewer days admitted
   to psychiatric hospitals than treatment-as-usual participants (incidence
   rate ratio 0.72 (0.68-0.75)).
   Conclusions: CapOpus led to earlier and more psychiatric emergency room
   contacts and admissions that, however, were of fewer days. This pattern
   could indicate that participants receiving treatment as usual were
   inadequately treated. However, it cannot be excluded that the
   differences might be an adverse reaction to the psychosocial
   intervention. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In a recent paper by Ting and Chen {[}18] it was shown by examples that

   materials. With the exception of cubic materials, the examples presented
   involve a very large transverse strain. We show here that a very large
   Poisson's ratio with a bounded transverse strain exists for all
   anisotropic elastic materials. The large Poisson's ratio with a bounded
   transverse strain occurs when the axial strain is in the direction very
   near or at the direction along which Young's modulus is very large. In
   fact the transverse strain has to be very small for the material to be
   stable. If the non-dimensionalized Young's modulus is of the order
   delta(-1), where delta is very small, the axial strain, the transverse
   strain and Poisson's ratio are of the order delta, delta(1/ 2) and
   delta(-1/ 2), respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Two examples of charged media in water are studied by numerical
   simulations: aqueous solutions of highly asymmetrical electrolytes
   (large and highly charged spherical particles Surrounded by small and
   slightly charged counterions) and a swelling clay (charged plane sheets
   surrounded by small counterions). In the former example. Brownian
   dynamics (BID) showed that the mean number of counterions in the
   vicinity of polyions nearly balances the charge of the macroion and that
   the turnover of the small ions in this region is important. The effect
   of hydrodynamic interactions on the dynamics is weak for small ions but
   is great for macroions. On the other hand, the relative decrease of the
   macroion self-diffusion coefficients is more important than that of
   counterions. Moreover, the small ions retain a relatively high
   self-diffusion coefficient at the highest concentration, a concentration
   at which the macroions freeze. BD simulation was also used to obtain the
   distribution of counterions Na+ between the sheets of a fairly hydrated
   montmorillonite. The obtained profile was very similar to those we
   obtained by atomic simulations (Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics) and
   by a Poisson-Boltzmann treatment. It justifies the description of the
   solvent as a continuum as soon as the system is hydrated enough.
   However, for less hydrated states of the clay (mono- or bi-layer of
   water), only atomic simulations can bring exploitable information. We
   showed that, according to whether the counterion is Na+ and/or Cs+, the
   behaviours in the bihydrated clay are very different: although Na+ is
   easily hydrated and is located in the middle of the pores, Cs+ remains
   close to the negative surfaces of the sheets and its preferential paths
   along the surface sites can be underscored from obtained trajectories.}},

   clinical-functional vulnerability were identified by multiple analysis
   of Poisson regression with robust variance.
   RESULTS: Kappa statistics was 0.599 and Pearson's correlation
   coefficient 0.755 (p < 0.001). The EFS found a 28.2\% prevalence of
   frailty, and the CFVI-20 found a 19.5\% prevalence of high risk of
   clinical-functional vulnerability. Age equal to or greater than 80
   years, history of stroke, polypharmacy, negative self-perceived health,
   fall in the past 12 months, and hospitalization in the past 12 months
   were variables associated with frailty in both instruments after
   multiple analysis. Less than four years of education, osteoarticular
   disease, and weight loss were associated with frailty only by EFS, and
   having a caregiver was associated with a high risk of
   clinical-functional vulnerability only by CFVI-20.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although the analyses show moderate agreement and strong
   positive correlation between the instruments, the indicated prevalence
   of frailty is discrepant. Our results attest the need to standardize the
   instrument for assessing frailty in community-dwelling older people.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundRacial disparities in cardiovascular disease (CVD) have been
   attributed in part to negative psychosocial factors. Prior studies have
   demonstrated associations between individual psychosocial factors and
   CVD risk factors, but little is known about their cumulative
   effects.MethodsUsing the Jackson Heart Study, we examined the
   cross-sectional associations of cumulative psychosocial factors with CVD
   risk factors among 5306 African Americans. We utilized multivariable
   Poisson regression to estimate sex-stratified prevalence ratios (PR 95\%
   confidence interval-CI) of obesity, hypertension and diabetes prevalence
   and hypertension and diabetes control with negative affect (cynicism,
   anger-in, anger-out, depressive symptoms and cumulative negative affect)
   and stress (global stress, weekly stress, major life events-MLEs and
   cumulative stress), adjusting for demographics, socioeconomic status,
   and behaviors.ResultsAfter full adjustment, high (vs. low) cumulative
   negative affect was associated with prevalent obesity among men (PR 1.36
   95\% CI 1.16-1.60), while high (vs. low) cumulative stress was similarly
   associated with obesity among men and women (PR 1.24 95\% CI 1.01-1.52
   and PR 1.13 95\% CI 1.03-1.23, respectively). Psychosocial factors were
   more strongly associated with prevalent hypertension and diabetes among
   men than women. For example, men who reported high cynicism had a 12\%
   increased prevalence of hypertension (PR 1.12, 95\% CI 1.03-1.23).
   Psychosocial factors were more strongly associated with lower
   hypertension and diabetes control for women than men. Women who reported
   high (vs. low) cynicism had a 38\% lower prevalence of hypertension
   control (PR 0.62, 95\% CI 0.46-0.84).ConclusionsCumulative psychosocial
   factors were associated with CVD risk factors and disease management
   among African Americans. The joint accumulation of psychosocial factors
   was more associated with risk factors for men than women.}},

Title = {{Elastic and failure characteristics of additive manufactured thin wall
   lattice structures with defects}},
Journal = {{THIN-WALLED STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{161}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The design and realization of lightweight thin wall lattice structures
   assisted by additive manufacturing (AM) has the potential for a broad
   range of engineering applications. Due to the more pronounced material
   and feature defects that commonly occur with AM lattice structures, the
   application of these structures are currently hindered by the lack of
   adequate understanding of the effects of material defects on various
   structural performance, including the fracture characteristics. In this
   work, an analytical modeling-based analysis was carried out with two
   types of lattice designs, including the re-entrant auxetic and the
   diamond structures, in order to understand the effect of material
   defects on the elastic and fracture characteristics of these structures.
   The material defect characteristics were represented by introducing
   material property variability (strength and elastic modulus) functions
   using stochastic normal distribution functions, which were
   experimentally established in this study. The models provided good
   predictions of various fracture characteristics of the lattice
   structures fabricated by laser powder bed fusion AM (L-PBF-AM) process.
   Furthermore, the models were employed to investigate the effect of
   varying material property variabilities on the fracture characteristics
   of the two types of lattice structures. The results showed that the
   existence of material property variability not only result in reduced
   initial fracture strength, but also lead to some unexpected
   characteristics such as the increase of retaining strength and the
   divergence of fracture patterns. In addition, it was found that the
   auxetic and diamond structures exhibit significantly different
   sensitivities to material property variabilities, which translates into
   various implications for their use in different potential applications.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Much debate remains regarding why certain countries
   experience dramatically higher winter mortality. Potential causative
   factors other than cold exposure have rarely been analysed.
   Comparatively less research exists on excess winter deaths in southern
   Europe. Multiple time series data on a variety of risk factors are
   analysed against seasonal-mortality patterns in 14 European countries to
   identify key relations
   Subjects and setting: Excess winter deaths ( all causes), 1988 - 97,
   EU-14.
   Design: Coefficients of seasonal variation in mortality are calculated
   for EU-14 using monthly mortality data. Comparable, longitudinal
   datasets on risk factors pertaining to climate, macroeconomy, health
   care, lifestyle, socioeconomics, and housing were also obtained. Poisson
   regression identifies seasonality relations over time.
   Results: Portugal suffers from the highest rates of excess winter
   mortality (28\%, CI = 25\% to 31\%) followed jointly by Spain (21\%, CI
   = 19\% to 23\%), and Ireland ( 21\%, CI = 18\% to 24\%). Cross country
   variations in mean winter environmental temperature ( regression
   coefficient (beta) = 0.27), mean winter relative humidity (beta = 0.54),
   parity adjusted per capita national income (beta = 1.08), per capita
   health expenditure (beta = 1.19), rates of income poverty (beta =
   20.47), inequality (beta = 0.97), deprivation (beta = 0.11), and fuel
   poverty (beta = 0.44), and several indicators of residential thermal
   standards are found to be significantly related to variations in
   relative excess winter mortality at the 5\% level. The strong, positive
   relation with environmental temperature and strong negative relation
   with thermal efficiency indicate that housing standards in southern and
   western Europe play strong parts in such seasonality.
   Conclusions: High seasonal mortality in southern and western Europe
   could be reduced through improved protection from the cold indoors,
   increased public spending on health care, and improved socioeconomic
   circumstances resulting in more equitable income distribution.}},

Abstract = {{Hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) seroconversion in chronic hepatitis B
   virus infection confers a favorable prognosis, but untoward outcomes may
   develop in some patients. The impact of the age of HBeAg seroconversion
   on prognosis is not clearly known. HBeAg-positive patients with
   biopsy-proven chronic hepatitis B were followed up long-term. Follow-up
   studies included liver biochemistry, alpha-fetoprotein, and
   ultrasonography every 3 to 6 months or more frequently if clinically
   indicated. Of the patients who underwent spontaneous HBeAg
   seroconversion, the incidences of HBeAg-negative hepatitis, cirrhosis,
   hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and hepatitis B surface antigen
   seroclearance were compared between patient groups with different ages
   at the time of HBeAg seroconversion using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis
   and Poisson regression model. Spontaneous HBeAg seroconversion was
   documented in 508 patients. Of the 483 patients who had no evidence of
   cirrhosis or HCC at the time of HBeAg seroconversion, HBeAg
   seroconversion occurred before age 30 in 218 patients (group A), between
   age 31 and 40 in 199 patients (group B), and after age 40 in 66 patients
   (group Q. The 15-year cumulative incidences of HBeAg-negative hepatitis,
   cirrhosis, and HCC increased with increasing age of HBeAg
   seroconversion, the lowest being in group A (31.2\%, 3.7\%, and 2.1\%,
   respectively) and highest being in group C (66.7\% {[}P < 0.0001],
   42.9\% {[}P < 0.0001], and 7.7\% {[}P = 0.29], respectively). The hazard
   ratio of HBeAg-negative hepatitis, cirrhosis, and HCC was 2.95, 17.6,
   and 5.22, respectively, in group C compared with group A. Conclusion:
   Patients with HBeAg seroconversion before age 30 have excellent
   prognosis, whereas patients with delayed HBeAg seroconversion after age
   40 have significantly higher incidences of HBeAg-negative hepatitis,

Journal = {{ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Metamaterials exhibit properties beyond those exhibited by conventional
   materials in conventional scenarios. These have been investigated both
   theoretically and experimentally at length. In many cases the
   underpinning physical understanding of metamaterials has greatly
   preceded our ability to manufacture constituent structures. However, the
   development of additive manufacturing techniques gives new possibilities
   for the fabrication of complex metamaterial structures, many of which
   cannot be realised through conventional fabrication methods. The
   literature to date contains contributions from a diverse group of
   researchers from the physical sciences, mathematics, and manufacturing
   technology in the creation of metamaterials for electromagnetic,
   acoustic and mechanical applications. It is proposed that additive
   manufacturing holds the key to realise the capabilities of this vibrant
   research community and permit the creation of new paradigms in
   fundamental structures but also exploitation through application. For
   this purpose, a literature review is presented which identifies key
   advances in metamaterials alongside additive manufacturing and proposes
   new opportunities for researchers to work together through intra/inter
   disciplinary research to realise structures which exhibit extraordinary
   behaviour(s). This review represents a comprehensive account of the
   state-of-the-art in the production of such metamaterials using additive
   manufacturing methods and highlights areas, which, based on trends
   observed in the literature, are worthy of further research and require a
   coordinated effort on behalf of the afore mentioned disciplines in order
   to advance the state-of-the-art.}},

Abstract = {{The dynamic mechanical responses of the ferroelastic materials under
   uniaxial straining and temperature cycling are studied via the
   Landau-type phase field model in two dimensions. The model may exhibit a
   single-well (double-well) energy profile when temperature is greater
   (less) than the critical temperature. Effective negative stiffness in
   the vicinity of the temperature-induced solid-solid phase transformation
   is numerically demonstrated through monotonic uniaxial straining on a
   single-domain ferroelastic under temperature cycling around the Curie
   temperature. Under sinusoidal uniaxial straining, the effective Young's
   modulus and damping, as indicated by the enclosed area of the
   stress-strain curve, may be largely increased due to the phase
   transition. Our calculated responses here are consistent with
   experimental data reported in the literature, as well as theoretical
   results based on the composite theory with inclusions assumed to have
   negative modulus. No negative stiffness values are directly assigned in
   our phase field model as the underlying physics of the order parameters,
   i.e., spontaneous strains, provides effective negative stiffness into
   the systems. (C) 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA, Weinheim}},

Abstract = {{A weighted equation based on the three-phase time-average and Wood
   equations is applied to derive a relationship between the compressional
   wave (P wave) velocity and the amount of hydrates filling the pore
   space. The proposed theory predicts accurate P wave velocities of marine
   sediments in the porosity range of 40-80\% and provides a practical
   means of estimating the amount of in situ hydrate using seismic
   velocity. The shear (S) wave velocity is derived under the assumption
   that the P to S wave velocity ratio of the hydrated sediments is
   proportional to the weighted average of the P to S wave velocity ratios
   of the constituent components of the sediment. In the case that all
   constituent components are known, a weighted equation using multiphase
   time-average and Wood equations is possible. However, this study showed
   that a three-phase equation with modified matrix velocity, compensated
   for the clay content, is sufficient to accurately predict the
   compressional wave velocities for the marine sediments. This theory was
   applied to the laboratory measurements of the P and S wave velocities in
   permafrost samples to infer the amount of ice in the unconsolidated
   sediment. The results are comparable to the results obtained by
   repeatedly applying the two-phase wave scattering theory. The theory
   predicts that the Poisson's ratio of the hydrated sediments decreases as
   the hydrate concentration increases and the porosity decreases. In
   consequence, the amplitude versus offset (AVO) data for the
   bottom-simulating reflections may reveal positive, negative, or no AVO
   anomalies depending on the concentration of hydrates in the sediments.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CARDIAC FAILURE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{25}},

Pages = {{2-9}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Background: Frailty reflects decreased resilience to physiological
   stressors; its prevalence and prognosis are not fully defined in heart
   failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).
   Methods: The Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) was prospectively
   obtained in 114 outpatients with HFpEF. The SPPB tests gait speed,
   tandem balance, and timed chair rises, each scored from 0 to 4 points.
   Severe and mild frailty were respectively defined as an SPPB score <= 6
   and 7-9 points. We used risk-adjusted logistic, Poisson, and negative
   binominal regression, respectively, to assess the relationship between
   SPPB score and risk of death or all-cause hospitalization, number of
   hospitalizations, and days hospitalized or dead longer than 6 months.
   Results: Patients were similar to other HFpEF cohorts (age 68 +/- 13
   years, 58\% female, body mass index 36 +/- 8 kg/m(2), multiple
   comorbidities). Mean SPPB score was 6.9 +/- 3.2, and 80\% of patients
   were at least mildly frail. Over a 6-month period, the SPPB score
   independently predicted death or all-cause hospitalization (odds ratio
   0.81 per point, 95\% confidence interval {[}CI] 0.69-0.94, P =.006),
   number of hospitalizations (incidence rate ratio 0.92 per point, 95\% CI
   0.86-0.97, P =.006), and days hospitalized or dead (incidence rate ratio
   0.85 per point, 95\% CI 0.73-0.99, P =.04).
   Conclusions: Lower extremity function, as measured by the SPPB,
   independently predicts hospitalization burden in outpatients with HFpEF.
   Additional studies are warranted to explore shared mechanisms and
   treatment implications of frailty in HFpEF.}},

Abstract = {{Objective(s): HIV-positive individuals have elevated rates of anal
   squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and sexually transmitted infections with
   its causative agent, high-risk human papillomavirus, and other
   oncoviruses including hepatitis B virus (HBV). HBV infection can cause
   liver cancer, and has been associated with increased risk of some
   extra-hepatic cancers including biliary tract cancer, pancreatic cancer,
   and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Whether HBV is associated with anal SCC risk
   is unknown.
   Design: Prospective study of anal SCC risk in HIV-positive and
   HIV-negative MSM in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study from 1984 to 2014.
   Methods: Poisson regression models were used to examine the association
   between past or current HBV infection (positive tests for HBV core
   antibodies, surface antigen, and/ or DNA) and anal SCC risk.
   Results: We observed 53 cases of anal SCC among 5298 participants with
   79 334 person-years follow-up. Among HIV-positive men, past or current
   HBV infection was associated with anal SCC risk in models adjusted for
   age, CD4(+) cell counts, HAART use, and other risk factors {[}incidence
   rate ratio (IRR), 95\% confidence interval 3.15, 1.27-7.82]. Additional
   risk factors included immunological parameters 1 and 6 years prior to
   diagnosis (IRR, 95\% confidence interval 2.45, 1.31-4.58 and 2.44,
   1.3-4.59 for CD4(+) cell counts < 500 cells/ml; 2.43, 1.34-4.42 and
   2.77, 1.5-5.11 for CD4(+) : CD8(+) ratios < 0.5, respectively). Among
   HIV-negative men, IRR for prior HBV and anal SCC risk was similar, but
   NS due to small number of cases.
   Conclusion: HIV-positive MSM with prior HBV infection have increased
   anal SCC risk. This population may benefit from screening. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{Objectives: To assess HIV prevalence and risk factors for HIV infection,
   to investigate condom use among registered female commercial sex workers
   (CSWs) in Senegal, West Africa, and to examine the association between
   previous HIV testing, knowledge of HIV serostatus and condom use with
   both regular sex partners and clients within this population.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted at three sexually
   transmitted disease clinics among 1052 Senegalese registered CSWs
   between 2000 and 2004. Inperson interviews soliciting information
   concerning demographic characteristics, medical history, sexual
   behaviour with clients and regular partners, and previous HIV testing
   history were performed. Blood samples were collected for determination
   of HIV-1 and/ or HIV-2 serostatus. Multivariable, Poisson and
   log-binomial models were used to calculate prevalence ratios.
   Results: The overall HIV prevalence was 19.8\%. Over 95\% of CSWs
   reported always using a condom with clients, but only 18\% reported
   always using a condom with their regular partners. A history of previous
   HIV testing was not associated with condom use with clients (adjusted
   prevalence ratio (APR) = 0.98, 95\% confidence intervals, CI: 0.90 to
   1.06). However, prior HIV testing was associated with decreased condom
   use with their regular partners (APR = 0.44, 95\% CI: 0.28 to 0.69),
   especially in women who tested HIV negative (APR = 0.17, 95\% CI: 0.08
   to 0.36).
   Conclusions: CSWs in Senegal have a high HIV prevalence; therefore
   preventing HIV transmission from this population to the general
   population is important. Condom use with regular partners is low among
   registered CSWs in Senegal, and a prior HIV negative test is associated
   with even less condom use with regular partners. Intervention efforts to
   increase condom use with regular sexual partners are needed.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: We aimed to examine the impact of weather on hospital admissions
   with bronchiolitis in Australia and New Zealand.
   Methods: We collected data for inpatient admissions of infants aged 2-12
   months to seven hospitals in four cities in Australia and New Zealand
   from 2009 until 2011. Correlation of hospital admissions with minimum
   daily temperature, wind speed, relative humidity and rainfall was
   examined using linear, Poisson and negative binomial regression analyses
   as well as general estimated equation models. To account for possible
   lag between exposure to weather and admission to hospital, analyses were
   conducted for time lags of 0-4 weeks.
   Results: During the study period, 3876 patients were admitted to the
   study hospitals. Hospital admissions showed strong seasonality with
   peaks in wintertime, onset in autumn and offset in spring. The onset of
   peak incidence was preceded by a drop in temperature. Minimum
   temperature was inversely correlated with hospital admissions, whereas
   wind speed was directly correlated. These correlations were sustained
   for time lags of up to 4 weeks. Standardised correlation coefficients
   ranged from -0.14 to -0.54 for minimum temperature and from 0.18 to 0.39
   for wind speed. Relative humidity and rainfall showed no correlation
   with hospital admissions in our study.
   Conclusion: A decrease in temperature and increasing wind speed are
   associated with increasing incidence of bronchiolitis hospital
   admissions in Australia and New Zealand.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Morbidity associated with cardiovascular disease is
   increasing in the HIV-infected population. We aimed to study the impact
   of HIV and of antiretrovirals on acute myocardial infarction (AMI).
   Methods: We performed a cohort and a nested case-control study using the
   dataset of the Regie de l'Assurance Maladie du Quebec. HIV-positive
   patients were identified using ICD-9 diagnostic codes and matched to
   HIV-negative patients. Within the HIV-positive cohort, cases of AMI were
   identified and matched to HIV-positive patients without AMI. The
   coprimary outcomes were the risk of AMI associated with HIV exposure in
   the cohort study and that associated with exposure to antiretrovirals in
   the case-control study. Data were analysed using Poisson and conditional
   logistic regression.
   Results: About 7053 HIV-positive patients were matched to 27,681
   HIV-negative patients. Incidence rates of AMI in the HIV+ cohort was
   3.88 95\% confidence interval (CI) (3.26 to 4.58) per 1000
   patient-years, compared to 2.21 95\% CI (1.93 to 2.52) per 1000
   patient-years in the HIV cohort. The adjusted incidence ratio of AMI for
   HIV-infected patients was 2.11 95\% CI (1.69 to 2.63). Among HIV+
   patients, 125 AMI cases were matched with 1084 HIV+ patients. We found
   increased odds ratio (95\% CI) of AMI associated with any exposure to
   abacavir 1.79 (1.16 to 2.76), P = 0.02, efavirenz 1.83 (1.21 to 2.76) P
   = 0.004, lopinavir 1.98 (1.24 to 3.16) P = 0.004, and ritonavir 2.29
   (1.48 to 3.54) P < 0.001.
   Conclusions: HIV+ individuals were at higher risk of AMI than the
   general population, and several antiretrovirals were associated with an
   increased risk of AMI. Results should be interpreted with caution in
   absence of data on smoking and HIV clinical status.}},

Abstract = {{The New York City tuberculosis (TB) case rate declined from 1991 to 1994
   following more than a decade of increases. The present study
   investigated TB trends in New York City neighborhoods and their
   association with neighborhood-specific rates of application of directly
   observed therapy (DOT). Using Poisson regression models, TB trends in
   each of New York City's 30 health districts were classified as
   increasing, decreasing, or stable, as indicated respectively by
   significant positive, negative, or nonsignificant regression
   coefficients. Case counts increased in four health districts, decreased
   in 10, and were stable in 16. Decreasing TB was associated with a higher
   rate of application of DOT. TB cases among foreign-born persons
   increased in 12 health districts and were stable in 18, whereas cases
   among persons born in the United States decreased in 19 and were stable
   in 11 districts. Among the foreign-born, increasing TB was not
   associated with a lesser rate of application of DOT. These data provide
   some support for the role of DOT in containing TB, but also suggest that
   the application of DOT among foreign-born residents is less effective
   than among United States-born residents. This may be due to a greater
   proportion of TB cases among the foreign-born being due to reactivation
   of TB rather than new infection.}},

Pages = {{889-897}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Electric polarization arising in hybrid aligned nematic liquid crystal
   layers with rigid boundary conditions is studied numerically by solving
   the torques equation and Poisson equation. Three phenomena that give
   rise to the polarization are taken into account: flexoelectricity,
   surface polarization and adsorption of ions. The director orientation
   within the layer, as well as the distribution of electric potential and
   space charge density are calculated for layers deformed by an external
   magnetic field. The role of the ionic space charge is investigated. For
   a particular set of parameters of a model substance, the voltage arising
   between the layer surfaces varies from 10(-1) V (in an extremely pure
   nematic) to 10(-3) V ( in material with a typical ion concentration).
   The surface polarization yields an additional voltage (of the order
   10(-2) V) nearly independent of the ion concentration. The effect of
   simultaneous flexoelectric polarization and ion adsorption is evidently
   different from a linear superposition of their separate contributions.
   The flexoelectric polarization leads to partial separation of ions of
   opposite signs. In the case of positive flexoelectric coefficients, a
   thin sublayer of positive charge arises at the planar-orienting boundary
   plate. The negative charge is displaced towards the homeotropically
   aligning plate. The magnitude of this effect increases with the magnetic
   field. The surface phenomena introduce additional subsurface charges.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Under-five mortality is decreasing but with little change in
   neonatal mortality rates. We examined the effect of maternal HIV status
   on under-five mortality and cause of death since widespread availability
   of antiretroviral therapy in rural Malawi.
   Methods: Children born in 2006-2011 in the Karonga demographic
   surveillance area were included. Maternal HIV status was available from
   HIV serosurveys. Age-specific mortality rate ratios for children born to
   HIV-positive and HIV-negative mothers were obtained by fitting a Poisson
   model accounting for child clustering by mother and adjusting for
   potential confounders. Cause of death was ascertained by verbal autopsy.
   Findings: There were 352 deaths among 6913 under-five singleton children
   followed for 20,754 person-years (py), giving a mortality rate of
   17.0/1000 py overall, 218/1000 py (16.5/1000 live births) in neonates,
   20/1000 py (17.4/1000 live births) in postneonatal infants, and 8/1000
   py in 1-4 years old. Comparing those born to HIV-positive and
   HIV-negative mothers, the rate ratio adjusted for child age, sex,
   maternal age, parity, and drinking water source was 1.5 (95\% confidence
   interval {[}CI]: 0.6 to 3.7) in neonates, 11.5 (95\% CI: 7.2 to 18.5) in
   postneonatal infants, and 4.6 (95\% CI: 2.7 to 7.9) in 1-4 years old.
   Birth injury/asphyxia, neonatal sepsis, and prematurity contributed
   >70\% of neonatal deaths, whereas acute infections, malaria, diarrhea,
   and pneumonia accounted for most deaths in older children.
   Conclusions: Maternal HIV status had little effect on neonatal mortality
   but was associated with much higher mortality in the postneonatal period
   and among older children. Greater attention to HIV care in pregnant
   women and mothers should help improve child survival, but broader
   interventions are needed to reduce neonatal mortality.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Improved life expectancy in high HIV prevalence populations
   has been observed since antiretroviral therapy (ART) scale-up. However,
   it is unclear if the benefits are sustained, and the mortality among
   HIV-positive individuals not (yet) on ART is not well described. We
   assessed temporal change in mortality over 9 years in rural Malawi.
   Methods: Within a demographic surveillance site in northern rural
   Malawi, we combined demographic, HIV and ART uptake data. We calculated
   life expectancy using Kaplan-Meier estimates, and compared mortality
   rates and rate ratios using Poisson regression, by period of ART
   availability (July 2005-June 2008, July 2008-June 2011 and July
   2011-June 2014).
   Results: Among 32 664 individuals there were 1424 deaths; 1930
   individuals were known HIV-positive, of whom 1382 started ART. Overall,
   life expectancy at age 15 years increased by 10 years within 5 years of
   ART introduction, and plateaued. Age-standardized adult mortality rates
   declined from 11.3/1000 to 7.5/1000 person-years between the first and
   last time period. In July 2011-June 2014 compared with July 2005-June
   2008, mortality declined in HIV-positive individuals on ART (rate ratio
   adjusted (aRR) for age, sex, location and education, 0.3; 95\%
   confidence interval (CI) 0.2-0.5) and in those not (yet) on ART (aRR
   0.3; 95\% CI 0.1-0.5) but not in HIV-negative individuals (aRR 1.1; 95\%
   CI 0.7-1.9).
   Conclusions: Total population adult life expectancy increased toward
   that of HIV-negative individuals by 2011 and remained raised. The
   reduction in all-cause and HIV-related mortality in HIV-positive
   individuals not (yet) on ART suggests ART uptake is occurring at an
   earlier disease stage, particularly in women.}},

Abstract = {{The interaction of heptalysine with vesicles formed from mixtures of the
   acidic lipid phosphatidylserine (PS) and the zwitterionic lipid
   phosphatidylcholine (PC) was examined experimentally and theoretically.
   Three types of experiments showed that smeared charge theories (e.g.,
   Gouy-Ghapman-Stern) underestimate the membrane association when the
   peptide concentration is high. First, the zeta potential of PC/PS
   vesicles in 100 mM KCI solution increased more rapidly with heptalysine
   concentration (14.5 mV per decade) than predicted by a smeared charge
   theory (6.0 mV per decade). Second, changing the net surface charge
   density of vesicles by the same amount in two distinct ways produced
   dramatically different effects: the molar partition coefficient
   decreased 1000-fold when the mole percentage of PS was decreased from
   17\% to 4\%, but decreased only 10-fold when the peptide concentration
   was increased to 1 mu M. Third, high concentrations of basic peptides
   reversed the charge on PS and PC/PS vesicles. Calculations based on
   finite difference solutions to the Poisson-Boltzmann equation applied to
   atomic models of heptalysine and PC/PS membranes provide a molecular
   explanation for the observations: a peptide adsorbing to the membrane in
   the presence of other surface-adsorbed peptides senses a local potential
   more negative than the average potential. The biological implications of
   these ``discreteness-of-charge{''} effects are discussed.}},

Title = {{Dynamic stall control optimization of rotor airfoil via variable droop
   leading-edge}},

Volume = {{43}},
Pages = {{406-414}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{A novel strategy of dynamic stall control for rotor airfoil via variable
   droop leading-edge (VDLE) has been conducted based upon the optimization
   method. As foundations, body-fitted grids around oscillatory rotor
   airfoil with VDLE are regenerated by solving Poisson equations, and
   flowfield around airfoil is simulated based on unsteady Reynold averaged
   Navier-Stokes (URANS) equations. To improve computational accuracy and
   efficiency, ROE-MUSCL scheme, S-A turbulence model and implicit LU-SGS
   scheme are adopted. The verified results of VR-12 airfoil indicate that
   dynamic stall vortex could be remarkably suppressed by VDLE control.
   Additionally, parametric analyses for dynamic stall control of airfoil
   indicate that aerodynamic characteristics of an oscillatory airfoil
   could be significantly improved when non-dimensional frequency (k{*}) of
   VDLE is about 1.0 and mean droop angle (delta(0)) and angular amplitude
   (delta(m)) of VDLE are between 2 degrees and 7 degrees. Furthermore,
   multi-objective optimizations are conducted by employing the surrogate
   model. The maximum drag and negative moment coefficients of VR-12
   airfoil can be reduced by about 79.2\% and 81.2\% respectively via
   control of VDLE with k{*} = 1.06 and delta(m)(delta(0)) = 8.46 degrees.
   By multi-objective optimization, it indicates that ``upward{''}
   leading-edge at some instant helps to optimize control effects of VDLE
   on dynamic stall of rotor airfoil. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. All

Abstract = {{Design of materials and structures with quite low coefficient of thermal
   expansion (CTE), even zero or negative CTE is important for industrial
   application where drastic temperature changes are encountered. In this
   paper, making use of the bending of bi-material beam and the unique
   deformation mechanism of chiral lattice structures, five sets of chiral
   lattice composite structures with tailorable CTEs are proposed, where
   synergic effects of rigid node rotation and bi-material ligament bending
   deformation are responsible for giant range of structural deformation
   due to temperature change, from positive CTE to negative CTE through
   adjusting the geometrical parameters of composite bi-material chiral
   unit cell, and the relationship between unit cell geometric parameters
   and CTEs of the structure are studied systematically through finite
   element analysis. Finally, design of bi-material cylindrical shells
   consisting of anti-tetra chiral unit cells are proposed, and its axial
   CTEs with different number of the unit cells along the circumferential
   are studied systematically, demonstrating the robust range of CTEs can
   be generated through adjusting the geometrical parameters of chiral
   bi-material unit cells. The proposed chiral structures demonstrated
   promising application potentials in industrial fields, such as:
   aerospace and microelectronics, where extremely high structural accuracy
   is required during harsh working temperature environment.}},

Abstract = {{The article details a sampling scheme which can lead to a reduction in
   sample size and cost in clinical and epidemiological studies of
   association between a count outcome and risk factor. We show that
   inference in two common generalized linear models for count data,
   Poisson and negative binomial regression, is improved by using a ranked
   auxiliary covariate, which guides the sampling procedure. This type of
   sampling has typically been used to improve inference on a population
   mean. The novelty of the current work is its extension to log-linear
   models and derivations showing that the sampling technique results in an
   increase in information as compared to simple random sampling.
   Specifically, we show that under the proposed sampling strategy the
   maximum likelihood estimate of the risk factor's coefficient is improved
   through an increase in the Fisher's information. Asimulation study is
   performed to compare the mean squared error, bias, variance, and power
   of the sampling routine with simple random sampling under various
   data-generating scenarios. We also illustrate the merits of the sampling
   scheme on a real data set from a clinical setting of males with chronic
   obstructive pulmonary disease. Empirical results from the simulation
   study and data analysis coincide with the theoretical derivations,
   suggesting that a significant reduction in sample size, and hence study
   cost, can be realized while achieving the same precision as a simple
   random sample.}},

   piezocomposites: Improved performance via controlling auxeticity and
   anisotropy}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{255}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{Multiscale material design has made it possible to control the
   properties of a material through introducing structures at multiple
   length scales. This structuring brings about unusual material behaviour
   that is not seen in a continuum material. Here we introduce a multiscale
   design for the matrix components of a lead-free piezocomposite. This
   combines a microscale stiff polymeric structure embedded within a softer
   matrix to form a composite matrix. By controlling the microscale
   features of the embedded structure, we tune the mechanical behaviour of
   the matrix by rendering it either nonauxetic (hexagonal structure) or
   auxetic (inverted hexagonal structure). Further, the mechanical and
   electrical properties of the matrix are controlled at the nanoscale by
   addition of carbon nanotubes within the embedded polymeric structure. By
   engineering the matrix at the nano and the microscale, we firstly
   demonstrate that the auxetic matrix can result in three orders of
   magnitude higher piezoelectric response by amplifying the strains within
   the piezoelectric inclusions. We further demonstrate that by using the
   matrix with the nonauxetic embedded structure, it is possible to design
   piezoelectric composites with pronounced anisotropy in their
   longitudinal and transverse responses. This is an important requirement
   for designing materials with directional sensing ability. Our findings
   show that the multiscale material design proposed here has important
   implications for both energy harvesting and directional sensing.
   Further, the approach taken here yields considerable performance
   improvements while using limited quantities of nanomaterial. The
   multiscale matrix design is scalable and amenable to fabrication through
   emerging methods such as additive manufacturing.}},

Abstract = {{It is rather natural in the context of semiclassical, or first-order
   quantum, corrections to general relativity to consider an effective
   theory in which the Lagrangian consists of the Hilbert-Einstein term,
   linear in curvature, and correction terms quadratic in curvature, with
   coefficients typically of the order of the Planck length squared.  Given
   such a candidate for a semiclassical theory, it is interesting to ask
   whether the simulated quantum effects can help reduce the strength of
   curvature near classical singularities, in particular, those found in
   the interior of black holes.  In this article, I shall examine the
   effects on the Schwarzschild singularity of a particular semiclassical
   model based on the Gauss-Bonnet quadratic combination, in a spacetime
   possessing more than four dimensions.  In this model, the field
   equations are nontrivial and consist of a system of second-order
   differential equations for the metric tensor (any other combination
   would yield fourth-order equations).  The results depend strongly on the
   overall sign of the quadratic term:  for positive coupling, as dictated
   by string theory, the singularity occurs sooner than in the classical

Abstract = {{Attaining architected structures with unprecedented properties not found
   in natural materials is a long-sought goal for both materials science
   and additive manufacturing. Improving the mechanical behavior of
   engineered materials such as auxetics for bioengineering applications or
   bistable structures for mechanical actuation depends on the buckling
   mechanisms governing their response. Despite the fact that the design
   principles for two-dimensional buckling have been elucidated in previous
   studies, comprehending three dimensional buckling mechanisms is still
   tenuous. In this study, we aim to illuminate the buckling mechanisms
   governing the response of three-dimensional structures at the
   microscale, providing the critical guidelines for the design of novel
   metamaterials. In addition, finite element analysis and in-situ SEM -
   microindentation experiments are performed to investigate how scale
   effects affect the design principles to architect a controlled 3D
   buckling mechanism and reflect the mechanical response to the
   deformation of the structure in-situ. Our findings elicit the design
   process of tailored three dimensional buckling structures based on the
   geometric architecture instead of the behavior of the bulk material,
   while setting a broader framework to fabricate and characterize these
   structures at the microscale. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Effects of Long-Term Selection in the Border Collie Dog Breed:
   Inbreeding Purge of Canine Hip and Elbow Dysplasia}},
Journal = {{ANIMALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Simple Summary
   For dog breeders, health is one of the main criteria when choosing a
   breeding animal; thus, selection for good anatomy is the key to reduce
   orthopedic disorders. In many dog breeds, radiographic screening for
   canine hip and elbow dysplasia is a compulsory test for breeding;
   however, these multifactorial traits are determined by genetic and
   environmental factors. Therefore, it is extremely difficult to eliminate
   these disorders from the population. In natural selection, such traits
   can be ``purged{''} out of the population with inbreeding. The study
   aimed to examine the inbreeding-purge of canine hip and elbow dysplasia
   in the border collie breed. The main conclusion was that
   over-representation of homozygous individuals may have a positive effect
   on hip and elbow conformation.
   Pedigree data of 13,339 border collie dog was collected along with
   canine hip dysplasia (CHD) and canine elbow dysplasia (CED) records
   (1352 CHD and 524 CED), and an inbreeding-purging (IP) model was
   created. Ancestral inbreeding coefficients were calculated by using a
   gene dropping simulation method with GRain 2.2 software. Cumulative
   logit models (CLM) for CHD and CED were fitted using a logit-link
   Poisson distribution and the classical (F\_(W)), and ancestral
   inbreeding (F\_(BAL), F\_(KAL), and F\_(KAL\_NEW)) coefficients as
   linear regression coefficients. The effective population size was
   calculated from F\_(W) and decreased in the examined period along with
   an increase of F\_(W); however, slight differences were found as a
   consequence of breeding dog imports. CHD values were lowered by the
   expansion of F\_(BAL), as the alleles had been inbred in the past. For
   CHD, signs of purging were obtained. There was a positive trend
   regarding the breeding activity (both sire and dam of the future litters
   should be screened and certified free from CHD and CED), as years of
   selection increased the frequency of alleles with favorable hip and
   elbow conformation. Division of the ancestral inbreeding coefficient
   showed that alleles that had been identical by descent (IBD) for the
   first time (F\_(KAL\_NEW)) had a negative effect on both traits, while
   F\_(KAL) has shown favorable results for alleles IBD in past
   generations. Some authors had proven this phenomenon in captive
   populations or experimental conditions; however, no evidence of
   inbreeding purge has ever been described in dog populations. Despite the
   various breeding practices, it seems that alleles of these polygenic
   disorders could be successfully purged out of the population with
   long-term selection.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To compare employment in people by HIV status, mode of HIV
   transmission and migrant status. Design: Nation-wide population-based
   register data from 1996 to 2016. Methods: All people born between 1940
   and 2000 (n = 8587 629) were identified from the Swedish Total
   Population Register and linked to the Swedish National HIV Register (n =
   9492) and Longitudinal Integration Database for Health Insurance and
   Labour Market Studies. Adjusted prevalence ratios (adjPR) of employment
   were calculated using Poisson regression. Trends in employment were
   illustrated in scatterplots with overlaid prediction plots. Results:
   People with HIV were less likely employed than HIV-negative but with
   decreasing difference over time {[}adjPR 0.57, 95\% confidence interval
   (CI) 0.54-0.60 in 1996, adjPR 0.84, 95\% CI 0.83-0.86 in 2016]. Female
   migrants with HIV had the highest increase of employment over time and
   were more likely employed than HIV-negative female migrants by end of
   follow-up (adjPR 1.12, 95\% CI 1.08-1.16). Swedish-born with
   present/former intravenous drug use had the lowest employment rates.
   Individuals with undetectable HIV-RNA viral levels showed higher
   employment rates (adjPR 1.29, 95\% CI 1.20-1.38) compared with those
   with detectable viral levels. Conclusion: Employment in people living
   with HIV (PLWH) increased over time but remained lower than for
   HIV-negative people. HIV was not associated with lower employment in
   migrants by end of follow-up, indicating that HIV is not a barrier for
   employment among migrants in Sweden. The heterogeneity of PLWH needs to
   be taken into account in interventions, and future studies, focusing on
   access to the labour market in PLWH.}},

Abstract = {{Serum albumin is a major determinant of hospitalization in patients with
   end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Previous reports generally use the
   Poisson model to evaluate the relationships between outcome and response
   variables. However, hospitalization data are often overdispersed, and
   few studies using appropriate methods exist in the literature.This
   retrospective cohort study included 426 patients with ESRD receiving
   hemodialysis treatment between 2014 and 2018. Using a negative binomial
   regression model with hierarchical multivariable adjustments, we
   investigated the relationship between serum albumin, hospital
   admissions, and total hospitalization days. Mean age and mean baseline
   serum albumin levels were 64.7 +/- 11 years and 3.5 +/- 0.5 g/dL,
   respectively. At least one hospitalization was identified in 402 (94\%)
   patients. The incidence rate was 1.48 (95\% CI, 1.41-1.56) admissions
   per patient-year during the follow-up period of 5 years. A negative
   linear association was observed between serum albumin and
   hospitalization frequency. Hospitalization rates (95\% CI) were 1.81
   (1.65-1.98), 1.44 (1.3-1.59), 1.36 (1.22-1.51), and 1.33 (1.2-1.48) per
   patient-year in serum albumin levels <= 3, 3.1 to <= 3.3, 3.4 to <= 3.7,
   and >= 3.8 g/dL, respectively. Case mix-adjusted incidence rate ratio
   was 0.82 (95\% CI, 0.70-0.94), while it was robust to further
   adjustments for malnutrition and inflammation markers. Similar results
   were observed in hospitalization days and time to the first
   hospitalization. These findings, which result from the negative binomial
   model using overdispersed data, suggest that lower serum albumin is
   related to increased hospitalization rates and hospital days in incident
   hemodialysis patients.}},

Abstract = {{{[}1] The Brazilian Lithosphere Seismic Project (BLSP, a joint project
   by University of Sao Paulo and Carnegie Institution, 1992-1999) operated
   more than 20 temporary broadband stations in the southeastern Brazilian
   shield. The area, a transect 1000 km long and 300 km wide, covers
   different geological provinces: the Precambrian Sao Francisco craton,
   the adjacent Brasiliano (700-500 Ma) fold belts, and the Parana basin of
   Paleozoic origin. Crustal thicknesses were estimated for 23 sites using
   receiver functions. For each station, receiver functions were stacked
   for different sets of earthquakes according to azimuth and distance. The
   P-to-S Moho converted phase was clearly identified at most sites.
   Crustal thicknesses were estimated using an average crustal P wave
   velocity of 6.5 km/s. Poisson's ratio of 0.23 (Vp/Vs = 1.70) was used
   for the Sao Francisco craton and adjacent fold belt (based on travel
   times from small, local earthquakes) and 0.25 was used for the Parana
   basin and coastal belt. Crustal thicknesses ranged from 35-47 km.
   Although there is a clear inverse correlation between topography and
   Bouguer gravity anomalies in the study area, Moho depths show the
   opposite pattern from that expected: areas of low topography and less
   negative Bouguer anomalies, such as the Parana basin, have thicker crust
   (40-47 km) compared with the high elevation areas of the craton and fold
   belt (37-43 km). Two hypothesis are proposed to explain the data: (1) A
   lower density, by 30-40 kg/m(3), in the lithospheric mantle under the
   Archean block of the Sao Francisco craton relative to the Proterozoic
   lithosphere is responsible for maintaining the high elevations in the
   plateau area. Relatively low density and high P wave velocity are
   compatible with a depleted (low FeO) composition for the Archean
   lithosphere. (2) Alternatively, if the density contrasts between Archean
   and Proterozoic lithospheres are smaller than the values above, then the
   crust beneath the Parana basin must be more dense than that of the
   craton. Higher crustal density and high Poisson's ratio would be
   consistent with magmatic underplating in the lower crust beneath the
   Parana basin, as inferred from other studies.}},

Abstract = {{Several computer models of quartz were developed and tested. A simple
   model based on a potential energy function, derived in large part from
   quantum mechanical calculations on the molecule H6Si2O7, was found to
   reproduce the compressibility curve for quartz up to pressures of 8 GPa.
   The potential includes quadratic expressions for the SiO bond lengths,
   the OSiO angles and a parameter spanning the SiOSi angle together with
   an exponential OO repulsion term for non co-dimer O atoms. The
   variations in the cell edges and in the SiOSi angle, as a function of
   pressure, parallel observed trends when the bond lengths and angles
   calculated for the molecule are used as regressor values. Poisson ratios
   calculated using the model match those observed. Two configurations for
   quartz related by the Dauphine twin law are generated as minimum energy
   structures of the model with about equal frequencies as observed in
   nature. It is shown that the model, devised for quartz, can also be
   applied to the silica polymorph cristobalite, giving reasonable
   estimates of its compressibility curve, structural parameters and its
   negative Poisson ratio. When the observed bond lengths and angles are
   used as regressor values, the model generates the absolute coordinates
   of the atoms and the cell dimensions for quartz to within 0.005 angstrom
   and those of cristobalite to within 0.001 angstrom, on average, both at
   zero pressure. When applied to coesite, the model yields a zero pressure
   structure that is close to that observed but which is significantly
   softer than observed. The resulting SiO bond lengths are linearly
   correlated with f(s)(O), as observed for coesite, despite the use of a
   single bond length and a single SiOSi angle as regressor values in the
   calculation. When the structures are optimized assuming P1 space group
   symmetry and triclinic cell dimensions, the resulting frameworks of
   silicate tetrahedra exhibit the translational, rotational and reflection
   symmetries observed for quartz, cristobalite and coesite. The fact that
   the resulting frameworks exhibit observed space group symmetries is
   evidence that the symmetry adopted by the silica polymorphs can be
   explained by short ranged forces.}},

Abstract = {{Using the hydrodynamic equations of cold inertial positive ions with the
   Maxwellian distribution for light negative ion and electron densities
   and the Poisson equation, the family of nonplanar (cylindrical and
   spherical) Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equations, i.e., the KdV, modified
   KdV, and extended KdV (EKdV), are obtained for small but finite
   amplitude ion-acoustic waves. The nonplanar EKdV equation is used to
   analyze the time-dependent planar and nonplanar soliton and shock
   structures. It is well-known that the exact solutions of the family of
   nonplanar KdV equations are not possible. Therefore, a local
   discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) method is developed for solving the
   nonplanar EKdV equation numerically. According to this method, the
   initial and boundary conditions for the solitary and shock waves are
   accurately identified. The L-2 stability of the LDG method is proved for
   the general nonlinear case. The existence regions for both solitary and
   shock excitations have been defined precisely depending on the
   laboratory plasma parameters. Moreover, the effects of the negative-ion
   temperature ratio and the negative ion concentration on the profiles of
   the nonlinear structures (solitons and shocks) are examined. The effect
   of the geometrical divergence on the pulse profile is also reported
   which indicates that the localized pulses deform as time goes on.
   Furthermore, it is found that the amplitude of cylindrical structures
   (solitons and shocks) is larger than that of planar ones but smaller
   than that of the spherical ones. Moreover, in cylindrical geometry, the
   nonlinear structures travel slower than in the spherical ones. The
   implications of our results agree with the experimental observations.

Title = {{Prediction of the Multisegment Clot Sign on Dynamic CT Angiography of
   Cardioembolic Stroke}},

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{39}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The multisegment clot sign has been observed at
   the site of large-artery occlusion in patients with acute ischemic
   stroke. This study aimed to assess its occurrence rate and relationship
   with stroke etiologies in patients with acute intracranial large-artery
   occlusion.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: We included consecutive patients with acute
   ischemic stroke who had acute intracranial large-artery occlusion and
   underwent perfusion CT within 8 hours after stroke onset. The
   multisegment clot sign was assessed on dynamic CT angiography derived
   from perfusion CT. The stroke etiologies were defined by the
   international Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment criteria.
   Poisson regression analyses and diagnostic testing were used to
   investigate the relationship between the multisegment clot sign and
   stroke etiologies.
   RESULTS: Finally, 194 patients with intracranial large-artery occlusion
   were enrolled. According to the Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke
   Treatment criteria, 110 (56.7\%) patients were diagnosed with
   cardioembolism; 43 (22.2\%), with large-artery atherosclerosis; and 41
   (21.1\%), with undetermined etiology. The multisegment clot sign was
   found in 74 (38\%) patients. Poisson regression analysis showed that the
   presence of the multisegment clot sign was significantly higher in
   patients with cardioembolism than in those with large-artery
   atherosclerosis (52.7\% versus 9.3\%; prevalence ratio, 1.53; 95\%
   confidence interval, 1.03-2.90; P = .037). For determined etiologies,
   the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive
   values of the multisegment clot sign for predicting cardioembolism were
   52.7\%, 90.7\%, 93.5\%, and 42.9\%, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: The presence of the multisegment clot sign on dynamic CTA
   specifically indicates intracranial large-artery occlusion caused by an
   embolism from a cardiac source, which may be useful for acute management
   and secondary prevention of stroke.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a series of triaxial compression experiments was
   performed to investigate the effects of fracture dip, trace length, gap
   width, confining pressure and temperature on mechanical properties of
   the single-fractured rock mass. Experimental results show that the
   mechanical parameters of rock mass exhibit the quadratic function with
   dips and the exponential distribution with trace length, respectively.
   Moreover, the fitting formula (3) is employed to calculate rock mass
   strength approximately. It is found that rock mass strength linearly
   increases with the confming pressure. However, Poisson ratio and elastic
   modulus under negative temperature are independent of the confming
   pressure. The strength of rock mass decreases with the increase of gap
   width when it is less than 0.1 mm or greater than 0.8 mm. However,
   mechanical parameters are irrelevant to the gap width when it locates
   between 0.1 mm and 0.8 mm. Water, existing in pores and fractures,
   freezes under negative temperature so that both the cohesion and
   friction angle between rock particles are increased. Hence, the change
   of water form is the reason why the rock mass strength increases with
   reducing temperature. Results also show that the fracture angle affects
   the initial position of failure surface, the trace length affects the
   expansion scale of failure surface, and the confming pressure influences
   the extension direction of failure surface. In addition, the crack dip
   is the most sensitive influencing parameter to the strength of rock
   mass, followed by trace length, with the least temperature.}},

Abstract = {{Aim. To evaluate the impact of traumatic dental injury (TDI) among
   Brazilian adolescents on their families' quality of life (QoL).
   Design. A cross-sectional study was carried out with a population-based
   sample of 1122 schoolchildren aged 11-14 years selected using a
   multistage sampling procedure. Parents/caregivers answered the Brazilian
   version of the 14-item Family Impact Scale (B-FIS) to assess the impact

   diagnosed using the Andreasen classification. Malocclusion, dental
   caries, gender and socio-economic classification were the other
   independent variables. Poisson regression analyses were carried out (P <
   0.05).
   Results. The prevalence of TDI was 14.8\%. The multivariate model
   demonstrated that families of adolescents diagnosed with fracture
   involving the dentine or dentine/pulp were more likely to report a
   negative impact on the overall B-FIS score {[}rate ratio (RR) = 1.44;

Abstract = {{Southeastern Tibet marks the site of presumed clockwise rotation of the
   crust due to the India-Eurasian collision and abutment against the
   stable Sichuan basin and South China block. Knowing the structure of the
   crust is a key to better understanding of crustal deformation and
   seismicity in this region. Here, we analyze recordings of teleseismic
   earthquakes from 25 temporary broadband seismic stations and one
   permanent station using the receiver function method. We find that the
   crustal thickness decreases gradually from the Tibetan Plateau proper to
   the Sichuan basin and Yangtze platform but that significant
   (intra-)crustal heterogeneity exists on shorter lateral scales (<1000
   km). Most receiver functions reveal a time shift of similar to 0.2s in
   the direct P arrival and negative phases between 0 and 5 s after the
   first arrival. Inversion of the receiver functions yields S-velocity
   profiles marked by near-surface and intra-crustal low-velocity zones
   (IC-LVZs). The shallow low-velocity zones are consistent with the wide
   distribution of thick surface sedimentary layers. The IC-LVZ varies
   laterally in depth and strength; it becomes thinner toward the east and
   southeast and is absent in the Sichuan basin and the southern part of
   the Yangtze platform. Results from slant-stacking analysis show a
   concomitant decrease in crust thickness from similar to 60 km in the
   Songpan-Ganze fold system to similar to 46 km in the Sichuan basin and
   similar to 40 km in the Yangtze platform. High Poisson's ratios (>0.30)
   are detected beneath the southeastern margin of Tibet but in the Sichuan
   basin and southeastern Yangtze platform the values are close to the
   global average. Combined with high regional heat flow and independent
   evidence for mid-crustal layers of high (electric) conductivity, the
   large intra-crustal S-wave velocity reduction (12-19\%) and the
   intermediate-to-high average crustal Poisson's ratios are consistent
   with partial melt in the crust beneath parts of southeastern Tibet.
   These results could be used in support of deformation models involving
   intra-crustal flow, with the caveat that significant lateral variation
   in location and strength of this flow may occur. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{In this paper, a singular integral equation method is applied to
   calculate the stress intensity factor along crack front of a 3D inclined
   semi-elliptical surface crack in a semi-infinite body under tension. The
   stress field induced by displacement discontinuities in a semi-infinite
   body is used as the fundamental solution. Then, the problem is
   formulated as a system of integral equations with singularities of the
   form r(-3). In the numerical calculation, the unknown body force
   doublets are approximated by the product of fundamental density
   functions and polynomials. The results show that the present method
   yields smooth variations of mixed modes stress intensity factors along
   the crack front accurately for various geometrical conditions. The
   effects of inclination angle, elliptical shape, and Poisson's ratio are
   considered in the analysis. Crack mouth opening displacements are shown
   in figures to predict the crack depth and inclination angle. When the
   inclination angle is 60 degree, the mode I stress intensity factor F-I
   has negative value in the limited region near free surface. Therefore,
   the actual crack surface seems to contact each other near the surface.}},

Title = {{Empirical Performance of LGPS and LEOPARD: Lessons for Developing a Risk
   Identification and Analysis System}},
Journal = {{DRUG SAFETY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{S133-S142}},
Abstract = {{Background The availability of large-scale observational healthcare data
   allows for the active monitoring of safety of drugs, but research is
   needed to determine which statistical methods are best suited for this
   task. Recently, the Longitudinal Gamma Poisson Shrinker (LGPS) and
   Longitudinal Evaluation of Observational Profiles of Adverse events
   Related to Drugs (LEOPARD) methods were developed specifically for this
   task. LGPS applies Bayesian shrinkage to an estimated incidence rate
   ratio, and LEOPARD aims to detect and discard associations due to
   protopathic bias. The operating characteristics of these methods still
   need to be determined.
   Objective Establish the operating characteristics of LGPS and LEOPARD
   for large scale observational analysis in drug safety.
   Research Design We empirically evaluated LGPS and LEOPARD in five real
   observational healthcare databases and six simulated datasets. We
   retrospectively studied the predictive accuracy of the methods when
   applied to a collection of 165 positive control and 234 negative control
   drug-outcome pairs across four outcomes: acute liver injury, acute
   myocardial infarction, acute kidney injury, and upper gastrointestinal
   bleeding.
   Results In contrast to earlier findings, we found that LGPS and LEOPARD
   provide weak discrimination between positive and negative controls,
   although the use of LEOPARD does lead to higher performance in this
   respect. Furthermore, the methods produce biased estimates and
   confidence intervals that have poor coverage properties.
   Conclusions For the four outcomes we examined, LGPS and LEOPARD may not
   be the designs of choice for risk identification.}},

Title = {{Examination of the risk of reinfection with hepatitis C among injecting

Volume = {{23}},

Abstract = {{Background: Unsafe injecting practices put injecting drug users (IDUs)
   at repeat exposure to infection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV). It has
   not yet been determined if spontaneously clearing one's primary
   infection influences the risk of reinfection; our aim was to estimate
   the relative risk of reinfection in IDUs who have cleared the virus.
   Methods: We conducted a retrospective study using a large database of
   HCV test results covering Greater Glasgow Health Board during 1993-2007
   to calculate rates of infection and reinfection in current/former IDUs.
   The relative risk of (re)infection in previously infected compared with
   never-infected IDUs was estimated using Poisson regression, adjusting
   for age at study entry, sex, and calendar period of test.
   Results: Although the rate of reinfection in IDUs who were HCV
   antibody-positive, RNA-negative at baseline was lower (7/100
   person-years, 95\% CI: 5-9) than the rate of acute infection in IDUs who
   were HCV antibody-negative at baseline (10/100 person-years, 95\% CI:
   9-12), the risk of reinfection was not significantly different than the
   risk of initial infection (adjusted rate ratio = 0.78, 95\% CI:
   0.57-1.08).
   Conclusion: We found only weak evidence for a reduced risk of HCV
   reinfection in IDUs who had cleared their previous infection. Further
   research among those who have cleared infection through antiviral
   therapy is needed to help inform decisions regarding treatment of IDUs.

   The macroscopic slip rule is found to exhibit a weak non-associativity
   in the tangential plane, although the slip rule at the microscale is

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{172}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{The stability, elastic moduli and deformation behavior of graphene-based
   diamond-like phases are examined by molecular dynamics simulations.
   Three important criteria are considered to study stability of the
   structure within applied methods. Molecular dynamics simulations are
   performed to derive stiffness and compliance coefficients, and
   stress-strain curves under hydrostatic compression of diamond-like
   phases. The analysis of elastic properties (Poisson's ratio, Young's
   modulus and shear modulus) is carried out. Analytical calculations are
   used. From the obtained stability criteria, it is found that only two
   graphene-based diamond-like phases, LA3 and LA6, instead of eight known,
   can be considered stable in molecular dynamics approach. Young's
   modulus, measured in linear elastic regime, of stable phases
   orientationally dependent: values in different directions can differ two
   times. Analysis of the variability of shear modulus showed that for LA6
   values are much higher than for LA3. Again, shear modulus are
   orientation-dependent for some directions. In non-elastic regime, stable
   diamond-like phases can be stretched until 0.012 and compressed until
   0.1. The main mechanisms of non-elastic deformation is stretching of the
   covalent bonds and valent angles.}},

Abstract = {{The paper provides a theoretical analysis of axially stretched
   rectangular thin plates composed of two differently oriented layers of

   crystallographic orientations parallel to the plate edges, and in the

   The analysis shows that more than fifty cubic crystals with positive
   anisotropy can form two-layered plates whose effective Young's modulus
   is greater than the moduli of both layers, which violates the well-known
   Voigt's rule of mixtures. The anomalous behavior of effective Young's
   modulus and Poisson's ratios in the plates depends on the properties of
   their constituent crystals: the sign and value of anisotropy
   coefficients and Poisson's ratio, ratio of Young's moduli, relative
   orientation angle, and layer thickness ratio.}},

Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{53}},
Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To identify the factors associated with the worsening of
   frailty in older adults resident in the community.
   METHODS: This is a prospective, longitudinal, and analytical study. The
   data collection in the baseline occurred in the participants' homes from
   a random sampling by conglomerates. Demographic and socioeconomic
   variables, morbidities, and use of health services were analyzed.
   Frailty was measured by the Edmonton Frail Scale. The second data
   collection was performed after an average period of 42 months. The
   adjusted prevalence ratios were obtained by multiple Poisson regression
   analysis with robust variance.
   RESULTS: A total of 394 older adults participated in both phases of the
   study, with 21.8\% of them presenting worsening of the frailty
   condition. The variables that remained statistically associated with the
   transition to a worse state of frailty were: polypharmacy, negative
   self-perception of health, weight loss, and hospitalization over the
   past 12 months.
   CONCLUSIONS: The factors associated with worsening of frailty along the
   studied period among older adults in the community were those related to
   health care. This result must be considered by health professionals when
   addressing frail and vulnerable older adults.}},

Abstract = {{We present distribution functions and mark correlations of the shapes of
   massive dark matter halos derived from Hubble volume simulations of a
   Lambda CDM universe. We measure both position and velocity shapes within
   spheres that encompass a mean density 200 times the critical value and
   calibrate small-N systematic errors using Poisson realizations of
   isothermal spheres and higher resolution simulations. For halos more
   massive than 3 x 10(14) h(-1) M-circle dot, the shape distribution
   function peaks at (minor/major, intermediate/major) axial ratios of
   (0.64, 0.76) in position and is rounder in velocity, peaking at (0.72,
   0.82). Halo shapes are rounder at lower mass and/or redshift; the mean
   minor-axis ratio in position follows < c/a > (M,z) c(15,0){[}1-alpha In(
   M/10(15) h(-1) M-circle dot)](1+z)(-epsilon), with c(15,0) = 0.631 +/-
   0.001, alpha = 0.023 +/- 0.002, and epsilon = 0.086 +/- 0.004. Position
   and velocity principal axes are well aligned in direction, with median
   alignment angle 22 degrees, and the axial ratios in these spaces are
   correlated in magnitude. We investigate mark correlations of halo pair
   orientations using two measures: a simple scalar product shows >= 1\%
   alignment extending to 30 h(-1) Mpc, while a filamentary statistic
   exhibits nonrandom alignment extending to scales similar to 200 h(-1)
   Mpc, 10 times the sample two- point correlation length and well into the
   regime of negative two- point correlation. Shapes of cluster halos are
   little affected by the large-scale environment; the distribution of
   supercluster member minor-axis ratios differs from that of the general
   population at only the few percent level.}},

Title = {{Broadening of the polymerization degree distribution in living
   polymerization}},
Journal = {{POLIMERY}},
Year = {{1998}},
Volume = {{43}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{135-143}},
Abstract = {{The polymer polydispersity index, DPw/DPw i.e., the weight-average over
   the number-average degree of polymerization (DP), is discussed in
   relation to the degree of monomer conversion (alpha) for studying the
   reversible living polymerization and polymerization involving a
   bimolecular transfer onto the polymer followed by chain scission. The
   scission leads to segmental exchange though the concentrations of both
   active species and growing macromolecules remain unaffected (constant).
   Even. in the ideal irreversible polymerization when the DP of the
   growing macromolecules follows the Poisson distribution function type,
   the polydispersity index is related to alpha and to the initial monomer
   {[}M](o) and initiator {[}I](o) concentrations.. viz., <(DP)over
   bar>(w)/<(DP)over bar>(n) = 1 + alpha({[}M](o)/{[}I](o))/(1 +
   alpha{[}M](o)/{[}I](o))(2); the index may differ much from unity. In the
   living polymerization with reversible propagation, the DP distribution
   is described by the Flory-Schulz function (the most probable one) for
   which <(DP)over bar>(w)/<(DP)over bar>(n) = 2 - 1/DPn. The relationship
   <(DP)over bar>(w)/<(DP)over bar>(n) = f(alpha) can be evaluated by
   numerical methods only (e.g., Monte Carlo method, numerical
   integration). Styrene (S), L,L-lactide (LA) and tetrahydrofuran (THF)
   polymerizations were used to demonstrate that, the higher the monomer
   concentration at equilibrium ({[}M](eq)) (cf: Table 1), the shorter the
   lime of transition of the DP distribution from the Poisson to the most
   probable one. Next, by Monte Carlo calculations, the polymerization
   involving segmental exchange was shown to yield two populations of
   macromolecules having the same <(DP)over bar>(n) but different DP
   distributions, viz., the Poisson type and the negative binomial Polya
   type. A numerical method was developed to evaluate the <(DP)over
   bar>(w)<(DP)over bar>(n) = f(alpha) relationship for the polymerization
   involving segmental exchange, which made it possible to evaluate - for
   the first time - the k(p)/k(tr(2)) ratio (k(p) and k(tr(2)) being the
   propagation rate constant and the bimolecular transfer rate constant,
   resp.). This ratio was evaluated by comparing the family of <(DP)over
   bar>(w)<(DP)over bar>(n) = f(alpha) curves generated numerically at
   preset k(p)/k(tr(2))-values, with the experimentally observed <(DP)over
   bar>(w)<(DP)over bar>(n) = f(alpha) relationship obtained from SEC
   measurements. This method was used to analyze the polymerization of LA,
   initiated by an Al(O-iPr)(3) trimer, for which it was found that
   k(p)/k(tr(2)) = 100 (THF, 80 degrees C). Since k(p) 8.4 x 10(3)
   mol(-1).L.s(-1) {[}20], then k(tr(2)) = 8.4 x 10(-5) mol(-1).L.s(-1).}},

Abstract = {{Purpose This study aimed to evaluate parents' perceptions of the oral
   health status of children enrolled in public preschools and associated
   factors.
   Methods This was a cross-sectional study with data collected via
   self-administered questionnaire. A total of 474 questionnaires were
   distributed in public preschools in the city of Canoas, Rio Grande do
   Sul, the southernmost state of Brazil. Poisson regression models were
   used in the multivariate analysis (p < 0.05).
   Results The study included 171 (36\%) valid questionnaires. The
   prevalence of parents who perceived the oral health status of their
   children as negative was 29.8\% (n = 51). Mother being unemployed (vs
   employed) increased by 16\% the likelihood of parents perceiving the
   oral health status of their children as negative (prevalence ratio
   {[}PR] 1.16; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI] 1.02-1.31. Parents having
   (vs having not) observed difficulties in the child's ability to eat
   increased by 27\% the likelihood of perceiving the child's oral health
   status as negative (PR 1.27; 95\% CI 1.08-1.48), while child's tooth
   brushing 1-2 (vs 3 or more) times a day and family income up to 2 (vs 3
   or more) minimum wages increased it by 14\% (PR 1.14; 95\% CI 1.03-1.27
   for both). Current or past use (vs no use) of pacifiers increased by
   12\% the likelihood of parents' negative perceptions (PR 1.12; 95\% CI
   1.00-1.25).
   Conclusion We can conclude that unemployed mothers, low-income families,
   parents having observed child's feeding difficulties, child's tooth
   brushing 1-2 times a day, and current or past use of pacifiers
   contributed significantly to parents' negative perception of the child's
   oral health status. These factors are essential for the planning,
   implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of actions aimed at
   controlling the oral health of children enrolled in public preschools.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to determine associations between
   socio-demographic and health characteristics with paid work among
   elderly Brazilians. The analysis included 11,177 subjects aged 60 years
   and over from the National Health Survey conducted in 2013. The
   multivariate analysis was based on prevalence ratios and their
   respective 95\% confidence intervals estimated by Poisson regression.
   The participation of men in paid work was significantly higher (32.9\%)
   than women (14.4\%). For men and women, this participation decreased
   with increasing age and was higher among those with better schooling and
   good self-rated health. Among men, good self-rated health was associated
   with paid work (PR = 1.63, 95\% CI, 1.23-2.15) only for those with less
   schooling (< 9 years). Among women, good self-rated health revealed a
   positive association with paid work (PR = 1.94, 95\% CI 1.32-2.84) for
   those with less schooling, and a negative association for those with
   better schooling (RP = 0.54, 95\% CI 0.38-0.77). The results suggest
   that investments in schooling and improvements in health conditions can
   contribute to an increase in the longevity of the elderly in the labor

Abstract = {{In this article, the transfer and output characteristics of an
   electrostatically doped (ED) 4-armchair silicene nanoribbon (4-ASiNR)
   field-effect transistor (FET) with three gates are investigated. The
   numerical simulations are carried out based on the self-consistent
   solution of the Poisson and Schrodinger equations within the
   nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism, implemented in the
   NanoTCAD ViDES simulator. Results show that ED SiNR-FET has better
   characteristics than chemically doped (CD) SiNR-FET. Additionally,
   ED-device is inherently free of negative impacts of impurities on the
   transistor's performance. The ED SiNR-FET functionality is analyzed
   using different channel lengths, introducing the extended channel
   ED-device (ECED) with an improved I-ON/I-OFF ratio of 3.8x10(5) and a
   significant I-ON of 4.6mA/mu m. A 15 nm ECED SiNR-FET with an 8 nm
   channel is studied under different temperatures and supply voltages.
   Based on the results, low-power (LP) and high-performance (HP)
   applications are suggested for the ECED-device, with the minimum
   subthreshold swing of 64mV/dec and the maximum transconductance of 63 mu

Journal = {{CANCER}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND This study was aimed at examining the risks of subsequent
   primary cancers (SPCs) among breast cancer survivors by hormone receptor
   (HR) status and age at diagnosis.
   METHODS Data from 12 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results
   registries were used to identify 431,222 breast cancer survivors (at
   least 1 year) diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 84 years from 1992 to
   2015. Risks of SPCs were measured as the standardized incidence ratio
   (SIR) and the excess absolute risk (EAR) per 10,000 person-years.
   Poisson regression was used to test the difference in SIRs by HR status.
   RESULTS In comparison with the general population, the risk of new
   cancer diagnoses among survivors was 20\% higher for those with
   HR-positive cancers (SIR, 1.20; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI],
   1.19-1.21; EAR, 23.3/10,000 person-years) and 44\% higher for those with
   HR-negative cancers (SIR, 1.44; 95\% CI, 1.41-1.47; EAR, 45.2/10,000
   person-years), with the risk difference between HR statuses
   statistically significant. The higher risk after HR-negative cancer was
   driven by acute nonlymphocytic leukemia and breast, ovarian, peritoneal,
   and lung cancers. By age at diagnosis, the total EAR per 10,000
   person-years ranged from 15.8 (95\% CI, 14.1-17.5; SIR, 1.11) among
   late-onset (age, 50-84 years) HR-positive survivors to 69.4 (95\% CI,
   65.1-73.7; SIR, 2.24) among early-onset (age, 20-49 years) HR-negative
   survivors, with subsequent breast cancer representing 73\% to 80\% of
   the total EAR. After breast cancer, the greatest EARs were for ovarian
   cancer among early-onset HR-negative survivors, lung cancer among early-
   and late-onset HR-negative survivors, and uterine corpus cancer among
   late-onset HR-positive survivors.
   CONCLUSIONS Risks of SPCs after breast cancer differ substantially by
   subtype and age. This suggests that more targeted approaches for cancer
   prevention and early-detection strategies are needed in survivorship
   care planning.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To retrospectively assess outcome in patients with clinically
   unsuspected pulmonary embolism ( PE) at chest multi detector row
   computed tomography (CT).
   Materials and Methods: Institutional review board approval and informed
   consent were not required. PE was assessed in consecutive CT scans in
   1966 patients (mean age, 60 years; range, 15-96 years; male-female
   ratio, 1.79) and graded with severity score. Studies with true-positive
   and false-negative radiologic diagnoses were determined. Coexisting
   morbidity, anticoagulant therapy (ACT), complications, and 1-year
   outcome were reviewed. Statistical evaluation included Mann-Whitney U
   test, X-2 test, Poisson regression, and Kaplan-Meier statistics.
   Results: Scans were PE positive in 117 patients. Clinical data review
   was complete in 96 patients; 63 of 96 patients had malignancy; in 58, PE
   was not suspected. In 38 of these 58 patients, radiology report findings
   were false-negative (mean severity score, 20.21 +/- 17.88 {[}standard
   deviation] and 9.55 +/- 7.12 for those with true-positive and
   false-negative findings, respectively; P = .012). Forty-nine patients
   received therapeutic ACT; 21, prophylactic ACT; and 26, no treatment. PE
   severity was higher in patients with therapeutic ACT versus those
   without (P <.001). Bleeding complications were more frequent with
   therapeutic ACT (two early deaths, five major nonfatal hemorrhages) than
   without ( =one minor hemorrhage; P = .037). There were eight early
   deaths ( =therapeutic ACT, seven; without ACT, one; P = .037). Positive
   predictors of early death included severity score > 28, use of systemic
   thrombolytic therapy, occurrence of major hemorrhage, and new-onset
   cardiac or renal failure (P =.001- .043). Negative predictors were
   report with false-negative findings and no therapeutic ACT (P = .007-
   .037). Predictors of late death (n = 25) were older age, malignancy, and
   renal failure (P =.001 - .043).
   Conclusion: Clinically unsuspected PE may remain undetected at routine
   chest CT; these patients have favorable short-term outcome without
   therapeutic ACT. (c) RSNA, 2006.}},

Abstract = {{Human papillomavirus (HPV) has been recognized as a major factor for
   cervical cancer causation. Other factors, relating to reproduction, are
   also important. This study aims to disentangle the roles of baseline HPV
   infection, high vaginal parity (defined as having a parts per thousand
   yen4 vaginal deliveries), and the interaction between the two in
   predicting cervical cancer risk.
   The authors apply a newly developed causal-pie modeling technique to
   analyze a cohort of more than 10,000 women conducted in Taiwan with more
   than 10 years of follow-up. The rate ratios adjusted by age and
   menopausal status were further modeled by an additive Poisson regression
   with non-negative parameters. The index of causal-pie weight (CPW) was
   calculated to indicate the proportion of cervical cancer cases
   attributable to a particular class of causal pies.
   It was found that the CPWs are 36.3 \% for baseline HPV infection, 35.6
   \% for baseline HPV infection and high vaginal parity, and 28.1 \% for
   other factors.
   A causal-pie modeling based on a women cohort in Taiwan successfully
   disentangles the roles of virus factors and reproductive factors at

Abstract = {{In the present paper, it is analyzed the problem of a crack approaching
   a plastically graded microstructure along its path. The problem regards
   a nanocrystalline electrodeposited material in which the plastic
   properties (yield stress, hardness, UTS) vary much more than the elastic
   ones (Young modulus and Poisson ratio).
   In the present paper, the analysis has been conducted by employing
   ABAQUS simulations on nanocrystalline Ni-W alloys with 20 and 100 nm
   constant grain size; the results were compared with those of the
   plastically graded sheets with negative graded configuration in which
   the grain size varies between 20 and 100 nm from the surface to the
   bottom in a linear way and with positive graded configuration in which
   the grain size varies between 100 and 20 nm from the surface to the
   bottom in a linear way.
   The finite element study has conducted to the conclusion that the grade
   in the microstructure and consequent plastic mechanical properties of
   nanocrystalline Ni-W alloys leads to several changes in the driving
   force for fracture demonstrated by the different behavior of the
   effective J-integral at the crack tip in the different studied
   configurations. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{With the development of the times, the demand for rapid detection of
   trace toxic and harmful components and circulating tumor cells is
   increasing and it is urgent to develop portable specialized detection
   instruments. Since it is difficult to directly measure the sample
   material in the trace amount detection, the method of high-enrichment of
   the trace substance based on the ion concentration polarization
   principle can make the trace substance easy to be determined. In this
   paper, a novel micro-nanofuidic preconcentrator with Koch fractal
   nanochannel surface is proposed. By coupling the Poisson-Nernst-Planck
   equation and the Navier-Stokes equation, the influence of Koch fractal
   parameters on ion enrichment was studied by numerical simulation. The
   results show that increasing the unit length L, increasing fractal time
   n, using the unstraggered structure and increasing the fractal angle
   theta can significantly increase the ion enrichment ratio. In addition,
   we found that the above means can reduce the fluid flow velocity in the
   nanochannel and thus reduce the negative influence of electroosmotic
   flow on ion enrichment. This work provides a theoretical basis for the
   design of trace detection instruments based on micro-nanofluidic
   platform.}},

Abstract = {{Metamaterials are engineered structural materials with special
   mechanical properties (e.g., negative Poisson's ratio) that are not
   found in nature materials. The properties of the metamaterials can be
   tailored by designing the cellular structure at the mesoscale.
   Additively manufactured metamaterial structures provide new
   opportunities for the development of next-generation functional
   lightweight vehicle components. This paper proposes a general method for
   the design optimization of the metamaterial infilled structure component
   under transient, dynamic loads (i.e., when gradient information is not
   available). We propose to integrate the addition correction-based
   multi-fidelity approach with the Probabilistic Multi-Phase Sampling
   Strategy, which maximizes the information gain of a limited number of
   sample points. The propose method continuously improves the
   predictability of the multi-fidelity surrogate model during the
   iterative optimal search process. This method is demonstrated on two
   benchmark problems: optimization of a 2D cellular metamaterial structure
   under static tensile loads and optimization of a pseudo 3D cellular
   metamaterial structure under transient dynamic loads. In both cases, the
   proposed method finds the optimal design with fewer number of expensive,
   high-fidelity design evaluations than the traditional design
   optimization methods.}},

Abstract = {{High frequency localized vibration modes for linear isotropic elastic
   plates and rods of slowly varying thickness are shown to occur within
   the vicinity of maximal or minimal cross-sections. Long wave asymptotic
   integration close to the eigenmodes of such cross-sections is provided.
   The cases of a one integer parameter of thickness resonances (for a
   plate in plane stress) and two integer parameters (for a rod of circular
   cross-section) are fully investigated. One-dimensional Hermite-type
   equations for the eigenmodes are derived and associated frequency shifts
   from those of the thickness resonances of the maximal or minimal
   cross-section obtained. It is established that the existence of this
   type of localization phenomena is strongly dependent on the sign of the
   group velocity of the associated uniform thickness structure this being
   the same as that of the local group velocity calculated at the maximal
   or minimal cross-section. It is confirmed that positive group velocity
   allows localization for elevated structures with negative group velocity
   allowing localization only for ligaments. In each case intervals of the

Abstract = {{After the breakthrough of the study on the two-dimensional (2D) layered

Title = {{Real-World Associations of Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System
   Inhibitor Dose, Hyperkalemia, and Adverse Clinical Outcomes in a Cohort
   of Patients With New-Onset Chronic Kidney Disease or Heart Failure in
   the United Kingdom}},

Abstract = {{Background-Dosing of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors
   (RAASi) may be modified to manage associated hyperkalemia risk; however,
   this approach could adversely affect cardiorenal outcomes. This study
   investigated real-world associations of RAASi dose, hyperkalemia, and
   adverse clinical outcomes in a large cohort of UK cardiorenal patients.
   Methods and Results-This observational study included RAASi-prescribed
   patients with new-onset chronic kidney disease (n=100 572) or heart
   failure (n=13 113) first recorded between January 2006 and December 2015
   in Clinical Practice Research Datalink and linked Hospital Episode
   Statistics databases. Odds ratios associating hyperkalemia and RAASi
   dose modification were estimated using logistic generalized estimating
   equations with normal (<5.0 mmol/L) serum potassium level as the
   reference category. Patients with serum potassium >= 5.0 mmol/L had
   higher risk of RAASi down-titration (adjusted odds ratios, chronic
   kidney disease: 1.79 {[}95\% CI, 1.64-1.96]; heart failure: 1.33 {[}95\%
   CI, 1.08-1.62]). Poisson models were used to estimate adjusted incident
   rate ratios of adverse outcomes based on total RAASi exposure (<50\% and
   >= 50\% of the guideline-recommended RAASi dose). Incidence of major
   adverse cardiac events and mortality was consistently higher in the
   lower dose group (adjusted incident rate ratios: chronic kidney disease:
   5.60 {[}95\% CI, 5.29-5.93] for mortality and 1.60 {[}95\% CI,
   1.55-1.66] for nonfatal major adverse cardiac events; heart failure:
   7.34 {[}95\% CI, 6.35-8.48] for mortality and 1.85 {[}95\% CI,
   1.71-1.99] for major adverse cardiac events).
   Conclusions-The results of this real-world analysis highlight the
   potential negative impact of suboptimal RAASi dosing and the need for
   strategies that allow patients to be maintained on appropriate therapy,
   avoiding RAASi dose modification or discontinuation.}},

Abstract = {{The linear bifurcation theory is used to investigate the stability of
   soft thin films bonded to curved substrates. It is found that such a
   film can spontaneously lose its stability due to van der Waals or
   electrostatic interaction when its thickness reduces to the order of
   microns or nanometers. We first present the generic method for analyzing
   the surface stability of a thin film interacting with the substrate and
   then discuss several important geometric configurations with either a
   positive or negative mean curvature. The critical conditions for the
   onset of spontaneous instability in these representative examples are
   established analytically. Besides the surface energy and Poisson's ratio
   of the thin film, the curvature of the substrate is demonstrated to have
   a significant influence on the wrinkling behavior of the film. The
   results suggest that one may fabricate nanopatterns or enhance the
   surface stability of soft thin films on curved solid surfaces by
   modulating the mechanical properties of the films and/or such
   geometrical properties as film thickness and substrate curvature. This
   study can also help to understand various phenomena associated with
   surface instability. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Familial aggregation of Trypanosoma brucei gambiense human African
   trypanosomiasis (HAT) was investigated in 3 adjacent villages of central
   Zaire{*} where 318/1431 inhabitants had previously suffered fi om HAT.
   Neither spatial nor familial aggregation was detected when analysing the
   distribution of cases in the whole community using Poisson, negative
   binomial and pairwise odds ratio models. However, clustering of cases
   was observed when specific familial relationships were examined. The
   risk of HAT for a child was significantly increased if the mother had
   also had HAT, but it was not influenced by a past history of HAT in the
   father. Sisters and brothers of cases of HAT had a higher risk of HAT
   than siblings of individuals who had never had HAT,but no such
   association was documented for half-sisters and half-brothers. Among
   married couples, a past history of HAT in one spouse had no impact on
   the other spouse's risk of HAT. Indirect arguments suggested that
   familial clustering was a consequence of shared exposure, either
   sequential or simultaneous, rather than of genetic susceptibility. The
   existence of familial clustering should be kept in mind when
   implementing passive or active case-finding activities.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{135}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{3398-3408}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{It is known that modes in axially uniform waveguides exhibit
   backward-propagation characteristics for which group and phase
   velocities have opposite signs. For elastic plates, group velocities of
   backward Lamb waves depend only on Poisson's ratio. This paper explores
   ways to achieve a large group velocity of a backward mode in hollow
   cylinders by changing the outer to inner radius ratio, in order that
   such a mode with strong backward-propagation characteristics may be used
   in acoustic logging tools. Dispersion spectra of guided waves in hollow
   cylinders of varying radii are numerically simulated to explore the
   existence of backward modes and to choose the clearly visible backward
   modes with high group velocities. Analyses of group velocity
   characteristics show that only a small number of low order backward
   modes are suitable for practical use, and the radius ratio to reach the
   highest group velocity corresponds to the accidental degeneracy of
   neighboring pure transverse and compressional modes at the wavenumber k
   = 0. It is also shown that large group velocities of backward waves are
   achievable in hollow cylinders made of commonly encountered materials,
   which may bring cost benefits when using acoustic devices which take
   advantage of backward-propagation effects. (C) 2014 Acoustical Society

Title = {{Building egg-tray-shaped graphenes that have superior mechanical
   strength and band gap}},
Journal = {{NPJ COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{JUL 11}},
Abstract = {{The major hindrances of implementing graphene in two-dimensional (2D)
   electronics are both mechanical (the tendency to crumble and form
   ripples) and electrical (the lack of a band gap). Moreover, the
   inevitable structural defects in graphene have a profound influence on
   its physical and chemical properties. Here, we propose a family of 2D
   egg-tray graphenes constructed by arranging pentagon and heptagon
   defects in the graphene lattice based on a careful analysis of the
   topological distribution of minima, maxima, and saddle points.
   First-principles calculations show that the egg-tray graphenes are
   dynamically stable, and their energies, which depend on the
   concentration of pentagons and heptagons, are the lowest among carbon
   allotropes. These 2D carbon allotropes exhibit a large variation in
   their electronic properties, ranging from semi metallic to
   semiconducting, including some allotropes that have Dirac cones in their
   band structures. Furthermore, some egg-tray graphenes are predicted to
   have negative Poisson's ratios. The adsorption of Li atoms on the
   egg-tray graphenes is considerably stronger than the adsorption on
   perfect graphene, therefore they may absorb Li more effectively than
   graphene, which is important for improving the performance of
   rechargeable Li batteries.}},

   adjusted prevalence ratios. Of the total, 29.6\% of the elderly
   evidenced failure in the diagnosis, 4.6\% in the use of

   associated with males, presence of morbidity, having a partner, white
   skin color/ethnicity, having access to the health covenant or private
   health service, with low/medium personal income and working.
   Antihypertensive use failure was associated with low/medium personal

   energies to power directly the electronics or recharge a secondary
   battery. The key parameter of an energy harvesting (EH) device is its
   efficiency, which strongly depends on the conversion medium. To address
   this issue, metamaterials, artificial materials and structures with
   exotic properties, have been introduced for EH in recent years. They
   possess unique properties not easily achieved using naturally occurring
   materials, such as negative stiffness, mass, Poisson's ratio, and
   refractive index. The goal of this paper is to review the fundamentals,
   recent progresses and future directions in the held of
   metamaterials-based enhanced energy harvesting. An introduction on EH
   followed by the classification of potential metamaterials for EH is
   presented. A number of theoretical and experimental studies on
   metamaterials-based EH are outlined, including phononic crystals,
   acoustic metamaterials, and electromagnetic metamaterials. Finally, we
   give an outlook on future directions of metamaterials-based energy
   harvesting research including but not limited to active
   metamaterials-based EH, metamaterials-based thermal EH, and
   metamaterials-based multifunctional EH capabilities. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Biaxial tests are commonly used to investigate the mechanical behaviour
   of soft biological tissues and polymers. In the current paper we uncover
   a fundamental problem associated with the calculation of material stress
   from measured force in standard biaxial tests. In addition to measured
   forces, localised unmeasured shear forces also occur at the clamps and
   the inability to quantify such forces has significant implications for
   the calculation of material stress from simplified force-equilibrium
   relationships. Unmeasured shear forces are shown to arise due to two
   distinct competing contributions: (1) negative shear force due to
   stretching of the orthogonal clamp, and (2) positive shear force as a
   result of material Poisson-effect. The clamp shear force is highly
   dependent on the specimen geometry and the clamp displacement ratio, as
   consequently, is the measured force-stress relationship. Additionally in
   this study we demonstrate that commonly accepted formulae for the
   estimation of material stress in the central region of a cruciform
   specimen are highly inaccurate. A reliable empirical correction factor
   for the general case of isotropic materials must be a function of
   specimen geometry and the biaxial clamp displacement ratio. Finally we
   demonstrate that a correction factor for the general case of non-linear
   anison-opic materials is not feasible and we suggest the use of inverse
   finite element analysis as a practical means of interpreting
   experimental data for such complex materials. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Objective: To analyze the correlation between breastfeeding in the first
   hour of life with neonatal mortality rates.
   Methods: The present study used secondary data from 67 countries,
   obtained from the Demographic and Health Surveys. Initially, for data
   analysis, Spearman Correlation (95\% CI) and Kernel graphical analysis
   were employed, followed by a Negative Binomial Poisson regression model,
   adjusted for potential confounders.
   Results: Breastfeeding within the first hour of life was negatively
   correlated with neonatal mortality (Spearman's Rho = -0.245, p = 0.046),
   and this correlation was stronger among countries with more than 29
   neonatal deaths per 1000 newborns (Spearman's Rho = -0.327, p = 0.048).
   According to the statistical model, countries with the lowest
   breastfeeding tertiles had 24\% higher neonatal mortality rates (Rate
   ratio = 1.24, 95\% CI = 1.07-1.44, p < 0.05), even when adjusted for
   potential confounders.
   Conclusion: The protective effect of breastfeeding during the first hour
   of life on neonatal mortality in this ecological study is consistent
   with findings from previous observational studies, indicating the
   importance of adopting breastfeeding within the first hour as a routine
   neonatal care practice. (C) 2013 Sociedade Brasileira de Pediatria.

Abstract = {{this paper we present a rigorous derivation of the luminosity function
   (LF) in the presence of a background. Our approach is free from the
   logical contradictions of assigning negative values to positively
   defined quantities and avoids the use of incorrect estimates for the 68
   per cent confidence interval (error bar). It accounts for Poisson
   fluctuations ignored in previous approaches and does not require binning
   of the data. The method is extensible to more complex situations, does
   not require the existence of an environment-independent LF, and
   clarifies issues common to field LF derivations. We apply the method to
   two clusters of galaxies at intermediate redshift (z similar to 0.3)
   with among the deepest and widest K-s observations ever taken. Finally,
   we point out the shortcomings of flip-flopping magnitudes.}},

Abstract = {{We assessed the association between marijuana use and retention in HIV
   care through a retrospective cohort study of patients engaged in care at
   a large HIV clinic in 2011 and 2012. Two different retention outcomes
   were assessed: not meeting the Institute of Medicine's (IOM) retention
   definition (>2 provider visits >90 days apart in a calendar year) and
   no-show visits. Any marijuana use and frequency of marijuana use were
   obtained from a substance use screening questionnaire administered at
   each clinic visit. Modified Poisson regression was used to estimate risk
   ratios and 95\% confidence intervals for the association between
   marijuana use and retention outcomes. Marijuana use was reported by 17\%
   of 1791 patients and 21\% were not retained (IOM definition). Marijuana
   use was not associated with the IOM retention outcome, but was
   associated with missing the next scheduled appointment. A non-linear
   dose-response was observed for frequency of marijuana use and missed
   visits, with daily users having the highest risk compared to non-users.
   Daily marijuana use had a negative impact on HIV clinic attendance.
   Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms by which
   marijuana use affects this outcome to inform targeted interventions.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanical behaviour of chiral materials is of interest for the
   investigation of carbon nanotubes, honeycomb structures, auxetic
   materials and bones. This paper is concerned with a theory of chiral
   Cosserat elastic plates. In this theory, in contrast with the case of
   achiral plates, the stretching and flexure cannot be treated
   independently of each other. First, we derive the basic equations which
   characterize the deformation of chiral plates. Then, the deformation of
   an infinite plate with a circular hole is studied. The salient feature
   of solution is that a uniform pressure acting on the boundary of the
   hole produces a microrotation of the material particles.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Eye anomalies, including anophthalmos and microplithalmos
   (absent eye and small eye), are common features in congenital infection
   syndromes such as rubella. Influenza, Coxsackie virus, and Parvovirus
   are less well-established teratogens. We report an ecologic analysis of
   anophthalmia/microphthalmia prevalence in England in relation to
   temporal variation in these infections using routine infection data.
   Methods: The national (England) anophthalmos/microphthalmos register
   holds details of 406 babies (excluding chromosomal anomalies) born
   1988-1994. Weekly infection data were obtained from the U.K. Public
   Health Laboratory Service and Royal College of General Practitioners
   Weekly Returns Service. We assigned cases and births an estimated
   exposure based on the population infection counts in the gestational
   weeks known to be critical for ocular development. We calculated the
   rate ratio of anophthalmos/microphthalmos prevalence for infection in
   the 90th percentile compared with the 10th percentile by Poisson
   regression.
   Results: There was a positive association between severe
   anophthalmos/microplithalmos prevalence and Parvovirus B19 (rate ratio =
   1.26; 95\% confidence interval = 1.00-1.58) and for influenza (1.41;
   1.08-1.84). Coxsackie virus showed a negative association with any
   anophthalmos/microphthalmos (0.75; 0.58-0.98) and with severe cases
   (0.66; 0.46-0.95).
   Conclusions: This analysis provides suggestive evidence for a
   teratogenic role of influenza and Parvovirus in
   anophthalmos/microphthalmos. The role of maternal infections in
   congenital anomaly etiology is worthy of further investigation.}},

Abstract = {{Sex at an early age can have later life negative health outcomes.
   Insights on early sexual activity may help in the development of future
   health-promotion products and interventions related to pregnancy and
   sexually transmitted infections (STIs) prevention. Among Kenyan women
   participating in a contraceptive vaginal ring study, we determined: (1)
   the proportion with first sex at <= 15 years (early sex) and (2) factors
   associated with early sex. Baseline data collection and testing for
   pregnancy, STIs, and HIV were undertaken. A log-binomial or a modified
   Poisson regression was used to estimate univariable prevalence ratios
   and multivariable adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs). Among 332 women
   aged 18-34 years, the median age of first sex was 16 years, with 40.1\%
   experiencing early sex. Overall, 29.8\% reported an older first sex
   partner (>= 5 years); 83.9\% indicated lack of readiness or intentions
   at first sex; and 56.2\% received money, gifts, or favors as part of
   first sex. Early sex was more prevalent among inherited widows (a Luo
   cultural practice, aPR 1.49), gift recipients (aPR 1.38), women with a
   forced/unwanted sex history (aPR 1.42), or those with a partner of
   unknown or positive HIV status in the past 3 months (aPR 1.45). Sex
   before or at the age 15 may be associated with higher sexual risk
   behaviors. Complex power and gender relations may additionally influence
   exposure to sexual risk in our research setting.}},

Title = {{Abnormal elasticity and lattice dynamics in the L1(0)-FePd crystalline
   alloy at high pressure}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MAGNETISM AND MAGNETIC MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{510}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{We have systematically explored the pressure dependence of magnetism,
   electronic structure, elasticity and lattice dynamics of the
   ferromagnetic L1(0)-FePd crystalline alloy by employing first-principles
   calculations. All predicted properties of the ground state are well
   consistent with available experimental and theoretical results. The
   total magnetic moment decreases slowly with pressure before the
   ferromagnetic collapse critical pressure of about 164 GPa and then
   sharply decreases near the 164 GPa, and the (C-44 -C-66) value changed
   from positive to negative. The phonon dispersion relations and phonon
   densities of state are also investigated at zero and high pressures.
   Owing to the spontaneous magnetization of the system, the ferromagnetic
   L1(0)-FePd crystalline alloy is dynamically stable at pressures below
   171 GPa (above which the magnetism completely disappears). When the
   pressure was greater than 171.4 GPa, the system dynamics became
   unstable. The calculated elastic properties indicate that the L1(0)-FePd
   alloy is mechanically stable up to 180 GPa. The ferromagnetic L1(0)-FePd
   crystalline alloy has good ductility and metallicity outside the
   ferromagnetic collapse pressure region, but the L1(0)-FePd crystalline
   alloy has an abnormal phenomenon of a sudden sharp increase in
   brittleness near 162 GPa. We found this anomaly from the Pugh ratio B/G
   and Poisson's ratio of the system and the change of Cauchy pressures
   (C-12-C-66) and (C-13 -C-44) with pressure, and this anomaly was
   analyzed with compression factor and magnetoelastic force.}},

Journal = {{BRAIN INJURY}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{437-449}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Primary objective: To quantify the 10 year health service use (HSU) and
   mortality outcomes for people with a traumatic brain injury (TBI).
   Research design: A population-based matched cohort study using linked
   administrative data from Manitoba, Canada (Manitoba Injury Outcome
   Study).
   Methods and procedures: An inception cohort (1988-1991) of hospitalized
   cases with TBI aged 18-64 years (n = 1290) was identified and matched to
   a non-injured comparison group (n = 1290). Survival analysis, Negative
   binomial and Poisson regression were used to quantify associations
   between injury and HSU/mortality outcomes for 10 years following the TBI
   event.
   Main outcome and results: The majority of deaths (47.2\%) occurred in
   the first 60 days following injury. Excluding the first 60 days, the
   adjusted 10 year mortality remained elevated (mortality rate ratio =
   1.48, 95\% CI = 1.02-2.15). After adjusting for demographic
   characteristics and pre-existing health status, the TBI cohort had more
   post-injury hospitalizations (rate ratio (RR) = 1.54, 95\% CI =
   1.39-1.71), greater cumulative lengths of stay (RR= 5.14, 95\% CI =
   3.29-8.02) and a greater post-injury physician claims rate (RR = 1.44,
   95\% CI = 1.35-1.53) than the non-injured cohort.
   Conclusions: People who sustain a TBI and survive the initial acute
   phase of care experience substantially increased long-term morbidity
   compared to the general population, regardless of the level of injury
   severity.}},

Abstract = {{Compliant robotic grippers are more robust to uncertainties in grasping
   and manipulation tasks, especially when paired with tactile and
   proprioceptive feedback. Although considerable progress has been made
   towards achieving proprioceptive soft robotic grippers, current efforts
   require complex driving hardware or fabrication techniques. In this
   paper, we present a simple scalable soft robotic gripper integrated with
   high-deformation strain and pressure sensors. The gripper is composed of
   structurally-compliant handed shearing auxetic structures actuated by
   electric motors. Coupling deformable sensors with the compliant grippers
   enables gripper proprioception and object classification. With this
   sensorized system, we are able to identify objects' size to within 33\%
   of actual radius and sort objects as hard / soft with 78\% accuracy.}},

   significantly related to suicide. Counties with greater availability of

   percentage of men 65 years or older had significantly high suicide
   rates. An increase in, the While population between. 1980 and 1990 was
   also associated with a significant increase in suicide. Increases in
   psychiatrists reduced suicide rates, but the association was small.
   Psychiatrist availability may also partially reduce the effects of
   social disintegration at the county level. Primary care was not

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 20}},
Abstract = {{Electromagnetic resonators are integrated with advanced elastic material
   to develop a new type of tunable metamaterial. An
   electromagnetic-elastic metamaterial able to switch on and off its
   electromagnetic chiral response is experimentally demonstrated. Such
   tunability is attained by harnessing the unique buckling properties of
   auxetic elastic materials (buckliballs) with embedded electromagnetic
   resonators. In these structures, simple uniaxial compression results in
   a complex but controlled pattern of deformation, resulting in a shift of
   its electromagnetic resonance, and in the structure transforming to a
   chiral state. The concept can be extended to the tuning of

Abstract = {{Objective This study investigated whether a move to public housing
   affects people's use of healthcare services.
   Method Using administrative data from Manitoba, the number of
   hospitalizations, general practitioner (GP), specialist and emergency
   department (ED) visits, and prescription dnigs dispensed in the years
   before and after the housing move-in date (2012/2013) were measured for
   a public housing and matched cohort Generalized linear models with
   generalized estimating equations tested for differences between the
   cohorts in utilization trends. The data were modeled using Poisson (rate
   ratio, RR), negative binomial (incident rate ratio, IRR), and binomial
   (odds ratio, OR) distributions.
   Results GP visits (IRR = 1.04, 95\% CI 1.01-1.06) and prescriptions (IRR
   = 1.04, 95\% CI 1.02-1.05) increased, while ED visits (RR = 0.90, 95\%
   CI 0.82-1.00) and hospitalizations (OR = 0.95, 95\% CI 0.93-0.96)
   decreased over time. The public housing cohort had a significantly
   higher rate of GP visits (IRR = 1.08, 95\% CI 1.04-1.13), ED visits (IRR
   =1.18, 95\% CI 1.01-1.37), and prescriptions (IRR = 1.09, 95\% CI
   1.05-1.13), and was more likely to be hospitalized (OR =1.39, 95\% CI
   1.21-1.61) compared to the matched cohort. The rate of inpatient days
   significantly decreased for the public housing cohort, but did not
   change for the matched cohort.
   Conclusion Healthcare use changed similarly over time (except inpatient
   days) for the two cohorts. Public housing provides a basic need to a
   population who has a high burden of disease and who may not be able to
   obtain and maintain housing in the private market.}},

Abstract = {{The relationship between the incidence of childhood-onset
   insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and levels of nitrate in drinking
   water in the former Yorkshire Regional Health Authority was investigated
   by means of an ecological analysis. A population-based register
   contributed 1797 0-16-year-olds diagnosed with diabetes between 1978 and
   1994. Nitrate data were based on 9330 samples of drinking water tested
   between 1990 and 1995 in 148 water supply zones, for which 1991 census
   small area statistics were taken on population density, ethnicity and
   socio-economic status. Diabetes incidence was positively associated with
   raised mean nitrate levels with a standardised incidence ratio of 115 in
   zones with greater than 14.85 mg.l(-1) (chi(2) = 26.81, 1 df, p <
   0.001). Significant negative trends were found between standardised
   incidence ratios and proportion of non-whites in the population (chi(2)
   = 33.57, 1 df, p < 0.001), childhood population density (chi(2) = 30.81,
   1 df, p < 0.001) and the Townsend deprivation score (chi(2) = 33.89, 1
   df,p < 0.001). Poisson regression modelling, adjusting for the other
   factors, showed a significant increase in relative incidence rate ratio
   from a baseline of 1 at nitrate levels below 3.22 mg.l(-1) to 1.27 (95\%
   confidence interval 1.09,1.48) for mean nitrate levels above 14.85
   mg.l(-1). An association between higher nitrate levels in domestic
   drinking water and incidence of childhood diabetes has been
   demonstrated. This was not explained by the ethnic composition of the
   population, population density or socioeconomic status. Nitrate in
   drinking water may be a precursor of chemicals which are toxic to the
   pancreas.}},

Abstract = {{The work describes the out-of-plane properties of a curved wall
   honeycomb structure evaluated using analytical models and finite
   elements techniques. Out-of-plane properties are calculated using a
   theoretical approach based on energy theorems and validated using a
   full-scale finite element technique to simulate transverse shear tests.
   The effects of the curvature of the walls and the depth of the honeycomb
   cells on the out-of-plane elastic constants are evaluated and excellent
   agreement is observed between theoretical and numerical models. These
   curved cell wall honeycombs feature specific (i.e., relative density
   weighted) highly tailorable upper shear bounds that shift their maximum
   values with the radiuses of the curved cell walls at different internal
   cell angles. Finally, it is also shown that these honeycombs exhibit a
   particular topology with a specific upper boundary independent of the
   non-zero curvature cell wall adopted and only dependent upon the
   internal cell angle.}},

Abstract = {{Soil invertebrates are the major determinants of soil processes such as
   organic matter decomposition and nutrient cycling. However, the effect
   of quantity and quality of organic inputs on soil biota has not been
   studied in agroforestry systems in southern Africa. Variations in soil
   macrofauna abundance under maize grown in fallows of Gliricidia sepium,
   Acacia anguistissima, Leucaena collinsii, Leucaena diversifolia,
   Leucaena esculenta, Leucaena pallida, Senna siamea, Calliandra
   calothyrsus and monoculture maize were assessed at three sites with
   contrasting agro-ecological conditions in eastern Zambia. It was
   hypothesised that spatial variations in soil macrofauna abundance under
   maize crops are mediated by heterogeneity in the quality and quantity of
   organic inputs produced by these legumes. The relationships between the
   abundance of macrofauna groups and litter, leaf, stump re-sprout and
   recycled biomass, stump survival and the quality index lignin
   (L)+polyphenol (P) to nitrogen (N) ratio were assessed using generalised
   linear models assuming spatial randomness (Poisson distribution) and
   aggregation (negative binomial distribution). Earthworms, beetles and
   millipedes showed spatial aggregation, which was partly explained by the
   heterogeneity in organic resource quantity and quality. Earthworms and
   beetles were more abundant under legumes that produced high quantities
   of biomass with low (L + P) to N ratios and species that have high stump
   survival after coppicing. Millipedes were favoured by species which
   produced high quantities of biomass with high (L + P) to N ratios.
   Although ants and termites showed spatial aggregation, their
   distributions were not influenced by the quantity or quality of biomass
   produced by the legumes. Centipedes and Arachnida showed spatial
   randomness, and their distribution was not influenced by any of the
   organic quality and quantity variables.}},

   contributions of different bonds, this ``independent bond-level

   global perturbations: compression and shear. By applying a bond removal
   procedure that is both simple and experimentally relevant to remove a
   very small fraction of bonds, we can drive disordered spring networks to
   both the incompressible and completely auxetic limits of mechanical

Journal = {{MEDICAL CARE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{985-991}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background: Although hospice use may be increasing among heart failure
   patients, its association with both cost and intensity of care in this
   population has not been well examined.
   Objective: To assess the association of hospice care with resource
   utilization among a national sample of Medicare beneficiaries with heart
   failure during the last 6 months of life.
   Methods: We performed a cross-sectional analysis of the 5\% sample of
   Medicare claims data. Negative binomial regression models were used to
   compare expenditures, hospitalization rates, and intensive care unit
   (ICU) days between hospice and nonhospice beneficiaries. We used Poisson
   regression models to compare utilization of certain procedures between
   hospice and nonhospice beneficiaries.
   Results: Among 16613 Medicare beneficiaries who died with heart failure
   in 2007, 6436 (38.7\%) received hospice care during the last 6 months of
   life. The mean total medical expenditures were \$31,793 (SD 25,691)
   among decedents with hospice care, in comparison to \$34,067 (SD 40,561)
   among decedents without hospice care. However, after adjustments for
   covariates, hospice care was associated with 4\% higher expenditures
   (cost ratio, 1.04; 95\% confidence interval, CI: 1.01-1.07). Hospice use
   was associated with reduced hospitalizations (adjusted incidence rate
   ratio, 0.87, 95\% CI: 0.84-0.89), ICU days (adjusted incidence rate
   ratio, 0.68, 95\% CI: 0.63-0.73), and procedures, including cardiac
   catheterization, noninvasive ventilation, and mechanical ventilation.
   Conclusions: Despite lower rates of hospitalization, ICU days, and
   invasive procedures, hospice care was not associated with reduced
   expenditures in heart failure. Financial savings related to reduced
   intensive medical care seems to be offset by the expenditures related to
   hospice care itself.}},

Abstract = {{The mull-scale nature of architectured materials raises the need for
   advanced experimental methods suitable for the identification of their
   effective properties, especially when their size is finite and they
   undergo extreme deformations. The present work demonstrates that
   state-of-the art image processing methods combined with numerical and
   analytical models provide a comprehensive quantitative description of
   these solids and their global behaviour, including the influence of the
   boundary conditions, of the manufacturing process, and of geometric and
   constitutive non-linearities. To this end, an adapted mull-scale digital
   image correlation analysis is used to track both elongations and
   rotations of particular features of the unit cell at the local and
   global (homogenized) scale of the material. This permits to observe with
   unprecedented clarity the strain fields for various unit cells in the
   structure and to detect global deformation patterns and heterogeneities
   of the homogenized strain distribution. This method is here demonstrated
   on elastic sheets undergoing extreme longitudinal and shear
   deformations. These experimental results are compared to non-linear
   finite element simulations, which are also used to evaluate the effects
   of manufacturing imperfections on the response. A skeletal
   representation of the architectured solid is then extracted from the
   experiments and used to create a purely-kinematic truss-hinge model that
   can accurately capture its behaviour. The analysis proposed in this work
   can be extended to guide the design of two-dimensional architectured
   solids featuring other regular, quasi-regular or graded patterns, and
   subjected to other types of loads.}},

Abstract = {{Vessel wall enhancement is associated with both acute and future stroke
   in patients with cerebral amyloid angiopathy.
   BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE:
   Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a known risk factor for ischemic
   stroke though angiographic imaging is often negative. Our goal was to
   determine the relationship between vessel wall enhancement (VWE) in
   acute and future ischemic stroke in CAA patients.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS:
   This was a retrospective study of patients with new-onset neurologic
   symptoms undergoing 3T vessel wall MR imaging from 2015 to 2019. Vessel
   wall enhancement was detected on pre- and postcontrast flow-suppressed
   3D T1WI. Interrater agreement was evaluated in cerebral amyloid
   angiopathy?positive and age-matched negative participants using a
   prevalence- and bias-adjusted kappa analysis. In patients with cerebral
   amyloid angiopathy, multivariable Poisson and Cox regression were used
   to determine the association of vessel wall enhancement with acute and
   future ischemic stroke, respectively, using backward elimination of
   confounders to P < .20.
   RESULTS:
   Fifty patients with cerebral amyloid angiopathy underwent vessel wall MR
   imaging, including 35/50 (70.0\%) with ischemic stroke and 29/50
   (58.0\%) with vessel wall enhancement. Prevalence- and bias-corrected
   kappa was 0.82 (95\% CI, 0.71?0.93). The final regression model for
   acute ischemic stroke included vessel wall enhancement (prevalence ratio
   = 1.5; 95\% CI, 1.1?2.2; P = .022), age (prevalence ratio = 1.02; 95\%
   CI, 1.0?1.05; P = .036), time between symptoms and MR imaging
   (prevalence ratio = 0.9; 95\% CI, 0.8?0.9; P < .001), and smoking
   (prevalence ratio = 0.7; 95\% CI, 0.5?1.0; P = .042) with c-statistic =
   0.92 (95\% CI, 0.84?0.99). Future ischemic stroke incidence with
   cerebral amyloid angiopathy was 49.7\% (95\% CI, 34.5\%?67.2\%) per year
   over a total time at risk of 37.5 person-years. Vessel wall
   enhancement?positive patients with cerebral amyloid angiopathy
   demonstrated significantly shorter stroke-free survival with 63.9\%
   (95\% CI, 43.2\%?84.0\%) versus 32.2\% (95\% CI, 14.4\%?62.3\%) ischemic
   strokes per year, chi-square = 4.9, P = .027. The final model for future
   ischemic stroke had a c-statistic of 0.70 and included initial ischemic
   stroke (hazard ratio = 3.4; 95\% CI, 1.0?12.0; P = .053) and vessel wall
   enhancement (hazard ratio = 2.5; 95\% CI, 0.9?7.0; P = .080).
   CONCLUSIONS:
   Vessel wall enhancement is associated with both acute and future stroke
   in patients with cerebral amyloid angiopathy.}},

Journal = {{BMC MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{DEC 14}},
Abstract = {{BackgroundHIV is known to increase the likelihood of reactivation of
   latent tuberculosis to active TB disease; however, its impact on
   tuberculosis infectiousness and consequent transmission is unclear,
   particularly in low-incidence settings.MethodsNational surveillance data
   from England, Wales and Northern Ireland on tuberculosis cases in adults
   from 2010 to 2014, strain typed using 24-locus
   mycobacterial-interspersed-repetitive-units-variable-number-tandem-repea
   ts was used retrospectively to identify clusters of tuberculosis cases,
   subdivided into `first' and `subsequent' cases.Firstly, we used
   zero-inflated Poisson regression models to examine the association
   between HIV status and the number of subsequent clustered cases (a
   surrogate for tuberculosis infectiousness) in a strain type cluster.
   Secondly, we used logistic regression to examine the association between
   HIV status and the likelihood of being a subsequent case in a cluster (a
   surrogate for recent acquisition of tuberculosis infection) compared to
   the first case or a non-clustered case (a surrogate for reactivation of
   latent infection).ResultsWe included 18,864 strain-typed cases, 2238
   were the first cases of clusters and 8471 were subsequent cases. Seven
   hundred and fifty-nine (4\%) were HIV-positive.Outcome 1: HIV-positive
   pulmonary tuberculosis cases who were the first in a cluster had fewer
   subsequent cases associated with them (mean 0.6, multivariable incidence
   rate ratio {[}IRR] 0.75 {[}0.65-0.86]) than those HIV-negative (mean
   1.1).Extra-pulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) cases with HIV were less likely
   to be the first case in a cluster compared to HIV-negative EPTB cases.
   EPTB cases who were the first case had a higher mean number of
   subsequent cases (mean 2.5, IRR (3.62 {[}3.12-4.19]) than those
   HIV-negative (mean 0.6).Outcome 2: tuberculosis cases with HIV
   co-infection were less likely to be a subsequent case in a cluster (odds
   ratio 0.82 {[}0.69-0.98]), compared to being the first or a
   non-clustered case.ConclusionsOutcome 1: pulmonary tuberculosis-HIV
   patients were less infectious than those without HIV. EPTB patients with
   HIV who were the first case in a cluster had a higher number of
   subsequent cases and thus may be markers of other undetected cases,
   discoverable by contact investigations.Outcome 2: tuberculosis in
   HIV-positive individuals was more likely due to reactivation than recent
   infection, compared to those who were HIV-negative.}},

Title = {{Modeling and Analysis of Cloud Radio Access Networks Using Matern

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{4074-4087}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we analyze the performance of a cloud radio access
   network (CRAN), consisting of multiple randomly distributed remote radio
   heads (RRHs) and a macro base station (MBS), each equipped with multiple
   antennas. To model the spatial distribution of RRHs and analyze its
   performance, we use stochastic geometry tools. In contrast to previous
   works on CRAN that consider Poisson Point Process (PPP) model for the
   spatial distribution of RRHs, we consider a more realistic Matarn
   hard-core point process (MHCPP) model that imposes a certain minimal
   distance (referred to as hard-core distance) between the two RRHs so
   that the RRHs are not too close to each other. To compare system
   performance of CRAN when different transmission strategies are used,
   three RRH selection schemes are adopted including 1) the best RRH
   selection (BRS); 2) all RRHs participation (ARP); and 3) nearest RRH
   selection (NRS). Considering downlink transmission, the ergodic
   capacity, outage probability, and system throughput of CRAN are
   analytically characterized for different RRH selection schemes. The
   presented results demonstrate that compared to PPP model, the increase
   in hard-core distance will result in a higher outage probability and
   cause a negative impact on ergodic capacity. Furthermore, when the same
   total transmit power is consumed, BRS scheme provides the best outage
   performance while ARP scheme is the best RRH selection scheme when the
   same transmit SNR at each RRH is assumed. Moreover, it is shown that the
   hard-core distance has a more significant impact on systems with higher
   intensity of PPP distributed candidate points and in large hard-core
   distance regime increasing the intensity of candidate points can only
   provide a small improvement in outage performance. We extend our work to
   multiuser case with zero-forcing (ZF) precoding where it is proven that
   the results in multiuser case reduce to the derived results in this work
   by substituting K=1 for single-user.}},

   increased risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD). We investigated the
   impact of HCV cure on CKD in HIV-positive persons in the EuroSIDA study.
   Methods: HIV-positive persons with known HCV status and at least three
   serum creatinine measurements after 1/1/2004 were compared based on
   time-updated HCV-RNA and HCV treatment: anti-HCV-negative, spontaneously
   cleared HCV, chronic untreated HCV, successfully treated HCV, and
   HCV-RNA positive after HCV treatment. Poisson regression compared
   incidence rates of CKD {[}confirmed (>3 months apart) eGFR Results:
   Fourteen thousand, seven hundred and fifty-four persons were included;
   at baseline 9273 (62.9\%) were HCV-Ab negative, 696 (4.7\%) spontaneous
   clearers, 3021 (20.5\%) chronically infected, 922 (6.2\%) successfully
   treated and 842 (5.7\%) HCV-RNA positive after treatment. During 115 335
   person-years of follow-up (PYFU), 1128 (7.6\%) developed CKD; crude
   incidence 9.8/1000 PYFU (95\% CI 9.2-10.4). After adjustment, persons
   anti-HCV negative {[}adjusted incidence rate ratio (aIRR) 0.59; 95\% CI
   0.46-0.75] and spontaneous clearers (aIRR 0.67; 95\% CI 0.47-0.97) had
   significantly lower rates of CKD compared with those cured whereas
   persons chronically infected (aIRR 0.85; 95\% CI 0.65-1.12) and HCV-RNA
   positive after treatment (aIRR 0.71; 95\% CI 0.49-1.04) had similar
   rates. Analysis in those without F3/F4 liver fibrosis using a more
   rigorous definition of CKD showed similar results. Conclusion: This
   large study found no evidence that successful HCV treatment reduced CKD
   incidence. Confounding by indication, where those with highest risk of
   CKD were prioritized for HCV treatment in the DAA era, may contribute to
   these findings.}},

Abstract = {{Present biocompatible materials that are suitable for load bearing
   implants have high stiffness compared to the natural human bone. This
   mechanical mismatch causes a condition known as stress shielding. The
   current trend for overcoming this problem is to use porous scaffold
   instead of solid implants to reduce the implant stiffness. Due to the
   wide spread of metal additive manufacturing machines, porous orthopaedic
   implants can be mass produced. In this regard, a porous scaffold is
   incorporated in the design of a low stiffness hip stem. A 3D finite
   element analysis is performed to evaluate the performance of the new
   stem with the patient descending the stairs. The results of the
   numerical study show that the proposed design improves stress and strain
   distributions in the proximal region which reduce the stress shielding
   effect. Finally, a prototype of the proposed design is produced using a
   3D printer as proof of concept.}},

Abstract = {{In chiral metamaterials, the twist per axial strain (TPAS) is an
   important index to evaluate the tension-torsion coupling effect. Most
   chiral structures reported in current literatures have the appearance of
   lattice architectures, which possess limited TPAS. Inspired by DNA and
   origami structures, the proposed DNA-like chiral structure can generate
   a twist with the folding behavior of each unit. Theoretically, the value
   of TPAS of the proposed structure can achieve +co, which provides a good
   basis to design metamaterials for target tensiontorsion coupling
   properties. Also, we can design lattice structures based on the proposed
   DNA-origami concept. With the advanced additive manufacturing
   techniques, the proposed DNA-like structures can be used to fabricate
   shape memory morphing structures, smart propellers, artificial muscles,

Abstract = {{Guidelines for trip and parking generation in the United States come
   mainly from the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE). However,
   their trip and parking manuals focus on suburban locations with limited
   transit and pedestrian access. This study aims to determine how many
   fewer vehicle trips are generated and how much less parking demand is
   generated, by different housing types (single-family attached,
   single-family detached, and apartment and condo) and in different
   settings (from low density suburban environments to compact, mixed-use
   urban environments). Using household travel survey data from 30 diverse
   regions of the United States, we estimate a multilevel negative binomial
   model of vehicle trip generation and a multilevel Poisson model of
   vehicle ownership, vehicle trip generation and vehicle ownership being
   logically modelled as count variables. The models have the expected
   signs on their coefficients and have respectable explanatory power.
   Vehicle trip generation and vehicle ownership (and hence parking demand)
   decrease with the compactness of neighbourhood development, measured
   with a principal component that depends on activity density, land use
   diversity, percentage of four-way intersections, transit stop density
   and employment accessibility (after controlling for sociodemographic
   variables). The models capture the phenomena of trip degeneration' and
   car shedding' as development patterns become more compact. Reducing the
   number of required parking spaces, and vehicle trips for which
   mitigation is required, creates the potential for significant savings
   when developing urban projects. Guidelines are provided for using study
   results in transportation planning.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To determine whether heterosexual transmission of HIV differs
   according to HIV-1 subtype. Design: A retrospective observational
   cohort.
   Methods: HIV-1 subtype effects on heterosexual HIV-1 transmission were
   determined among 268 HIV-discordant couples retrospectively identified
   from a population cohort in Rakai, Uganda. HIV-1 subtype (gag and gp41
   sequencing and multiregion hybridization assay) and viral loads (reverse
   transcriptase PCR) were determined. Adjusted incidence rate ratios (adj
   IRR) of HIV transmission by subtype were estimated by multivariable
   Poisson regression adjusting for characteristics of index HIV-positive
   and HIV-negative partners.
   Results: Adjusting for index HIV-positive partners' age, viral load,
   stage of disease, genital ulcer disease, and HIV-negative partners'
   genital ulcer disease and nonuse of condoms, subtype A viruses were
   associated with a higher rate of transmission than subtype D {[}adj.IRR
   1.98, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.17-3.34], but no differences in
   transmission were observed between recombinant viruses and subtype D
   (aIRR 1.53, P=0.25). Index-positive partners' age less than 30 years
   (adj.IRR 3.44, 95\%. Cl 1.75-6.78) and viral load (adj.IRR 2.37, 95\% Cl
   1.75-3.21), and index-negative partners' genital ulcer disease (adj.IRR
   1.71, 95\% Cl 1.08-2.70) and nonuse of condoms (adj.IRR 1.94, 95\% Cl
   1.15-3.28) were significant determinants of HIV transmission.
   Conclusion: In Rakai, Uganda, subtype A viruses have a significantly
   higher rate of heterosexual transmission than subtype D viruses.

Abstract = {{The smaller-ion shell (SiS) model of strong binary electrolyte solutions
   extends the Debye-Huckel theory to the case of ions of unequal size; it
   is effective for many electrolytes of the various families in water at
   25 degrees C up to moderate concentrations, with ion-size parameters
   (ISPs) of co-ions being equal to the ionic diameters, and with a varying
   degree of ISP additivity. A SiS analysis is now provided for aqueous
   solutions of the acids HCl, HBr, HI, and HClO(4) at 25 degrees C; theory
   fits very well with experiment when the mean effective ionic diameter of
   the proton (H(3)O(+)) is chosen as similar to 1.1 angstrom and the mean
   anion size is the corresponding crystallographic diameter, as with other
   electrolytes having the same anion. The ISP nonadditivity is positive
   and large, apparently reflecting a strong polarizing effect of the small
   proton on the large anion. The SiS-derived single-ion activity
   coefficients of the proton allow calculation of the pH of the acids, and
   reliable values are obtained below the known limit of pH approximate to
   2, i.e., smaller and even negative values. The computed pH compares well
   with the experimentally derived Hammett acidity function, H(0), up to
   moderate concentration; differences between the two functions at higher
   concentration shed light on the activity coefficients of Hammett
   indicators and their response to increasing acid strength.}},

Abstract = {{Estrogen receptor (ER) status is important for breast cancer survival,
   it is however unclear how prognosis of contralateral breast cancer (CBC)
   is affected by ER-status of the two tumors. We conducted a large,
   population-based study of ER-status of both tumors in CBC patients and
   its influence on prognosis. The cohort consisted of all women diagnosed
   with CBC in Stockholm, Sweden during 1976-2005, with information on
   ER-status from medical records (N = 933). Prognosis was modeled as
   incidence rates of distant metastasis via Poisson regression. The
   proportion of CBCs with both cancers of the same ER-status was
   significantly larger than expected by chance. For synchronous
   (simultaneous) cancers the prognosis was significantly affected by the
   combined ER-status of both tumors (p = 0.01). Compared to unilateral
   breast cancer patients the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for patients with
   double ER-positive tumors was 1.25 (95 \% CI: 0.88-1.76), for
   ER-discordant tumors 2.19 (95 \% CI: 1.18-4.08) and for double
   ER-negative tumors 3.95 (95 \% CI: 1.77-8.81). For metachronous
   (non-simultaneous) cancers, women with double ER-positive tumors had
   similarly bad prognosis (IRR = 2.95; 95 \% CI: 2.39-3.64) as women with
   double ER-negative tumors (IRR = 2.88; 95 \% CI: 1.83-4.52). Both
   shorter time span between first and second cancer and endocrine therapy
   for the first cancer further worsened prognosis of women with double
   ER-positive metachronous CBC. For synchronous CBC patients, ER-pattern
   of both tumors is an important prognosticator, while among metachronous
   CBC patients, double ER-positive tumors confer equally bad prognosis as
   double ER-negative cancers. Our results indicate that this might be due
   to endocrine therapy resistance.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Men who have sex with men (MSM) have higher rates of
   substance use compared to men who have sex with women. Among MSM, drug
   use is linked to higher-risk sexual behavior and acquisition of HIV and
   other sexually transmitted infections. Objectives: We hypothesize that
   time since first acting on one's same sex attraction, or one's gay age,
   could be predictive of drug using behavior. Methods: We examined this
   question among 176 MSM, aged 18-35, presenting at a public sexual health
   clinic. Behavioral data were captured using interviewer- and
   self-administered surveys and clinical data were extracted from medical
   records. We used modified Poisson regression to examine associations
   between gay age and recent recreational drug use, and separately,
   between gay age and recent marijuana use. Results: In total, 43\% of
   participants reported recent marijuana use and 26\% of participants
   reported recent use of other drugs. The associations between gay age and
   marijuana use and other drug use varied by HIV status. After adjustment
   for biological age, race, and education, a one-year increase in gay age
   was associated with significantly increased drug use among HIV-negative
   men (adjusted prevalence ratio (aPR): 1.08; 95\% confidence interval
   (CI): 1.03-1.14), but we observed no association between gay age and
   drug use among HIV-positive men (aPR: 0.96, 95\% CI: 0.86-1.07). Gay age
   was not associated with marijuana use in HIV-negative (aPR: 1.00, 95\%
   CI: 0.95-1.04) or HIV-positive (aPR: 1.06, 95\% CI: 0.98-1.14) men.
   Conclusions: In summary, HIV-negative MSM who had experienced more time
   since first same-sex experience had significantly increased prevalence
   of recent drug use.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the present population study was to evaluate the impact of
   early childhood caries (ECC) on the oral health-related quality of life
   (OHRQoL) of preschool children and their parents/caregivers. A random
   sample of 638 children (aged 2-5 years) underwent a clinical oral
   examination to assess ECC, and their parents were invited to answer two
   questionnaires: one on the OHRQoL of the child, the Early Childhood Oral
   Health Impact Scale, and another on the characteristics and
   sociodemographic conditions of the child. Descriptive analysis, chi(2)
   test, Mann-Whitney test, Kruskal-Wallis test, and hierarchically
   adjusted Poisson regression models were used. The prevalence of ECC was
   52.2\%. The number of teeth with decay ranged from 1 (n = 42; 6.6\%) to
   20 (n = 5; 0.8\%), averaging 2.86 (SD = 4.04). There was a significant
   difference between the severity of ECC and OHRQoL in terms of the impact
   on both child and family (p < 0.001). An increase in the severity of ECC
   resulted in an increased negative impact on the quality of life of the
   child (rate ratio, RR = 5.32; 95\% confidence interval, Cl: 3.67-7.71).
   Greater age of the mother had a positive impact on the OHRQoL of
   preschool children (RR = 0.72; 95\% Cl: 0.54-0.97). Increased age
   resulted in an increased negative impact on the quality of life of the
   child (RR = 2.97; 95\% Cl: 1.61-5.47). ECC has a negative impact on the
   OHRQoL of children aged 2-5 years and their parents. Mothers aged 30 or
   older reported better OHRQoL, independent of the presence of ECC and the
   age of the child. Copyright (C) 2012 S. Karger AG, Basel}},

Abstract = {{Background Self-reports of medical findings are indispensable in
   clinical practice and research but subject to recall bias. We analysed
   the recall accuracy of notifications about incidental findings (IFs)
   from a whole-body MRI examination and assessed determinants of recall
   error.
   Methods Data from 3746 participants of a postal follow-up survey
   conducted on average 2.47 years after examination in the
   population-based Study of Health in Pomerania were analysed. Among
   those, 2185 (58.3\%) underwent whole-body MRI at baseline, and findings
   of potential clinical relevance were disclosed in standardised postal
   letters. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and
   negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated to determine the
   accuracy of self-reports. Poisson regression analysis was conducted to
   analyse predictors for false-positive and false-negative recall.
   Results An IF was disclosed to 622 (28.5\%) individuals; 81.5\% had
   tumour relevance. The overall sensitivity and PPV of participants'
   self-reports were 80\% and 60\%, respectively. PPvs were higher among
   women, better educated and married participants and among those with
   good verbal memory. Among MRI participants, lower educational level was
   associated with a higher risk of false-positive recall (risk ratio (RR)
   1.44, 95\% CI 1.01 to 2.03), while increasing age was associated with a
   higher risk of false-negative recall (RR 1.64, 95\% CI 1.33 to 2.01).
   Conclusions Most participants correctly recalled disclosed IFs. However,
   the probability of an event in case of a positive recall is barely above
   50\%. Therefore, relying on subjects' recall of disclosed IFs will lead
   to a relevant proportion of errors. Clinicians and researchers should be
   aware of this problem and of participants' characteristics which may
   moderate the probability of correct decisions based on recalled
   findings.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a creative metamaterial-based substrate (MetaSub)
   for piezoelectric energy harvesters. The MetaSub is a platform with a
   high flexibility in both longitudinal and transverse directions. The
   novel design of the MetaSub remarkably improves the productivity of
   strain-induced devices in structural health monitoring (SHM)
   applications, internet of thing (IoT) networks, micro electromechanical
   (MEMS) systems, vibration energy harvesters, sensor and actuators, and
   hundreds applications that its performance is related to their
   deformation capability. In this paper, a piezoelectric type of energy
   harvester is selected to be studied numerically as the first application
   of the MetaSub. The finite element results predict the average power
   output gained by the MetaSub piezoelectric energy harvester to be up to
   19.2 times more than power generated by an equivalent conventional

Abstract = {{Background
   UNAIDS official estimates of national HIV prevalence are based on trends
   observed in antenatal clinic surveillance, after adjustment for the
   reduced fertility of HIV positive women. Uptake of ART may impact on the
   fertility of HIV positive women, implying a need to re-estimate the
   adjustment factors used in these calculations. We analyse the effect of
   antiretroviral therapy (ART) provision on population-level fertility in
   Southern and East Africa, comparing trends in HIV infected women against
   the secular trends observed in uninfected women.
   Methods
   We used fertility data from four community-based demographic and HIV
   surveillance sites: Kisesa (Tanzania), Masaka and Rakai (Uganda) and
   uMkhanyakude (South Africa). All births to women aged 15-44 years old
   were included in the analysis, classified by mother's age and HIV status
   at time of birth, and ART availability in the community. Calendar time
   period of data availability relative to ART Introduction varied across
   the sites, from 5 years prior to ART roll-out, to 9 years after.
   Calendar time was classified according to ART availability, grouped into
   pre ART, ART introduction (available in at least one health facility
   serving study site) and ART available (available in all designated
   health facilities serving study site). We used Poisson regression to
   calculate age adjusted fertility rate ratios over time by HIV status,
   and investigated the interaction between ART period and HIV status to
   ascertain whether trends over time were different for HIV positive and
   negative women.
   Results
   Age-adjusted fertility rates declined significantly over time for HIV
   negative women in all four studies. However HIV positives either had no
   change in fertility (Masaka, Rakai) or experienced a significant
   increase over the same period (Kisesa, uMkhanyakude). HIV positive
   fertility was significantly lower than negative in both the pre ART
   period (age adjusted fertility rate ratio (FRR) range 0.51 95\% CI
   0.42-0.61 to 0.73 95\% CI 0.64-0.83) and when ART was widely available
   (FRR range 0.57 95\% CI 0.52-0.62 to 0.83 95\% CI 0.78-0.87), but the
   difference has narrowed. The interaction terms describing the difference
   in trends between HIV positives and negatives are generally significant.
   Conclusions
   Differences in fertility between HIV positive and HIV negative women are
   narrowing over time as ART becomes more widely available in these
   communities. Routine adjustment of ANC data for estimating national HIV
   prevalence will need to allow for the impact of treatment.}},

Title = {{Perceived HIV stigma and HIV testing among men and women in rural

Abstract = {{Background Stigma is a formidable social structural barrier to HIV
   testing, and yet the effect of stigma on HIV testing is rarely examined
   at the community level. We aimed to examine the geospatial relationships
   of perceived HIV stigma and HIV testing among men and women living in
   rural Uganda.
   Methods Women and men (aged >= 18 years or emancipated minor) residing
   in rural areas of Uganda who self-identified as HIV negative completed
   interviews that included measures of HIV testing history and how
   participants perceived HIV stigma. We used geospatial cluster analyses
   to identify areas of higher perceived stigma and lower perceived stigma
   and the geographical dispersion of these areas. We used Poisson
   regression models stratified by gender to test individual-level and
   community-level perceived stigma in relation to frequency of HIV testing
   in the previous 2 years.
   Findings Between Nov 25, 2015, and May 26, 2017, we interviewed 9740
   participants (4359 {[}45\%] men and 5381 {[}55\%] women]), among whom
   940 (9\%) had never been tested for HIV, and among those who had been
   tested, 1131 (12\%) had not been tested in the previous 2 years. Men
   (3134 {[}72\%] of 4359) were less likely to have been tested in the past
   2 years than women (4535 {[}84\%] of 5381) were (p<0.001). We used
   Poisson regression models, reporting B coefficients, to test study
   hypotheses regarding the effects of individual-level and community-level
   stigma on HIV testing frequency counts. Multilevel modelling showed that
   women showed significant individual-level (B=-0.173, p<0.001) and
   community-level (B=-0.223, p<0.001) associations between lower stigma
   predicting higher rates of HIV testing. For men, lower individual-level
   perceived stigma was also associated with higher testing frequency
   (B=-0.030, p=0.018), whereas higher community-level perceived stigma was
   associated with higher testing frequency (B=0.077, p=0.008).
   Interpretation Our results suggest that perceived HIV stigma at the
   community level exerts a differential influence on testing for women and
   men. HIV testing campaigns that are targeted to men and women in rural
   Uganda will require gender tailoring to fit local contexts. Copyright

Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{954-964}},
Abstract = {{Self-diffusion coefficients of ions of a charge and size symmetric +1 :
   -1 electrolyte were studied in the presence of ionic obstacles carrying
   ten negative elementary charges within a ``soft{''} version of the
   primitive model of electrolytes. The Brownian dynamics method was used
   to calculate the diffusion coefficients of mobile species. Simulations
   were complemented with the replica Ornstein-Zernike theory for
   partly-quenched systems to calculate the activity coefficients of
   individual ions and the Donnan exclusion coefficient. We study the
   influence of (i) the size of the pores, which varies with the
   concentration of quenched charged nanoparticles, and (ii) the presence
   of added salt on the mobility and thermodynamics of small ions. We show
   that for dilute matrices (low concentration of charged obstacles) the
   diffusion coefficient of counterions is smaller or equal to that of
   co-ions. The opposite is true for concentrated matrices: here
   counterions are considerably faster than co-ions. In dilute matrices,
   where obstacles are distributed at larger distances, the counterions are
   strongly attracted by fixed obstacles. As a consequence, they are slowed
   down in comparison with the co-ions. In concentrated matrices, where the
   average size of the pores is small, the counterions can take advantage
   of hopping from one obstacle to another, whereas the co-ions, repelled
   by the obstacles, need to diffuse in the space between the layers of
   counterions surrounding the obstacles. Thermodynamic calculations are
   consistent with the Brownian dynamics results.}},

Title = {{Screen detection of ductal carcinoma in situ and subsequent incidence of

Abstract = {{Background The value of screen detection and treatment of ductal
   carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a matter of controversy. At present, the
   extent to which the diagnosis and treatment of DCIS could prevent the
   occurrence of invasive breast cancer in the future is not clear. We
   sought to estimate the association between detection of DCIS at
   screening and invasive interval cancers subsequent to the relevant
   screen.
   Methods We obtained aggregate data for screen-detected cancers from 84
   local screening units within 11 regional Quality Assurance Reference
   Centres in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland from the National Health
   Service Breast Screening Programme. Data for DCIS diagnoses were
   obtained for women aged 50-64 years who were invited to and attended
   mammographic breast screening from April 1, 2003, to March 31, 2007 (4
   screening years). Patient-level data for interval cancer arising in the
   36 months after each of these were analysed by Poisson regression with
   invasive interval cancer screen detection rate as the outcome variable;
   DCIS detection frequencies were fitted first as a continuous and then as
   a categorical variable. We repeated this analysis after adjustment with
   both small size and high-grade invasive screen-detected cancers.
   Findings We analysed data for 5 243 658 women and on interval cancers
   occurring in the 36 months after the relevant screen. The average
   frequency of DCIS detected at screening was 1.60 per 1000 women screened
   (median 1.50 {[}unit range 1.54-3.56] per 1000 women). There was a
   significant negative association of screen-detected DCIS cases with the
   rate of invasive interval cancers (Poisson regression coefficient -0.084
   {[}95\% CI -0.13 to -0.03]; p=0.002). 90\% of units had a DCIS detection
   frequency within the range of 1.00 to 2.22 per 1000 women; in these
   units, for every three screen-detected cases of DCIS, there was one
   fewer invasive interval cancer in the next 3 years. This association
   remained after adjustment for numbers of small screen-detected invasive
   cancers and for numbers of grade 3 invasive screen-detected cancers.
   Interpretation The association between screen-detected DCIS and
   subsequent invasive interval cancers suggests that detection and
   treatment of DCIS is worthwhile in prevention of future invasive
   disease.}},

Abstract = {{Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) with oral anticoagulants may lead to
   under-anticoagulation and increased risk of thromboembolism. Although
   warfarin is susceptible to numerous DDIs, few studies have examined DDIs
   resulting in thromboembolism or those involving direct-acting oral
   anticoagulants (DOACs). We aimed to identify medications that increase
   the rate of hospitalization for thromboembolic events when taken
   concomitantly with oral anticoagulants. We conducted a high-throughput
   pharmacoepidemiologic screening study using Optum Clinformatics Data
   Mart, 2000-2016. We performed self-controlled case series studies among
   adult users of oral anticoagulants (warfarin, dabigatran, rivaroxaban,
   apixaban, and edoxaban) with at least one hospitalization for a
   thromboembolic event. Among eligible patients, we identified all oral
   medications frequently co-prescribed with oral anticoagulants as
   potential interacting precipitants. Conditional Poisson regression was
   used to estimate rate ratios comparing precipitant exposed vs. unexposed
   time for each anticoagulant-precipitant pair. To minimize within-person
   confounding by indication for the precipitant, we used pravastatin as a
   negative control object drug. Multiple estimation was adjusted using
   semi-Bayes shrinkage. We screened 1,622 oral anticoagulant-precipitant
   drug pairs and identified 226 (14\%) drug pairs associated with
   statistically significantly elevated risk of thromboembolism. Using
   pravastatin as the negative control object drug, this list was reduced
   to 69 potential DDI signals for thromboembolism, 33 (48\%) of which were
   not documented in the DDI knowledge databases Lexicomp and/or
   Micromedex. There were more DDI signals associated with warfarin than
   DOACs. This study reproduced several previously documented oral
   anticoagulant DDIs and identified potential DDI signals that deserve to
   be examined in future etiologic studies.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The rates and risk factors for overall and medical
   condition-specific hospitalizations in HIV-positive women have not been
   examined in detail or compared with rates in risk factor-matched
   HIV-negative women.
   Objective: To determine the rates and risk factors for overall and
   condition-specific hospitalizations.
   Methods: Prospective cohort study of 885 HIV-positive women and 425
   HIV-negative women followed for semiannual research visits between 1993
   and 2000 in 4 urban locations in the United States. Outcome measures
   were hospitalization diagnoses with diabetes mellitus, nonacute renal
   conditions, cardiovascular conditions, liver conditions, AIDS defining
   conditions, and overall hospitalizations. Clinical and laboratory risk
   factors were assessed at research visits every 6 months, and effects of
   risk factors on hospitalization rates were calculated using generalized
   estimating equations and Poisson regression.
   Results: Renal laboratory abnormalities, hypertension, and clinical AIDS
   were each associated with 3 of the 5 condition-specific hospitalization
   rates. Over time, diabetes-, nonacute renal-, and cardiovascular-related
   rates were flat or slightly increased and liver-related rates were
   significantly increased in HIV-positive women. Hospitalization rates
   with an AIDS-defining condition declined sharply in the latter half of
   the study period.
   Conclusions: In this population of largely African-American, inner-city,
   HIV-infected women, renal abnormalities, hypertension, and hepatitis C
   virus infection were common. Rate ratios indicated that ``non-AIDS{''}
   risk factors were important predictors of hospitalization. In the highly
   active antiretroviral therapy era, clinicians must pay attention to
   these risk factors for morbidity and should closely monitor renal
   abnormalities, hypertension, and hepatitis status.}},

Abstract = {{Background/Aim Enamel fractures are the most common type of traumatic
   dental injury (TDI) in children and adolescents. Recognizing the impact
   of these fractures on oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) could
   contribute to the establishment of treatment protocols. The aim of this
   study was to assess and quantify the impact of enamel fractures on
   overall OHRQoL and domain scores in adolescents. Materials and Methods A
   cross-sectional study was conducted with 775 adolescents aged 11 to 14
   years in the city of Santo angelo in southern Brazil. Sociodemographic
   variables were collected from parents/caregivers using a structured
   questionnaire. The adolescents answered the Child Perceptions
   Questionnaire (CPQ(11-14)). Physical examinations were performed by an
   examiner who had undergone training and calibration exercises for the
   investigation of TDI (Andreasen criteria), dental caries (WHO criteria),
   and malocclusion (Dental Aesthetic Index). Data analysis involved
   Poisson regression with robust variance. Results The prevalence of TDI
   was 11.9\% and enamel fractures accounted for 79.3\% of all injuries. In
   the multivariate analysis, adolescents with enamel fractures had 29\%
   higher CPQ(11-14) scores (worse OHRQoL) than those without TDI, even
   after adjustment for sociodemographic and clinical variables (mean ratio
   = 1.29; 95\% CI: 1.09-1.53; P = .003). Enamel fractures exerted a
   negative impact on the functional limitation, emotional well-being, and
   social well-being domains. Conclusions Enamel fractures exert a negative
   impact on the OHRQoL of adolescents, suggesting that subjective measures
   should be incorporated in the evaluation of patients with this traumatic
   injury.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The kinetic theory of an electron emitting electrode immersed in a
   low-density isotropic plasma is developed for the first time to include
   the theory of formation of a virtual cathode in this scenario. In
   addition to virtual cathode solution for supercritical emission, the
   potential profile solution for subcritical and critical emission is also
   included. The plasma-electron and emitted-electron are assumed to have
   half Maxwellian velocity distributions at the sheath entrance and
   electrode surface, respectively, while the plasma ions are assumed to be
   cold. Poisson's equation is then solved numerically for charge densities
   in the assumed negative sheath structure. The resulting potential
   profiles in the sheath for the floating and current carrying
   electrode/wall are calculated numerically. These potential profiles show
   a smooth transition from subcritical to critical and to supercritical
   emissions with increasing emitted-electron temperature T-e,T-em
   (decreasing parameter alpha = T-e,T-pl/(Te,em), plasma-electron to
   emitted-electron temperature ratio). The numerical solution of potential
   profiles for supercritical emission confirms the formation of a virtual
   cathode. The structure of the virtual cathode is dependent on the chosen
   boundary values. These results also show that the virtual cathode
   potential profile structure exists around alpha < 5 to alpha = 1.5 but
   the solution at alpha = 1 does not exist in this scenario. It indicates
   that the present model is applicable only to the situation where the
   sheath potential is negative relative to plasma potential. Published

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND Cholesterol- overloaded high- density lipoprotein ( HDL)
   particles exert a negative impact on the antiatherogenic function of HDL
   in experimental studies. However, it remains unclear whether
   cholesterol- overloaded HDL particle is involved in the development of
   atherosclerosis in humans. OBJECTIVES The objective of this study was to
   explore whether cholesterol- overloaded HDL particles are associated
   with the progression of carotid atherosclerosis in a cardiovascular
   disease- free population. METHODS Baseline HDL particle number was
   measured using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy in 930
   participants ages 45 to 74 years in a community- based cohort study. An
   estimate of cholesterol molecules per HDL particle ( HDL- C/ P ratio)
   was calculated as the ratio of HDL cholesterol to HDL particles. HDL- C/
   P ratio was categorized as < 41.0 ( lowest), 41.0 to 46.9, 47.0 to 52.9,
   and \$ 53.0 ( highest) using a fixed increment method. Modified Poisson
   regression was used to assess the association between HDL- C/ P ratio
   and 5- year progression of carotid atherosclerosis as indicated by
   progression of carotid plaques and change in total plaque area ( TPA).
   RESULTS Mean baseline HDL- C/ P ratio was 46.4 9.3 ( range 23.8 to
   86.9). Baseline HDL- C/ P ratio was significantly associated with 5-
   year progression of carotid atherosclerosis. Participants with the
   highest HDL- C/ P ratio had 1.56- fold ( 95\% confidence interval: 1.14
   to 2.13; p 0.006) increased progression compared with those with the
   lowest level. Among participants without baseline plaque, TPA in re-
   examination was larger by 9.4 mm2 in the subgroup with the highest level
   when compared with the lowest level. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest
   that cholesterol- overloaded HDL particles are independently associated
   with the progression of carotid atherosclerosis. This may explain why in
   recent trials raising HDL cholesterol was not beneficial. This study
   strongly suggests that the combination of cholesterol content and
   particle number determines the antiatherogenic function of HDLs, rather
   than either parameter alone. ( J Am Coll Cardiol 2015; 65: 355- 63) c

Abstract = {{Mediastinitis after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) gives a
   longstanding chronic inflammation and has a detrimental negative effect
   on long-term survival. For this reason, we aimed to study the effect of
   mediastinitis on graft patency after CABG. The epidemiologic design was
   of an exposed (mediastinitis, n = 41) versus non-exposed
   (non-mediastinitis, controls, n = 41) cohort with two endpoints: (i)
   obstruction of saphenous vein grafts (SVG) and (ii) obstruction of the
   internal mammary artery (IMA) grafts. The graft patency was evaluated
   with coronary CT-angiography examination at a median follow-up of 27
   years. The number of occluded SVG in the mediastinitis group was 189\%
   versus 155\% in the control group. Using generalized estimating
   equations model with exchangeable matrix, and confounding effect of
   ischaemic time and patients age, we found no significant association
   between presence of mediastinitis and SVG obstruction {[}rate ratio (RR)
   = 096, 95\% CI (052-267), P = 0697]. The number of occluded IMA grafts
   was 105\% in the mediastinitis group and 24\% in the control group.
   Using the Poisson regression model, we estimated RR = 548, 95\% CI
   (143-210) and P = 0013. There was a significant association between
   mediastinitis and IMA graft obstruction, when controlling for the
   confounding effect of ischaemic time, body mass index, presence of
   diabetes mellitus and the number of diseased vessels. Presence of
   mediastinitis increases the risk of IMA graft obstruction. This may
   confirm the importance of inflammation as a major contributor to the
   pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and explain the negative effect of
   mediastinitis on a long-term survival.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Hypopituitarism is associated with an increased mortality
   rate but the reasons underlying this have not been fully elucidated. The
   purpose of this study was to evaluate mortality and associated factors
   within a large GH-replaced population of hypopituitary patients.
   Design: In KIMS (Pfizer International Metabolic Database) 13 983
   GH-deficient patients with 69 056 patient-years of follow-up were
   available.
   Methods: This study analysed standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) by
   Poisson regression. IGF1 SDS was used as an indicator of adequacy of GH
   replacement. Statistical significance was set to P<0.05.
   Results: All-cause mortality was 13\% higher compared with normal
   population rates (SMR, 1.13; 95\% confidence interval, 1.04-1.24).
   Significant associations were female gender, younger age at follow-up,
   underlying diagnosis of Cushing's disease, craniopharyngioma and
   aggressive tumour and presence of diabetes insipidus. After controlling
   for confounding factors, there were statistically significant negative
   associations between IGF1 SDS after 1, 2 and 3 years of GH replacement
   and SMR. For cause-specific mortality there was a negative association
   between 1-year IGF1 SDS and SMR for deaths from cardiovascular diseases
   (P=0.017) and malignancies (P=0.044).
   Conclusions: GH-replaced patients with hypopituitarism demonstrated a
   modest increase in mortality rate; this appears lower than that
   previously published in GH-deficient patients. Factors associated with
   increased mortality included female gender, younger attained age,
   aetiology and lower IGF1 SDS during therapy. These data indicate that GH
   replacement in hypopituitary adults with GH deficiency may be considered
   a safe treatment.}},

Title = {{HIV serologically indeterminate individuals: Future HIV status and risk

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 26}},
Abstract = {{Background Indeterminate HIV test results are common, but little is
   known about the evolution of indeterminate serology and its
   sociodemographic and behavioral correlates. We assessed future HIV
   serological outcomes for individuals with indeterminate results and
   associated factors in Rakai, Uganda. Methods 115,944 serological
   results, defined by two enzyme immunoassay (EIAs), among 39,440
   individuals aged 15-49 years in the Rakai Community Cohort Study were
   assessed. Indeterminate results were defined as contradictory EIAs.
   Modified Poisson regression models with generalized estimating equations
   were used to assess prevalence ratios (PRs) of subsequent HIV
   serological outcomes and factors associated with HIV indeterminate
   results. Results The prevalence of HIV serologically indeterminate
   results was 4.9\%. Indeterminate results were less likely among women
   than men (adjPR 0.76, 95\% CI 0.71,0.81), in unmarried participants than
   married participants (adjPR 0.92, 95\% CI 0.85,99), and in individuals
   with primary (adjPR 0.90, 95\% CI 0.80,1.02), secondary (adjPR 0.83,
   95\% CI 0.73,0.96) and post-secondary (adjPR 0.75, 95\% CI 0.60,0.94)
   education, relative to no education. The proportions of persons with
   indeterminate results progressing to HIV positive, negative or
   indeterminate results in subsequent visits was 5\%, 71\% and 24\%,
   respectively. Conclusion HIV serologically indeterminate results were
   associated with gender and marital status. HIV surveillance programs
   should develop a protocol for reporting individuals with mixed or
   persistently indeterminate HIV results on multiple follow-up visits.
   Most indeterminate results became HIV-negative over time, but follow-up
   is still needed to detect positive serologies.}},

Abstract = {{The banana root borer, Cosmopolites sordidus Germar (Coleoptera:
   Curculionidae), is a major pest in many banana (Musa spp.)producing
   regions of the world, causing yield losses of up to 100\%. The aims of
   this study were to define the spatial distribution pattern of C.
   sordidus in banana plantations, to determine the probability
   distribution model that best describes the sampling data, and to develop
   a sequential sampling plan for this pest. Aggregation was investigated
   using aggregation indices and theoretical frequency distributions. To
   quantify the number of insects, 80 traps were distributed in a
   commercial banana plantation with an area of 4 ha and inspections were
   performed every 2 wk from 2005 to 2008. The sequential sampling plan was
   based on Wald's sequential probability ratio test. The calculated
   indices indicated moderate aggregation, with a common k parameter of the
   negative binomial distribution equal to 3.29. The best model for
   predicting the spatial distribution of the insects was the negative
   binomial distribution, which fit 93\% of the inspections, followed by
   the Neyman Type A distribution, which fit 90\% of the surveys, and
   Poisson's distribution, which fit only one survey. A sequential sampling
   plan was generated with Type I and II error rates of 5\%, for which 19
   was the maximum expected number of samples required to reach a decision
   for an infestation mean of approximately 3.7 insects per trap. The
   validation showed that the constructed plan is reliable and provides
   correct recommendations for decision-making in pest control.}},

Abstract = {{Although the information derived from biological markers could
   conceivably be used to overcome some of the problems intrinsic to
   virtually all epidemiologic study designs-case definition, true exposure
   level, host susceptibility and resistance to factors of interest, the
   misclassification of study subjects (false positive and false negative
   test results), etc-, we are still unable to resolve all such problems
   with the tools available at present. Biological markers seem more
   promising as potential indicators of the degree of susceptibility than
   as indicators of disease occurrence, an application requiring further
   technical refinement. Currently biological markers are employed in
   public health mainly to screen for particular diseases. Unfortunately,
   these markers have their limitations. For one thing, it is unlikely that
   they will completely eliminate the problem of false positive and false
   negative results, since DNA from solid tumors undergoes slight
   degradation due to necrosis and since genetic markers are susceptible to
   the effects of exposure to medication, diet, sex, ethnicity, and even
   the circadian cycle. And even if false positives and negatives were
   ultimately eliminated, it would be impossible to use many of the
   analytical tools based on two by two tables, such as the chi squared
   test, logistic regression, the Poisson regression, Cox' proportional
   hazards ratio, etc., since such tools rely on comparisons of the number
   of false positives and negatives in the exposed and non-exposed groups.
   Finally, albeit no less important, certain ethical issues must be
   carefully considered before allowing the massive use of human genetic
   markers, which could lead to violations of the rights of individuals,
   families, and communities if carried out in an indiscriminate,
   unregulated fashion. Epidemiology is rapidly broadening its scope, a
   trend that will continue into the future; new analytical tools will be
   developed, and the working hypotheses to which such tools will be
   applied will change. At present the scientific community is paying
   increased attention to this field of study, but more research and
   discussion are needed to respond to many of the questions for which we
   have no satisfactory answers yet.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Psychological disorders may affect the pain experience of
   women with vulvodynia, but evidence remains limited. The present study
   aimed to describe the magnitude of the association of depression and
   posttraumautic stress disorder (PTSD) with the presence of vulvodynia in
   a nonclinical population from southeastern Michigan. Methods: Baseline
   data from 1,795 women participating in the Woman to Woman Health Study,
   a multiethnic population-based study, was used for this analysis.
   Validated screening questionnaires were conducted to assess vulvodynia,
   depression, and PTSD. Modified Poisson regression models with a robust
   variance estimation were used to estimate prevalence ratios (PR) and
   their 95\% confidence intervals (CI) for the association between
   vulvodynia status and two mental health conditions, depression and PTSD.
   Results: In the adjusted models, women who screened positive for
   depression had a 53\% higher prevalence of having vulvodynia (PR=1.53;
   95\% CI: 1.12, 2.10) compared with women who screened negative for
   depression. Women who screened positive for PTSD had more than a
   two-fold increase in the prevalence of having vulvodynia (PR=2.37; 95\%
   CI: 1.07, 5.25) compared with women who screened negative for PTSD.
   Conclusions: The increased prevalence of vulvodynia among those
   screening positive for depression or PTSD suggests that these disorders
   may contribute to the likelihood of reporting vulvodynia. Alternatively,
   vulvodynia, depression, and PTSD may have a common pathophysiological
   and risk profile. Prospective studies are needed to improve our
   understanding of the temporal relation between mental health conditions
   and vulvar pain.}},

Abstract = {{Dielectric honeycombs are cellular materials often used in applications
   that require structural and electromagnetic characteristics, e.g., in LO
   (low observable) and radome components, A re-entrant (or auxetic)
   honeycomb is a cellular material with structural properties that are
   superior to those of a conventional honeycomb. By employing the
   finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) technique with periodic boundary
   conditions, the electromagnetic properties of re-entrant honeycombs are
   determined and compared to those of a conventional honeycomb. Re-entrant
   honeycombs are shown to have substantially superior electromagnetic
   properties. Measured permittivity data are used to substantiate the
   conclusions based on predicted FDTD data. The use of re-entrant
   honeycombs, rather than conventional honeycombs, in LO and radome
   applications can yield improved structural and electromagnetic
   performance.}},

Title = {{Strengths-based approaches for quantitative data analysis: A case study
   using the australian Longitudinal Study of Indigenous Children}},
Journal = {{SSM-POPULATION HEALTH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In Australia and internationally, there are increasing calls for the use
   of strengths-based methodologies, to counter the dominant deficit
   discourse that pervades research, policy, and media relating to
   Indigenous health and wellbeing. However, there is an absence of
   literature on the practical application of strengths-based approaches to
   quantitative research. This paper describes and empirically evaluates a
   set of strategies to support strengths-based quantitative analysis.
   A case study about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander child wellbeing
   was used to demonstrate approaches to support strengths-based
   quantitative analysis, in comparison to the dominant deficit approach of
   identifying risk factors associated with a negative outcome. Data from
   Wave 8 (2015) of the Australian Longitudinal Study of Indigenous
   Children were analysed. The Protective Factors Approach is intended to
   enable identification of factors protective against a negative outcome,
   and the Positive Outcome Approach is intended to enable identification
   of factors associated with a positive health outcome. We compared
   exposure-outcome associations (prevalence ratios and 95\% confidence
   intervals (CIs), calculated using Poisson regression with robust
   variance) between the strengths-based and deficit approaches.
   In this case study, application of the strengths-based approaches
   retains the identification of statistically significant exposure-outcome
   associations seen with the standard deficit approach. Strengths-based
   approaches can enable a more positive story to be told, without altering
   statistical rigour. For Indigenous research, a strengths-based approach
   better reflects community values and principles, and it is more likely
   to support positive change than standard pathogenic models. Further
   research is required to explore the generalisability of these findings.}},

Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Negative compressibility is the ability to expand in at least one
   dimension rather than shrinking upon the application of an externally
   applied hydrostatic pressure. It is shown that, contrary to current
   perception, negative linear compressibility may be obtained from
   re-entrant hexagonal truss systems of specific geometric features which
   deform through non-equal changes in the lengths of the cell walls when
   deforming through a constrained angle stretching rather than other modes
   of deformation (such as flexure or hinging, modes of deformation that
   also lead to auxetic behaviour in honeycombs). Negative compressibility
   is predicted in the vertical direction for particular re-entrant
   geometries of this smart hexagonal truss system when the vertical ribs
   are much stiffer than the inclined ribs.}},

Abstract = {{Structural instabilities have generally been regarded as entities that
   are best avoided in practice. However, with the rapid emergence of
   nonlinear mathematics, computational power and manufacturing techniques,
   the exploitation of the geometrically nonlinear range is becoming
   increasingly feasible for a wider range of applications. Currently, a
   pilot study is presented concerning the design of sandwich structures
   and in particular the lattice core metamaterial. The internal structure
   of the lattice core is deliberately disrupted by auxetic inclusions to
   engineer potentially exploitable features for energy absorption or
   structural isolation applications. A pilot numerical study shows the
   effect that the inclusions have on the nonlinear mechanical response
   such that the post-buckling behaviour may be adjusted by design to
   create beneficial features.}},

Title = {{The COVID-19 pandemic and new clinical trial activations}},
Journal = {{TRIALS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{APR 8}},
Abstract = {{Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused severe disruptions in care
   for many patients. A key question is whether the landscape of clinical
   research has also changed. Methods In a retrospective cohort study, we
   examined the association of the COVID-19 outbreak with new clinical
   trial activations. Trial data for all interventional and observational
   oncology, cardiovascular, and mental health studies from January 2015
   through September 2020 were obtained from . An interrupted time-series
   analysis with Poisson regression was used.
   Results: We examined 62,252 trial activations. During the initial
   COVID-19 outbreak (February 2020 through May 2020), model-estimated
   monthly trial activations for US-based studies were only 57\% of the
   expected estimate had the pandemic not occurred (relative risk = 0.57,
   95\% CI 0.52 to 0.61, p < .001). For non-US-based studies, the impact of
   the pandemic was less dramatic (relative risk = 0.77, 95\% CI 0.73 to
   0.82, p < .001), resulting in an overall 27\% reduction in the relative
   risk of new trial activations for US-based trials compared to
   non-US-based trials (relative risk ratio = 0.73, 95\% CI 0.67 to 0.81, p
   < .001). Although a rebound occurred in the initial reopening phase
   (June 2020 through September 2020), the rebound was weaker for US-based
   studies compared to non-US-based studies (relative risk ratio = 0.87,
   95\% CI 0.80 to 0.95, p < .001).
   Conclusions: These findings are consistent with the disproportionate
   burden of COVID-19 diagnoses and deaths during the initial phase of the
   pandemic in the USA. Reduced activation of cancer clinical trials will
   likely slow the pace of clinical research and new drug discovery, with
   long-term negative consequences for cancer patients. An important
   question is whether the renewed outbreak period of winter 2020/2021 will
   have a similarly negative impact on the initiation of new clinical
   research studies for non-COVID-19 diseases.}},

Journal = {{BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH}},

Month = {{MAY 2}},
Abstract = {{Background: Prevention interventions for people living with HIV/AIDS are
   an important component of HIV programs. We report the results of a pilot
   evaluation of a four-hour, clinic-based training for healthcare
   providers in South Africa on HIV prevention assessments and messages.
   This pre/post pilot evaluation examined whether the training was
   associated with providers delivering more prevention messages.
   Methods: Seventy providers were trained at four public primary care
   clinics with a high volume of HIV patients. Pre- and post-training
   patient exit surveys were conducted using Audio-Computer Assisted
   Structured Interviews. Seven provider appropriate messaging outcomes and
   one summary provider outcome were compared pre- and post-training using
   Poisson regression.
   Results: Four hundred fifty-nine patients pre-training and 405
   post-training with known HIV status were interviewed, including 175 and
   176 HIV positive patients respectively. Among HIV positive patients,
   delivery of all appropriate messages by providers declined
   post-training. The summary outcome decreased from 56 to 50\%; adjusted
   rate ratio 0.92 (95\% CI = 0.87-0.97). Sensitivity analyses adjusting
   for training coverage and time since training detected fewer declines.
   Among HIV negative patients the summary score was stable at 32\% pre-
   and post-training; adjusted rate ratio 1.05 (95\% CI = 0.98-1.12).
   Conclusions: Surprisingly, this training was associated with a decrease
   in prevention messages delivered to HIV positive patients by providers.
   Limited training coverage and delays between training and post-training
   survey may partially account for this apparent decrease. A more targeted
   approach to prevention messages may be more effective.}},

Abstract = {{Aiming at reducing the energy absorption of the hydrogen cylinder for
   fuel cell vehicles in collision, which may lead to fierce explosion,
   this paper introduces an energy-absorbing protective shell combining
   with negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) structure to the hydrogen cylinder.
   It adopts three honeycomb structures of the same mass and three kinds of
   aluminum alloy to determine the optimal structure and material scheme of
   the protective shell. Besides, sensitivity analysis is selected to
   screen the design parameters of the optimal structure scheme. Based on
   this, the overall mass of the designed protective shell, the specific
   energy absorption of NPR structure, the maximum impact force of rigid
   wall, and the maximum stress of the liner are taken to establish the
   optimization mathematical model. Furthermore, adaptive mutation genetic
   algorithm (AMGA), non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-ii (NSGA-II),
   and adaptive simulated annealing algorithm (ASA) are exerted as the
   optimization algorithms separately to conduct optimization design and a
   comparison is made between the optimization results. The results show
   that the optimized energy-absorbing protective shell has better
   crashworthiness and energy absorption effect, which can effectively
   improve the collision safety of the hydrogen cylinder. It provides a new
   idea for the protection design of hydrogen storage system in fuel cells
   in the future.}},

Abstract = {{Earlier studies suggest a protective association between vitamin K
   antagonist (VKA) anticoagulants and the incidence of cancer. The authors
   examined the associations between VKA therapy and incidence of 24
   site-specific cancers with a Danish population-based cohort study, using
   heart valve replacement as an instrumental variable. The authors
   enrolled 9,727 Danish residents who received a replacement heart valve
   between 1989 and 2006. The heart valve recipients were matched with
   95,481 unexposed individuals on age and sex. The authors used the heart
   valve replacement instrument to estimate rate ratios associating VKA
   therapy with incidence of the 24 site-specific cancers using Poisson
   regression models. Direct associations between VKA therapy and incidence
   of the 24 cancers were estimated in a prescription validation subset.
   The instrumental variable associations were plotted according to the
   inverse normal of rank percentile and subjected to semi-Bayes shrinkage
   adjustment for multiple comparisons. The pattern of associations was
   consistent with a null-centered Gaussian distribution. No individual
   cancer site showed a substantial positive or negative association with
   VKA therapy in the prescription validation subset, the instrumental
   variable analysis, or the analysis with semi-Bayes adjustment. These
   results do not support the existing hypothesis that VKA therapy is
   associated with reduced cancer risk.}},

Abstract = {{Background: We aimed to estimate the incidence and predictors of late
   presentation among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected
   individuals in Denmark. Methods: Incidence rates (IR) of presentation
   with advanced HIV (CD4 < 200 cells/mu l and/or acquired immune
   deficiency syndrome (AIDS)) and late presentation (CD4 < 350 cells/mu l
   and/or AIDS) were calculated per 100,000 population aged 16-60 y.
   Mortality rate ratios (MRR) were estimated using Poisson regression
   analysis. Results: Three thousand and twenty-seven individuals were
   diagnosed with HIV in 1995-2009; 34.7\% presented with advanced HIV and
   51.2\% were late presenters. The IR of HIV was stable (6.2/100,000
   population), but IR of presentation with advanced HIV declined during
   the study period from 2.2 (95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.8-2.8) to 1.1
   (95\% CI 0.8-1.5). Age >50 y, heterosexuals of non-Danish origin,
   `other' route of transmission, and diagnosis before 2002 were associated
   with an increased risk of presenting with advanced HIV, whereas a
   negative HIV test prior to diagnosis was associated with a significantly
   reduced risk. A total of 414 individuals (40.0\%) had attended a
   hospital 1-3 y before presenting with advanced HIV. After 2002 the
   proportion of men who have sex with men with a negative HIV test prior
   to diagnosis increased (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 1.3, 95\% CI
   1.1-1.6), coinciding with a reduction in IR of presentation with
   advanced HIV. Mortality rates were increased the first 2 y following
   presentation with advanced HIV (MRR 5.9, 95\% CI 3.6-9.4 and MRR 2.5,
   95\% CI 1.4-4.1, respectively). Conclusion: In a setting with a low HIV
   prevalence, the rate of presentation with advanced HIV can potentially
   be reduced by repeated HIV testing of individuals with a continuous high
   risk of transmission and by adhering to guidelines for targeted HIV
   testing.}},

Title = {{Higher moments of net-proton multiplicity distributions in a heavy-ion
   event pile-up scenario}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW C}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{96}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{OCT 20}},
Abstract = {{High-luminosity modern accelerators, like the Relativistic Heavy Ion
   Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) and Large Hadron
   Collider (LHC) at European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN),
   inherently have event pile-up scenarios which significantly contribute
   to physics events as a background. While state-of-the-art tracking
   algorithms and detector concepts take care of these event pile-up
   scenarios, several offline analytical techniques are used to remove such
   events from the physics analysis. It is still difficult to identify the
   remaining pile-up events in an event sample for physics analysis. Since
   the fraction of these events is significantly small, it may not be as
   serious of an issue for other analyses as it would be for an
   event-by-event analysis. Particularly when the characteristics of the
   multiplicity distribution are observable, one needs to be very careful.
   In the present work, we demonstrate how a small fraction of residual
   pile-up events can change the moments and their ratios of an
   event-by-event net-proton multiplicity distribution, which are sensitive
   to the dynamical fluctuations due to the QCD critical point. For this
   study, we assume that the individual event-by-event proton and
   antiproton multiplicity distributions follow Poisson, negative binomial,
   or binomial distributions. We observe a significant effect in cumulants
   and their ratios of net-proton multiplicity distributions due to pile-up
   events, particularly at lower energies. It might be crucial to estimate
   the fraction of pile-up events in the data sample while interpreting the
   experimental observable for the critical point.}},

Title = {{Is the historical war against wildlife over in southern Europe?}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{204-208}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Most southern European regions have experienced a rapid economical
   change during the last decades, moving from a historical economy based
   on agriculture to a society based on industry and technology. We test
   here whether causes of admission of birds admitted to a large southern
   European rehabilitation centre, during a 14-year period (1994-2007),
   reflect these socio-economical changes. Specifically, we estimated the
   trends in the number of birds admitted to the centre by shooting (S)
   over the number of birds admitted due to impacts caused by
   infrastructures (I), for the 10 most commonly admitted species with
   complete time series available. Species were grouped in three groups
   following ecological traits: raptors (diurnal and nocturnal) and aquatic
   birds. Trends were estimated by means of the slope of a linear
   regression of the log-transformed S/I ratio over time, which provided
   the finite population growth rate (lambda) and its 95\% confidence
   intervals. We used the ratio to prevent possible biases caused by
   changes in wild population densities over the years. We conclude that
   the overall trend in the S/I ratio, as well as the trends for all three
   bird groups considered, were negative, and indicated a c. 10\% annual
   reduction in the number of birds admitted by shooting in relation to
   those admitted by infrastructure-related injuries. Causal relationships
   were analysed by means of Poisson regressions on absolute numbers.
   Importantly we show that despite the direct historical war against
   wildlife seems to be coming to an end in southern Europe, impact to
   wildlife continues in an indirect way, as collateral damages caused by
   our post-industrial way of life. So the overall scenario is most likely
   not one of improved conservation status in southern Europe, but rather
   one of shifting ways of impacting wildlife in parallel with
   socio-economic changes.}},

Abstract = {{Background The definition of fever, and thus fever and neutropenia (FN),
   varies between different pediatric oncology centers. Higher temperature
   limit should reduce FN rates, but may increase rates of FN with
   complications by delaying therapy. This study determined if different
   fever definitions are associated with different FN rates. Procedure Two
   pediatric oncology centers had used three fever definitions in 20042011:
   ear temperature 38.5 degrees C persisting 2hours (low definition);
   axillary temperature 38.5 degrees C 2hours or 39.0 degrees C once
   (middle); and ear temperature 39.0 degrees C once (high). Clinical
   information was retrospectively extracted from charts. FN rates were
   compared using mixed Poisson regression. Results In 521 pediatric
   patients with cancer, 783 FN were recorded during 6,009 months
   cumulative chemotherapy exposure time (501 years; rate, 0.13/month
   {[}95\% CI, 0.120.14]), 124 of them with bacteremia (16\%; 0.021/month
   {[}0.0170.025]). In univariate analysis, the high versus low fever
   definition was associated with a lower FN rate (0.10/month {[}0.080.11]
   vs. 0.15/month {[}0.130.16]; rate ratio, 0.66 {[}0.450.97]; P=0.036),
   the middle definition was intermediate (0.13/month {[}0.110.15]). This
   difference was not confirmed in multivariate analysis (rate ratio, 0.94
   {[}0.671.33]; P=0.74). The high versus low definition was not associated
   with an increased rate of FN with bacteremia (multivariate rate ratio,
   1.39 {[}0.533.62]; P=0.50). Conclusion A higher fever definition was not
   associated with a lower FN rate, nor with an increased rate of FN with
   bacteremia. These may be false negative findings due to methodological
   limitations. These questions, with their potential impact on
   health-related quality of life, and on costs, need to be assessed in

Abstract = {{Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is currently a global pandemic that
   affects patients with other pathologies. Here, we investigated the
   influence of treatments for osteoporosis and other non-inflammatory
   rheumatic conditions, such as osteoarthritis and fibromyalgia, on
   COVID-19 incidence. To this end, we conducted a cross-sectional study of
   2,102 patients being treated at the Rheumatology Service of Hospital del
   Mar (Barcelona, Spain). In our cohort, COVID-19 cumulative incidence
   from March 1 to May 3, 2020 was compared to population estimates for the
   same city. We used Poisson regression models to determine the adjusted
   relative risk ratios for COVID-19 associated with different treatments
   and comorbidities. Denosumab, zoledronate and calcium were negatively
   associated with COVID-19 incidence. Some analgesics, particularly
   pregabalin and most of the studied antidepressants, were positively
   associated with COVID-19 incidence, whereas duloxetine presented a
   negative association. Oral bisphosphonates, vitamin D, thiazide
   diuretics, anti-hypertensive drugs and chronic nonsteroidal
   anti-inflammatory drugs had no effect on COVID-19 incidence in the
   studied population. Our results provide novel evidence to support the
   maintenance of the main anti-osteoporosis treatments in COVID-19
   patients, which may be of particular relevance to elderly patients
   affected by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.}},

Abstract = {{We aimed to assess the associations of socioeconomic factors with
   dietary patterns in a Guatemalan population.
   Cross-sectional data of 1076 participants (42 \% men, mean age 32.6 +/-
   A 4.2 years) collected between 2002 and 2004 in four rural villages in
   Guatemala. Dietary patterns were derived using principal component
   analysis. Chi-square and Poisson regression models were used to assess
   associations between socioeconomic factors and dietary patterns.
   Three dietary patterns were identified: ``Western{''} (high in processed
   foods), ``traditional{''} (high in traditional foods) and ``coffee and
   sugar{''}, explaining 11, 7 and 6 \% of the variance, respectively.
   Annual expenditures were associated with a higher adherence to the
   ``Western{''} pattern: prevalence ratios {[}(PR) (95 \% confidence
   interval)] 1.92 (1.17-3.15) for the highest vs. lowest expenditure group
   in men and 8.99 (3.57-22.64) in women. A borderline significant (p =
   0.06) negative association was found between the ``traditional{''}
   pattern and higher household expenditures {[}0.71 (0.49-1.02) in men]
   and with schooling {[}0.23 (0.05-1.02)] in women (p = 0.05).
   Dietary patterns in Guatemala are predicted by socioeconomic factors. In
   particular, high annual expenditures are associated with a more
   westernized, less traditional diet.}},

   Australia}},
Journal = {{TRANSFUSION}},

Volume = {{61}},
Number = {{3}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Background: This study compared the likelihood of return to donate and
   donation rate ratio by age of donors at their first donation when
   followed up to 12 years.
   Study Design and Methods: Donation history of two cohorts of first-time
   donors (those donating in 2007 and 2013) was extracted until March 2019
   from Australian Red Cross Lifeblood's national database. Poisson
   regression analyses compared donor return and negative-binomial
   regression estimated the rate ratio of donations.
   Results: A total of 120 469 and 95 381 donors were included in the 2007
   and 2013 cohorts, respectively. Compared to donors aged 20-24 years, the
   likelihood of return in both cohorts increased consistently as age at
   first donation increased from 30-years and above. Average number of
   whole-blood and plasmapheresis donations increased as the age at first
   donation increased from 30-years onward. The whole-blood donation rate
   was highest for donors >= 60 years, while plasmapheresis donation rate
   was highest for donors aged 50-59 years. These patterns were largely
   consistent when stratified by sex.
   Conclusions: To continuously ensure the short- to mid-term sufficiency
   of blood supply in Australia, targeted recruitment of donors aged
   30-years and above may be considered, however its feasibility and impact
   should be explored further given relatively smaller proportion of new
   donors are middle-aged and older under current policies. Future studies
   with a longer follow-up period are needed to examine whether the
   frequency of donation among those who start donating at a younger age
   increases later in their life when they are 30-years or over.}},

   Methods: The prospective observational database of the D:A:D
   collaboration of 11 cohorts of HIV-infected individuals, including 212
   clinics in Europe, the United States and Australia was used.
   Multivariate Poisson regression was used to assess the effect of HCV or

   adjustment for potential confounders, including cardiovascular risk
   factors, diabetes mellitus and exposure to antiretroviral therapy.
   Results: 01 33,347 individuals, 517 developed a myocardial infarction
   over 157,912 person-years, with an event rate of 3.3 events/1,000
   person-years (95\% confidence interval {[}CI] 3.0-3.6). Event rates
   (95\% CIs) per 1,000 person-years in those who were HCV-seronegative and
   HCV-seropositive were 3.3 (3.0-3.7) and 2.7 (2.2-3.3), respectively, and
   for those who were HBV-seronegative, had inactive infection or had
   active infection were 3.2 (2.8-3.5), 4.2 (3.1-5.2) and 2.8 (1.8-3.9),
   respectively. After adjustment, there was no association between HCV

Abstract = {{Background
   The shortage in Latin-American Primary Care (PC) workforce may be due to
   negative perceptions about it. These perceptions might be probably
   influenced by particular features of health systems and academic
   environments, thus varying between countries.
   Methods
   Observational, analytic and cross-sectional multicountry study that
   evaluated 9,561 first and fifth-year medical students from 63 medical
   schools of 11 Latin American countries through a survey. Perceptions on
   PC work was evaluated through a previously validated scale. Tertiles of
   the scores were created in order to compare the different countries.
   Crude and adjusted prevalence ratios were calculated using simple and
   multiple Poisson regression with robust variance.
   Results
   Approximately 53\% of subjects were female; mean age was 20.4 +/- 2.9
   years; 35.5\% were fifth-year students. Statistically significant
   differences were found between the study subjects' country, using Peru
   as reference. Students from Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Paraguay
   perceived PC work more positively, while those from Ecuador showed a
   less favorable position. No differences were found among perceptions of
   Bolivian, Salvadoran, Honduran and Venezuelan students when compared to
   their Peruvian peers.
   Conclusions
   Perceptions of PC among medical students from Latin America vary
   according to country. Considering such differences can be of major
   importance for potential local specific interventions.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Relative survival (RS) for patients with laryngeal cancer in
   the US population has yet to be described. Additionally, survival of
   patients with laryngeal cancer has demonstrated socioeconomic and racial
   disparities which have not been previously examined through the lens of
   RS. Materials and Methods: Data on 58,814 patients with laryngeal cancer
   were obtained from the National Cancer Database. Patients were diagnosed
   between 1998 and 2006, and had at least 5 years of follow-up. Birth,
   year-, age-, sex- and race-specific matched life expectancies were used
   to estimate expected survival. Stage-stratified RS rates were calculated
   with multiple factors assessed for significance. Excess mortality ratios
   were estimated in multivariate analysis utilizing Poisson regression.
   Results: Younger age, African-American race, uninsured or Medicaid
   insurance, and treatment at an academic center were all significantly
   associated with stage IV disease. Uninsured and Medicaid patients
   demonstrated decreased RS when compared to privately insured
   individuals. Excess mortality was markedly pronounced in the first year
   for patients over 50 years old with stage II-IV disease, especially for
   the over 75-year-old cohort. Conclusion: Survival disparities for
   uninsured and Medicaid populations were found, with these patients
   exhibiting increased excess mortality. Additionally, RS calculations
   highlight the negative effects of increasing age on survival of patients
   with laryngeal cancer.}},

Abstract = {{The Fokker-Planck equation is considered, which is connected to the
   birth and death process with immigration by the Poisson transform. The
   fractional derivative in time variable is introduced into the
   Fokker-Planck equation in order to investigate an origin of oscillatory
   behavior of cumulant moments. From its solution (the probability density
   function), the generating function (GF) for the corresponding
   probability distribution is derived. We consider the case when the GF
   reduces to that of the negative binomial distribution (NBD), if the
   fractional derivative is replaced to the ordinary one. The H-j moment
   derived from the GF of the NBD decreases monotonically as the rank j
   increases. However, the H-j moment derived in our approach oscillates,
   which is contrasted with the case of the NBD. Calculated H-j moments are
   compared with those of charged multiplicities observed in p(p) over bar,
   e(+) e(-), and e(+) p collisions. A phenomenological meaning of
   introducing the fractional derivative in time variable is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To assess the association between human immunodeficiency
   virus (HIV) and pregnancy intentions and safer conception knowledge
   among female sex workers in Port Elizabeth, South Africa.
   METHODS: This cross-sectional study recruited female sex workers in Port
   Elizabeth using respondent-driven sampling and completed an
   interviewer-administered questionnaire alongside HIV testing and
   counseling. In this secondary analysis, robust Poisson regression was
   used to model prevalence ratios for positive fertility intentions in
   this cross-sectional study. Knowledge of safer conception methods by HIV
   status was compared using Fisher exact tests.
   RESULTS: Overall 391 women were represented in the analyses. More than
   50\% had a prior HIV diagnosis, and an additional 12\% were diagnosed
   with HIV during the study. Approximately half (n=185) of the women
   reported future pregnancy intentions. In univariate analysis, a prior
   HIV diagnosis was negatively associated with pregnancy intentions as
   compared with HIV-negative women (prevalence ratio 0.68, 95\% confidence
   interval 0.55-0.85). Only parity remained independently associated with
   future pregnancy intentions in multivariate regression after controlling
   for HIV status, age, race, relationship status, and years selling sex.
   Knowledge of safer conception methods such as timed sex without a
   condom, preexposure prophylaxis, or self-insemination was low and
   similar between those with and without future pregnancy plans.
   CONCLUSION: Pregnancy intentions did not significantly vary according to
   HIV status. Fertility intentions were high, however, and knowledge of
   safer conception methods low, suggesting a need to provide female sex
   workers with advice around options to conceive safely in the context of
   high HIV prevalence.}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Bio-inspired network materials composed of regularly aligned repeating
   filamentary microstructures exhibit promising application prospects in
   tissue engineering and bio-integrated devices due to the typical
   J-shaped mechanics curve precisely matched to the biological tissues.
   During the tensile process, an evident nonlinear mechanical anisotropy
   is induced by the drastic changes of microstructure geometries, which is
   of great concern in some particular requirements such as identifying the
   direction with the lowest or highest tensile stiffness and inducing
   alternate positive and negative or nearly zero Poisson's ratio. An
   efficient theoretical model for nonlinear anisotropic mechanics is
   developed in this paper by introduction of equilibrium and deformation
   compatibility conditions of presentative unit cell under finite uniaxial
   stretching along arbitrary directions, which is then verified by finite
   element analyses (FEA) and experiments both graphically and
   quantitatively. Through this model, the anisotropic mechanical responses
   of the periodic network materials are studied thoroughly and
   systematically based on the precise prediction of stress-strain
   relation, transverse-longitudinal strain relation and the deformed
   configuration. The effects of both the geometric parameters and the unit
   cell topology on the anisotropic mechanical responses are analyzed
   thereafter, which implies that the proposed model can play an
   instructive role in the design, optimization, and application of the
   periodic network materials.}},

Volume = {{15}},

Pages = {{714+}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Understanding conformational change is crucial for programming and
   controlling the function of many mechanobiological and mechanical
   systems such as robots, enzymes and tunable metamaterials. These systems
   are often modelled as constituent nodes (for example, joints or amino
   acids) whose motion is restricted by edges (for example, limbs or bonds)
   to yield functionally useful coordinated motions (for example, walking
   or allosteric regulation). However, the design of desired functions is
   made difficult by the complex dependence of these coordinated motions on
   the connectivity of edges. Here, we develop simple mathematical
   principles to design mechanical systems that achieve any desired
   infinitesimal or finite coordinated motion. We specifically study
   mechanical networks of two- and three-dimensional frames composed of
   nodes connected by freely rotating rods and springs. We first develop
   simple principles that govern all networks with an arbitrarily specified
   motion as the sole zero-energy mode. We then extend these principles to
   characterize networks that yield multiple specified zero modes, generate
   pre-stress stability and display branched motions. By coupling
   individual modules, we design networks with negative Poisson's ratio and
   allosteric response. Finally, we extend our framework to networks with
   arbitrarily specifiable initial and final positions to design energy
   minima at desired geometric configurations, and create networks
   demonstrating tristability and cooperativity.}},

Abstract = {{Nitrogen dioxide is known as a deep lung irritant. The aim of this study
   was to find out whether the relatively low ambient air NO2
   concentrations in the northern city of Helsinki had an impact on the
   respiratory health of children.
   The association between personal exposure to ambient air NO2 and
   respiratory health was investigated in a 13-week follow-up study among
   163 preschool children aged 3-6 yrs, Personal weekly average exposure to
   NO2 was measured by passive diffusion samplers attached to the outer
   garments, Symptoms were recorded daily in a diary by the parents, Among
   53 children, peak expiratory flow (PEF) was measured at home in the
   mornings and evenings. The association between NO2 exposure and
   respiratory symptoms was examined with Poisson regression.
   The median personal NO2 exposure was 21.1 mu g.m(-3) (range 4-99 mu
   g.m(-3). An increased risk of cough was associated with increasing NO2
   exposure (risk ratio=1.52; 95\% confidence interval 1.00-2.31). There
   was no such association between personal weekly NO2 exposure and nasal
   symptoms, but a nonsignificant negative association was found between
   the exposure and the weekly average deviation in PEF.
   In conclusion, even low ambient air NO2 concentrations can increase the
   risk of respiratory symptoms among preschool children.}},

Abstract = {{The ground loss problem occurs when a cylindrical tunnel is constructed
   in a soil with the radius of the tunnel being somewhat smaller than the
   radius of the cavity. The method used in this paper is Muskhelishvilli's
   complex variable method considering conformal mapping of the elastic
   region onto a circular ring. The problem of an elastic half plane with a
   circular cavity was investigated, regarding the case that along the
   boundary of the cavity, the surface tractions were prescribed. The
   computer program (ground loss) was used. The program worked
   interactively, on the basis of values of Poisson's ratio and the ratio
   of the radius of the cavity to its depth (r/h). It was investigated
   whether certain problems of stresses and deformations caused by
   deformation of a tunnel in an elastic half plane could be solved by the
   complex variable method. For this purpose, two elementary boundary value
   problems were considered in detail. These include the problem of a half
   plane with a circular cavity loaded by a uniform radial stress, and the
   problem in which a uniform radial displacement is imposed on the cavity
   boundary (this is usually called the ground loss problem). It was
   concluded that the displacement of the bottom of the tunnel was always
   smaller than the value, u(o) (the displacement of the cavity). For large
   values of r/h, the displacement may even be negative, that is, downward.
   The displacement of the bottom was always equal to the average
   displacement of the tunnel plus a constant value Mo which is the imposed
   radial displacement.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the daily risk of central
   line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) increases over the
   dwell time of peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) in
   high-risk neonates.
   METHODS: Multicenter retrospective cohort including NICU patients with a
   PICC inserted between January 2005 and June 2010. We calculated
   incidence rates and used Poisson regression models to assess the risk of
   developing CLABSI as a function of PICC dwell time.
   RESULTS: A total of 4797 PICCs placed in 3967 neonates were included;
   149 CLABSIs occurred over 89 946 catheter-days (incidence rate 1.66 per
   1000 catheter-days). In unadjusted analysis, PICCs with a dwell time of
   8 to 13 days, 14 to 22 days, and >= 23 days each had an increased risk
   of infection compared with PICCs in place for <= 7 days (P < .05). In
   adjusted analysis, the average predicted daily risk of CLABSIs after
   PICC insertion increased during the first 2 weeks after PICC insertion
   and remained elevated for the dwell time of the catheter. There was an
   increased risk of CLABSIs in neonates with concurrent PICCs (adjusted
   incidence rate ratio 2.04, 1.12-3.71). The incidence of Gram-negative
   CLABSIs was greater in PICCs with dwell times >50 days (incidence rate
   ratio 5.26, 2.40-10.66).
   CONCLUSIONS: The risk of CLABSIs increased during the 2 weeks after PICC
   insertion and then remained elevated until PICC removal. Clinicians
   should review PICC necessity daily, optimize catheter maintenance
   practices, and investigate novel CLABSI prevention strategies in PICCs
   with prolonged dwell times.}},

Title = {{Study on mechanical, electronic and optical properties of Pb-free double

Abstract = {{In recent years, perovskite solar cells have attracted the attention of
   many researchers due to their advantages such as high conversion
   efficiency, simple manufacturing process and low cost, and have become
   an important research direction in the field of new energy batteries. At
   the same time, it is also a very promising new type of solar cells. In
   this paper, the geometric characteristics, mechanical properties,
   electronic properties and optical properties of three perovskites
   In2TiCl6, In2TiBr6 and In2TiI6 were studied by using first-principles.
   The Poisson and Pugh's ratios show the ductile characteristics of
   In2TiX6 (X = Cl, Br, I). The mechanical stability of studied compounds
   has been confirmed by the Born stability criteria. Moreover, the
   thermodynamic stability has been proved by the negative formation
   enthalpy and cohesive energy. In2TiCl6 and In2TiBr6 are indirect band
   gap semiconductors with band gap values 2.15 and 2.12 eV, respectively,
   and In2TiI6 is a direct band gap semiconductor with band gap value 1.24
   eV. Theoretical calculations showed that In2TiI6 has better absorption
   capacity than In2TiCl6 and In2TiBr6 in the near ultraviolet and visible
   light regions. The results demonstrate that the compound In2TiI6 can be
   a potential candidate for excellent light absorbing material.}},

Title = {{Characterization of processed lightweight aggregate and its effect on
   physical properties of concrete}},
Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{230}},
Month = {{JAN 10}},
Abstract = {{The plastic because of its lightweight and flexibility to adopt the
   required shapes has led in an enormous increase in production of plastic
   products during recent years. To minimize the negative environmental
   impacts of plastic waste, many industrial sectors have tried to recycle
   and utilize the plastic waste. Among the other sectors, concrete
   industry can be considered as one of the alternatives such as to use the
   recycled plastic as aggregate replacement in concrete. A processed
   lightweight aggregates (PLA) has been manufactured using the plastic
   waste and other local materials using a compression moulding press
   technique. The detailed characterization of the PLA was also conducted.
   In addition, the effect of PLA incorporation on the physical properties
   of concrete along with effect of curing temperature on the compressive
   strength was also tested. The addition of manufactured aggregate in
   concrete has increased the Poisson's ratio, thermal conductivity values
   while the density, and compressive strength were found to be reduced as
   compared to control mix. It was also noticed that PLA concrete can be
   cured at temperatures up to 30 degrees C, without significantly
   affecting compressive strength. The PLA has shown the prospective to be
   used in lightweight concrete applications. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All
