Abstract = {{The paper systemizes numerous cubic crystals which can have both
   positive and negative Poisson's ratios (the so-called partial auxetics)
   depending on the specimen orientation in tension. Several complete cubic
   auxetics whose Poisson's ratio is always negative are indicated. The
   partial cubic auxetics are classified with the use of two dimensionless
   elastic parameters. For one of the parameters, a critical value is found
   at which the orientation behavior of the crystals changes qualitatively.
   The behavior of mesotubes obtained by rolling up plates of cubic
   crystals (crystals with rectilinear anisotropy) is considered in detail.
   Such mesotubes with curvilinear cubic anisotropy can have micron and
   nanometer lateral dimensions. It is shown that uniform tension of
   nano/microtubes of cubic crystals is possible only in the particular
   case of zero chirality angle (the angle between the crystallographic
   axis and the axis of a stretched tube). It is demonstrated by the
   semi-inverse Saint-Venant method that solution of the axial tension
   problem for cylindrically anisotropic nano/microtubes of cubic crystals
   with a non-zero chirality angle is possible with radially inhomogeneous
   fields of three normal stresses and one shear stress. In the examples
   considered, the cylindrically anisotropic nano/microtubes of cubic
   crystals are auxetics even if they are initially non-auxetics with
   rectilinear anisotropy.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper a novel class of core material for sandwich structures is
   analyzed from an analytical and numerical point of view. Honeycombs with
   re-entrant cell geometry present negative in-plane Poisson's ratio
   coefficients, with an increase of bending stiffness compared to the one
   of hexagonal honeycomb cores. Due to the orthotropic mechanical
   properties of this kind of core material it is possible to employ the
   formulations of laminated orthotropic plates in order to describe the
   vibroacoustic behavior of simply supported sandwich plates. The natural
   frequencies of these laminates are sensitive to the geometrical
   parameters of the core cells. As an example application, an infinite
   cylindrical sandwich shell in contact with exterior and interior fluid
   flow is examined. An improvement of transmission loss factors is
   observed, suggesting a possible use of these cores in acoustic
   insulation. Damping properties are modeled taking into account the
   complex modulus of the core material. Two models are examined, one with
   full viscoelastic core and the other with a free-layer symmetrical beam
   geometry in order to describe the walls of the core cells. Both cases
   show a significant increase of the storage moduli of the cores compared
   to the ones of a regular honeycomb.}},

Abstract = {{Four metallic metamaterials with tailorable mechanical properties are
   designed using bi-material star shaped re-entrant planar lattice
   structures, which do not involve pins, adhesive, welding or pressure fit
   joints and can be fabricated through laser-based additive manufacturing.
   Three length parameters, one angle parameter and three material
   combinations are used as adjustable design parameters to explore
   structure-property relations. For each of the four designed
   metamaterials, the effects of the design parameters on the Poisson's
   ratio (PR), coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), Young's modulus and
   relative density are systematically investigated using unit cell-based
   finite element simulations that incorporate periodic boundary
   conditions. It is found that the bi-material lattice structures can be
   tailored to obtain 3-D printable metallic metamaterials with positive,
   near-zero or negative PR and CTE together with an uncompromised Young's
   modulus. In particular, it is shown that metamaterial \# 1 can exhibit
   both a negative PR and a non-positive CTE simultaneously. These metallic
   metamaterials can find applications in structures or devices such as
   antennas and precision instruments to reduce thermomechanical stresses
   and extend service lives. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Graphyne (GY) and graphdiyne (GDY) are two-dimensional one-atom-thick
   carbon allotropes highly considered to substitute graphene in electronic
   applications because of the prediction of non-null band-gap. There are
   multiple configurations of GY structures not yet fully investigated in
   literature. In this work, by means of classical molecular dynamics
   simulations, the Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio and linear thermal
   expansion coefficient (TEC) of all originally proposed seven types of
   GYs and corresponding GDYs are calculated. The dependence of these
   properties with the density of the structure is investigated for the
   first time. Quadratic increasing of the TEC of GY and GDY structures
   with density was found. The elastic modulus of GYs and GDYs were shown
   to be more sensitive to their density than general porous materials. In
   particular, non-symmetric structures are much softer along the armchair
   direction than along zigzag direction, implying that the elasticity
   along armchair direction of GY and GDY structures are similar to that of
   porous gels materials. Values larger than unity were found for the
   Poisson's ratio of some non-symmetric GYs and GDYs. A simple honeycomb
   mechanical model is shown to capture the observed values of Poisson's
   ratio of GYs and GDYs.}},

Abstract = {{Four types of three-dimensional (3-D) metallic metamaterials with
   tailorable thermo-mechanical properties are designed. For the first
   three types, the structure-property relations are studied by adjusting
   design parameters including two length parameters, one angle parameter
   and two material combinations. For the fourth type, one additional angle
   parameter is involved. It is shown that each of the four types of
   metamaterials designed exhibits the cubic symmetry and thus needs three
   independent elastic constants to characterize its elastic behavior and
   one coefficient of thermal expansion to describe its isotropic thermal
   expansion. The effects of the design parameters on the effective
   Poisson's ratio (PR), coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), Young's
   modulus, shear modulus and the relative density are systematically
   investigated for each of the four types of designed metamaterials by
   using unit cell-based finite element simulations that incorporate
   periodic boundary conditions. It is found that 3-D metallic
   metamaterials with positive, near-zero or negative PR and CTE can be
   obtained by tailoring the bi-material lattice structures and material
   combinations. Also, it is revealed that metamaterial \# 1 can achieve
   both a negative PR and a non-positive CTE while maintaining a high
   stiffness and a low relative density (and thus a lightweight). The good
   tunability of thermo-mechanical properties of the four types of
   metamaterials provides an avenue of enabling the expansion of Ashby's
   material chart to produce more material options for engineering
   applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper evaluates the effect of auxeticity on the extent of shear
   deformation in isotropic beams. It is herein shown that the ratio of
   maximum deflection by Timoshenko theory to the maximum deflection by the
   Euler-Bernoulli theory reduces as the Poisson's ratio of the beam
   material becomes more negative. The obtained results suggest that the
   ratio of shear deformation to bending deformation is lower in auxetic
   beams than in conventional beams, and that the use of Euler-Bernoulli
   beam theory for quantifying the deflection in auxetic beams gives lesser
   deviation from the Timoshenko beam theory than in conventional beams.
   Specifically, the shear deformation becomes insignificant for square
   beams with Poisson's ratio of -1. A set of design equations that allows
   the use of simpler Euler-Bernoulli beam theory instead of the Timoshenko
   beam theory for the considered cases are proposed herein to justify the
   use of the former theory on beam analysis on the basis of reduced shear
   deformation as the beam's Poisson's ratio becomes more negative. The
   findings obtained herein also suggest that in comparison with
   conventional beams (of equal Young's modulus, load distributions, and
   boundary conditions) the lower shear deformation in auxetic beams
   translates into smaller transverse deflections and hence better
   dimensional stability.}},

Abstract = {{A new analytical model is developed for three types of 2-D periodic
   star-shaped re-entrant lattice structures that possess the orthotropic
   symmetry and exhibit negative Poisson's ratios. Contributions from both
   the re-entrant and connection struts are considered using an energy
   method based on Castigliano's second theorem. Each re-entrant strut is
   treated as a Timoshenko beam, and stretching, transverse shearing and
   bending deformations are all incorporated in the formulation. Unlike
   existing studies, the overlapping of struts at joints is included in
   determining the relative density, which is analytically expressed for
   each lattice type. Closed-form formulas are derived for the effective
   Young's moduli and Poisson's ratios of each type of lattice structure,
   which contain three non-dimensional length ratios, two re-entrant
   angles, one shear correction factor, and Young's modulus and Poisson's
   ratio of the strut material. The new analytical model is validated
   against finite element simulations conducted in the current study and
   two existing analytical models for simpler square lattice structures
   without re-entrant struts. To illustrate the newly developed analytical
   model, a parametric study is conducted to quantitatively show the
   effects of the five geometrical parameters on the effective properties
   of each type of lattice structure. It is found that for the effective
   Poisson's ratios the key controlling parameters are the two re-entrant
   angles, while for the effective Young's moduli all of the geometrical
   parameters can have significant effects except for the external
   connection length ratio. It is demonstrated that through a proper
   selection of the geometrical parameters, vertex connections and strut
   material, it is possible to tailor the effective Poisson's ratios and
   Young's moduli of each type of lattice structure over wide ranges to
   satisfy different needs in various applications.}},

Abstract = {{Current reported cellular metastructures can either achieve only
   tailorable thermal expansion or obtain only tunable Poisson's ratio. By
   contrast, here, we develop a kind of lightweight cellular metastructure
   which incorporates coupled tailorable thermal expansion and tunable
   Poisson's ratio. That is a wide range of positive, zero and especially
   negative values of both thermal expansion and Poisson's ratio can be
   simultaneously obtained. The ranges and constraints of the geometrical
   parameters are revealed, and the relative densities are only about 2\%,
   indicating excellent lightweight character. Besides, analytical
   expressions for coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) and Poisson's
   ratio (PR) are theoretically established and numerically simulated.
   Parameter analysis confirms that the range of tailorable CTE can be
   enhanced through rationally selecting large values of CTE ratio, first
   geometrical angle and height ratio. By adjusting the second and third
   geometrical angles, Poisson's ratio also can be tuned to be large
   negative, near zero and positive values. Particularly, the metastructure
   can give paired negative CTE and negative PR. Different combinations of
   paired characteristics including positive CTE + negative PR, positive
   CTE + positive PR and negative CTE + positive PR are also flexibly
   available. Moreover, CTE and PR are found to be highly coupled. To
   simultaneously obtain specific CTE and PR, design parameters should be
   selected with consideration of the coupling effect. The results here are
   expected to contribute feasibility to structures with both temperature
   and mechanical sensitivities. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Based on the bi-material triangle lattice material, a new cellular
   structure: bi-material re-entrant triangle (BRT) is devised to
   incorporate tailorable coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) and
   tunable Poisson's ratio (PR) properties by replacing the straight base
   of a triangle with two hypotenuse members. An equation to systematically
   build the relationship among the external force, the temperature
   increment and the deformation for the planar lattice material with
   boundedjoints is derived and then embedded into a theoretical model for
   devised BRT structure. Using master stiffness equation, effective PR,
   effective Young's modulus as well as effective CTE are computed. In
   order to guide designers to construct an initial concept quickly, the
   design domain for coupling negative CTE and negative PR properties is
   proposed. Nine available paired characteristics for coupling effect are
   extracted and demonstrated with ABAQUS simulation.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic foams possess negative Poisson's ratio, exhibiting unique
   mechanical properties. A modified model based on the
   quasi-three-dimensional model of Choi and Lakes is developed for auxetic
   foams and the formula of the volumetric compression ratio is also
   corrected in this study. Three deformation mechanisms of all cell ribs
   (i.e. stretching, shearing and bending) are incorporated. By applying
   the newly modified model, the theoretical results of Young's modulus and
   Poisson's ratio depend on the folded angle of the bent ribs, the
   relative density, the shape of the rib cross section and the Young's
   modulus and Poisson's ratio of the virgin material. The predicted values
   of the effective Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of auxetic foams
   compare favourably with experimental data. In addition, a finite element
   analysis model is proposed to predict the value of Poisson's ratio in
   this study. The two models can be reduced to predict the mechanical
   properties of conventional foams, and exhibit the process of the
   conversion of conventional foams into auxetic foams. (C) 2010 WILEY-VCH

Title = {{Improving thermomechanical properties of cracked brittle honeycombs by
   negative Poisson's ratio effect}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{266}},
Month = {{JUN 15}},
Abstract = {{This work investigates the effects of cracking on the overall properties
   of brittle auxetic/non-auxetic honeycombs. The micro numerical model and
   macro theoretical model are established simultaneously. The analytical
   expressions of crack opening displacement (COD) are derived and the
   results agree well with numerical simulations. The fracture toughness of
   honeycombs is calculated by combining the stress in the numerical model
   and the stress intensity factor (SIF) in the theoretical model. The
   reductions in the equivalent stiffness and equivalent thermal stress
   coefficient (TSC) of the cracked honeycombs are predicted. The negative
   Poisson?s ratio (NPR) effects on those fracture mechanics parameters and
   equivalent thermomechanical properties are studied. And considering the
   orthogonal anisotropic properties of honeycombs, the cracking along two
   orthogonal directions is examined. It reveals that the significant NPR
   effects can only be detected in a single direction and the effects in
   another direction are inconspicuous. In addition, the effects of crack
   length, medium dimensions, and cell-wall angle of honeycomb cells on the
   overall performance of the cracked medium are also evaluated by
   parametric studies and the results are displayed graphically.}},

Abstract = {{A temperature-dependent intrinsic property of monolayer graphene, the
   negative Poisson's ratio (NPR), is investigated in the present study.
   The classical molecular dynamics (MD) method is employed and the
   Erhart-Albe hybrid potential, i.e. the combination of the reactive
   empirical bond order (REBO) and the Tersoff potentials, is used for the
   graphene sheet in the numerical simulation. In the simulation process,
   the graphene sheet is assumed to be free standing with in-plane
   periodical boundary condition and under an ambient temperature up to
   1000 K. Our study shows that the graphene NPR is decreased with the
   increase of temperature. Besides, we also perform the simulation of the
   graphene negative temperature expansion coefficient (NTEC) as an
   indirect validation of the present MD model. The characteristics of the
   nonlinear variations for both the NPR and the NTEC of a pristine
   graphene sheet are investigated. Our MD results at low temperature (0.1
   K) further prove the intrinsic and anisotropic property of NPR for
   graphene.}},

Abstract = {{By strengthening the pore with material different from that of matrix, a
   new type of negative thermal expansion materials with the re-entrant
   hexagonal honeycomb is designed in this paper. The equivalent Young's
   modulus, Poisson's ratio and the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE)
   are studied by using Timoshenko beam theory and the analytical formulas
   of these equivalent parameters are derived. The results of analytical
   formulas and numerical simulation indicate that the CTE of the material
   can be controlled from positive to negative by changing the geometry
   features and material properties of the structure. Meanwhile, the
   negative Poisson's ratio effect of the original re-entrant honeycomb can
   be preserved. Moreover, this method for designing new metamaterials has
   also been generalized to three-dimensional materials.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Effective Young's modulus and Poisson's ratios of two-layered
   cylindrical hollow tubes made of cubic crystals (auxetics and
   nonauxetics) are considered. An analysis of longitudinal tension of
   stretching tubes is performed within the framework of
   curvilinear-anisotropic elasticity and Saint-Venant's approximation.
   Analytical dependences of effective Young's modulus on the compliance
   coefficients of the initial crystals and layer thickness as ratio of
   composites auxetics-nonauxetics are obtained. Deviations from the rule
   of mixtures predictions which increase with increasing Young's modulus
   of initial nonauxetics are demonstrated. It is found that effective
   Poisson's ratios of two-layered tubes depend on the ratio of their
   thicknesses, the dimensionless combinations of compliance coefficients
   and a dimensionless radial distance. An effect of tube components on
   negativeness of effective Poisson's ratio of the composite
   auxetics-nonauxetics proved to be strongly dependent on the value of
   Young's modulus for nonauxetic component. It is shown that effective
   Poisson's ratios for some characteristics of the initial crystals and
   ratios of layer thicknesses may fall outside the limits on Poisson's
   ratios of isotropic materials. It is shown that many two-layered tubes
   composed of pairs of nonauxetics can have large negative effective
   Poisson's ratios.}},

Abstract = {{Analytical and numerical features of the elastic properties of the

   considered. Analytical formulas for Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio

   orientation. Numerical calculations are performed using these formulas
   and data on the elastic constants from the Landolt-Bornstein Handbook.
   Possible types of Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio are analyzed. More
   than eighty tetragonal crystals were studied. About 60\% of them are
   characterized by negative Poisson's ratio for certain particular
   orientations of the crystals. Such auxetics are listed in the Tables.
   Ten crystals can have Poisson's ratio greater than unity, and Poisson's
   ratio for six crystals is less than -0.5. The same six crystals are
   characterized by high variability of Young's modulus. Young's modulus
   for more than ten crystals exceeds 300 GPa.}},

Abstract = {{A type of mechanical metamaterial is proposed, whereby the effective
   coefficients of thermal and moisture expansions (CTE and CME,
   respectively) can be tuned from positive to negative values while
   maintaining a consistently auxetic (negative Poisson's ratio) behavior
   for the overall structure. Each unit consists of a pair of equal-armed
   crosses pin jointed at their centers, whereas their ends are connected
   via bridging beams using pin joints to facilitate free rotation. The
   bridging beams are of lower modulus and higher hygrothermal expansivity
   to permit negativity in metamaterial's overall Poisson's ratio and
   hygrothermal expansion. Two sets of effective Young's modulus, CME and
   CTE models are developed-one set for large deformation and the other for
   infinitesimal deformation. Results indicate that the effective Young's
   modulus is reduced while the expansion coefficients become more negative
   as the inclination angle of the equal-armed crosses increases, and that
   the application of tensile and compressive loads increases and decreases
   the effective Young's modulus, respectively. The establishment of
   effective zero thermal and moisture expansion conditions facilitates the
   application of the metamaterial structure that requires auxetic property
   within highly fluctuating environmental condition.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports the application of additive manufacturing technology
   to fabricate bi-dimensional lightweight composite meshes capable of
   demonstrating auxetic properties (negative Poisson's ratio (NPR)) in
   combination with negative thermal expansion (NTE) behaviour, using as
   constituent materials polymers that do not exhibit NTE behaviour. To
   describe the combination of NPR and NTE characteristics, the designation
   of `anepectic' is being proposed. Each mesh, obtained from varying
   either the material combination or the design parameters, was tested on
   a heated silicone bath to study the effects of the different
   combinations on the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE). It was found
   that all meshes studied demonstrated a successful combination of NPR and
   NTE behaviours, and it was revealed that there is a possibility to
   tailor the meshes to activate the NTE behaviour within a chosen range of
   temperatures. For an extreme case, a Poisson's ratio of -0.056, along
   with a CTE of -1568 x 10(-6) K-1 has been achieved.}},

Abstract = {{There have been many studies on smart mechanical materials that sensibly
   deform in response to external stimuli. However, most of the previous
   studies have focused on structure changes but largely neglected
   stimuli-responsive and programmable mechanical properties. Here, we
   present a novel strategy of mechanical metamaterials, engineered
   materials with mechanical properties defined by their structure rather
   than their composition, to design smart materials that change their
   mechanical properties in response to external stimuli. The present work
   demonstrates mechanical metamaterials with thermoresponsive and
   reversible switching between positive and negative Poisson's ratios. In
   order to realize the thermoresponsive and reversible switching, a
   thermoresponsive rod with an extremely large thermal expansion
   coefficient is developed utilizing two-way shape memory effects. As an
   application of our metamaterials, we propose soundproofing materials
   that selectively block sound waves in a specific frequency range

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{89}},
Pages = {{100-120}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{We consider hybrid materials consisting of auxetic (material with
   negative Poisson's ratio) and non-auxetic phases. The auxetic phase is
   represented by either spherical or cubic inclusions. We analyse the
   effective characteristics (the Young's and shear moduli and the
   Poisson's ratio) computed using either the differential scheme for the
   effective moduli of composites or the direct finite element simulations.
   The results are verified through Hashin-Shtrikrnan bounds. We
   demonstrate that by creating hybrids from auxetic and non-auxetic phases
   one can obtain considerable increase in stiffness over the stiffnesses
   of the phases. The stiffening effect is controlled by the value of the
   Poisson's ratios of the phases, shape of the auxetic inclusions and
   their concentration. Depending upon the concentration, the hybrid can be
   made both auxetic and non-auxetic. Even when the inclusions are cubic
   the hybrid is still nearly isotropic; it becomes truly orthotropic only
   when the Poisson's ratio of the auxetic phase is very close to the
   thermodynamic limit of -1. These findings can be applied directly in
   designing a new class of hybrid materials with enhanced stiffness. (C)

Abstract = {{The main content dealt with in the paper is to make a theoretical
   analysis of the contour diameter of auxetic yarn under tension, which
   expands transversely under axial tension. The auxetic yarn is designed
   by two components, that is, a core filament and a wrap filament.
   Compared with the wrap filament, the core filament is thicker, softer
   and much more extensible. In the initial status, the core filament is
   straight in the center of the auxetic yarn and the wrap filament wraps
   the core filament helically in a certain helical angle. Based on
   theoretical analysis, the formula of negative Poisson's ratio of
   stretched auxetic yarn is obtained. It is found that the value of
   Poisson's ratio is related to axial strain, helical angle and the
   diameter ratio of the core filament to the wrap filament. An applied
   example is presented to verify the Poisson's ratio value-strain curve of
   auxetic yarn. In order to better investigate effects on negative
   Poisson's ratio, the effect of different parameters of yarn, including
   mesh size, diameter ratio, tensile modulus and helical angle of the wrap
   filament, is investigated using finite element analysis based on ABAQUS
   software to analyze the negative Poisson's ratio of auxetic yarn when
   stretched. It verified that yarn spun by two different components
   produced a negative Poisson's ratio effect under tension and structure
   parameters of auxetic yarn significantly affected negative Poisson's
   ratio values. It is expected that this study could help us understanding
   the deformation mechanism of auxetic yarn under axial tension load.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic yarn was successfully produced by a wrap filament and a core
   filament based on a ring-spinning system, which showed an auxetic effect
   when stretched, that is, expanding transversely under tension. Yarns
   were spun by different structural parameters of the core filament and
   the wrap filament, including diameter ratio, helical angle and tensile
   modulus of the wrap filament. Corresponding tensile tests were utilized
   to analyze the effects of structural parameters and performance on outer
   contour deformation of auxetic yarn. Experimental results showed that
   the outer contour of auxetic yarn expanded transversely under tension
   and there existed significant negative Poisson's ratio values in the
   Poisson's ratio-strain curve, and it was found that the auxetic effect
   became more observable with a higher diameter ratio of the core filament
   to the wrap filament, and lower helical angle and larger tensile modulus
   of the wrap filament. Moreover, compared with theoretical results by
   theoretical modeling in Part I, good relations of Poisson's ratio-strain
   curves were obtained between experimental and theoretical results. This
   proves the effectiveness of spinning auxetic yarn by selecting
   reasonable components of yarn and it is feasible to design yarn with a
   negative Poisson's ratio effect.}},

Abstract = {{A novel 3D anti-tetrachiral structure with negative Poisson's ratio,
   based on a 2D anti-tetrachiral structure, was proposed in this paper.
   The 3D structure consists of two different perpendicular 2D
   anti-tetrachiral honeycomb cells connected by ligaments. The deformation
   mechanism of the structure was investigated, and analytical solutions
   for the Poisson's ratio of the cellular structure were obtained, which
   indicates a wide range of mechanical property via adjusting its
   geometric parameters. It was found that one of the Poisson's ratios is
   always -1 and is independent of the geometric parameters. Based on the
   energy method, the equivalent elastic moduli of the proposed structure
   along the three primary directions were also obtained. The analytical
   results were agree well with finite element analysis results. It was
   verified that the present analytical model can provide a relatively
   accurate solution in the prediction of the performance of auxetic

Title = {{Intrinsic Ultrahigh Negative Poisson's Ratio in Two-Dimensional
   Ferroelectric ABP(2)X(6) Materials}},

Abstract = {{Recently, ferroelectric materials have attracted considerable research
   attention. In particular, two dimensional (2D) strain ferroelectric
   materials have been considered as most crucial for next- generation
   circuit designs because of their application as novel electric memory
   devices. However, a 2D ferroelectric material is very rare. The
   ferroelectric materials with the form ABP(2)X(6) (A = Ag, Cu; B = Bi,
   In; X = S, Se) are of interest because of their ferroelectric property
   maintained in their ultrathin structures. Within the ABP(2)X(6)
   monolayer, the P-P bonds form the pillars that hold the top and bottom X
   planes, while the off-center A-B atoms between the X layers induce a
   spontaneous ferroelectric polarization. If the two off-center A-B sites
   are equally aligned, this would lead to the appearance of the
   paraelectric state. Such intriguing structures must impart novel
   mechanical properties to the materials. Until now, there has been no
   report on the mechanical properties of monolayerABP(2)X(6). Based on
   first-principles calculations, we studied the structural, electronic,
   mechanical as well as the electromechanical coupling properties of
   monolayer ABP(2)X(6) (A = Ag, Cu; B = Bi, In; X = S, Se). We found that
   they are all semiconductors with wide bandgaps of 2.73, 2.17, 3.00, and
   2.31 eV for CulnP(2)Se(6), CuBiP2Se6, AgBiP2S6, and AgBiP2Se6,
   respectively, which are calculated based on the Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof
   (HSE) exchange correlation functional model. The conduction band minimum
   is mainly from p orbitals of X and B atoms, whereas the valence band
   maximum is due to the hybridization of the p orbital of X atoms and the
   d orbital of A atoms. Moreover, there are three short and three long NB
   -X bonds due to the A-B off center displacement. Together with the d-p
   orbital hybridization, the main reason for the distorted ferroelectric
   structure in ABP(2)X(6) monolayers is the Jahn-Teller effect. ABP(2)X(6)
   monolayers are predicted to be a new class of auxetic materials with an
   out-of-plane negative Poisson's ratio, i.e., the values of the negative
   Poisson's ratio are in the order AgBiP2S6 (-0.805) < AgBiP2Se6 (-0.778)
   < CuBiP2Se6 (-0.670) < CulnP(2)S(6) (-0.060). This is mainly due to the
   tensile strain applied in the x/y direction enlarging the angle(
   )between P-P bonds and top layer X atoms, thereby enhancing the bucking
   height of monolayer ABP(2)X(6). Moreover, external strain has a
   significant impact on the A-B off-center displacement, rendering an
   out-of-plane piezoelectric polarization. The values of e(13) for
   CulnP(2)S(6), CuBiP2Se6, AgBiP2S6, AgBiP2Se6 monolayers are calculated
   to be -3.95 x 10(-12), -5.68 x 10(-12), - 3.94 x 10(-12), -2.71 x
   10(-12) C.m(-1) , respectively, which are comparable to the only
   experimentally confirmed 2D out-of-plane piezoelectric Janus system
   (piezoelectric coefficient = -3.8 x 10(-12 )C.m(-1)).
   This unusual auxetic behavior, ferroelectric polarization, and the
   electromechanical coupling in monolayerABP(2)X(6) could potentially lead
   to enormous technologically important applications in nanoelectronics,
   nanomechanics, and piezoelectrics.}},

Abstract = {{An auxetic material is one with a negative Poisson's ratio and has the
   property of widening when stretched or narrowing when compressed in
   contrast to conventional materials. Typical auxetic materials include
   modified polymeric foams (Lakes, 1987), regular honeycombs,
   polypropylene fibres and certain crystal structures. Auxetic materials
   benefit from enhanced mechanical properties. These benefits include
   improved indentation resistance, enhanced shear moduli and fracture
   toughness Evans and Alderson (2000).
   While modelling granular materials, Bathurst and Rothenburg (1988a,b)
   noted the theoretical possibility of a negative Poisson's ratio if the
   constitutive grains had unconventional interactive properties. These
   unconventional interactive properties are that the tangential
   interaction should be stiffer than the normal interaction. In this work,
   a 2D unit cell has been designed with just such an unconventional
   interaction so that a 2D granular material can be constructed with
   negative Poisson's ratio. Theoretical calculations of such a granular
   assembly are made using mean strain assumptions and first order
   heterogeneity calculations. These are compared to 2D discrete element
   simulations, finite element simulations and Bathurst and Rothenburg's
   original result. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials have negative Poisson ratio which has a multiple
   ranges of functional applications. The helical auxetic yarn was
   successfully developed through direct twist system by using core and

   Helical Auxetic Yarns were developed using various parameters of the
   core and warp filament, these parameters are wrapping angle (Twist per
   meter), diameter ratio, and modulus ratio. The strength of Helical yarn
   was characterized using single yarn strength and Image J software was
   used for the calculation of poisson's ratio. According to test results,
   it is concluded that the core filament of helical auxetic yarn increased
   its thickness in transverse direction under stress, and a considerable
   negative poisson's ratio was calculated. The values of negative
   poisson's ratio described that the auxeticity had a direct relation with
   core filament thickness or diameter and inversely proportional to the
   linear density of wrap filament, in case of the wrap angle the
   auxeticity of HAY yarn had an inverse effect with wrap angle.

Pages = {{192-214}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a study on the auxetic behaviour of the materials
   composed of hollow spheres. Although, as a newly developed material, the
   hollow sphere structures have gained a great deal of scientific
   attention, few studies have acknowledged its auxetic performance.
   Auxetic materials or materials with a negative Poisson's ratio have been
   a subject of intensive research due to their unusual and, in many
   extents, superior mechanical properties. A number of different auxetic
   systems that have been developed commonly based on designing special
   geometry of the material microstructure. However, in the hollow sphere
   structures, this mechanism is essentially different and the auxetic
   effect is attributed to the peculiarities of deformation of a thin-wall
   hollow sphere and to the interaction between the spheres in the
   assembly. In this study it is shown that the negative Poisson's ratio in
   this material is due to the high ratio between tangential to normal
   stiffnesses of a thin-wall hollow sphere. To evaluate the mechanical
   properties of these materials a homogenisation procedure based on the
   Cosserat 3D continuum theory is adopted. In this procedure, an assembly
   of the flexible thin-wall spheres is modelled as a stack of rigid
   spheres connected by a set of linear springs. The developed continuum
   model is validated against the direct finite element analysis of a
   regular assembly of the hollow spheres. Influence of the various design
   parameters on the macroscopic mechanical behaviour of the hollow sphere
   materials is investigated. The numerical study is focused on the auxetic
   behaviour of various kinds of packing arrangements of the hollow
   spheres. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The two-component complex yarn with helical wrapping structure has been
   reported with auxetic behavior and unique performance, however, the
   residual torque could lead to the slippage of the wrap component from
   the core in the natural state and poor stability and applicability.
   Therefore, this paper aims to introduce a novel interlaced-helical
   wrapping yarn with negative Poisson's ratio, stable structure,
   practicability and continuous preparation. The differences in geometry
   and auxetic behavior between helical structure and interlaced-helical
   structure were presented and analyzed. Both the structure stability and
   auxetic effect of the interlaced-helical complex yarn have advantages
   over the helical wrap yarn with same materials and initial wrap angle.
   It can be shown that the interlaced-helical wrap yarns with lower
   initial wrap angle and bigger tensile modulus of the stiff yarns will
   produce better auxetic effect. Besides, the deformation mechanism and
   the manufacturing process were described in detail. Several kinds of
   yarns have been fabricated to discuss the effect of initial wrap angle
   and tensile modulus on the Poisson's ratio of the structure. The maximum
   value of Poisson's ratio for the yarns manufactured was -2.8. It is also
   expected that auxetic yarns with novel braided structure can prompt the
   applications of auxetic textiles.}},

   auxetic cellular materials with negative Poisson's ratios. The in-plane
   Young's moduli of these cellular materials are theoretically analyzed,
   and calculated from the cell member bending with large deflection.
   Expressions for the in-plane Young's moduli of the above-mentioned
   cellular materials are given by incomplete elliptic integrals. It is
   found that the in-plane Young's moduli of two-dimensional cellular
   materials with negative Poisson's ratios depend both on the geometry of
   the cell, and on the induced strain of these cellular materials. The
   in-plane Young's moduli are no longer constants at large deformation.
   But at the limit of small strain, they converge to the results predicted
   by the small deformation model of flexure.}},

Abstract = {{Double-V microstructure (DVM) is a type of auxetic cellular material
   with negative Poisson's ratio (NPR). Accurate predictions of the
   mechanical properties of these microstructures at large strains are
   critical for many engineering applications. In this paper, nonlinear
   theoretical models of two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D)
   DVM based on a large beam deflection model are established to predict
   the normalized Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio in the principal
   directions. The theoretical solutions are compared to solutions obtained
   from numerical finite element analyses and quasi-static compression
   experiments of a 2D prototype manufactured using additive printing
   technique. It is found that there is good agreement between these
   results, validating the accuracy of the proposed theoretical model.
   Effects of geometry parameters on the mechanical properties of the DVM
   are also investigated to understand the mechanical behavior at large
   strains. This study provides validated models for predicting the
   behavior of these microstructures at large strains, useful for
   engineering designs.}},

Abstract = {{Negative Poisson's ratio, while thermodynamically permitted is only
   observed in some natural crystals in certain directions. All other known
   cases of negative Poisson's ratio are the man-made structures exhibiting
   this property macroscopically. One class of these structures includes
   re-entrant foams and specially engineered structures with springs and
   hinges. Another class is constituted by materials consisting of a matrix
   with positive Poisson's ratio with embedded microstructural elements
   producing macroscopic negative Poisson's ratio. In the first class, we
   propose structures made of balls bonded by links with high shear to
   normal stiffness ratio. In the second class, we introduce materials
   filled with cracks with suppressed relative shearing of the faces. In
   the case of multiscale crack distributions the minimum value of
   Poisson's ratio achievable is -1/3. Materials with positive and negative
   Poisson's ratio can be combined into hybrid materials. We show that
   multiscale distribution of spherical inclusions whose Poisson's ratio
   has different sign to that of the elastic isotropic matrix can
   considerably (up to two orders of magnitude) increase the effective
   Young's modulus even when the Young's moduli of the matrix and
   inclusions are the same. Generic mechanical properties of auxetics such
   as fracture toughness, wave propagation and damping are discussed. (C)

Abstract = {{This chapter begins by establishing the effect of constituents with
   opposite Poisson's ratio signs on the effective moduli of composite
   properties. Results show that the effective Young's modulus of
   continuous unidirectional fiber composites in the fiber direction and
   that for laminates of isotropic laminas in the in-plane direction
   exceeds the rule of mixture prediction, especially when the difference
   between Young's moduli and Poisson's ratios between the constituents are
   small and large, respectively. For laminates of isotropic laminas with
   opposing Poisson's ratio signs, the effective Young's modulus in the
   out-of-plane direction not only exceeds the inverse rule of mixture but
   also the direct rule of mixture, and this is especially so when the
   difference between the Young's modulus of individual laminas is
   insignificant. The conditions that lead to further counter-intuitive
   properties whereby the in-plane laminate modulus exceeds the modulus of
   the stiffer phase is established, followed by an example in which the
   maximum point of the laminate modulus takes place when the volume
   fraction of the stiffer phase is lower than the volume fraction of the
   more compliant phase. Thereafter, investigation on laminates of
   isotropic laminas with alternating signs of Poisson's ratio and
   alternating signs of coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) gives
   results of extreme overall CTE. Finally, a review is done for
   investigation on conventional composites that lead to auxetic
   properties.}},

Abstract = {{Combined heat treatment and applied mechanical strains have been
   employed to modify the structure and properties of polyurethane (PU)
   foams. Consequently, foams with a range of pore sizes, shapes and
   orientations have been produced, including those possessing auxetic
   (negative Poisson's ratio) behaviour. Four conversion conditions were
   employed: triaxial, biaxial and uniaxial compression (to linear
   compression ratios of 0.9, 0.8 and 0.7) and uniaxial tension to (linear
   extension ratios of 1.1 and 1.2). The converted foams were then observed
   by either SEM or optical microscopy, as appropriate, to determine the
   pore structure. Mechanical properties were measured using tensile
   testing in conjunction with videoextensometry, allowing the values of
   Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio to be ascertained. Increased
   anisotropy in the pore structure and elastic properties was observed.
   The biaxial as well as the triaxial conversion routes led to auxetic
   behaviour for the PU foams.}},

Abstract = {{Negative Poisson's ratio, while thermodynamically permitted, is only
   observed in some natural crystals in certain directions. All other known
   cases of negative Poisson's ratio are the man-made structures which
   exhibit this property macroscopically. One class of these structures
   includes re-entrant foams and special structures with springs and
   hinges. Another class is constituted by materials consisting of a matrix
   with positive Poisson's ratio with embedded microstructural elements
   producing macroscopic negative Poisson's ratio. In the first class, we
   propose structures made of balls bonded by links with high shear to
   normal stiffness ratio. In the second class, we introduce materials
   filled with cracks with suppressed relative shearing of the faces. In
   the latter case we determine the effective moduli for multiscale crack
   distributions using the differential self-consistent method and show
   that the minimum value of Poisson's ratio achievable in this way is
   -1/3. Materials with positive and negative Poisson's ratio can be
   combined into hybrid materials. For multiscale distribution of
   inclusions (wide distribution of sizes with the same concentration at
   each scale) we show that negative Poisson's ratio spherical inclusions
   in a positive Poisson's ratio elastic isotropic matrix considerably
   increase the effective Young's modulus even when the Young's moduli of
   the matrix and inclusions are the same.}},

Abstract = {{As an effective candidate for enhancing energy absorption, a range of
   foam materials have gained considerable popularity, in which the
   density, Young's modulus and plasticity of foam materials are considered
   critical to crashworthiness. Relatively speaking, less attention has
   been paid to the roles played by the Poisson's ratio of foam or cellular
   materials. More importantly, the interaction between different Poisson's
   ratios and thin-walled structures has been a critical yet under-studied
   issue. This paper aims to explore the effects of negative, zero and
   positive Poisson's ratio of auxetic foams, ranging from -1 to 0.5, on
   structural crashworthiness and seek optimal design for different
   foam-filled square, circular and conic tubes. In this study the specific
   energy absorption (SEA) and mean crushing force (MCF) are taken as the
   objective functions by using mathematical regression analysis. The
   sequential quadratic programming (SQP) and the Non-dominated Sorting
   Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) are employed for single and
   multiobjective design of foam-filled tubes with different Poisson's
   ratios, respectively. The optimal Poisson's ratio is obtained for these
   three different types of foam-filled tubes. By comparison we found that
   the crashworthiness of foam filled conic tube is the best, followed by
   circular and then squared tubes. The study provides new insights into
   material selection and design with a more favorable Poisson's ratio for
   crashworthiness. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Materials exhibiting auxetic behaviour get fatter when stretched (i.e.
   possess a negative Poisson's ratio). This property has been closely
   related to particular geometrical features of a system and how it
   deforms. One of the mechanisms which is known to have a potential to
   generate such behaviour is that of rotating rigid units. Several models
   based on this concept have been developed, including two-dimensional as
   well as three-dimensional (3D) models. In this work, we propose a new 3D
   structure constructed from rigid cuboids which also deform through
   relative rotation of the units. In particular, analytical models for the
   mechanical properties, namely the Poisson's ratio and the Young's
   moduli, are derived and it is shown that for loading on-axis, these
   systems have the potential to exhibit negative values for all the six
   on-axis Poisson's ratios.}},

Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{This study investigates the compressive responses and mechanisms of
   perforated structures made of pure nylon polymer (NP) and short carbon
   fibre reinforced nylon polymer (SCF/NP) with negative Poisson's ratio
   (NPR), and proposes an improved lightweight auxetic structure. A
   theoretical analysis is performed for predicting the Poisson's ratios of
   perforated auxetic structures, and validated experimentally. A
   comparison between conventional and auxetic perforated structures under
   compression shows that the SCF/NP specimens have higher stiffness than
   the NP structures and the auxetic structure can reach a NPR of about -1.
   The effects of perforation geometry and material type on the mechanical
   properties are investigated. Results depict a decrease in nominal stress
   with an increase in the perforation gap, but the perforation gap
   increase leads to enhancement of relative density, effective strain and
   average Poisson's ratio. Further, SCF/NP structures have advantages over
   NP structures due to their higher effective strain, effective specific
   energy absorption (SEA) and relative Young's modulus. Subsequently, an
   improved auxetic structure is designed, and a comparative study between
   the designed structure and two common auxetic structures (with the same
   relative density of 0.32) shows that the designed auxetic structures
   have the highest SEA and relative Young's modulus with the strongest
   auxetic effect (smallest average Poisson's ratio).}},

Abstract = {{This article presents an experimental and geometrical study of a novel
   kind of plied yarn structure with negative Poisson's ratio (NPR). The
   deformation mechanism of the yarn structure formed with two stiff yarns
   and two soft yarns to achieve NPR behavior was firstly introduced. Based
   on the proposed yarn structure, four kinds of yarn samples were then
   fabricated with two kinds of stiff yarns and two types of soft yarns and
   tested under the axial extension to verify their auxetic or NPR effect.
   A geometric analysis was finally conducted to theoretically calculate
   the Poisson's ratio of the yarn structure and compared with the
   experimental results. The study shows that the proposed yarn structure
   has obvious NPR effect and the geometrical analysis can well predict its
   Poisson's ratio in the higher axial strain range. It is expected that
   this study could promote further development of auxetic textiles with

Abstract = {{Auxetic yarn is designed by ourselves by wrap-core structure, which has
   special physical properties and geometrical structure different from
   traditional yarn. The wrap-core auxetic yarn will expand transversely
   under tension. Therefore, the tensile tests were conducted to analyze
   effects of structural parameters and performance on lateral deformation
   of yarn. The experimental results show that yarn with negative Poisson's
   ratio as low as -4.31 is produced successfully. Moreover, effects of
   structure and performance, including the wrap angle, the diameter ratio,
   the tension modulus of the wrap yarn and the twist of the core yarn, on
   poisson's ratio of yarn are analyzed. It is found that the negative
   Poisson's ratio effect becomes more observable with the higher diameter
   ratio or lower wrap angle, and it becomes much more observable when the
   twist degree of the core yarn is higher or the wrap yarn's modulus is
   lower.}},

Abstract = {{Most metamaterials with negative Poisson's ratio and/or negative thermal
   expansion coefficient possess relatively low stiffness. In this work, a
   novel hybrid-honeycomb structure with enhanced stiffness is proposed. It
   consists of two merged hexagonal honeycombs. Analytical and
   computational homogenization methods are used to evaluate the effective
   thermoelastic properties. Analytical expressions of the effective
   Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, and thermal expansion coefficient are
   given. We show that the effective thermoelastic properties of the
   structure are widely tunable by tailoring the microstructural geometry
   and the constituent materials. In particular, the inplane effective
   Poisson's ratio and thermal expansion coefficient are adjustable over a
   wide range, from negative to positive. By properly choosing the
   geometrical and material parameters, the structure can be designed to
   concurrently possess an enhanced stiffness and a high degree of

Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials and negative thermal expansion materials show great
   application potential in many important fields. In this paper, a novel
   three-dimensional truss structure with a tunable Poisson's ratio and
   tailorable coefficient of thermal expansion was developed. Since the
   deformation of each rod was dominated by axial tension or compression,
   the structure showed high stiffness. Equations regarding equivalent
   elasticity parameters and coefficients of thermal expansion of the
   structure were obtained by displacement and unit force methods. A
   numerical simulation verification was performed by ANSYS 16.0 software.
   The verification results indicated that the formulas have high precision
   and wide application scope. Through parametric analysis, we obtained the
   conditions for achieving a negative Poisson's ratio and negative thermal
   expansion coefficient. We also concluded that this material could
   realize a three-dimensional negative Poisson's ratio and bidirectional
   negative thermal expansion simultaneously by choosing reasonable
   geometric parameters and material combinations.}},

Abstract = {{Existent rigid unit mode (RUM) models based on rotating squares, which
   may explain the phenomenon of negative thermal expansion (NTE), are
   generalized so as to assess the NTE potential for novel systems made
   from rectangular or rhombic rigid units. Analytical models for the area
   coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE) of these innovative networks are
   derived in an attempt to determine the optimal geometrical parameters
   and connectivity for maximum NTE. It was found that all systems exhibit
   NTE, the extent of which is determined by the shape and connectivity of
   the elemental rigid units (side lengths ratio or internal angle). It was
   also found that some of the networks proposed here should exhibit
   significantly superior NTE properties when compared with the well-known
   network of squares, and that for optimal NTE characteristics,
   pencil-like rigid units should be used rather than square-shaped ones,
   as these permit larger pore sizes that are more conducive to NTE. All
   this compliments earlier work on the negative Poisson's ratio (auxetic)
   potential of such systems and may provide a route for the design of new
   materials exhibiting superior thermo-mechanical characteristics
   including specifically tailored CTEs or giant NTE characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{Based on the known solutions of the problems of extension and torsion of
   cylindrically anisotropic chiral tubes, the analysis of variability of
   the Young's modulus, Poisson's ratios and torsional stiffness of
   monoclinic crystalline tubes was carried out using known experimental
   values of the compliance coefficients of the crystals. The extreme
   values of Young's modulus and torsional stiffness were determined and
   their variability was studied. It was shown that chirality had a
   significant effect on the values of the elastic characteristics of tubes
   made from monoclinic crystals. Thin-walled tubes (the ratio of the
   external and internal radii of about one), which had a negative
   Poisson's ratio, were identified. The largest negative values of
   Poisson's ratio among all the analysed tubes were achieved for tubes
   from LaNbO4 and CsH2PO4 crystals. Due to the change in the ratio of the
   radii and the chirality, the Young's modulus and the torsional stiffness
   of such tubes were changed in several times, and their Poisson's ratios
   could change by several units. Angular Poisson's ratio could reach the
   value of - 6.5 on the inner surface of a tube from CsH2PO4 crystal. The
   LaNbO4 and CsH2PO4 crystals also had large negative values of Poisson's
   ratios in the case of rectilinear anisotropy, which were significantly
   different from the Poisson's ratio for isotropic materials.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the elastic band structures of two-dimensional solid
   phononic crystals (PCs) with both negative and positive Poisson's ratios
   are investigated based on the finite difference domain method. Systems
   with different combinations of mass density ratio and shear modulus
   ratio, filling fractions and lattices are considered. The numerical
   results show that for the PCs with both large mass density ratio and
   shear modulus ratio, the first bandgap becomes narrower with its upper
   edge becoming lower as Poisson's ratio of the scatterers decreases from
   -0.1 to -0.9. Generally, introducing the material with a negative
   Poisson's ratio for scatterers will make this bandgap lower and
   narrower. For the PCs with large mass density ratio and small shear
   modulus ratio, the first bandgap becomes wider with Poisson's ratio of
   the scatterers decreasing and that of the host increasing. It is easy to
   obtain a wide low-frequency bandgap by embedding scatterers with a
   negative Poisson's ratio into the host with a positive Poisson's ratio.
   The PCs with large filling fractions are more sensitive to the
   variations of Poisson's ratios. Use of negative Poisson's ratio provides
   us a way of tuning bandgaps. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The transverse shear modulus of in-plane negative Poisson's ratio
   honeycombs is determined using numerical simulations. General honeycombs
   have theoretical upper and lower bounds of transverse shear moduli. The
   actual transverse shear modulus is an intermediate value, depending on
   the relative density and the gauge thickness ratio. The difference
   between upper and lower bounds is particularly significant for negative
   Poisson's ratio honeycombs. Finite element simulations confirm the
   theoretical trend, and show gauge ratio dependence different from that
   envisaged in the literature for conventional honeycombs. A modified
   approximate formula is thus proposed to predict the actual transverse
   shear modulus for honeycombs having in-plane negative Poisson's ratio
   values.}},

Title = {{Multi-functional cylindrical metastructures to simultaneously program
   both thermal expansion and Poisson's ratio}},
Journal = {{EXTREME MECHANICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{43}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Currently reported cylindrical metastructures mainly act as the
   load-bearing components, or only present the single function of
   programming either Poisson's ratio (PR) or coefficient of thermal
   expansion (CTE). Here, by curling the planar metamaterials, a series of
   multi-functional cylindrical metastructures is originally devised to
   simultaneously incorporate programmable CTE and PR. The deformation
   characteristics are systematically analyzed. It is identified that the
   number of circumfer-ential cells N remarkably affects the deformation
   characteristics. When N is small, the warp effect induced by the curved
   members is remarkable. The quantitative analysis figures out that when N
   is larger than specific critical values, the PR and CTE of the
   cylindrical metastructures approach to those of the planar
   metamaterials. Thus, a design strategy is identified, namely, with
   adequate circumferential cells, both the PR and CTE of the cylindrical
   metastructures are independent on the variable N, and are equal to those
   of the corresponding planar metamaterials. Most importantly, by
   modulating the geometric parameters, the PR and CTE of the devised
   cylindrical metastructures can be simultaneously programmed to be wide
   ranges. The excellent programmability in both PR and CTE enables the
   cylindrical metastructures to be potentially used in engineering
   applications where precise control of deformation induced both by
   mechanical and thermal loads is in urgent need. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{In an effort to tailor functional materials with customized anisotropic
   properties - stiffness and yield strain, we propose porous materials
   consisting of flexible mesostructures designed from the deformation of a
   re-entrant auxetic honeycomb and compliant mechanisms. Using an analogy
   between compliant mechanisms and a cellular material's deformation, we
   can tailor in-plane properties of mesostructures; low stiffness and high
   strain in one direction and high stiffness and low strain in the other
   direction. Two mesostructures based on hexagonal honeycombs with
   positive and negative cell angles are generated. An analytical model is
   developed to obtain effective moduli and yield strains of the porous
   materials by combining the kinematics of a rigid link mechanism and
   deformation of flexure hinges. A numerical technique is implemented to
   the analytical model for nonlinear constitutive relations of the
   mesostructures and their strain dependent Poisson's ratios. A Finite
   Element Analysis (FEA) is used to validate the analytical and numerical
   model. The moduli and yield strain of a porous aluminum alloy are about
   6.3GPa and 0.26\% in one direction and about 2.8MPa and 12\% in the
   other direction. The mesostructures have extremely high positive and
   negative Poisson's ratios, v(xy){*} (similar to +/- 40) due to the large
   rotation of the link member in the transverse direction caused by the
   input displacement in the longitudinal direction. The mesostructures
   also show higher moduli for compressive loading due to the contact of
   slit edges at the center region. This paper demonstrates that compliant
   mesostructures can be used for a next generation material design in
   terms of tailoring mechanical properties; moduli, strength, strain, and
   Poisson's ratios. The proposed mesostructures can also be easily
   manufactured using a conventional cutting method.}},

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1805-1822}},
Month = {{JAN 25}},
Abstract = {{Purpose
   Negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) material has huge potential applications
   in various industrial fields. However, lower Young's modulus due to the
   porous form limits its further applications. Based on the topology
   optimization technique, this paper aims to optimize the structure
   consisting two isotropic porous materials with positive Poisson's ratio
   (PPR) and NPR and void.
   Design/methodology/approach
   Under prescribed dual-volume fraction constraints, the structural
   compliance is taken as the objective. Young's modulus and Poisson's
   ratio are, respectively, interpolated and expressed with Lame's
   parameters for easier programming. Accordingly, the sensitivities can be
   derived through the chain rule. Several two- and three-dimensional
   illustrative examples are presented to demonstrate the capability and
   effectiveness of the proposed approach. The influences of Poisson's
   ratios, volume fractions and Young's moduli on the optimized results are
   investigated.
   Findings
   For NPR materials having unique load responses, the resulting topologies
   of PPR and NPR materials have distinct material distributions in
   comparison of the results from two PPR materials. Furthermore, it is
   observed that higher structural stiffness can be achieved from the
   hybrid of PPR and NPR materials than that obtained from the structures
   made of individual constituent materials.
   Originality/value
   A topology optimization methodology is proposed to design structures
   composed of PPR and NPR materials.}},

Abstract = {{Elastic properties of the hexagonal crystals under pressure were
   analyzed. Seven crystals with negative Poisson's ratio (auxetics) were
   revealed at zero pressure. These are crystals of MoS2, Zn, Be, BeCu
   (alloy with 2.4 at.\% Cu), TiB2, C7H12, and MnAs. Analytical expressions
   of extreme values of Poisson's ratio and Young's modulus were obtained.
   For these materials, the variability of Poisson's ratio and Young's
   modulus was analyzed at pressure change. It was shown that all seven
   hexagonal auxetics may become completely auxetic under certain pressure
   values. The variability of the elastic properties of graphite and SiC,
   being non-auxetics at zero pressure, was considered. These crystals
   become partially auxetic at negative pressure (-15 GPa for graphite and
   -56 GPa for silicon carbide) and completely auxetic at -114 and -122

Abstract = {{The present compilation of P - and S wave velocities (V-p and V-s) for
   395 dry and 664 wet basalt, 231 dry and 63 wet rhyolite samples provide
   a new database for evaluating the porosity (phi) dependence of V-p, V-s
   and Poisson's ratio (nu) and the potential auxetic behavior (i.e.,
   negative Poisson's ratio) of volcanic rocks. The nu-phi correlation is
   always positive for the water-saturated rocks but can be either positive
   (rhyolite) or negative (basalt) for dry rocks, depending on the
   Poisson's ratio of the non-porous solid matrix (nu(0)). Auxetic behavior
   cannot occur in wet volcanic rocks but may appear in dry basalts with
   extremely high porosity (>= 70\% for basalt), such that a reentrant foam
   structure forms. The auxeticity of highly porous volcanic rocks such as
   pumice and reticulite will be suppressed by infiltration of water into
   the rocks. Hence, volcanic rocks cannot be auxetic in nature if their
   vesicles are filled with water. Under the laboratory conditions,
   however, a transition from conventional to auxetic behaviors in pumice
   and reticulite is expected to occur by changing the degree of water
   saturation. These results provide a set of basic parameters for the
   modeling of ground deformation and temporal and spatial variations in
   V-p, V-s, V-p/V-s ratio as precursors of volcanic eruption or volcanic
   edifice collapse.}},

Abstract = {{In the present paper, three kinds of novel two-dimensional enhanced
   star-shaped honeycombs (2D-ESSH) are proposed, which are consisted of
   the two-dimensional star-shaped honeycomb (2D-SSH) and reinforcing rods.
   Relative densities of the 2D-SSH and three kinds of 2D-ESSH are deduced.
   Mechanical properties of the proposed novel 2D-ESSH are investigated via
   finite-element simulations and compression experiments. The effects of
   the effective length, the angle of the outer cell walls, the thickness
   of the outer cell walls, the angle of the inner cell walls, and the
   thickness of the inner cell walls on the effective Poisson's ratio and
   effective Young's modulus of the structures are explored in detail. The
   results show that the novel 2D-ESSH can effectively regulate the effect
   of negative Poisson's ratio and two kinds of the 2D-ESSH also improve
   the effective Young's modulus with the appropriate parameters while
   ensuring the lightweight. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic textiles are defined as textiles with negative Poisson's ratio.
   These textiles possess unique properties that render them suitable for
   special applications. This work aims to investigate the effect of fabric
   structural parameters such as thread densities, weave design and warp
   yarn count. Thus, 30 fabric samples were woven at 3 weft and 2 warp
   densities, respectively. Two warp counts and three weave designs of
   plain, basket 3/3 and weft-backed satin 6 were used. The samples were
   uniaxially loaded in weft direction and dimensional changes at various
   strains levels were evaluated. The evaluation was carried out using the
   image processing technique based on MATLAB software. The weft yarns used
   were found to exhibit auxetic behavior at the whole spectrum of the
   strain level used. The least weft yarn Poisson's ratio was found to be
   -0.9. It was established that in general the fabric samples exhibit
   auxetic effect within the stated range of strain. Additionally, it was
   concluded that while fabric thread densities together with warp count
   influence the minimum fabric Poisson's ratio, auxetic behavior of the
   samples is not dependent on weave design alone. Rather, it was
   illustrated that the combined effect of weave design in association with
   stated structural parameters on auxetic feature cannot be ignored.}},

Abstract = {{Materials with negative Poisson's ratios (auxetic materials) have
   several advantages compared to conventional materials, including
   increased plane strain fracture resistance and increased shear modulus.
   A method for the manufacture of honeycomb ceramics with a structure,
   which yields negative Poisson's ratio is described. Ceramics with
   cellular or honeycomb structures have applications as substrates in
   catalytic converters for the emissions from internal combustion engines.
   In such devices due to the extreme temperature variations, the structure
   has to provide high thermal shock resistance. It is possible to increase
   the thermal shock resistance by incorporating specific web geometries,
   Such structures can absorb or compensate for compressive and tensile
   stresses generated in the body during thermal expansion and contraction.
   It is shown that such structures can be produced by the extrusion of
   ceramic pastes through polymer dies produced by rapid prototyping
   (selective laser sintering), CAD technology was used to design the die.
   A ceramic paste based on a zirconia powder was used to make the cellular
   extruded tube. The negative Poisson's ratio behaviour was confirmed by
   employing a simple test.}},

Title = {{Novel Negative Poisson's Ratio Lattice Structures with Enhanced
   Stiffness and Energy Absorption Capacity}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The weak stiffness and strength of materials with negative Poisson's
   ratio limits their application. In this paper, three types of novel
   lattices with negative Poisson's ratio are proposed to improve not only
   stiffness and strength but also energy absorption capacity by embedding
   different ribs into a classic re-entrant structure. Unit cell analyses
   show these novel lattices have significantly increased Young's modulus
   along the loading direction, and Type C can maintain sufficient negative
   Poisson's ratio performance compared with the base lattice. In addition,
   the novel lattices exhibit higher yield stress, plateau stress and
   densification strain extracted from quasi-static compressive simulation.
   The lattices are prototyped by laser-based additive manufacturing and
   tested in quasi-static experiments, which show the experimental data
   match the numerical results within an error of margin. The work
   signifies the prospect of lattices with negative Poisson's ratio in
   enhancing engineering-applicable structures, and indicates the potential
   of structural topology optimization in more sophisticated designs.}},

   alpha(mn) = 47 dB/cm for the auxetic material, which is 1.5 times the
   highest value for the microporous positive nu UHMWPE and more than three

Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{226}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{Cellular solids are attractive materials due to their high specific
   static and dynamic mechanical properties. Even though these mechanical
   domains are interdependent, they are generally studied separately. This
   study uses a combination of additive manufacturing and vacuum assisted
   investment casting to manufacture low specific density (0.042-0.098)
   non-stochastic metallic cellular solids. An in-situ unitary cell
   geometric control is used to produce samples with positive, zero and
   negative Poisson's ratios. The different values of this elastic constant
   allow the analysis of the distinct deformation in auxetic and
   non-auxetic behaviors. Deformation models are used to describe the
   static and dynamic behavior of the referred samples. It is shown that
   auxetic samples display higher values of apparent modulus and plastic
   collapse stress due to their densification effect. In terms of dynamic
   properties, samples with slightly negative and zero rib angles show
   higher values of damping. This is attributed to the more favorable
   flexure component of deformation and variations in material volume that
   influence the hysteretic damping. Overall, it is suggested that the most
   beneficial combination of specific density, static and dynamic
   mechanical properties is observed in samples with a rib angle of -10
   degrees and a Poisson's ratio of - 0.34.}},

Abstract = {{Much research related to negative Poisson's ratio (NPR), or auxetic,
   structures is emerging these days. Several types of 3D NPR structure
   have been proposed and studied, but almost all of them had cuboid
   shapes, which were not suitable for certain engineering applications. In
   this paper, a cylindrical NPR structure was developed and researched. It
   was expected to be utilized in springs, bumpers, dampers and other
   similar applications. For the purpose of parametric analysis, a method
   of parametric modeling of cylindrical NPR structures was developed using
   MATLAB scripts. The scripts can automatically establish finite element
   models, invoke ABAQUS, read results etc. Subsequently the influences of
   structural parameters, including number of cells, number of layers and
   layer heights, on the uniaxial compression behavior of cylinder NPR
   structures were researched. This led to the conclusion that the
   stiffness of the cylindrical NPR structure was enhanced on increasing
   the number of cells and reducing the effective layer height. Moreover,
   small numbers of layers resulted in a late transition area of the
   load-displacement curve from low stiffness to high stiffness. Moreover,
   the middle contraction regions were more apparent with larger numbers of
   cells, smaller numbers of layers and smaller effective layer heights.
   The results indicate that the structural parameters had significant
   effects on the load-displacement curves and deformed shapes of
   cylindrical NPR structures. This paper is conducive to the further
   engineering applications of cylindrical NPR structures.}},

Abstract = {{The use of negative thermal expansivity (NTE) particles as composite
   fillers is relatively new and the particle-matrix interface is not well
   studied. This lack of understanding of the particle-matrix interface is
   further complicated as in many engineering applications, such as
   microchip packaging, the composite is constrained by its surroundings
   and is not free to expand upon heating; an important consideration that
   is often not taken into account. This paper presents a systematic
   theoretical study of the behaviour at the particle-matrix interface
   under varying particle coefficient of thermal expansivity (CTE),
   Poisson's ratios (including negative Poisson's ratios), Young's moduli,
   boundary conditions and particle separation distances via finite element
   modelling, and describes how to optimise composite formulation for
   problems of thermal mismatch through tailoring of particle-matrix
   interaction. The effects of reduced CTE are explored via models of
   electronic chip package assembly. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In the present paper, we analyze uniaxial deformation of crystals of

   crystals, gathered in the well-known Landolt-Bornstein tables. The
   competition between the anisotropy of crystal structures and the
   orientation of deformable samples results in the dependence of the
   elastic characteristics of deformation, such as Young's modulus and
   Poisson's ratio, on the orientation angles. In the special case of a
   single angle, a large number of auxetics were found among crystals of
   cubic, hexagonal, rhombohedral, tetragonal, and orthorhombic systems and
   the character of variations in their response due to changes in

Abstract = {{In the area of biomaterials, the structures with negative Poisson's
   ratio are able to be applied to the polymer component of prosthesis,
   artificial blood-vessel and catheter. To induce its characteristic,
   previous studies postulated many structural shapes such as non-convex
   shape with re-entrant corners and re-entrant honeycomb. In this study,
   we proposed the rotational particle structures and investigated the
   Poisson's ratio and the ratio (E-e/E) of the elastic modulus of these
   structures based on structural design variables using finite element
   method.
   The auto-meshing preprocessor was coded using MATLAB in order to
   construct numerical models as design variables and perform finite
   element analysis (FEA) effectively. Three selected design variables were
   the ratio of fibril's length to particle's diameter (0.2-2.0), the ratio
   of fibril's length to its width (0.02 similar to 0.2) and the angle of
   fibril about horizontal axis (0 degree similar to tangential angle).
   Finite element model has 2D plain stress quadratic element and composed
   of 515 particles and 6-linked fibrils per each particle. For all of 213
   cases, one side of each model is applied a tension, 0.1\% strain and
   analyze Poisson's ratio and the ratio (E-e/E) of the elastic modulus.
   As the ratio of fibril's length to particle's diameter increased and the
   ratio of fibril's diameter to fibril's length decreased fixing the
   fibril's angle with 45 degree, the negative Poisson effect of rotational
   particle structures increased. The ratio of elastic modulus of these
   structures decreased with Poisson's ratio. The results show the
   reasonable values as compared with the previous analytical results.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel three-dimensional (3D) cellular structure with
   negative Poisson's ratio was designed by alternating cuboid surface
   indents on the vertical ribs of the unit cells. The Poisson's ratio and
   Young's modulus of structures with different geometric parameters were
   determined using the finite element method (FEM) as a function of these
   parameters. Samples with identical geometric variables were fabricated
   via 3D printing, and their through-thickness direction Poisson's ratios
   were measured and compared with simulation results. Results showed that
   the Poisson's ratio of the 3D cellular structures can be tuned from
   positive to negative and can reach a minimal value of -0.958. Good
   agreement was found between the experimental results and the simulation.
   This lattice structure is considerably stiffer than re-entrant negative
   Poisson's ratio foam with the same solid phase. The design concept
   developed here can be optimized for specific applications via geometric
   parameters manipulation.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials exhibit a negative Poisson's ratio. Herein, the
   performance of rectangular auxetic membranes, under uniform load, is
   evaluated in terms of the maximum stress encountered. To facilitate
   convenient calculation, empirical modeling is conducted on the exact
   solution to reproduce displacement coefficients that are sufficiently
   accurate. A dimensionless maximum stress is then introduced to allow the
   effect from the membrane's Poisson's ratio and aspect ratio to be
   directly observed. Results reveal that 1) the dimensionless maximum
   stress reduces monotonically and nonmonotonically for conventional and
   auxetic membranes, respectively, 2) for the same Poisson's ratio
   magnitude the stresses in auxetic membranes are lower than those from
   conventional ones, 3) the optimal Poisson's ratio, on the basis of
   dimensionless maximum stress minimization, falls within the negative
   range, and 4) the dimensionless maximum stress minimization is
   especially effective for square membranes as well as very long and
   narrow membranes. It is therefore recommended that material auxeticity
   be taken into account-alongside geometrical and other material
   properties-in designing membranes and highly compliant very thin plates.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials have previously been shown to enhance various
   performances due to its unusual property of becoming fatter when
   uniaxially stretched and thinner when uniaxially compressed (i.e., the
   materials exhibit a negative Poisson's ratio). The current study focuses
   on assessing the potential of an auxetic material to enhance the
   buckling capacity of a rectangular plate under uniaxial compression. The
   in-plane translational restraint along the unloaded edges that was often
   neglected in open literature is taken into consideration in our buckling
   model proposed in this study. The closed-form expressions for the
   critical buckling coefficient of the rectangle are provided and the
   predicted results agree well with those determined by the finite element
   method. Furthermore, the results indicate that the buckling performance
   of a rectangular plate under uniaxial compression can be significantly
   improved by replacing the traditional material that has a positive
   Poisson's ratio with an auxetic material when there is in-plane
   translation restraint along the unloaded edges. (C) 2016 Chinese Society

Journal = {{MECHANICS OF MATERIALS}},

Volume = {{133}},
Pages = {{111-119}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Here, we demonstrate that the Young's modulus (E) and Poisson's ratio
   (nu) are not only material-dependent but also size-dependent. The
   interplay between the size dependence of E and nu and the dispersion
   characteristics of the material is revealed. An experimental approach is
   developed to capture the size-dependence of E and nu based on material's
   dispersion characteristics. This experimental approach is supported by a
   theoretical approach, which implements a nonlocal model with two
   independent nonlocal fields. A unique material dispersion parameter (R)
   that measures the contrast between the material dispersions in
   longitudinal and transverse directions is developed. This parameter is
   used to scale the size-dependence of E and nu of various monocrystals
   and define the conditions of the material stability. It is revealed that
   the material is stable with positive stiffnesses when 0 < R < 0.865.
   When R > 0.865, the material possesses a negative bulk modulus, and it
   is yet stable if it is constrained. The material is unstable when R is
   imaginary. The material is auxetic (with a negative Poisson's ratio)
   only when 0.7 < R < 1. The implementations of the two approaches to Ag,
   Au, Cu, Pt, and Si monocrystals highlight that values of E and nu
   strongly depend on the material's size and the contrast between its
   longitudinal and transverse dispersions.}},

Title = {{Design of auxetic sandwich panel faceplates comprising cellular networks
   with high stiffness and negative Poisson's ratio}},
Journal = {{ADVANCED COMPOSITE MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{175-196}},
Month = {{DEC 31}},
Abstract = {{In the present work, a novel design is presented for producing auxetic
   laminated faceplates for structures that contain auxetic cores in order
   to produce fully auxetic sandwich structures. The design is based on the
   use of periodic cellular networks that are embedded in a
   fibre-reinforced polymer matrix. These networks have a high in-plane
   negative Poisson's ratio and a high in-plane stiffness. Two auxetic
   networks were chosen for this purpose: a classical re-entrant hexagonal
   network and an anti-tetra chiral auxetic network. The finite elements
   method was used to model the auxetic network and the faceplate. For the
   auxetic network, the relative modulus (E-s/E-m) was investigated to
   determine its effect on the behaviour of the faceplate. The auxetic
   behaviour of the faceplate occurs when the auxetic network has a high
   relative modulus. For example, for a classical re-entrant hexagonal
   network faceplate, the auxetic behaviour starts to appear when
   E-s/E-m>33, while for an anti-tetra chiral auxetic network faceplate,
   the auxetic behaviour starts to appear when E-s/E-m>24. Analytical
   expressions for the elastic constants of the faceplates were developed
   using the representative volume element model (RVE) and a semi-empirical
   formula of the rule of mixtures (ROMs). The results of the analytical
   expressions were compared with the finite elements results for various
   values of the relative density parameter rho({*}). The relative density
   had a significant effect on the elastic constants of the faceplate. The
   model produced with the representative volume element method had higher
   values for the elastic constants than did that created with the finite
   elements model, but the semi-empirical rule of mixtures gave more
   accurate results for both types of faceplates. A modified design for the
   classical re-entrant hexagonal network that increases the in-plane
   stiffness of the auxetic network is presented since it has been found
   that it plays a major role in producing a high negative Poisson's ratio.
   The modified networks are an oval re-entered and a stiffened re-entered
   network. Experiments were carried out on the oval re-entered faceplates
   to obtain the in-plane moduli and the Poisson's ratios. The tested
   faceplate samples clearly showed auxetic behaviour. A good agreement
   between the finite elements results and the experimental data was
   obtained.}},

Abstract = {{A new cellular vehicle body structure (Negative Poisson's Ratio vehicle

   a finite element analysis (FEA) model of Negative Poisson's Ratio (NPR)
   structure cell, the effect of relative density and topological structure
   on the linear and nonlinear properties is studied. A compressive
   experiment using a 3{*}3 NPR structure sample made of ABS material was
   developed. The experimental results concluded that NPR structure
   possesses the negative Poisson's (between 0 and -1) and enhanced
   strength under in-plane compression, which provide theoretical

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials, known with negative Poisson's ratio, are highly

   material with unusual in-plane negative Poisson's ratio within the
   framework of density functional theory calculations. B4N monolayer also
   exhibits a highly emerged mechanical anisotropy, characterized by
   Young's modulus and Poissons ratio. In addition, this monolayer shows
   superior mechanical flexibility in ideal tensile strength and critical
   strain values. The phonon dispersion calculations and ab initio
   molecular dynamics simulations further demonstrate that this monolayer
   also owns excellent dynamical and thermal stabilities. The fantastic
   mechanical properties coupled with robust structural stability render
   the auxetic B4N monolayer promising for future nanomechanical devices.}},

Abstract = {{Developing two-dimensional multifunctional materials is highly desirable
   for nanoscale device applications. Herein, by means of first-principles
   calculations, we demonstrate a promising two-dimensional multifunctional
   semiconductor with ferroelectricity, ultrahigh carrier mobility, and
   negative Poisson's ratio in single-layer BI. We show that single-layer
   BI exhibits intrinsic ferroelectricity, derived from its asymmetric
   structure, and the ferroelectricity features an in-plane electric
   polarization as large as 3.3 x 10(-10)C(m-1), which is beneficial for
   nonvolatile memories. Owing to its large band dispersion, single-layer
   BI is also found to harbor an extremely high carrier mobility (1.17 x
   10(5) cm(2)V(-1)s(-1)), even comparable to that of graphene, suggesting
   its potential for high-performance electronics and bulk photo-voltaic
   effect. This, combined with the moderate band gap, renders single-layer
   BI with a high absorption coefficient (10(5)cm(m-1)) from near-infrared
   to ultraviolet light. In addition, we unveil that single-layer BI is a
   long-sought-after auxetic material with a negative Poisson's ratio of
   -0.31. All of these findings make single-layer BI a compelling
   multifunctional material, offering a versatile platform for diverse
   nanoscale devices applications.}},

Abstract = {{A physically nonlinear constitutive equation with four arbitrary
   material functions for isotropic rheonomic materials is studied to
   determine the rheological effects simulated by it and the spheres of
   influence of the material functions. The properties of the volumetric,
   axial, and lateral creep curves generated by this equation and the
   dependence of the lateral strain coefficient (Poisson's ratio) on the
   material functions, time, and stress during creep are analytically
   investigated. A general exact estimate of the upper and lower bounds of
   the Poisson's ratio and criteria of its negativeness, increase,
   decrease, and constancy are obtained. The Poisson's ratio of the model
   is proved not to be a nonmonotonic function of time.}},

Abstract = {{The theory of elasticity predicts a variety of phenomena associated with
   solids that possess a negative Poisson's ratio. The fabrication of
   metamaterials with a `designed' microstructure that exhibit a Poisson's
   ratio approaching the thermodynamic limits of 1/2 and -1 increases the
   likelihood of realising these phenomena for applications. In this work,
   we investigate the properties of a layered composite, with alternating
   layers of materials with negative and positive Poisson's ratio
   approaching the thermodynamic limits. Using the finite element method to
   simulate uniaxial loading and indentation of a free standing composite,
   we observed an increase in the resistance to mechanical deformation
   above the average value of the two materials. Even though the greatest
   increase in stiffness is gained as the thermodynamic limits are
   approached, a significant amount of added stiffness can be attained,
   provided that the Young's modulus of the negative Poisson's ratio
   material is not less than that of the positive Poisson's ratio material.

Abstract = {{Systematic and deep understanding of mechanical properties of the
   negative Poisson's ratio convex-concave foams plays a very important
   role for their practical engineering applications. However, in the open
   literature, only a negative Poisson's ratio effect of the metamaterials
   convex-concave foams is simply mentioned. In this paper, through the
   experimental and finite element methods, effects of geometrical
   morphology on elastic moduli, energy absorption, and damage properties
   of the convex-concave foams are systematically studied. Results show
   that negative Poisson's ratio, energy absorption, and damage properties
   of the convex-concave foams could be tuned simultaneously through
   adjusting the chord height to span ratio of the sine-shaped cell edges.
   By the rational design of the negative Poisson's ratio, when compared to
   the conventional open-cell foams of equal mass, convex-concave foams
   could have the combined advantages of relative high stiffness and
   strength, enhanced energy absorption and damage resistance. The research
   of this paper provides theoretical foundations for optimization design
   of the mechanical properties of the convex-concave foams and thus could
   facilitate their practical applications in the engineering fields.}},

Abstract = {{A chiral structure with a negative Poisson's ratio containing a hollow
   circle with varying diameters was designed, and the finite element
   method was used to investigate the variation in the Poisson's ratio when
   the hollow circle diameter was varied (d = 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 mm). The
   simulation results showed that the Poisson's ratio was sensitive to the
   hollow circle diameter, and the minimum Poisson's ratio was -0.43. Three
   specimens with different hollow circle diameters (d ` = 0, 1, and 3 mm)
   were 3D-printed from thermoplastic polyurethane, and the Poisson's ratio
   and equivalent elastic modulus were measured. In the elastic range, the
   Poisson's ratio increased and the equivalent elastic modulus decreased
   as the hollow circle diameter increased. The simulation and experimental
   results showed good agreement. The proposed structure is expected to be
   applicable to protective sports gear owing to its high energy absorption
   and the fact that its properties can be modified as required by
   adjusting the geometric parameters of the unit cell.}},

Abstract = {{Based on the butterfly pattern structure and the star-shaped honeycomb
   structure, a novel auxetic butterfly-shaped honeycomb structure (BSH)
   was constructed, which realized the coupling improvement of negative
   Poisson's ratio and in-plane stiffness. Under uniaxial tension, the
   equivalent elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio of the BSH structure were
   derived by the energy method. The relationship between Poisson's ratio
   and structural parameters of the BSH structure was discussed to optimize
   the structural parameters by numerical analysis. Poisson's ratio and
   relative elastic modulus were taken as the objective function groups.
   The Pareto solution set was obtained by the Gamultiobj multi-objective
   genetic algorithm method. The Pareto solution set was sorted based on
   the entropy-weight TOPSIS method, and the optimal solution was selected
   as the solution of the novel structure optimization design. The
   correctness of the theoretical results was verified by the finite
   element analysis and experiment results. Furthermore, compared with the
   traditional re-entrant hexagonal honeycomb structure and the star-shaped
   honeycomb structure, the relative elastic modulus and auxetic effect of
   the BSH structure were greatly improved, and the stiffness of the novel
   structure was improved while maintaining a high auxetic effect.

Abstract = {{Solids that possess negative Poisson's ratio are termed auxetic
   materials. This article considers the effect of auxeticity, i.e., the
   negative extent of Poisson's ratio on thermal stresses in plates,
   shells, and other solids. Results show that in cases where temperature
   gradient is in the through-thickness of a fully-clamped plate or when
   the temperature gradient is in the radial direction of fully-clamped
   shells, the thermal stresses can be significantly reduced by using
   auxetic materials. The same result applies to spheres and cylinders with
   radial temperature gradient. The maximum thermal stress is minimized if
   the selected material possesses Poisson's ratio of -1. However, the use
   of auxetic material is not always advantageous, nor does the use of
   materials with Poisson's ratio of -1 always minimize the maximum thermal
   stresses. It is herein suggested that, in addition to the use of
   materials with lower modulus and lower coefficient of thermal expansion,
   the use of auxetic materials offers an alternative route for lowering
   thermal stresses in some cases.}},

Journal = {{IRANIAN POLYMER JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{49-56}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The effect of extension ratio on the structure and property of expanded
   polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) has been decisively studied. ePTFE is
   unique with its porous fibrillar network structure connected by nodes
   and also with its degree of orientation which increases with increases
   in extension ratio. It is found that the Poisson's ratio of ePTFE is
   negative, and it is reduced dramatically with increased extension ratio.
   At the extension ratio of 30, the Poisson's ratio reaches - 10.00. By
   changes of extension ratio from 1 to 10, the segmental mobility of
   polymer chains becomes harder, and the dynamic glass transition
   temperature (T-g) is increased. Broad glass transition regions are
   revealed in tan delta versus temperature curves in
   polytetrafluoroethylene specimens stretched 20-(S20) and 30-fold (S30).
   As the extension ratio is increased, the thermal conductivity of the
   specimens is decreased. The thermal conductivity coefficient is dropped
   to 0.051 W m(-1) K owing to the appearance of more pores and low degree
   of crystallinity at higher extension ratio. The properties of ePTFE
   modified by carbonyl iron powder (CIP) have been investigated. CIP has
   affected the structure and properties of modified ePTFE. CIP-modified
   ePTFE also exhibits a negative Poisson's ratio which is larger than
   ePTFE at the same extension ratio. The modified ePTFE reveals higher
   thermal conductivity coefficient than ePTFE itself.}},

Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{262}},
Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{The engineering materials and structures, which usually suffer both
   temperature variation and mechanical loading, motivate the urgent need
   of the multifunctional metamaterials with simultaneously programmable
   coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) and Poisson's ratio (PR).
   Whereas, the current 3D metamaterials can not continuously program the
   CTE and PR. Herein, a class of 3D metamaterial is originally devised by
   an exclusive geometrical methodology. The explicit expressions of the
   CTE and PR are theoretically established and are also verified by the
   numerical modeling. The analysis confirms that the CTE can be widely
   tailored by varying the geometrical parameters and selection of the
   constituents. Besides, the controllable PR can be also easily obtained
   by adjusting the geometrical parameters. Moreover, the devised 3D
   metamaterial gives paired tailorable CTE and controllable PR, including
   especially negative CTE + negative PR. An arrangement rule is developed
   to construct a series of hierarchical cells which can program CTE and PR
   in multi principle axes and can be periodically arrayed for obtaining
   the 3D cellular metamaterials. The devised 3D metamaterials are capable
   of realizing the widely coupled programmability of both CTE and PR and
   provide a strategy of shape morphing stimulated both by temperature
   variation and mechanical loading.}},

Abstract = {{An exploration by analytical method has been made herein for a
   mechanism-based structure that involves a two-dimensional array of rings
   and a three-dimensional array of double-rings, with short fixed rods and
   long sliding rods attached at the outer and inner surfaces of the rings,
   respectively. Based on the theory of thin rings, effective Poisson's
   ratio and effective coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) models have
   been obtained for single-ring structures, pole-loaded double-ring
   structures, and equator-loaded double-ring structures. Results establish
   a very strong correlation between these effective properties with the
   ring radius and rod lengths. In addition, the analysis of four of the
   double-ring structures reveals that the sign of Poisson's ratio is
   dependent on the direction of loading. An example application is
   demonstrated herein in which positive thermal expansion rings, used in
   conjunction with rigid rods, enable the design of an overall zero
   thermal expansion structure (i.e., minimal thermal stress) with tunable
   negative thermal expansion internal microstructure for use as sieve.
   Finally, it is herein shown that, by judicious positioning of the short
   fixed rods and/or long sliding rods, one may possibly obtain various
   combinations of positive and negative CTEs with positive and negative
   Poisson's ratio.}},

Title = {{Pluripotent stem cell expansion and neural differentiation in 3-D
   scaffolds of tunable Poisson's ratio}},
Journal = {{ACTA BIOMATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{49}},
Pages = {{192-203}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Biophysical properties of the scaffolds such as the elastic modulus,
   have been recently shown to impact stem cell lineage commitment. On the
   other hand, the contribution of the Poisson's ratio, another important
   biophysical property, to the stem cell fate decision, has not been
   studied. Scaffolds with tunable Poisson's ratio (v) (termed as auxetic
   scaffolds when Poisson's ratio is zero or negative) are anticipated to
   provide a spectrum of unique biophysical 3-D microenvironments to
   influence stem cell fate. To test this hypothesis, in the present work
   we fabricated auxetic polyurethane scaffolds (v = 0 to -0.45) and
   evaluated their effects on neural differentiation of mouse embryonic
   stem cells (ESCs) and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs).
   Compared to the regular scaffolds (v = +0.30) before auxetic conversion,
   the auxetic scaffolds supported smaller aggregate formation and higher
   expression of beta-tubulin III upon neural differentiation. The
   influences of pore structure, Poisson's ratio, and elastic modulus on
   neural lineage commitment were further evaluated using a series of
   auxetic scaffolds. The results indicate that Poisson's ratio may
   confound the effects of elastic modulus, and auxetic scaffolds with
   proper pore structure and Poisson's ratio enhance neural
   differentiation. This study demonstrates that tuning the Poisson's ratio
   of the scaffolds together with elastic modulus and microstructure would
   enhance the capability to generate broader, more diversified ranges of
   biophysical 3-D microenvironments for the modulation of cellular
   differentiation.
   Statement of Significance
   Biophysical signaling from the substrates and scaffolds plays a critical
   role in neural lineage commitment of pluripotent stem cells. While the
   contribution of elastic modulus has been well studied, the influence of
   Poisson's ratio along with microstructure of the scaffolds remains
   unknown largely due to the lack of technology to produce materials with
   tailorable Poisson's ratio. This study fabricated auxetic polyurethane
   scaffolds with different elastic modulus, Poisson's ratio and
   microstructure and evaluated neural differentiation of pluripotent stem
   cells. The findings add a novel angle to understand the impact of
   biophysical microenvironment on stem cell fate decisions. (C) 2016 Acta

Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Traditional three dimensional (3D) block auxetics exhibit anisotropic
   cross-section changes even they exist in isotropic forms due to finite
   size and boundary effect. Herein, a systematic design strategy of
   axisymmetric aux-etic metamaterials is proposed with rotationally
   symmetric transverse deformation mode. The axisymmetric auxetics are
   obtained by the revolution of two-dimensional curved auxetic
   configurations along the axis of rota-tion and composed with shell
   elements. Finite element simulations and mechanical experiments reveal
   that the axisymmetric deformation mechanism cause transversely isotropic
   negative Poisson's ratio and enhance the specific Young's modulus
   compared to corresponding 2D and 3D cellular structures. The influence
   of geometric parameters on elastic constants is investigated
   numerically. Three kinds of 3D printing technologies are adopted to
   fabricate the axisymmetric auxetics which shows the relative Young's
   modulus and equivalent Poisson's ratio are independent of constitute
   materials. This study systematically characterizes the mechanical
   responses of axisymmetric auxetic metamaterials and expounds the
   potential multifunctional applications, such as reusable energy

Abstract = {{The study of physical and mechanical properties can shed light on the
   picture of martensitic transitions in materials that control the unique
   effects of shape memory and superelasticity. Martensitic transformations
   in metals and alloys are based on shear-type deformation processes, so
   the study of their elastic behavior contains important information about
   the nature and mechanisms of these phase transitions. In this report, we
   analyze the value and relationship between the degree of elastic
   anisotropy and the Poisson's ratio of Ti-Ni alloy crystals based on our
   own and literature data obtained experimentally and computationally from
   the first principles. A significant variability of the elastic
   anisotropy coefficient A of Ti-Ni crystals was established, which is due
   to the apparently elastic ``softening{''} of the alloy lattice on the
   eve of martensitic transformations (especially the constant c44). The
   minimum Poisson's ratio of Ti-Ni crystals is -0.25. The maximum value of
   mu was 1.10, which is higher than the theoretical limit for
   polycrystals. Extreme values of mu were achieved for directions when the
   stretch is oriented along the direction < 110 >, i. e. diagonals of the
   cube face. The mean <mu > was found to be 0.41. Ti-Ni based alloys can
   be considered as partial auxetic - materials with negative Poisson's
   ratio in some directions, that is, have mu < 0 when choosing some
   directions and be an ordinary material with positive mu for other
   directions. The elastic anisotropy of Ti-Ni crystals can be determined
   based on the numerical differences in the extreme values of mu as A(mu)
   = |mu(ma)x-mu(min)|/<mu >. A strong correlation was established between
   the elastic anisotropy coefficient A and the factor A(mu) (the
   correlation coefficient 0.9871). The parameters of the linear dependence
   of the reduced anisotropy factor A(mu)({*}) =1.33779A(mu) + 0.18542, for
   which A(mu)({*}) = A.}},

   fibril hinging, flexure and stretching. Expressions for strain-dependent
   Poisson's ratio and Young's modulus have been derived and compared with
   experimental results on microporous PTFE and UHMWPE. A combination of
   the hinging mode followed by the stretching mode of deformation can be
   used to explain the general features of the experimental data for these
   auxetic polymers. The force coefficients governing the different modes
   of deformation are dependent on fibril dimensions and intrinsic material
   properties. By varying the geometry of the network, the model can be
   used to predict different combinations of Poisson's ratio with modulus,
   from large positive through to large negative values.}},

Abstract = {{Two sets of carbon fibre laminate configurations have been designed
   manufactured and examined. The first consisted of one in plane auxetic
   (i.e. having a negative Poisson's ratio) and one with matched elastic
   moduli, but a positive in-plane Poisson's ratio. The second consisted of
   three laminate again with matched elastic moduli but with negative, near
   zero and positive thru-thickness Poisson's ratio. Fracture toughness is
   predicted to be enhanced if a negative thru-thickness Poisson's ratio is
   present. This study also shows that more energy is required to propagate
   a crack in the auxetic laminate and that is less notch sensitive than
   its conventional counterpart for the negative in-plane Poisson's ratio.

Abstract = {{A stiff tubular cellular structure topology is designed by alternatively
   indenting rectangular contour patterns on the cell ribs. Modified
   topologies can be obtained by tailoring the geometric parameters. The
   Poisson's ratios and elastic moduli of the proposed tubular structures

   method (FEM). Results show that the minimum Poisson's ratio of the
   proposed structures can reach -0.28. The unit cell topology and
   orientation can significantly affect the structures deformation
   behaviors. The structures exhibit mixed mode of bending- and
   stretching-dominated deformation responses, and show improved specific
   elastic moduli compared with traditional open-cell stochastic foams with
   positive Poisson's ratios. 3D-printed samples with identical geometric
   variables to those of the FE models are fabricated, and their Poisson's
   ratios and stress-strain relationships are determined experimentally,
   and compared with simulation results. Excellent agreement is achieved
   between measurements and simulations. The design concept proposed here

Abstract = {{3D random Vonoroi structures with negative Poisson's ratio have been
   proposed and created numerically via finite element method using Voronoi
   tessellation technique. Negative Poisson's ratio is achieved via
   triaxial compression treatment on the Voronoi models generated using
   Matlab. The Poisson's ratio and energy absorption capacity of the
   triaxially compressed structures have been studied as a function of the
   geometrical irregularity beta and the triaxial compression ratio eta in
   a uniaxial compression setup. Results show that the Poisson's ratio of
   the structures rapidly decreases from positive to negative and achieved
   a minimum with an increasing triaxial compression ratio eta. The
   Poisson's ratio exhibited slight increase and quickly saturated with
   further increase of the triaxial compression ratio eta. A minimum nu(yz)
   of -0.366 is achieved when beta = 0.3 and eta = 20\%; whereas, a minimum
   nu(xz) of -0.347 is achieved when beta = 0.1 and eta = 10\%. The energy
   absorption capacity of the structure with a specific initial
   irregularity factor beta decreases with an increasing eta. For a
   specific eta, structures with the maximum initial irregularity factor
   beta exhibited the highest energy absorption capacity. A maximum energy
   absorption capacity is achieved in the model with an initial

Abstract = {{Based on the bi-material triangle lattice cell, a new cellular
   structure, bi-material re-entrant triangle (BRT) cellular structure, is
   devised to incorporate tailorable coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE)
   and tunable Poisson's ratio (PR) properties by replacing the straight
   base of a triangle with two hypotenuse members. A general
   thermoelasticity equation to systematically build the relationship among
   the external force, the temperature load, and the deformation for planar
   lattice structures with bounded joints is derived and then embedded into
   a theoretical model for the devised BRT structure. Using assembled
   thermoelasticity equation, effective PR, Young's modulus, as well as CTE
   are computed. In order to guide designers to construct initial concepts,
   the design domain for coupling negative CTE and negative PR properties
   is plotted. The material-property-combination region that can be
   achieved by this cellular structure is determined within an Ashby
   material selection chart of CTE versus PR. Nine available combinations

Volume = {{39}},

Abstract = {{The Poisson's ratio of a material is strictly defined only for small
   strain linear elastic behavior. In practice, engineering strains are
   often used to calculate Poisson's ratio in place of the mathematically
   correct true strains with only very small differences resulting in the
   case of many engineering materials. The engineering strain definition is
   often used even in the inelastic region, for example, in metals during
   plastic yielding. However, for highly nonlinear elastic materials, such
   as many biomaterials, smart materials and microstructured materials,
   this convenient extension may be misleading, and it becomes advantageous
   to define a strain-varying Poisson's function. This is analogous to the
   use of a tangent modulus for stiffness. An important recent application
   of such a Poisson's function is that of auxetic materials that
   demonstrate a negative Poisson's ratio and are often highly strain
   dependent. In this paper, the importance of the use of a Poisson's
   function in appropriate circumstances is demonstrated. Interpretation
   methods for coping with error-sensitive data or small strains are also
   described.}},

Abstract = {{Open-cell auxetic foams have shown potential for use in sporting and
   other protective equipment. Previous conversion methods for auxetic
   closed-cell foam used a bespoke pressure vessel. This work expands upon
   a recent method, using steam absorption followed by cooling and
   condensation, to change the cell shape of closed-cell foam to impart a
   negative Poisson's ratio. Aiming to present a simple, repeatable
   conversion method, foam samples (20 x 10 x 100 mm) floating in
   water-filled (similar to 20 degrees C), covered ceramic containers (300
   x 200 x 100 mm) were heated in an oven at 105 degrees C for between 1
   and 6.5 hrs. Based on the results for these smaller samples, a larger
   sample of foam (30 x 100 x 100 mm) was also converted, with a steaming
   time of 8 hrs. The final volume ratio (original/final volume) increased
   with heating time, up to a maximum of 4.6. The amount and angle of
   re-entrant (inward-folding) cell walls increased with the final volume
   ratio as cells contracted further, as evidenced by micro-computed
   tomography. Poisson's ratios, measured using digital image correlation,
   were as low as -0.3 in tension and -1.1 in compression. The tensile
   Young's modulus increased from similar to 2 up to similar to 6 MPa with
   the final volume ratio and the compressive Young's modulus reduced from
   similar to 1.5 MPa for low values of the final volume ratio between one
   and three and then remained close to 1.5 MPa.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents the electromechanical properties of the 3-3
   piezoelectric metamaterial based on variants of honeycomb (HC)
   structure. Three kinds of three-dimensional (3D) elastically anisotropic
   and piezoelectrically active HC structures were introduced, namely,
   conventional HC (3D-CHC), a re-entrant HC (3D-RE) and a semi re-entrant
   HC (3D-SRE). Highly porous 3D finite element models of the mentioned
   three kinds of metamaterials were developed and the role of ligament
   orientation on their effective elastic, piezoelectric and dielectric
   properties was completely characterized. The intrinsic symmetry of HC
   structure was utilized and simplified mixed boundary conditions
   equivalent to periodic boundary conditions were recognized. In
   comparison to their bulk constituent, all the 3-3 type piezoelectric HC
   networks exhibited an enhanced response, especially for the longitudinal
   poling. The normalized figures of merit show a mild dependence on the
   angle theta and the underlying deformation mechanisms associated with
   the zero, positive and negative Poisson's ratios. Figures of merit such
   as hydrostatic strain coefficient (d(h)), the hydrostatic figure of
   merit (d(h).g(h)) and the acoustic impedance (Z) reached their best
   values at small angles, i.e., theta = 30 degrees. Longitudinally poled
   networks exhibited four order of magnitude increase in their hydrostatic
   figure of merit (foam to solid ratio > 10,000) and one order of
   magnitude decrease in the acoustic impedance indicating their
   applicability for the design of hydrophones.}},

Abstract = {{While elastic modulus is tunable in tissue engineering scaffolds, it is
   substantially more challenging to tune the Poisson's ratio of scaffolds.
   In certain biological applications, scaffolds with a tunable Poisson's
   ratio may be more suitable for emulating the behavior of native tissue
   mechanics. Here, we design and fabricate a scaffold, which exhibits
   simultaneous negative and positive Poisson's ratio behavior. Custom-made
   digital micro-mirror device stereolithography was used to fabricate
   single- and multiple-layer scaffolds using polyethylene glycol-based
   biomaterial. These scaffolds are composed of pore structures having
   special geometries, and deformation mechanisms, which can be tuned to
   exhibit both negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) and positive Poisson's ratio
   (PPR) behavior in a side-to-side or top-to-bottom configuration. Strain
   measurement results demonstrate that analytical deformation models and
   simulations accurately predict the Poisson's ratios of both the NPR and
   PPR regions. This hybrid Poisson's ratio property can be imparted to any
   photocurable material, and potentially be applicable in a variety of
   biomedical applications. (C) 2012 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by

Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we report a new multi-scale NPR composite based on
   auxetic fabric/elastomer matrix (AF/EM) composite structure. The
   multi-scale AF was obtained via using helical auxetic yarn (HAY) as weft
   yarns and constructing re-entrant hexagonal (REH) geometry structure on
   the macro scale, then the AF was combined with EM to fabricate the
   auxetic composite (AC). The AF and AC exhibit the NPR of - 1.492 and -
   0.379. Simultaneously, high tensile strain over 108\% (AF) and 82\% (AC)
   can be subjected, indicating good mechanical performance. The superior
   performance of the AC is its ability to maintain NPR and resilience,
   with elastic recovery ratio over 94\% and work recovery coefficient with
   a stable value over 80\% after 10 cycles. Also, the damping properties
   results further evidence the good elasticity of our AC. The paper shows
   that our AF and AC are promising candidates in protective composites.}},

Journal = {{MECHANICS OF MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{157}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{This work analyses shear moduli of conventional and auxetic open-cell
   polymer foams. Shear moduli are i) measured directly and ii) calculated
   by applying elasticity theory for isotropic solid materials, using
   Young's moduli and Poisson's ratios from compression tests. Zero and
   negative Poisson's ratio foams are fabricated from conventional foams
   using a thermo-mechanical process. Fabricated and conventional foams are
   compression tested in three orthogonal directions, up to densification
   at similar to 60\% compression, with full-field strain measurements
   obtained using Digital Image Correlation. Compression testing is
   followed by shear testing. The measured shear moduli vary from 16 +/- 7
   kPa for negative Poisson's ratio foams to 38 +/- 2 kPa for zero
   Poisson?s ratio foams, with conventional foams in between with a mean
   value of 32 +/- 8 kPa. The calculated shear moduli are typically lower
   than the measured values. The results suggest that the application of
   elasticity theory to calculate the low strain shear modulus of open-cell
   foam from Young's modulus and Poisson?s ratio measured in compression
   tests is appropriate if the foam is isotropic.}},

Pages = {{391-400}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the effective thermo-elastic properties of
   hybrid materials containing layered auxetic microstructures. We consider
   three types of arrangements: (1) hybrids with randomly distributed
   plate-like inclusions possessing the negative Poisson's ratio and
   negative thermal expansion coefficient, (2) sandwich structures with
   auxetic cores and (3) laminates with randomly arranged and ordered
   auxetic and negative thermal expansion layers. We evaluate the effective
   characteristics of these hybrids by analysing representative volume
   elements using the finite element method. We observe that the plate-like
   auxetic inclusions increase the effective stiffness of the hybrid. This
   stiffening effect was previously reported for spherical and cubic
   auxetic inclusions and is further investigated in this study. We
   demonstrate that the aspect ratio of the plate-like shapes has strong
   influence on this stiffening effect the decrease in the aspect ratio
   reduces stiffening in the direction parallel to the layers and enhances
   it in the direction perpendicular to them. In the auxetic laminates, the
   stiffening effect strengths with the increase in the number of auxetic
   layers. We also show that thinner inclusions provide lower effective
   linear coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) in the direction parallel
   to the layering and higher effective CTE in the direction perpendicular
   to it.}},

Abstract = {{Materials presenting a negative Poisson's ratio (auxetics) have drawn
   attention for the past two decades, especially in the field of
   lightweight composite structures and cellular media. Studies have shown
   that auxeticity may result in higher shear modulus, indentation
   toughness and acoustic damping. In this work, three auxetic periodic
   microstructures based on 2D geometries are considered for being used as
   sandwich-core materials. Elastic moduli are computed for each
   microstructure by using finite elements combined with periodic
   homogenization technique. Anisotropy of elastic properties is
   investigated in and out-of-plane. Comparison is made between auxetics
   and the classical honeycomb cell. A new 3D auxetic lattice is proposed
   for volumic applications. Cylindrical and spherical elastic indentation
   tests are simulated in order to conclude on the applicability of such
   materials to structures. Proof is made that under certain conditions,
   auxetics can be competitive with honeycomb cells in terms of indentation
   strength. Their relatively soft response in tension can be compensated,
   in some situations, by high shear moduli.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel three-dimensional (3D) unit cell structure with
   butterfly-like perforations was designed, and negative Poisson's ratio
   and tunable stiffness were achieved in such a geometry. The Poisson's
   ratio and strain-stress relationship of structures with different
   geometric parameters were determined using the finite element method
   (FEM). Samples with identical geometric variables to those of finite
   element models were fabricated via 3D printing technique, and their
   Poisson's ratios and stress-strain relationships were experimentally
   determined and compared with the FEM results. Results showed that the
   proposed 3D cellular structures exhibit negative Poisson's ratios, and a
   minimal value of -0.7091 could be reached. The stress-strain curve of
   each structure exhibited three distinct stages (elastic response, rib
   buckling and self-contact), with different elastic moduli being observed
   at each stage, and demonstrated a tunable range of the compressive
   stiffness ratio between stages varying from 0.1866 to 1.4006(tunable
   stiffness), as determined by FEM analysis. Good agreement was found
   between the experimental results and FEM predictions. The design concept
   can be implemented and optimized for specific applications via geometric
   parameters manipulation.}},

Abstract = {{Composite materials containing negative-stiffness inclusions embedded in
   positive-stiffness matrix may exhibit unconventional (anomalous)
   effective coupled-field properties through interactions of the two
   phases. Effective coupled-field properties are calculated with the
   finite element methods under the quasi-static assumption. Stability
   boundaries are determined by applying 10Hz sinusoidal loading on
   boundary surfaces, and the system is unstable if its energy becomes
   divergent for a chosen inclusion Young's modulus ratio ((E)) or bulk
   modulus ratio ((K)). Effective viscoelastic properties and their
   stability are studied for negative (E) at 10Hz, while the Poisson's
   ratio of the purely elastic inclusion is kept constant. For small
   inclusion volume fractions, their stability boundary is at
   (E)approximate to-0.3, and extreme large effective damping and
   viscoelastic modulus are in the unstable regime. Furthermore, in the
   viscoelastic case, inclusion shapes have no effects on stability. As for
   the effective coupled-field properties, all anomalous peaks are in the
   unstable regime for negative (E) or (K), except for an anomalous peak in
   effective thermal expansion coefficient with electrically insulated
   inclusions. Insulated inclusions may cause charge accumulation at the
   inclusion-matrix interface and boundary surface effects may serve as
   stabilizing agents to the composite system. (C) 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag

Abstract = {{Examples of auxetic fused fibrous assemblies can be found among both
   natural and synthetic materials. In theory, fibrous network materials
   can exhibit negative Poisson's ratios, yet the deformation mechanisms
   and parameters which give rise to a negative Poisson's ratio in
   disordered fibrous materials are not well understood, and this class of
   auxetic materials remains largely under-explored. The potential
   applications of auxetic fibre networks include their use as
   reinforcement in composites. The process of embedding auxetic random
   fibrous networks in a polymer matrix is an attractive alternate route to
   the manufacture of auxetic composites; however, before such an approach
   can be developed, a methodology for designing fibrous networks with the
   desired negative Poisson's ratios must first be established. This
   requires an understanding of the factors which bring about negative
   Poisson's ratios in these materials. In this work, we present a
   modelling approach to study the auxetic behaviour of compressed fused
   fibrous networks, Finite element analyses of three-dimensional
   stochastic fibre networks were performed to gain insight into the
   effects of parameters such as network anisotropy, network density and
   degree of network compression on the out-of-plane Poisson's ratio. The
   simulation results suggest that compression and anisotropy are the
   critical parameters that give rise to auxetic behaviour in these
   materials. We comment on the use of this model to inform the design of
   fibrous auxetic materials across different length scales, and on the
   feasibility of developing auxetic composites by using auxetic fibrous
   networks as the reinforcing phase. Preliminary experimental results
   indicate that this approach is a promising route in the pursuit of
   negative Poisson's ratio composites. (C) 2009 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \&

Abstract = {{Cellular materials' two important properties-structure and mechanism-can
   be selectively used for materials design; in particular, they are used
   to determine the modulus and yield strain. The objective of this study
   is to gain a better understanding of these two properties and to explore
   the synthesis of compliant cellular materials (CCMs) with compliant
   porous structures (CPSs) generated from modified hexagonal honeycombs.
   An in-plane constitutive CCM model with CPSs of elliptical holes is
   constructed using the strain energy method, which uses the deformation
   of hinges around holes and the rotation of links. A finite element (FE)
   based simulation is conducted to validate the analytical model. The
   moduli and yield strains of the CCMs with an aluminum alloy are about
   4.42 GPa and 0.57\% in one direction and about 2.14 MPa and 20.9\% in
   the other direction. CCMs have extremely high positive and negative
   Poisson's ratios (NPRs) (nu(xy){*} similar to +/- 40) due to the large
   rotation of the link member in the transverse direction caused by an
   input displacement in the longitudinal direction. A parametric study of
   CCMs with varying flexure hinge geometries using different porous shapes
   shows that the hinge shape can control the yield strength and strain but
   does not affect Poisson's ratio which is mainly influenced by rotation
   of the link members. The synthesized CPSs can also be used to design a
   new CCM with a Poisson's ratio of zero using a puzzle-piece CPS
   assembly. This paper demonstrates that compliant mesostructures can be
   used for next generation materials design in tailoring mechanical
   properties such as moduli, strength, strain, and Poisson's ratios.}},

Abstract = {{Negative Poisson's ratio (NPR), also known as ``auxetic{''}, is a highly
   desired property in a wide range of future industry applications. By
   employing molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, metal matrix

   In the simulation, single crystal copper with crystal orientation {[}1 1

   is used to describe the interaction of copper atoms. An aligned graphene
   sheet is selected as reinforcement, and a hybrid potential, namely, the
   Erhart-Albe potential, is used for the interaction between a pair of
   carbon atoms. The interaction between the carbon atom and copper atom is
   approximated by the Lennard-Jones (L-J) potential. The simulation
   results showed that both graphene and copper matrix possess in-plane

Abstract = {{This work presents a novel negative Poisson's ratio honeycomb design
   composed by two parts (a reentrant hexagonal component and a thin plate
   part) that provide separate contributions to the in plane and

   in-plane negative Poisson's ratio, the in-plane compliance and the
   out-of-plane compressive strength, while the thin plate part connecting
   the re-entrant hexagonal section bears the large out-of-plane
   flexibility. This ``paper focuses on the in-plane mechanical properties
   of the auxetic cellular structure. Theoretical models related to the
   in-plane uniaxial tensile modulus, the shear modulus, and the Poisson's
   ratios have been built and validated using the finite element
   techniques. The in-plane behavior of the honeycomb has also been
   investigated against the geometrical parameters of the unit cell using a
   parametrical analysis. The theoretical and numerical models illustrate
   good agreement and show the potential of its application in morphing
   structures. We also provide a benchmark of the auxetic configuration

   spiral wire structure}},
Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{New kinds of entangled materials with an auxetic effect were
   investigated in terms of fabrication, structural characterization, the
   measurement of their negative Poisson's ratio and the auxetic mechanism.
   The maximum negative Poisson's ratio of -1.5 was obtained at about 5\%
   of the engineering strain for the entangled materials with 45\%
   porosity. The auxetic behavior originated from the rotation of the
   `slanted coil-springs' structure. A model to formulate the negative
   Poisson's ratio was proposed based on the slanted coil-spring structure.
   The initial slanted angle affected the auxetic behavior significantly.
   As the slanted angle decreased, the negative Poisson's ratio increased.
   Entangled materials with such an auxetic effect have potential for
   engineering applications.}},

Title = {{Unusual anisotropic thermal expansion in multilayer SnSe leads to
   positive-to-negative crossover of Poisson's ratio}},
Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{116}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{FEB 24}},
Abstract = {{Monolayer SnSe has been predicted to exhibit an unusual anisotropic
   thermal expansion-when heated, the long lattice parameter contracts,
   while the short one expands, resulting in a
   rectangular-to-square-lattice phase transformation at a critical
   temperature (T-c). Here, we employ density-functional-theory
   calculations to demonstrate an even more notable thermal-expansion
   behavior of SnSe from monolayer to bulk. We find that the unusual
   thermal expansion persists in multilayers, while the coefficients of
   thermal expansion of different numbers of layers are almost identical.
   This behavior results from a delicate interplay between the elastic
   stiffness coefficient and Gruneisen parameters. Finally, we find that
   the Poisson's ratio of multilayer SnSe, which is positive at T=0 K, gets
   smaller with increasing temperature and even turns negative, signaling a
   zero Poisson's ratio at a particular temperature. Overall, the present
   results provide another perspective in understanding the unusual thermal
   properties of monochalcogenides.}},

Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{262}},

Abstract = {{The negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) structures exhibit some unusual but
   highly useful mechanical properties. In comparison to two-dimensional
   (2D) NPR structures, less attention has been paid to the studies on
   threedimensional structures due to the complex manufacturing process. In
   this paper, based on the twodimensional nonconvex hexagonal cell, a
   novel three-dimensional (3D) NPR energy-absorbing structure is proposed.
   According to the beam theory, the equivalent Young's modulus and
   Poisson's ratio are deduced. Subsequently, numerous finite element (FE)
   simulations and compression tests were performed and a good agreement
   was observed among the theoretical results, the numerical simulations,
   and the experimental results. Moreover, a typical fuselage section of
   aircraft during a crash landing was considered and the fuselage section
   with the 3D NPR structure presented in this work showed better energy
   absorption capacity than the one without the 3D NPR structure.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic means that the material or structure possesses negative
   Poisson's ratio. Auxetic materials own many fascinating properties due
   to the negative Poisson's ratio character, such as increased shear
   modulus, indentation resistance, fracture toughness, energy absorption,
   porosity/permeability variation with strain, synclastic curvature and so
   on. Recent years, 3D non-random auxetic cellular structures have
   attracted considerable interest and become a focus of auxetic material
   research. Though, due to the complexity of their configuration, to our
   knowledge, most 3D ordered auxetic cellular structures can only be
   manufactured by additive manufacturing method. However, additive
   manufacturing method will introduce some defects to the structures such
   as rough surface, irregular cross sections, and defects caused by stair
   stepping effect. Additionally, mass production and cost are also
   problems for additive manufacturing method, and the materials can be
   used are also limited by the additive manufacturing equipment.
   In this paper, a novel manufacturing method of one type of 3D auxetic
   structure will be briefly introduced. For this method, the structure was
   divided into 2D parts which can be easily manufactured by traditional
   fabricating methods with high-accuracy. The present manufacturing method
   will overcome the shortcomings introduced by additive manufacturing
   methods; in other words, the quality of the structures will be improved
   compared with additive manufacturing methods. At the same time, it will
   expand the range of materials that can be used to manufacture 3D auxetic
   structures. Additionally, this manufacturing method has the potential
   for mass production and automatic manufacturing while keeps the
   manufacturing costs at low level. Also, numerical simulation was
   conducted to simulate the structure's Poisson's ratio, and the negative
   Poisson's ratio character was successfully demonstrated.}},

   absolute value of the structure's Poisson's ratio decreased rapidly at
   first with an increasing compression strain epsilon(y) and then more
   slowly as it approached a constant of approximately 1 when epsilon(y) >
   0.1. A maximum absolute value of the Poisson's ratio of approximately 12

Abstract = {{Elastic longitudinal tension of thin two-layered plate composed of
   materials having positive and negative Poisson's ratios (auxetics and
   nonauxetics) is considered. Isotropic materials and crystals with cubic
   fourfold symmetry axis coinciding with the direction of tension are
   analyzed. The analytical dependences for effective Poisson's ratios of
   the plates on the ratio of layer thicknesses, Poisson's ratios and
   Young's moduli ratios of initial joined materials are derived. It was
   found that effective Poisson's ratio do not follow the rule of mixtures.
   Violation is particularly essential for the strong initial isotropic
   auxetics and incompressible isotropic nonauxetics. Derivation of general
   formulas for effective Poisson's ratios and effective Young's modulus of
   two -layered plates from cubic crystals is given. The derived formula
   for effective Young's modulus in the limit of initial isotropic
   materials coincides with formulas obtained previously in the literature.
   We show several examples of cubic crystals, auxetics-nonauxetics such
   that effective Poisson's ratios of two-layered plates may substantially
   exceed Poisson's ratios of the initial crystals. Effective Young's
   modulus may also exceed Young's moduli of both initial crystals. (C)

Abstract = {{Cellular materials have two important properties: structures and
   mechanisms. This property enables one to design structures with proper
   stiffness and flexibility. Recent advance in 3D printing technologies
   enable engineers to manufacture complex cellular structures. In
   addition, use of smart materials, e.g., shape memory polymers (SMPs),
   for 3D printing enables us to construct mesostructures actively
   responsive to environmental stimuli with a programmable function, which
   may be termed `4D Printing' referring to additional dimension on
   time-dependent shape change after 3D printing. The objective of this
   study is to design and synthesize active reconfigurable cellular
   materials, which enables the advance of technology on intelligent
   reconfigurable cellular structures with 4D printing. A two layer hinge
   of a CPS functions through a programmed thermal expansion mismatch
   between two layers and shape memory effect of an SMP. Starting with
   thermo-mechanical constitutive modeling of a compliant porous hinge
   consisting of laminated elastomer composites, macroscopic behaviors of a
   reconfigurable compliant porous structure (CPS) will be constructed
   using the strain energy method. A finite element (FE) based simulation
   equipped with a user subroutine will be implemented with ABAQUS/Standard
   to simulate time dependent thermo mechanical behaviors of a CPS.
   The designed CPS with polymers shows an extremely high negative
   Poisson's ratio-120) and negative thermal expansion coefficient (-2,530
   x 10(-6)/C). When programmed with an appropriate thermo-mechanical
   procedure, the hinge of the CPS bends either in positive and negative
   sign, which enables to tailor the CPS into desired intermediate and
   final configurations, ending up with achieving a reconfigurable CPS.
   This paper demonstrates that actively reconfigurable compliant cellular
   materials (CCMs) with CPSes can be used for next-generation materials
   design in terms of tailoring mechanical properties such as modulus,
   strength, yield strain, Poisson's ratios and thermal expansion
   coefficient together with programmable characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{Elastomer-matrix composites show promise for high Poisson's ratio and
   negative Poisson's ratio (auxetic) applications due to high orthotropy.
   There are approximately five orders of magnitude between the axial
   stiffness of high modulus graphite fibres and the stiffness of low
   durometer elastomers. Although the maximum Poisson's ratio for isotropic
   elastomers is 0.5, it is easily shown that inplane Poisson's ratios
   twice unity can be obtained with a graphite/epoxy angle-ply laminate at
   25 degrees. Chou and others have predicted inplane Poisson's ratios
   greater than 7 for certain cord-rubber combinations. Peel previously
   predicted inplane Poisson's ratios higher than 32 and less than -60.
   Preliminary experimental results have produced inplane Poisson's ratios
   as high as 14. Certain combinations of un-balanced highly orthotropic
   laminates may also produce inplane negative Poisson's ratios. Inplane
   Poisson's ratios, experimentally obtained from two laminate
   configurations with approximately the same axial stiffness are compared.
   A symmetric, balanced laminate produced an inplane Poisson's ratio of
   3.7; while an unbalanced laminate with an equivalent axial stiffness
   produced an average inplane Poisson's ratio of - 1.5. Certain high and
   negative Poisson's ratio elastomer-matrix laminates appear to have quasi
   anti-symmetric relationships about 0 degrees, although laminate
   designers may consider dual angle-ply laminates to be the more likely
   counterpart to the unbalanced dual angle auxetic laminates. Unbalanced
   symmetric laminates experience significantly more inplane shear
   deformation when axially loaded than their balanced counterparts. The
   high shear may be desirable for damping applications, but less desirable
   otherwise. (C) 2007 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA, Weinheim.}},

Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Based on a 2D cross chiral structure, two novel 3D cross chiral
   structures (structure-1 and structure-2) with negative Poisson's ratios
   were proposed in this paper. Structure-1 could be evolved into
   structure-2 by adding a star structure. Analytical models of the two
   auxetic cellular structures were established based on the Timoshenko
   beam theory. The Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of the cellular
   structures were obtained in all principal directions, which were
   verified by finite element method (FEM). Structure-1 exhibits
   anisotropic auxetic behavior while structure-2 shows uniform auxetic
   behavior in all three principal directions with all on-axis Poisson's
   ratios closer to the limit of-1. Additionally, the extra addition of
   star structure can enhance the Young's modulus of structure-2
   significantly in the case of same relative density, compared to
   structure-1. Moreover, the effect of parameter variation on elastic
   properties of two structures and the comparison with other classical 3D
   auxetic structures were also thoroughly studied and discussed in detail.
   These results are expected to eventually contribute to the advance of
   research and the application of new 3D auxetic structures in the future.

   auxetic at non-ambient conditions, in particular at positive external

   valence shell electron pair repulsion of isostructures. Combining with
   previous research, we provide a self-consistent explanation of the

Abstract = {{Comparing with traditional honeycomb structures, Negative Poisson's
   Ratio (NPR) structures had better mechanical performances in some
   certain respects, especially the shear modulus and fracture toughness.
   However, few publications focused on the cylinder-shape NPR structure,
   which influence the diversity and possibility of NPR structure
   applications. In this paper, a cylindrical NPR structure was introduced
   and applied as a suspension jounce bumper in order to solve the issue
   that the ideal uniaxial compression load-displacement curve sometimes
   cannot be realized by traditional Polyurethane (PU) jounce bumper. The
   load-displacement curve of NPR jounce bumper was proved to be smoother
   and more ideal than that of traditional jounce bumper. Nevertheless, the
   influences of NPR jounce bumper on the suspension mechanical performance
   and vehicle ride comfort were not comprehended yet. In this study, the
   traditional and NPR jounce bumpers were both assembled into virtual
   prototypes of Macpherson, double wishbone and multi-link suspensions to
   conduct single wheel travel virtual tests. The results indicated that
   NPR jounce bumper can achieve more ideal wheel force vs. jounce height
   curve without adjusting free travel, which is beneficial to spare
   precise suspension space. Furthermore, a jounce bumper evaluation method
   using pulse ride comfort was proposed in this paper. The virtual ride
   comfort tests of travelling through bump and pothole were conducted
   using established vehicle virtual prototype. The maximum vertical
   accelerations and weighted root mean square (RMS) of acceleration of
   vehicle centroid at most speeds were reduced applying NPR jounce bumper.
   Thus, the NPR jounce bumper can apparently improve vehicle ride comfort.}},

Abstract = {{With the aim of understanding anisotropic crystals that possess a
   negative Poisson's ratio and to lay a foundation for investigating
   molecular mechanisms, we discuss the definition of the ratio and
   establish conditions on the compliance that govern its sign. We derive
   results on orientation averaging that are useful in the context of
   anisotropy and helpful in the investigation of isotropic polycrystals.
   We discuss alpha-cristobalite, a polymorph of silicon dioxide that
   possesses interesting negative ratio properties in single crystals and
   hypothetical polycrystals. In this connection, we draw attention to the
   transverse compliance as an alternative and simpler metric for gaging
   the ratio and for orientation averaging. For alpha-cristobalite, we
   arrive at new results for the directions that yield the most negative
   Poisson's ratio. This result should be of value in divining the
   underlying molecular mechanism that explains the negative values of
   Poisson's ratio in alpha-cristobalite, a crystal of tetragonal symmetry
   that possesses six independent elastic constants. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Shape memory polymers, as a kind of smart materials, play an important
   role in more and more fields, such as aerospace, biomedicine and
   intelligent clothing field and so on. Comparing with traditional
   materials, negative Poisson's ratio foam has excellent mechanical
   properties, such as double curvature, light weight, high shear
   resistance, auxetic etc., and it has a great potential application in
   the field of aerospace. Therefore, in this project, shape memory
   composite foam was fabricated based on the commercial soft polyurethane
   foam material as matrix and shape memory epoxy resin as functional
   phase. Negative Poisson's ratio of foam was fabricated based on its
   shape memory feature through a process of triaxial compression with heat
   treatment. Microstructure deformation was characterized after the
   transformation of auxetic foam. By adjusting the processing parameters,
   the auxetic shape memory foam with different ``re-entrant{''} structure
   was obtained. Such fabricated shape memory composite foams display
   variable stiffness with auxetic behavior. Effective compressive and
   tensile modulus was obtained by compression and tension tests. The
   effect of processing parameters on foam Poisson's ratio was analyzed,
   which provided certain guiding significance for the further shape memory

Abstract = {{A two-dimensional (2D) open cell topology with eight-sided star
   perforations is proposed. Its mechanical properties (including Poisson's
   ratio and energy absorption capacity) and deformation behaviors are
   studied using finite element method (FEM) as a function of the geometric
   parameters. Simulation results showed that the Poisson's ratio of the
   structure is tunable from positive to negative by varying the geometric
   parameters that define the shape of the perforation. A minimum Poisson's
   ratio of -0.68 is achieved when the geometric parameter , which
   determines the inner corner sharpness of the star perforation, is equal
   to 0.1. The highest energy absorption capacity is observed in the model
   which exhibits the minimum Poisson's ratio. The star perforation cells
   shrink when the lattice structure is being compressed due to the
   negative Poisson's ratio effect. Compressive samples are fabricated by
   3D printing from Tango Black Plus, and their Poisson's ratios are
   measured and compared with numerical results. Excellent agreement is
   found between measurements and simulation.}},

Abstract = {{Materials with a negative Poisson's ratio known also as auxetic
   materials {[}1] exhibit unusual property of getting thicker when
   stretched and thinner when compressed. The helical auxetic yarn (HAY) is
   a recently invented auxetic reinforcing structure for composites {[}2].
   A helical auxetic yarn (HAY) consists of two fibres: a low modulus
   elastomeric core and a high modulus wrap fibre in a double helix
   structure. When a tensile load is applied the core of the HAY becomes
   wider as the wrap straightens out, resulting in a lateral expansion of
   the core, and therefore a large negative Poisson' ratio behaviour. The
   auxetic behaviour of the HAY can be tailored by altering fibre
   properties, the initial geometry and also the applied strain to comply
   with specific applications, such as composites {[}3, 4], blast
   mitigation, and filtration {[}5]. This paper introduces a further
   development to the current HAY by addition of a third component (a
   sheath). The presence of the sheath is expected to overcome problems
   such as slippage of the wrap and inconsistency in the initial wrap angle
   previously encountered during the manufacture of the HAY. The auxetic
   performance of conventional and novel systems is investigated and
   Poisson's ratio data are presented.}},

   Directions}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Materials with an abnormal Poisson's ratio, including those with
   negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) and zero Poisson's ratio (ZPR), are an
   important category of mechanical metamaterials, among which many exhibit
   NPR in all three directions. However, few of them, especially the 3D
   materials, exhibit ZPR in partial directions and NPR in other
   directions. Herein, a novel 3D structure developed by orthogonal
   splicing the 2D parallelogram honeycomb structure is proposed. Different
   from the 2D parallelogram honeycomb with ZPR, the spliced 3D
   parallelogram structure can exhibit not only ZPR but also NPR in
   different directions. The analytical model of the structure is
   established based on the classical beam theory, the equivalent
   analytical formulas of Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio are given,
   and finite element simulation and experiments are used for verification.
   The relationships between Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of the
   structure, as well as its geometric parameters and material parameters,
   are analyzed using analytical formulas and numerical simulation. The
   results reveal that the structure is transversely isotropic and can
   achieve NPR on the transverse symmetry plane and ZPR outside the plane.
   This unique property may accord this structure with important
   applications in aerospace, biomedical, and other fields.}},

Abstract = {{An investigation into the Poisson's ratio and elastic modulus of African

   out. Quasi-static compressive tests were conducted at moisture levels of
   8, 11.2, 14, 17.4 and 28.7\% (d.b.) in an axial loading orientation.
   Both unit lateral extension and unit normal compression values were
   determined. Average values of 0.512 to 0.275 were obtained for moisture
   levels of 8 to 28.7\%, respectively. Effects of loading rates were also
   investigated and results show that Poisson's ratio increased from 0.136
   to 0.334 at loading rates of 1 and 7 mm min(-1), respectively. Elastic
   modulus was observed to decrease as moisture increased. Average values
   of 201.5 to 41.30 N mm(-2) were noted for moisture levels of 8 to
   28.7\%, respectively. A similar negative trend was observed with loading

Abstract = {{Thermal expansion and stress of solid materials can significantly affect
   structural safety and instrument accuracy in many engineering fields. An
   alternative way to overcome these drawbacks is to use materials with
   controllable coefficients of thermal expansion (CTEs). This work
   presents a new three-dimensional (3D) material with controllable CTEs
   that is composed of chiral honeycomb layers connected by a set of
   inclined struts. Although each single chiral layer has positive CTEs, by
   carefully designing geometric parameters and material constituents, the
   negative thermal expansion (NTE) can be established. Analytical
   solutions of the equivalent CTEs are proposed using the classical beam
   theory, which were verified by finite element simulations. The results
   show that the proposed material can achieve a large range of CTEs (from
   positive to negative), and has negative Poisson's ratios in the chiral
   honeycomb planes. In addition, isotropic negative and zero thermal
   expansion can be obtained with appropriate design parameters.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials are a type of novel materials exhibiting negative
   Poisson's ratio (NPR) with potentials for special applications. Herein,
   the aim is to optimize the auxetic yarn and fabric manufacturing
   processes, establish the understanding of the influence of yarn and
   fabric parameters on the auxeticity of the engineered materials and
   explore the potential applications of auxetic textile materials. The
   auxetic yarns are manufactured based on a conversional helical structure
   composing initially a super elastic polyurethane core and a high modulus
   Nylon 6,6 binder. A hollow spindle machine is used to produce the
   auxetic yarn with optimized twisting and delivery speeds. Stable helical
   yarns with auxetic properties are manufactured using the optimized
   parameters, and woven fabrics are produced from the selected auxetic
   yarns in both warp and weft directions. Experiments show that the
   maximum NPR of helical auxetic yarns reaches a remarkable level of -5.6,
   and the auxetic fabrics display notable geometric changes compared with
   the nonauxetic fabrics with the same structural parameters. The
   auxeticity demonstrated in the fabrics implies applications in areas

Title = {{A systematic study on the predictability of different methods to predict
   the maximum Poisson's ratio of helical auxetic yarn}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE TEXTILE INSTITUTE}},
Abstract = {{Helical auxetic yarn is a structural material with negative Poisson's
   ratio which contains a soft yarn with a higher diameter as a core
   component and a stiff yarn with a lower diameter as wrap component that
   has been wrapped around the core component. In the present study, a
   semi-empirical model based on the improvement of a theoretical model and
   an artificial neural network model was developed for predicting the
   maximum negative Poisson's ratio of helical auxetic yarn. In order to
   verify the models, an experiment according to the initial helical angle
   of wrap component, the diameter ratio of components, and the modulus
   ratio of components has been designed. To measure the Poisson's ratio of
   helical auxetic yarn, an algorithm based on the image processing
   technique has been proposed. Unlike the results of previous studies, the
   experimental results showed that increasing the diameter ratio of
   components so much, will decrease the maximum negative Poisson's ratio
   of helical auxetic yarn due to higher bending stiffness of core
   component. The results of the comparison between the predicted and
   experimental values indicated that the artificial neural network model
   has a lower error than the semi-empirical model. It is expected that
   this work provides engineering tools to predict the auxetic behavior of
   helical auxetic yarn based on the required precision.}},

   Poisson's ratio structure and dielectric elastomer}},
Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Dielectric elastomer is one of the most concerned type of electroactive
   polymer. When a membrane of dielectric elastomer is subject to a voltage
   on both sides, the membrane reduces thickness and expands area, and vice
   versa. Due to this unique behavior, dielectric elastomer can be applied
   as active structure, actuator, sensor, energy harvesting component, etc.
   However, the mechanical performance of active structure is limited by
   the low Young's modulus of dielectric elastomer. Inspired by the human's
   bone-muscle system, a novel active structure that applying dielectric
   elastomer on the double-V type Negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) structure
   was proposed in this paper. When voltage and load vary, mechanical
   performance and dimensions of proposed Electroactive NPR (ENPR)
   structure change. The electro-mechanical model of ENPR structure was
   established from the perspective of Helmholtz free energy. And the
   theoretical model was verified by the experiment of an ENPR structure
   prototype. Furthermore, the influences of dimensions of dielectric
   elastomer and structural parameters on the electro-mechanical
   performance were researched. The results indicated that all variables
   influenced the stiffness of ENPR structure. Width L-2, number of cells
   n(x) and number of layers n(y) had limited effects on the electroactive
   response, but tuning of others variables which can improve stiffness
   will weaken the electroactive response. Through periodic replication of
   ENPR cells, the electro-mechanical property can be superimposed to
   satisfy higher bearing requirements and larger size demands. ENPR
   structure can realize integration, electronization, informatization and
   intellectualization of elastic component, sensor, actuator, and energy
   harvesting system theoretically, which is significant and can be
   expected to be widely applied on mechanical systems.}},

Volume = {{204}},
Pages = {{438-444}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic materials expand/contract transversely while
   tensioned/compressed in the longitudinal direction, thus they possess a
   negative Poisson's ratio. According to the theory of elasticity, their
   existence in isotropic forms is theoretically possible, however, they
   are found in nature only in anisotropic forms. Auxetics are expected to
   possess enhanced relative static and dynamic properties, thus, several
   auxetic composites have been proposed and manufactured to mimic such
   behavior. This study shows the development of axisymmetric auxetics, a
   novel class of negative Poisson's ratio composites obtained by the
   revolution of reentrant lattices in turn of an axis. It is shown by
   experimental testing and FEA that an auxetic circumferential deformation
   mechanism increases the overall Poisson's ratio and promotes an
   elevation of the Specific Young's modulus relative to regular
   honeycombs. Furthermore, the developed composites are compared in terms
   of Specific Young's modulus and densities to commercial foams and other
   non-stochastic auxetics. It is concluded that they present enhanced
   specific properties for relative densities in the range of 0.28-0.35 and
   may be a promising route for future applications.}},

Title = {{Woven Fabrics Made of Auxetic Plied Yarns}},
Journal = {{POLYMERS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic plied yarns are specially constructed with two types of single
   yarns of different sizes and moduli. This paper investigates how to use
   these types of yarns to produce woven fabrics with auxetic effects.
   Four-ply auxetic yarns were first incorporated into a series of woven
   fabrics with different design parameters to study their auxetic behavior
   and percent open area during extension. Effects of auxetic plied yarn
   arrangement, single component yarn properties, weft yarn type, and weave
   structure were then evaluated. Additional double helical yarn (DHY) and
   6-ply auxetic yarn woven fabrics were also made for comparison. The
   results show that the alternative arrangement of S- and Z-twisted 4-ply
   auxetic yarns in a woven fabric can generate a higher negative Poisson's
   ratio (NPR) of the fabric. While the higher single stiff yarn modulus of
   auxetic yarn can result in greater NPR behavior, finer soft auxetic yarn
   does not necessarily generate such an effect. Weft yarns with low
   modulus and short float over the 4-ply auxetic yarns in fabric structure
   are favorable for producing high NPR behavior. The weft cover factor

Abstract = {{Analytical investigations on the contact problems between two
   homogeneous and isotropic soft bodies were performed to simulate the
   contact of human buttocks and seat cushions. The cushion materials'
   Poisson's ratio were allowed to be negative. The human buttocks were
   modeled as an ideal sphere with radius 15 cm, and assumed to have a low
   Young's modulus and a Poisson's ratio close to 0.5. These parameters
   were held constant during our analysis. Peak contact pressure was
   reduced by adjusting the contour curvature of cushions according to
   Hertz theory, as expected. Moreover, analysis by both the Hertz model
   and a finite thickness 3D elasticity model showed that using negative
   Poisson's ratio cushions could further reduce the pressure. Negative
   Poisson's ratio cushions may be beneficial in the prevention of pressure
   sores or ulcers in the sick and in reduction of pressure-induced
   discomfort in seated people. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of a porous polymeric construct
   (scaffold) quantitatively describe how it supports and transmits
   external stresses to its surroundings. While Young's modulus is always
   non-negative and highly tunable in magnitude, Poisson's ratio can,
   indeed, take on negative values despite the fact that it is non-negative
   for virtually every naturally occurring and artificial material. In some
   applications, a construct having a tunable negative Poisson's ratio (an
   auxetic construct) may be more suitable for supporting the external
   forces imposed upon it by its environment. Here, three-dimensional
   polyethylene glycol scaffolds with tunable negative Poisson's ratios are
   fabricated. Digital micromirror device projection printing (DMD-PP) is
   used to print single-layer constructs composed of cellular structures
   (pores) with special geometries, arrangements, and deformation
   mechanisms. The presence of the unit-cellular structures tunes the
   magnitude and polarity (positive or negative) of Poisson's ratio.
   Multilayer constructs are fabricated with DMD-PP by stacking the
   single-layer constructs with alternating layers of vertical connecting
   posts. The Poisson's ratios of the single- and multilayer constructs are
   determined from strain experiments, which show (1) that the Poisson's
   ratios of the constructs are accurately predicted by analytical
   deformation models and (2) that no slipping occurrs between layers in
   the multilayer constructs and the addition of new layers does not affect
   Poisson's ratio.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports a theoretical analysis of deformation behavior of an

   theoretically calculated and compared with the experimental results.
   Based on the validation of the theoretical analysis, the effects of
   different structural parameters and yarn modulus on the negative
   Poisson's ratio behavior of the structure were finally predicted and
   discussed. The results obtained from the analysis would be very useful
   for the optimization of the negative Poisson's ratio behavior of 3D

Journal = {{MECHANICS OF MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{154}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The extreme values of Young's modulus for sixand seven-constant
   tetragonal crystals are found using the necessary and sufficient
   conditions for the extrema of the functions of two variables.
   Theoretical and numerical analyzes of stationary and extreme values are
   performed based on experimental data on elastic constants collected in
   the Landolt-Bornstein reference book. Five such Young's moduli are
   formed in the case of six constant and seven-constant tetragonal
   crystals. It is found how the stationary and extremal values of Young's
   modulus depend on three anisotropy coefficients that disappear in the
   limit of an isotropic material. Simple analytical dependences of some
   stationary and extreme values of Young's moduli of six-constant crystals
   are obtained. In the case of stationary values of Young's modulus of
   seven-constant tetragonal crystals, the coefficients included in the
   sufficient conditions for the extremum of the function of two variables
   are estimated numerically. Tetragonal crystals (Hg2I2, Hg2Br2, Hg2Cl2,
   TeO2, (NH2)(2)CO, LiY0.5Tb0.5F4 and C(CH2OH)(4)) with a large difference
   between the maximum and minimum values of Young's modulus are revealed.
   It is shown that six-constant tetragonal crystals may have a greater
   difference between global extrema than seven-constant tetragonal
   crystals. It is found that six-constant tetragonal crystals with a large
   difference between the global extrema of Young's modulus have a negative
   Poisson's ratio. In the case of seven-constant tetragonal crystals, such
   relationship has not been identified. A classification scheme based on
   the dependence of three stationary values of Young's modulus on two
   dimensionless parameters is proposed.}},

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},

Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The Poisson's ratio is a fundamental measure of the elastic-deformation
   behaviour of materials. Although negative Poisson's ratios are
   theoretically possible, they were believed to be rare in nature. In
   particular, while some studies have focused on finding or producing
   materials with a negative Poisson's ratio in bulk form, there has been
   no such study for nanoscale materials. Here we provide numerical and
   theoretical evidence that negative Poisson's ratios are found in several
   nanoscale metal plates under finite strains. Furthermore, under the same
   conditions of crystal orientation and loading direction, materials with
   a positive Poisson's ratio in bulk form can display a negative Poisson's
   ratio when the material's thickness approaches the nanometer scale. We
   show that this behaviour originates from a unique surface effect that
   induces a finite compressive stress inside the nanoplates, and from a
   phase transformation that causes the Poisson's ratio to depend strongly
   on the amount of stretch.}},

Title = {{Stable two-dimensional pentagonal tellurene: A high ZT thermoelectric
   material with a negative Poisson's ratio}},

Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{559}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{Motivated by the recent experimental exfoliation of tellurium thin film,
   and the amazing physical and chemical properties of various
   theoretically tellurene allotropes, we design a novel and stable
   pentagonal structure of tellurene (SP-type Te), and make a detailed
   comparison with other possible Te allotropes, related to their
   mechanical, electronic and thermoelectric properties. SP-type Te shows
   the higher expandability than other Te allotropes, due to its lower
   layer modulus and Young's modulus. More interestingly its Poisson's
   ratio along x (y) direction is unusually negative (similar to -0.01)
   which can be further decreased by applying coaxial strain. Three-layers
   SP-type Te can turn into a topological insulator (TI) with a nontrivial
   band gap similar to 0.03 eV when uniaxial compressional strain sigma(x)
   = 7\%. Moreover the higher the number of layers in SP-type Te, the lower
   sx inducing its topological transition requires. At room temperature,
   lattice thermal conductivity k(L) of SP-type Te is the lowest in all Te
   allotropes, and meanwhile its peak ZT for n-type doping even can reach
   up to 2.84. Thus if SP-type Te can be synthesized in future, these
   extraordinary properties would promote it with great potential in
   designing low-dimensional mechanical, spintronic and thermoelectric
   devices.}},

   The calculations of the analytical formulae can be well consistent with

   show that the honeycomb material proposed in this paper is isotropic at
   the macroscopic scale and its Poisson's ratio is close to -1, which

Abstract = {{Elastic properties of multilayers with low period thickness show in some
   cases anomalies which are generally correlated with structural
   modifications in individual layers. In the recent past, several studies
   have evidenced using X-ray diffraction in-plane and out-of-plane strains
   with the same sign. Some authors have then proposed in the case of W/Ni
   and Nb/Cu metallic superlattices to use a negative Poisson's ratio. This
   result is surprising because the value of this coefficient in metals is
   generally positive. In this article. we introduce a novel interpretation
   mainly based on the experimental determination by sin(2) Psi method of
   the reference parameter (stress-free lattice parameter) used in strain
   calculations. Then, we show that the introduction of the bulk parameter
   instead of stress-free parameter for the reference parameter is an
   unrealistic assumption in the case of thin films and multilayers (W and
   Ag/Ni) and may thus lead to wrong results which are then in total
   disagreement with those obtained by other techniques. Therefore, the
   elastic anomaly concerning Poisson's ratio which has been reported by
   some authors in scientific literature do not result from real structure
   of multilayers but from experimental X-ray; diffraction data analysis.}},

Title = {{Re-entrant auxetic lattices with enhanced stiffness: A numerical study}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{178}},
Month = {{JUL 15}},
Abstract = {{Traditional auxetic lattices are featured with negative Poisson's ratio
   but weak stiffness. In this work, a set of auxetic lattices with
   enhanced stiffness are proposed by adding a strengthening rib into
   conventional auxetic unit cells in a direction perpendicular to the
   re-entrant direction. The effective mechanical properties of these
   variants are calculated using the fast Fourier transform-based
   homogenization method, which show that their Young's modulus in 2D can
   be improved by approximately 200\% along the strengthening direction
   without significant sacrifice of auxetic property. However, such an
   enhancement is weakened in 3D as the variant of a tetrahedral cell has
   an approximate 100\% improvement of Young's modulus only at low relative
   density. Though the stiffness of a variant hexahedral cell can be
   doubled in 3D at a wide range of relative density, its Poisson's ratio
   remains negative only in a narrow range of relative density. The
   findings in this work will offer new opportunities for the applications
   of auxetic materials which not only need negative Poisson's ratio but
   also high stiffness.}},

Abstract = {{Poisson's ratio is defined as the negative of the ratio of the
   transverse strain to the longitudinal strain in response to a
   longitudinal uniaxial stress. In the presence of anisotropy, this means
   that the ratio depends on two directions. With a view to assessing
   crystals that exhibit directions for which the ratio is negative, we
   resort to a transverse average to eliminate one directional variable and
   at the same time to arrive at a measure that poses a challenge to
   achieving significant negative values. The areal Poisson ratio coincides
   with the Poisson ratio for an isotropic material. We determine the
   stationary directions of the areal Poisson ratio for all crystal
   symmetry classes. The directions represented by invariant stationary
   points-those that hold independently of the material-we identify and
   explain class-by-class in terms of the axes of symmetry for the class.
   It is shown that for cubic crystals, positive definiteness of the strain
   energy requires that the areal Poisson ratio lie between -1 and 1/2, as
   it does for isotropy. We conclude that the areal Poisson ratio for the
   classes of lower symmetry are not restricted.}},

   Poisson's ratio}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{201}},

Abstract = {{Chiral lattices are generally considered to possess auxetic properties
   with negative Poisson's ratios and high compressibility. However, the
   effects of anisotropy and handedness (chirality) on their mechanical
   properties, such as directional moduli, Poisson's ratio, and other
   coupling effects, are not clearly understood due to the lack of
   analytical methods to handle both anisotropy and chirality. Herein, we
   construct a generalized micropolar homogenization method to characterize
   the elastic constants of tetra-chiral and tetra-achiral lattices having
   different joint types. The developed method can identify the directional
   moduli and Poisson's ratio and coupling effects in the anisotropic wavy
   lattices. The generalized micropolar homogenization of the wavy square
   lattices reveals i) the axial-shear coupling effect of tetra-chiral
   structures, ii) the weak correlation of the chirality of tetra-chiral
   lattices to auxeticity, and iii) the directional positive and negative
   Poisson's ratio of tetra-achiral lattices. This work offers a powerful
   platform for metamaterials' design via geometric reconfiguration of
   lattice structures to adjust both anisotropy and chirality.

Abstract = {{Literature on the mechanical performance of additively manufactured (AM)
   negative Poisson's ratio (-nu) structures has been primarily focused on
   beam-based re-entrant structures with chevron crosslinks. The walled
   variants of this architecture have been shown to exhibit lateral
   instability. This is where a layered framework can be advantageous as
   they provide increased lateral stability. Much less is known regarding
   the behaviour of such architecture, let alone their thin/thick-walled
   variants. This study explores the influence of design parameters namely
   wall thickness (t) and angle (theta) on the mechanical performance of
   thin and thick-walled inherently stable -nu. lattices. The design is
   achieved through conceiving linearly arranged AlSi10Mg re-entrant
   unit-cells while discarding the traditional chevron crosslinks. The
   printed prototypes were experimentally tested and response surface (RS)
   models were generated to study the parametric influence on the elastic
   modulus (E), compressive strength (sigma(c)), failure strain
   (epsilon(f)), -nu and relative density (rho(r)). The results demonstrate
   that both thin- and thick-walled structures exhibit. of -0.108 to -0.257
   despite the interaction effects between t and theta. The elastic modulus
   can be increased by either increasing t or theta without considering the
   interaction effects at 0.3 <= t <= 1 mm and 45 degrees <= 0 <= 85
   degrees. This study presents a new understanding regarding the
   fabrication and performance of re-entrant structures by AM.}},

Abstract = {{Systems with a negative Poisson's ratio (auxetic) exhibit the unusual
   yet very useful property of getting wider rather than thinner when
   uniaxially stretched. A novel mechanism to generate auxetic behaviour at

   using readily available materials is proposed. FEA simulations are used
   to provide a proof of principle for this concept and an analytical model

   lattice structures filled with polymers}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITES PART B-ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{171}},
Pages = {{183-191}},
Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic lattice structures are prospective candidates in many
   engineering applications because of their unique negative Poisson's
   ratio effect as well as excellent mechanical properties. An aluminum
   based auxetic lattice structure reinforced by polymer fillers was
   fabricated through pressure infiltration technology, and the compressive
   mechanical properties of the resultant auxetic composites were then
   investigated through experimental tests combined with finite element
   analyses in the present study. The results show that the composites
   exhibit higher elastic modulus, compressive strength and energy
   absorption capacity compared with original aluminum based auxetic
   lattice structures. This enhancement is ascribed to intensified
   interaction between the struts and the polymer filler resulted from the
   special deformation mode of auxetic lattice structures. Furthermore, the
   deformation mechanism mode of the auxetic structures and corresponding
   auxetic composites were also discussed. It is therefore suggested that
   there will be pronounced enhancement in auxetic lattice structures if
   the negative Poisson's ratio effect is restrained.}},

Abstract = {{In this work we show that a structure consisting of a network of bending
   beams can exhibit a negative Poisson's ratio. We have shown that the
   negative Poisson's ratio behaviour is driven by the (bcc analogous) type
   Ill beams, the type II (fcc like) beams result in a structure with a
   Poisson's ratio of around zero and type I (simple cubic configuration)
   beams result in a Poisson's ratio of nearly +1. The tensile and shear
   strengths of the type III beams are augmented by addition of type II and
   type III beams. By tailoring the relative stiffness of the component
   beams within the structure it is possible to design an auxetic truss
   structure with specific Poisson's ratio, tensile and shear moduli.
   This validates the hypothesis that crystal structures can provide
   inspiration for macro structures with tailored mechanical properties
   where the mechanism for negative Poisson's ratio (auxetic) behaviour at
   the atomic scale in cubic crystals is replicated by bending beams. (C)

Journal = {{EXTREME MECHANICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{42}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{As we all know, compression in one direction will cause expansion in the
   orthogonal direction for conventional materials. Similarly, stretching
   in one direction will give rise to contraction in the vertical
   direction. It is hence possible to combine these two properties to
   obtain a novel mechanism to create 3D structures with negative Poisson's
   ratio (PR) in some directions and positive PR in other ones (partial
   auxetics). The latitude-and-longitude-inspired double-elliptic-ring
   structures (DERs) with tunable Poisson's ratio and Young's modulus are
   designed and studied in this work, which offers an effective way for
   achieving this mechanism. A 3D structure with negative Poisson's ratio
   in three directions is also obtained via arranging the DERs alternately.
   Meanwhile, theoretical results show that the magnitude of Poisson's
   ratio of DERs can reach -18.3. Experimental and simulation consequences
   indicate that the DERs can effectively reduce stress concentration and
   fracture possibility due to its smooth geometry. Another advantage of
   DERs is that it still has negative Poisson's ratio effect under large
   levels of compression. This work can provide a useful reference for the
   design of 3D auxetic metamaterials with excellent properties, which is
   promising in some structural and functional applications. (C) 2020

Abstract = {{Energy minimizations for unstretched and stretched cellulose models
   using an all-atom empirical force field (molecular mechanics) have been
   performed to investigate the mechanism for auxetic (negative Poisson's
   ratio) response in crystalline cellulose I-beta from kraft cooked Norway
   spruce. An initial investigation to identify an appropriate force field
   led to a study of the structure and elastic constants from models
   employing the CVFF force field. Negative values of on-axis Poisson's
   ratios nu (31) and nu (13) in the x (1)-x (3) plane containing the chain
   direction (x (3)) were realized in energy minimizations employing a
   stress perpendicular to the hydrogen-bonded cellobiose sheets to
   simulate swelling in this direction due to the kraft cooking process.
   Energy minimizations of structural evolution due to stretching along the
   x (3) chain direction of the `swollen' (kraft cooked) model identified
   chain rotation about the chain axis combined with inextensible secondary
   bonds as the most likely mechanism for auxetic response.}},

Abstract = {{The subject of thermal expansion, particularly negative thermal
   expansion, is a topic of great practical importance in view of its
   relevance in many everyday applications and the consequences which may
   arise when the thermal expansion if not controlled. This paper presents
   a detailed analytical model of a composite system, which enables control
   of the thermal expansion through the use of the thinning that is
   observed when a conventional material is mechanically stretched (the
   Poisson's effect). It is shown that the model can predict the thermal
   expansion of such systems to an extent comparable to more complex finite
   element simulations. The proposed model also permits optimization of the
   system to exhibit maximum negative thermal expansion, or, thermal
   expansion of a desired magnitude.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on a systematic isogeometric design approach for the
   optimal petal form and size characterization of tetra-petals auxetics,
   considering both plane stress and plane strain conditions. The
   underlying deformation mechanism of a tetra-petals auxetic is analyzed
   numerically with respect to several key parameters. Design optimizations
   are performed systematically to give bounding graphs for the minimum
   Poisson's ratio achievable with different stiffness constraints. Tunable
   design studies with targeted effective Poisson's ratio, shear modulus
   and stiffness are demonstrated. Potential application for functionally
   graded lattice structures is presented. Numerical and experimental
   verifications are provided to verify the designs. The out-of-plane
   buckling phenomenon in tension for thin auxetics with re-entrant
   features is illustrated experimentally to draw caution to results
   obtained using plane stress formulations for designing such structures.

Abstract = {{Poisson's ratio is a fundamental property of a material which reflects
   the transverse strain response to the applied axial strain. Negative
   Poisson's ratio is allowed theoretically, but is rare in nature. Besides
   the discovery and tailoring of bulk auxetic materials, recent studies
   have also found a negative Poisson's ratio in nanomaterials, while their
   negative Poisson's ratio is mainly based on conventional rigid
   mechanical models as bulk auxetic materials. In this work, we report the
   existence of in-plane negative Poisson's ratio in a two-dimensional
   convex structure of newly synthesized semi-fluorinated graphene by using
   first-principles calculations. In addition, the sign of the Poisson's
   ratio can be tuned by the applied strain. Interestingly, we find that
   this unconventional negative Poisson's ratio cannot be explained by
   conventional rigid mechanical models but originates from the enhanced
   bond angle strain over the bond strain due to chemical
   functionalization. This new mechanism of auxetics extends the scope of
   auxetic nanomaterials and can serve as design principles for future
   discovery and design of new auxetic materials.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials and microstructures are attracting the attention of a

   high mechanical performances, in both the static and dynamic regimes.
   The topological derivative is used in this contribution to determine

   The auxetic nature of the computed microstructures is demonstrated by
   both numerical and real experiments performed over samples fabricated by
   additive printing. The effective mechanical properties of these auxetic
   structures have been computed in the framework of couple stress
   elasticity, allowing to identify both in-plane and out-of plane
   effective properties. The calculated classical moduli are found
   independent of the size of the window of analysis and are consequently
   effective coefficients. In contrast to this, the calculated in-plane
   bending moduli show a clear dependency on the auxetic cell size, whereas

Abstract = {{This paper describes the manufacturing, characterization and parametric
   modeling of a novel fiber-reinforced composite flexible skin with
   in-plane negative Poisson's ratio (auxetic) behavior. The elastic
   mechanical performance of the auxetic skin is evaluated using a
   three-dimensional analytical model based on the classical laminate
   theory (CLT) and Sun's thick laminate theory. Good agreement is observed
   between in-plane Poisson's ratios and Young's moduli of the composite
   skin obtained by the theoretical model and the experimental results. A
   parametric analysis carried out with the validated model shows that
   significant changes in the in-plane negative Poisson's ratio can be
   achieved through different combinations of matrix and fiber materials
   and stacking sequences. It is also possible to identify fiber-reinforced
   composite skin configurations with the same in-plane auxeticity but
   different orthotropic stiffness performance, or the same orthotropic
   stiffness performance but different in-plane auxeticity. The analysis
   presented in this work provides useful guidelines to develop and
   manufacture flexible skins with negative Poisson's ratio for
   applications focused on morphing aircraft wing designs.}},

Journal = {{MECHANICS OF MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2021}},

Abstract = {{A new concept of 3D auxetic lattice structures with high stiffness is
   proposed in this paper. Correspondingly, a feasible method for rapidly
   fabricating the proposed structures with high-performance continuous
   carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composite is exploited.
   Theoretical models for predicting the homogenized elastic properties of
   the representative structure along all principal axes, including the
   Young's moduli, Poisson's ratios and shear moduli, are developed. Based
   on the models, directional dependence of structural homogenized elastic
   properties is investigated in detail. The compressive elastic behaviors
   of the 3D auxetic lattice structures fabricated with high-performance
   continuous carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composite are further
   investigated in a combination of numerical analysis and experiments. Our
   results suggest that the new concept of 3D auxetic lattice structures
   are very suitable for uniaxial loading and can be great candidates where
   excellent load bearing capacity and obvious negative Poisson's ratio
   effects are simultaneously desired. Coupled with the proposed efficient
   fabrication process, our efforts may help to promote the 3D auxetic
   lattice structures to be widely used in a variety of applications.}},

Journal = {{COMPOSITES COMMUNICATIONS}},

Volume = {{22}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{A novel 3-D structure is proposed by adding the reinforcing rods into
   the original 2-D star-shaped structure to obtain more obvious negative
   Poisson's ratio effect. The influence of length parameter, thickness
   parameter, angle parameters and material combination on the effective
   Poisson's ratio, effective Young's modulus and effective shear modulus
   of the novel 3-D structure is systematically investigated using
   cell-based finite element modeling. Additionally, the change rule of
   material combination sequence and length parameter of the structure's
   thermal expansion is also studied. The results show that the novel 3-D
   structure can achieve positive, zero and negative Poisson's ratio, as
   well as positive, zero and negative thermal expansion when appropriate
   material combination is adopted. Moreover, the negative Poisson's ratio
   effect of the novel 3-D structure is distinctly enhanced, and the
   effective Young's modulus is slightly increased through comparing with
   other two 3-D star shaped structures. By selecting material combinations
   and structural geometry parameters, metamaterials with special

   Poisson ratios under large stretching}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{151}},
Pages = {{314-321}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Recently, open cellular substrates instead of traditional solid
   substrates have been used in flexible electronics, catering to the need
   for high permeability of bio-fluids through the device. The Poisson
   ratio of the existing open cellular designs, however, remains positive,
   which is inappropriate for the cellular substrates mounting on some
   biological auxetic materials, as the resulting mismatch in deformation
   may cause irritation. In the current work, a type of triangular lattice
   networks is presented with satisfactory negative Poisson ratio effect
   over large strains. A finite deformation model is developed for the
   deformed angles, constitutive relation and maximum strain of the
   building block, with nonlinear finite element method (FEM) validations.
   Results demonstrate desired negative Poisson ratios and mechanical
   properties can be achieved in an isotropic manner by tailoring three
   geometric parameters (arc angle theta(0), length/radius ratio L/R and
   width/radius ratio w/R). Thereinto, longer arm lengths not only yield
   lower equivalent modulus and maximum strain, but also enable wider range
   of isotropic negative Poisson ratios (from -0.35 to 0) and applied
   strains (from 0\% to 80\%), providing more flexibility in network
   designs and new possibilities to emerging biomedical applications.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials, including textiles, exhibit a negative Poisson's
   ratio (NPR), which is of interest for many applications. This research
   aims to optimize the structural parameters of helical auxetic yarns
   (HAYs) and to evaluate the auxetic performance of these yarns. The
   research reports on the improvement of auxetic yarn quality and the yarn
   auxeticity through studying the effect of helical angles, diameter ratio
   and tensile moduli of the two plies, as well as the binder filament
   feeding. The maximum NPR of the optimized auxetic yarns was
   experimentally achieved as low as -9.6, with the helical angle of around
   14.0 degrees on average using the optimal machine setting. The optimized
   yarn parameters enabled the making of high-quality auxetic yarns with a
   wider range of machine settings than before. In parallel, theoretical
   and numerical studies were carried out for the engineering design of
   auxetic yarns, which enabled comparisons among the experimental results,
   calculated results and results from finite element analysis. The
   comparison showed that a lower initial helical angle, higher tensile
   modulus of the wrap ply and lower tensile modulus of the core ply led to
   a higher auxetic effect. A new finding is reported in that a concave
   relationship between the diameter ratio and the NPR was discovered. The
   results of this study could assist researchers in producing HAYs, and
   this type of HAY could be used for many potential applications, such as
   filtration and impact protection.}},

Abstract = {{The equilibrium Young's modulus of articular cartilage is known to be
   primarily determined by proteoglycans (PGs). However, the relation
   between the Poisson's ratio and the composition and structure of
   articular cartilage is more unclear. In this study, we determined
   Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of bovine articular cartilage in
   unconfined compression. Subsequently, the same samples, taken from
   bovine knee (femoral, patellar and tibial cartilage) and shoulder
   (humeral cartilage) joints, were processed for quantitative microscopic
   analysis of PGs, collagen content, and collagen architecture. The
   Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, PG content (estimated with optical
   density measurements), collagen content, and birefringence showed
   significant topographical variation (p < 0.05) among the test sites.
   Experimentally the Young's modulus was strongly determined by the tissue
   PG content (r = 0.86, p < 0.05). Poisson's ratio revealed a significant
   negative linear correlation (r = -0.59, p < 0.05) with the collagen
   content, as assessed by the Fourier transform infrared imaging. Finite
   element analyses, conducted using a fibril reinforced biphasic model,
   indicated that the mechanical properties of the collagen network
   strongly affected the Poisson's ratio. We conclude that Poisson's ratio
   of articular cartilage is primarily controlled by the content and
   organization of the collagen network. (c) 2006 Orthopaedic Research

Abstract = {{This paper reports a novel method to fabricate auxetic warp knitted
   fabrics on a tricot warp knitting machine based on a special structure
   design and knitting process. Three auxetic warp knitted structures were
   successfully developed and all of them were designed to form a reentrant
   hexagonal geometry to acquire an auxetic effect. To provide the fabrics
   with reentrant frames, elastomeric yarns and stiff yarns were used to
   form the elastic underlaps and stiff underlaps, respectively. While the
   elastic underlaps can keep the reentrant structures stable, the stiff
   underlaps can support the reentrant structures to keep their reentrant
   frames. To alleviate the transfer of yarns in the loops under tension,
   an additional front yarn guide bar was used to feed binding yarns to
   basic reentrant structures. After knitting, all the fabrics were
   subjected to a heat setting process to keep their shape and a tensile
   test to assess their auxetic behavior. The experimental results showed
   that all the fabrics exhibited an obvious auxetic behavior within a wide
   range of strain. In particular, the fabrics retained auxetic behavior
   until breaking when stretched in the wale direction, and the Poisson's
   ratio of the fabrics could be as low as -0.5. On the other hand, the
   fabrics exhibited a large tensile elongation when stretched in the
   course direction and their Poisson's ratios changed from negative to
   positive after the tensile strain exceeded a certain value.}},

Abstract = {{A 2D model for the deformation of auxetic microporous polymers (those
   with a negative Poisson's ratio) has been previously developed,
   consisting of a network of rigid rectangular nodules interconnected by
   fibrils. This model has now been extended to describe the deformation of
   the network via concurrent fibril hinging and stretching mechanisms.
   Expressions for the strain-dependent Poisson's ratios and Young's moduli
   are derived and fully investigated with respect to their dependence on
   the model parameters. These expressions are compared with the
   experimental strain-dependent data for auxetic microporous
   polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and ultra-high molecular weight
   polyethylene (UHMWPE). The use of concurrent deformation mechanisms
   makes a very significant improvement in the agreement of theory with
   experiment for both cases. Slight discrepancies are discussed in terms
   of the use of the assumptions of a 2D network of regular, rectangular
   nodules and a constant force coefficient ratio governing the two
   deformation mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{As a basic mechanical parameter, Poisson's ratio (nu) measures the
   mechanical responses of solids against external loads. In rare cases,
   materials have a negative Poisson's ratio (NPR), and present an
   interesting auxetic effect. That is, when a material is stretched in one
   direction, it will expand in the perpendicular direction. To design
   modern nanoscale electromechanical devices with special functions, two
   dimensional (2D) auxetic materials are highly desirable. In this work,
   based on first principles calculations, we rediscover the previously
   proposed delta-phosphorene (delta-P) nanosheets {[}Jie Guan, et al.,
   Phys. Rev. Lett., 2014, 113, 046804] which are good auxetic materials
   with a high NPR. The results show that the Young's modulus and Poisson's
   ratio of delta-P are all anisotropic. The NPR value along the grooved
   direction is up to -0.267, which is much higher than the recently
   reported 2D auxetic materials. The auxetic effect of delta-P originating
   from its puckered structure is robust and insensitive to the number of
   layers due to weak interlayer interactions. Moreover, delta-P possesses
   good flexibility because of its relatively small Young's modulus and
   high critical crack strain. If delta-P can be synthesized, these
   extraordinary properties would endow it with great potential in
   designing low dimensional electromechanical devices.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a metacomposite that shrinks regardless of
   temperature decrease or increase, i.e. it exhibits positive and negative
   thermal expansions with cooling and heating, respectively, which leads
   to auxetic behavior. This metacomposite is constructed from rigid rods
   and bimaterial strips; the ends of the rigid rods are connected in
   series by freely-rotating pin joints while neighboring chains of rigid
   rods are linked by bimaterial strips that are connected to the mid-spans
   of the rigid rods by fixed joints. Thermal deformation results indicate
   that the magnitude of the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of the
   metacomposite parallel to the rigid rod is about 3 times greater than
   that parallel to the bimaterial strips. Upon thermal deformation,
   prescription of stretching parallel to the chains of rigid rods indicate
   a Poisson's ratio that is approximately -1/3. Results also show that the
   effective in-plane CTE and Poisson's ratio are influenced by the CTE
   ratio of the bimaterial phases and aspect ratio of the bimaterial strip.
   The possibility of this auxetic metacomposite to achieve in situ
   signswitching of CTE avails greater design options to the materials

Abstract = {{Engineers have vested interested in auxetic materials because of their
   negative Poisson's ratio. These materials undergo perpendicular
   expansion under tension. Meanwhile, auxetic textiles that has both
   flexibility and negative Poisson's ratio have great potential in future
   functional materials. In this paper, different flexible re-entrant
   honeycomb structures are manufactured using 3D printing technology. The
   shape change processes were also investigated. The re-entrant honeycomb
   structures exhibits negative Poisson's ratio immediately when stretched.
   The shape change consists of three stages in X1-direction, the same as
   that in X2-direction. A noticeable discovery was that the shape change
   in the X1-direction posed an out-plane change after the first shape
   change stage, while the shape change in X2-direction always remained
   in-plane throughout the entire tension process. The Young's moduli were
   also tested and were consistent with the tendency of the previous works'

Abstract = {{Stretching 7-constant rhombohedral crystals is described in the theory
   of elasticity. Numerical analysis, based on the obtained analytical
   expressions for Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio, is showed that
   three of the eight 7-constant rhombohedral crystals are partial
   auxetics, i.e. they have a negative Poisson's ratio in some directions
   of stretching crystals. Minimum and maximum values of Poisson's ratio
   and Young's modulus, values of the average Poisson's ratio and the
   minimum and maximum values of Poisson's ratio for particular
   orientations were obtained. Auxetic surfaces corresponding to zero
   Poisson's ratio were plotted. Solution of problems of tension and
   torsion curvilinear anisotropic nano/microtubes from 7-constant
   rhombohedral crystals was considered under Saint-Venant's approach.
   Analytical expressions of Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio for these
   nano/microtubes were obtained. Numerical analysis allowed to find six of
   the eight auxetics among nano/microtubes. Values of Poisson's ratio for
   thin-walled nano/microtubes from 7-constant rhombohedral crystals, as
   well as critical values of thickness parameter at which the change in

   modulus slightly dependent on the thickness parameter of the tube. An
   analytical expression for the torsional stiffness of nano/microtubes

Title = {{Effect of Compressive Strain Rate on Auxetic Foam}},
Journal = {{APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic foams have previously been shown to have benefits including
   higher indentation resistance than their conventional counterparts, due
   to their negative Poisson's ratio, making them better at resisting
   penetration by concentrated loads. The Poisson's ratio and Young's
   modulus of auxetic open cell foams have rarely been measured at the high
   compressive strain rates typical during impacts of energy absorbing
   material in sporting protective equipment. Auxetic closed cell foams are
   less common than their open cell counterparts, and only their
   quasi-static characteristics have been previously reported. It is,
   therefore, unclear how the Poisson's ratio of auxetic foam, and
   associated benefits such as increased indentation resistance shown at
   low strain rates, would transfer to the high strain rates expected under
   impact. The aim of this study was to measure the effect of strain rate
   on the stiffness and Poisson's ratio of auxetic and conventional foam.
   Auxetic open cell and closed cell polymer foams were fabricated, then
   compression tested to similar to 80\% strain at applied rates up to 200
   s(-1), with Poisson's ratios obtained from optical full-field strain
   mapping. Open cell foam quasi-static Poisson's ratios ranged from -2.0
   to 0.4, with a narrower range of -0.1 to 0.3 for closed cell foam.
   Poisson's ratios of auxetic foams approximately halved in magnitude
   between the minimum and maximum strain rates. Open cell foam
   quasi-static Young's moduli were between 0.02 and 0.09 MPa, whereas
   closed cell foams Young's moduli were similar to 1 MPa, which is like
   foam in protective equipment. The Young's moduli of the auxetic foams
   approximately doubled at the highest applied strain rate of 200 s(-1).}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic plied yarn is a novel type of yarn structure formed with two
   types of component yarns with different moduli. Although the effect of
   structural parameters on its negative Poisson's ratio behavior has been
   investigated by both experimental and geometrical analyses, the
   influence of material properties, including yarn tensile modulus and
   friction, has not been studied yet. In this work, these two factors are
   further investigated via finite element simulation. The finite element
   model is first created by using the commercial software ANSYS 15.0.
   Then, the simulation results are compared with the experimental and
   analytical data. Finally, the effects of the tilt angle of stiff yarn,
   yarn friction and tensile modulus are discussed. It is expected that the
   outcomes of this work would be useful to guide the design and
   fabrication of this type of auxetic yarn structure.}},

   with negative Poisson's ratios}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITES PART B-ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{201}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Auextic materials possessing negative Poisson's ratios have gained great
   research interest by virtue of its various exotic mechanical properties
   while most of these metamaterials rely on the hollow cellular
   configuration, largely undermining the overall mechanical performance.
   It therefore restricts their application in load-bearing engineering
   fields. In order to solve this issue, we first designed a new class of
   chiral structures by integrating various polynomial curves. Based on the
   state-of-the-art 3D printing technique, these auxetic geometries were
   then fabricated into high-performance composites with chopped carbon
   fiber (CF) as the reinforcement. Guided by experimental characterization
   and finite element analysis, the influences of the polynomial orders (n)
   and the incorporation of CF on the mechanical properties were
   systematically studied. Results showed that the auxetic behaviour can be
   tailored by varying the n value inside the polynomial equation.
   Moreover, the tensile modulus, strength and energy absorption at break
   of printed chiral samples were all enhanced with the addition of CF,
   especially for the large improvement of modulus and absorbed energy by
   2-fold. Hence, these novel chiral composites present great potential in
   the development of high performance mechanical metamaterials.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports a new type of auxetic yarn made with circular
   braiding technology to overcome the yarn slippage problem in the
   conventional helical auxetic yarn structure. Various auxetic yarn
   structures are firstly produced on a vertical circular braiding machine
   with 16 yarn carries by changing the number and arrangement of stiff
   yarn as well as diameter of elastic yarn and core yarn, and then tested
   under single and repeating tensile conditions. The results show that not
   only yarn slippage problem could be overcome in the newly developed
   auxetic yarn structure, but also an early activation and a higher
   magnitude of negative Poisson's ratio could be achieved. The results
   also show that all structural parameters including stiff yarn number and
   arrangement, core yarn, and elastic yarn diameter have an influence on
   the auxetic effect of the novel yarn structure. Since the new auxetic
   yarn is produced by using standard braiding manufacturing technique and
   conventional non-auxetic yarns, there are few technological barriers for
   its large-scale manufacture for practical application.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper a theoretical and numerical study on the viscoelastic
   behavior of auxetic polymers and cellular materials is presented.
   Negative Poisson's ratio materials (alpha upsilon xi epsilon o sigma in
   Creek) expand in all directions when pulled in only one, and contract
   when compressed in one direction. This behavior is due to the special
   geometric layout of their unit cells. A theoretical model including
   viscoelastic and inertia effects on the unit cell has been prepared in
   order to compute the equivalent in-plane dynamic storage modulus and
   loss factor of the cellular material. The calculations show how inertia
   effects and geometric layout of the unit cell affect the viscoelastic
   behavior of the material over the frequency domain. The results show a
   very good agreement with the ones from analogous FEM models. Auxetic
   honeycombs are a good example of cellular materials with negative
   Poisson's ratio behavior. A Finite Element model has been elaborated to
   model also the viscoelastic response of the transverse shear modulus of
   this kind of honeycombs and compared with analytical results.}},

Abstract = {{The Poisson's ratio (PR) of asphalt mixtures is an important input
   parameter in the constitutive models for pavement design and performance
   analysis. The design and performance analysis of asphalt pavements
   depend upon measuring proper material properties such as complex modulus
   and PR. The PR is often assumed to be time independent or it is
   calculated as the negative ratio of transverse to axial strains in the
   time domain under uniaxial loading when the time dependency is
   considered. This study used accurate methods to calculate the
   viscoelastic Poisson's Ratio (VPR) under various loading conditions and
   demonstrated the error associated with using inaccurate methods for
   calculating the PR. The results demonstrated that the VPR increased with
   time in uniaxial unconfined tension and compression tests where shear
   relaxation was generally faster than dilatational relaxation. While the
   VPR slightly decreased with time in uniaxial confined compression tests
   where the dilatational relaxation was faster than the shear relaxation.
   In addition, the results demonstrated that asphalt mixtures with coarse
   aggregate gradations had lower VPR compared to asphalt mixtures with
   finer aggregate gradations. Also, the VPR was found to be sensitive to
   the ageing and moisture conditions. The VPR decreased with ageing and
   increased with the level and time of moisture conditioning of the
   asphalt mixtures. Finally, the error introduced by incorrectly
   calculating the PR as the negative ratio of transverse to axial strains
   in the time domain was found to be significant in some cases, while it
   was insignificant in others.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetics, i.e. systems with a negative Poisson's ratio, exhibit the
   unexpected property of becoming wider when stretched and narrower when
   compressed. This property arises from the manner in which the internal
   geometric units within the system deform when the system is submitted to
   a stress and may be explained in terms of geometry-deformation
   mechanism' based models. This work considers realistic finite
   implementations of the well known rotating squares system in the form of
   (i) a finite planar structure and (ii) a tubular conformation, as one
   typically finds in stents. It shows that although the existing models of
   the Poisson's ratios and moduli based on periodic systems may be
   appropriate to model systems where the geometry/deformation mechanism
   operate at the micro- or nano- (molecular) level where a system may be
   considered as a quasi infinite system, corrections to the model may need
   to be made when one considers finite structures with a small number of
   repeat units and suggests that for finite systems, especially for the 2D
   systems, the moduli as predicted by the periodic model may be
   significantly overestimating the moduli of the real system, even
   sometimes by as much as 200\%. (C) 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co.

Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MECHANICS A-SOLIDS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{70}},
Pages = {{8-14}},
Month = {{JUL-AUG}},
Abstract = {{Poisson's ratio is an important mechanical property that explains the
   deformation patterns of materials. A positive Poisson's ratio is a
   feature of the majority of materials. Some materials, however, display
   ``auxetic{''} behaviors (i.e. possess negative Poisson's ratios).
   Indeed, auxetic and non-auxetic materials display different deformation
   mechanisms. Explaining these differences and their effects on the
   mechanics of these materials is of a significant importance.
   In this study, effects of Poisson's ratio on the mechanics of auxetic
   and non-auxetic nanobeams are revealed. A parametric study is provided
   on effects of Poisson's ratio on the static bending and free vibration
   behaviors of auxetic nanobeams. The general nonlocal theory is employed
   to model the nonlocal effects. Unlike Eringen's nonlocal theory, the
   general nonlocal theory uses different attenuation functions for the
   longitudinal and lateral strains. This theory emphasizes the Poisson's
   ratio-nonlocal coupling effects on the mechanics of nanomaterials. The
   obtained results showed that Poisson's ratio is an essential parameter
   for determining mechanical behaviors of nanobeams. It is demonstrated
   that auxetic and non-auxetic nanobeams may reflect softening or
   hardening behaviors depending on the ratio of the nonlocal fields of the
   beam's longitudinal and lateral strains.}},

Abstract = {{Compared with triangular, square and Kagome honeycombs, hexagonal
   honeycomb has superior heat dissipation capabilities, but its lower
   in-plane stiffness hinders its multifunctional applications. Regarding
   this problem, in this paper we propose a multifunctional hierarchical
   honeycomb (MHH) with negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) sub-structures. This
   MHH is constructed by replacing the solid cell walls of the original
   regular hexagonal honeycomb (ORHH) with two kinds of equal mass NPR
   honeycombs, the anisotropic re-entrant honeycomb or the isotropic chiral
   honeycomb. Based on the Euler beam theory, formulas for the Young's
   moduli of these two kinds of MHH structures are derived. Results show
   that by appropriately adjusting the geometrical parameters both the
   re-entrant honeycomb (when the cell-wall thickness-to-length ratio of
   the ORHH is less than 0.045) and the chiral honeycomb (when the
   cell-wall thickness-to-length ratio of the ORHH is less than 0.75) can
   greatly tune the in-plane stiffness of the MHH structure. The presented
   theory could thus be used in designing new tailorable hierarchical
   honeycomb structures for multifunctional applications. (C) 2013 The

   that present unprecedented mechanical properties not found in nature.
   One of the most well-known mechanical metamaterials is auxetics, which
   demonstrates negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) behavior that is very
   beneficial in several industrial applications. In this study, a specific
   type of auxetic metamaterial structure namely idealized 3D re-entrant
   structure is studied analytically, numerically, and experimentally. The
   noted structure is constructed of three types of struts-one loaded
   purely axially and two loaded simultaneously flexurally and axially,
   which are inclined and are spatially defined by angles theta and phi.
   Analytical relationships for elastic modulus, yield stress, and
   Poisson's ratio of the 3D re-entrant unit cell are derived based on two
   well-known beam theories namely Euler-Bernoulli and Timoshenko.
   Moreover, two finite element approaches one based on beam elements and
   one based on volumetric elements are implemented. Furthermore, several
   specimens are additively manufactured (3D printed) and tested under
   compression. The analytical results had good agreement with the
   experimental results on the one hand and the volumetric finite element
   model results on the other hand. Moreover, the effect of various
   geometrical parameters on the mechanical properties of the structure was
   studied, and the results demonstrated that angle theta (related to
   tension-dominated struts) has the highest influence on the sign of
   Poisson's ratio and its extent, while angle phi (related to
   compression-dominated struts) has the lowest influence on the Poisson's
   ratio. Nevertheless, the compression-dominated struts (defined by angle
   phi) provide strength and stiffness for the structure. The results also
   demonstrated that the structure could have zero Poisson's ratio for a
   specific range of theta and phi angles. Finally, a lightened 3D
   re-entrant structure is introduced, and its results are compared to
   those of the idealized 3D re-entrant structure.}},

Abstract = {{2-D and 3-D micro-architectured multiphase thermoelastic metamaterials
   are designed and analyzed using a parametric level set method for
   topology optimization and the finite element method. An asymptotic
   homogenization approach is employed to obtain the effective
   thermoelastic properties of the multiphase metamaterials. The
   epsilon-constraint multi-objective optimization method is adopted in the
   formulation. The coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) and Poisson's
   ratio (PR) are chosen as two objective functions, with the CTE optimized
   and the PR treated as a constraint. The optimization problems are solved
   by using the method of moving asymptotes. Effective isotropic and
   anisotropic CTEs and stiffness constants are obtained for the
   topologically optimized metamaterials with prescribed values of PR under
   the constraints of specified effective bulk modulus, volume fractions
   and material symmetry. Two solid materials along with one additional
   void phase are involved in each of the 2-D and 3-D optimal design
   examples. The numerical results reveal that the newly proposed approach
   can integrate shape and topology optimizations and lead to optimal
   microstructures with distinct topological boundaries. The current method
   can topologically optimize metamaterials with a positive, negative or
   zero CTE and a positive, negative or zero Poisson's ratio.}},

Abstract = {{Soft network materials that incorporate wavy filamentary microstructures
   have appealing applications in bio-integrated devices and tissue
   engineering, in part due to their biomimetic mechanical properties, such
   as ``J-shaped{''} stress-strain curves and negative Poisson's ratios.
   The diversity of the microstructure geometry as well as the network
   topology provides access to a broad range of tunable mechanical
   properties, suggesting a high degree of design flexibility. The
   understanding of the underlying microstructure-property relationship
   requires the development of a general mechanics theory. Here, we
   introduce a theoretical model of infinitesimal deformations for the soft
   network materials constructed with periodic lattices of arbitrarily
   shaped microstructures. Taking three representative lattice topologies
   (triangular, honeycomb, and square) as examples, we obtain analytic
   solutions of Poisson's ratio and elastic modulus based on the mechanics
   model. These analytic solutions, as validated by systematic finite
   element analyses (FEA), elucidated different roles of lattice topology
   and microstructure geometry on Poisson's ratio of network materials with
   engineered zigzag microstructures. With the aid of the theoretical
   model, a crescent-shaped microstructure was devised to expand the
   accessible strain range of network materials with relative constant
   Poisson's ratio under large levels of stretching. This study provides
   theoretical guidelines for the soft network material designs to achieve
   desired Poisson's ratio and elastic modulus.}},

Abstract = {{Analytical expressions are derived for the Poisson's ratios associated
   with a three-dimensional network of regular, corner-sharing tetrahedra
   in which: (1) the tetrahedra are assumed to be rigid and free to rotate
   relative to each other; (2) the tetrahedra are assumed to maintain shape
   and orientation but are free to change size (dilate); (3) tetrahedral
   rotation and dilation are assumed to act concurrently. The structure has
   a primitive unit cell containing four tetrahedra and is analogous to the
   molecular structure of a-cristobalite. Strain-dependent variations in
   Poisson's ratio are also predicted by the models. For deformation due to
   tetrahedral rotation the network is found to exhibit negative Poisson's
   ratios in each of the three principal directions, with the magnitude of
   the Poisson's ratio being dependent on the angle of rotation of the
   tetrahedra. The behaviour of the Poisson's ratio is isotropic in the
   transverse plane, but anisotropic elsewhere. In the dilation model
   negative Poisson's ratios equal to -1 are observed for uniaxial loading
   in any of the principal directions, with the value being constant
   irrespective of tetrahedral size. The model for concurrent tetrahedral
   rotation and dilation allows positive as well as negative Poisson's
   ratios, with the values determined by the framework geometry and
   relative strengths of the two mechanisms. The concurrent model also
   offers a design route to materials and structures having ultrahigh
   Young's moduli.}},

Abstract = {{An analytical framework has been developed for predicting the equivalent
   in-plane elastic moduli (longitudinal and transverse Young's modulus,

   spatially random variations in cell angles. Employing a bottom up

   expressions have been derived in this article. This study also includes
   development of a highly generalized finite element code capable of
   accepting number of cells in two perpendicular directions, random
   structural geometry and material properties of irregular auxetic
   honeycomb and thereby obtaining five in-plane elastic moduli of the
   structure. The elastic moduli obtained for different degree of
   randomness following the analytical formulae have been compared with the
   results of direct finite element simulations and they are found to be in
   good agreement corroborating the validity and accuracy of the proposed
   approach. The transverse Young's modulus, shear modulus and Poisson's

Abstract = {{This article investigates the effect of auxeticity on the thermal
   stresses of isotropic plates. The thermal stress is non-dimensionalized
   against the coefficient of thermal expansion, the change in temperature
   and at least one of the moduli so as to express the dimensionless
   thermal stresses solely in terms of Poisson's ratio of the plate
   material. Results show that increasing auxeticity leads to mild and
   significant drop in the thermal stresses under the conditions of
   constant Young's modulus and constant shear modulus, respectively.
   However, increasing auxeticity causes increase in the thermal stress
   under the condition of constant bulk modulus. It is also shown that
   increasing auxeticity under the condition of constant product of all the
   three moduli reduces the thermal stress if Poisson's ratio falls within
   a wide range of -1 and 0.303. These results suggest that, under most
   circumstances, the replacement of conventional plate materials with
   auxetic solids is useful for reducing thermal stresses therein. The use
   of auxetic materials, therefore, provides an additional choice for the
   reduction of thermal stresses in plates other than selecting materials
   of lower modulus and low coefficient of thermal expansion.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a novel fibre structure known as the helical
   auxetic yarn (HAY). The geometry of the yarn is defined and the
   manufacturing process described. A range of HAYs have been manufactured
   that vary the geometric properties of the structure. A systematic study
   of the yarns has been completed to evaluate the effect on the auxetic
   behaviour of the geometry. We also characterise the component fibres and
   yarns and discuss the influence of geometric and material effects on the
   observed Poisson's ratio of the yarns.
   It can be shown that the starting wrap angle of the yarn has the
   greatest effect on auxetic behaviour both in terms of magnitude and the
   strain range over which it may be observed.
   The maximum negative Poisson's ratio observed for a yarn manufactured
   from conventionally available monofilaments with positive Poisson's
   ratio is -2.7. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic polyproplyene fibres have been produced on a large-scale
   industrial extruder for the first time. A first batch of tests
   identified a coarse processing window which was then more closely
   defined by subsequent tests. The effects of barrel temperature, screw
   speed, take-up speed and quenching (through the parameters of air gap
   and bath temperature) on the Poisson's ratio and Young's modulus of the
   fibres were examined. It was found that a temperature of 200 degrees C,
   screw speed of 12.5 rpm and take-up speed of either 1.5 or 3.5 rpm
   produced fibres with a high degree of auxeticity up to 5\% strain
   -significantly increasing the auxetic strain range previously reported
   for lab-scale extrusions at lower extruder temperatures. Quenching with
   a water bath reduced the auxeticity, so was not employed as a processing

Abstract = {{The effects of thermo-mechanical auxetic foam conversion parameters on
   the Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of open-cell polyurethane foam
   are related to changes in chemical bonding and cell structure. Applied
   volumetric compression, conversion temperature, and duration are
   reported on foam Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, and structural
   stability. Fourier transform infrared spectral analysis on samples
   converted at and above 160 degrees C strongly indicates a hydrogen bond
   interaction increase in urea groups (C=O---H-N) and an increase in
   hydrogen bonding population. Spectral changes inferred soft segment
   degradation following extensive heat exposure (200 degrees C, 180 min),
   specifically a shift and intensity change in CH2 and C-O-C polyol bands
   and a broad baseline increase between 3600 and 2400 cm(-1). These
   changes are linked to (i) resistance to dimensional recovery over time
   and during re-heating; (ii) Poisson's ratio becoming negative, then zero
   in tension or marginally positive in compression; (iii) Young's Modulus
   reducing then increasing; (iv) mass loss, evidenced by thermogravimetric
   analysis increasing from 150 degrees C. The minimum mean values of
   Poisson's ratio of approximate to-0.2 (to 10\% compression/tension) are
   comparable to other studies. All samples that retain their imposed
   compression over time are isotropic, with near constant Young's moduli
   and Poisson's ratio (to 10\% compression/tension).}},

Title = {{The variation in Poisson's ratio caused by interactions between core and
   wrap in helical composite auxetic yarns}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITES SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{102}},
Pages = {{87-93}},
Month = {{OCT 6}},
Abstract = {{Materials with a negative Poisson's ratio are referred to as auxetic.
   One recently invented example of this is the helical auxetic yarn (HAY).
   This has been proved to successfully exhibit auxetic behaviour both as a
   yarn and when incorporated into fabric. The HAY is based on a
   double-helix geometry where a relatively stiffer `wrap' is helically
   wound around a compliant core fibre. This paper studies the effect of
   the interaction between the core and the wrap fibre on the auxetic
   behaviour of the HAY, including the effect of their relative moduli.
   Assessment of the Poisson's ratio of the HAYs has revealed that an
   elevated difference in component moduli causes the wrap fibre embedding
   itself into the core fibre, thus decreasing the auxetic effect. Careful
   determination of an optimum core-wrap moduli ratio where the ratio is
   high enough to yield an auxetic effect and low enough to prevent the
   core-indentation effect can lead to the fabrication of a yarn with
   largest negative Poisson's ratio. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{On the conical indentation response of elastic auxetic materials:
   Effects of Poisson's ratio, contact friction and cone angle}},

Abstract = {{The linear elastic analytical solution of an axisymmetric probe
   indenting a semi-infinite half-space forms the backbone of most
   indentation data analysis protocols. It has been noted in the literature
   that the theoretical solution relies on a boundary condition that is
   ill-posed which leads to discrepancies from the actual response that
   depends, among other parameters, on the Poisson's ratio of the indented
   material. While correction factors have been proposed, prior studies
   have concentrated on the positive Poisson's ratio regime and have
   neglected an exciting and developing class of materials: the auxetic
   systems. The finite element method is used to simulate the conical
   indentation response of elastic materials with Poisson's ratios covering
   the whole thermodynamically possible range, -1 <= v <= 0.5. Consistent
   with theoretical predictions, the indentation resistance and hardness of
   auxetic materials is enhanced compared to their non-auxetic
   counterparts. The stress profiles and contact details are systematically
   analyzed and the increase in resistance is traced to the shear
   stiffening and the reduction of contact area compared to conventional
   materials. Furthermore, it is shown that the analytical linear elastic
   solution falls short in accurately describing the indentation response,
   especially for negative Poisson's ratio materials. In contrast to the
   theoretical prediction, the contact area reduces as the Poisson's ratio
   increases resulting in increased required force to penetrate the
   material and an enhanced pressure distribution beneath the indenter. The
   analytical solution is corrected for the whole v range and best fit
   polynomials are proposed for ease-of-use. The effects of
   contact-friction and indenter cone-angle are also studied and
   quantified. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents an experimental study of tensile and deformation
   behavior of an auxetic plied yarn structure. The basic configuration of
   the plied structure formed with two soft yarns and two stiff yarns was
   firstly introduced. Based on this 4-ply helix structure, six kinds of
   yarn samples were made by different combinations of soft yarns, stiff
   yarns and twist levels. These yarn samples were first tested and the
   effects of different design parameters were analyzed. Apart from the
   tensile test, changes in the internal structure of two samples upon
   stretching were also studied through microscopic examination. Finally,
   double helix yarn and 6-ply auxetic yarn were made for a comparative
   purpose to investigate the effect of helical structure. The study shows
   that all of the 4-ply auxetic yarn samples exhibit negative Poisson's
   ratio (NPR) throughout the entire tensile process, and the magnitude of
   NPR gets larger with a smaller soft yarn diameter, a higher tensile
   modulus of stiff yarn and a lower twist level. The study also shows that
   auxetic behavior inside the 4-ply structure is generated by the
   interplay between the soft yarns and stiff yarns and 4-ply auxetic yarns
   have the advantages to produce immediate auxetic effect upon stretching.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials expand when stretched, and shrink when compressed.
   This is the result of a negative Poisson's ratio v. Isotropic
   configurations with v approximate to -1 have been designed and are
   expected to provide increased shear stiffness G. This assumes that
   Young's modulus and v can be engineered independently. In this article,
   a micropolar-continuum model is employed to describe the behavior of a
   representative auxetic structural network, the chiral lattice, in an
   attempt to remove the indeterminacy in its constitutive law resulting
   from v = -1. While this indeterminacy is successfully removed, it is
   found that the shear modulus is an independent parameter and, for
   certain configurations, it is equal to that of the triangular lattice.
   This is remarkable as the chiral lattice is subject to bending
   deformation of its internal members, and thus is more compliant than the
   triangular lattice which is stretch dominated. The derived micropolar
   model also indicates that this unique lattice has the highest
   characteristic length scale I of all known lattice topologies, as well
   as a negative first Lame constant without violating bounds required for
   thermodynamic stability. We also find that hexagonal arrangements of
   deformable rings have a coupling number N=1. This is the first lattice
   reported in the literature for which couple-stress or Mindlin theory is
   necessary rather than being adopted a priori. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

   positive Poisson's ratios (PPRs), auxetic materials are rare. In this
   paper, by employing first principles calculations, we found a high NPR
   two-dimensional (2D) material, tungsten carbide (W2C), in the transition
   metal carbides (MXenes). Our results of the relatively moderate Young's
   modulus and fracture strength as well as the critical strain showed that
   the 2D monolayer W2C is an extraordinary flexible material. Our DFT
   results also demonstrated that W2C possesses high NPRs while Hf2C and
   Ta2C have PPRs. Furthermore, the mechanically induced deformation
   mechanism and the NPR formation mechanism of W2C have been proposed.
   Such an intrinsic NPR in W2C is attributed to the strong coupling
   between the C-p and W-d orbitals in the pyramid structural unit. The
   mechanically induced deformation mechanism and the PPR formation
   mechanism of Hf2C have also been determined. The intrinsic NPR for W2C
   transforms to PPR upon the surface functionalization induced. The
   behavior occurs due to the W-C interaction weakening. The excellent NPR
   in the 2D MXene material combined with other outstanding properties such
   as the metallic state would bring about its promising engineering
   prospects, ranging from the metal-ion battery, to automobiles and
   aircraft.}},

Abstract = {{Materials that possess negative Poisson's ratio are termed ``auxetic

   of the inverse rule-of-mixture for obtaining the out-of-plane Young's
   modulus of a laminate is valid only for conventional laminates and fully
   auxetic laminates. The Young's modulus by inverse rule-of mixture
   significantly underestimates the out-of-plane Young's modulus of a
   semi-auxetic laminate. It is also shown that under certain conditions,
   the out-of-plane Young's modulus of a semi-auxetic laminate exceeds even
   the direct rule-of-mixture. A correction term is developed herein for
   incorporation into the inverse rule-of-mixture. (c) 2009 Elsevier Masson

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials exhibit negative Poisson's ratio and they expand in

   generation of the auxetic behavior in a typical DHY system. The DHY
   system can be potentially tailored for a large negative Poisson's ratio
   under a broader ``window{''} of axial tensile strains by simply
   downsizing the diameter of carbon based wrap yarn from micron to

Abstract = {{Most studies on composites assume that the constituent phases have
   different values of stiffness. Little attention has been paid to the
   effect of constituent phases having distinct Poisson's ratios. This
   research focuses on a concurrent optimization method for simultaneously
   designing composite structures and materials with distinct Poisson's
   ratios. The proposed method aims to minimize the mean compliance of the
   macrostructure with a given mass of base materials. In contrast to the
   traditional interpolation of the stiffness matrix through numerical
   results, an interpolation scheme of the Young's modulus and Poisson's
   ratio using different parameters is adopted. The numerical results
   demonstrate that the Poisson effect plays a key role in reducing the
   mean compliance of the final design. An important contribution of the
   present study is that the proposed concurrent optimization method can
   automatically distribute base materials with distinct Poisson's ratios
   between the macrostructural and microstructural levels under a single
   constraint of the total mass.}},

Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},

Month = {{JAN 5}},
Abstract = {{Structures with negative Poisson's ratios have been widely applied in
   existing engineering, especially in the field of energy absorption. To
   design double-arrowed auxetic structures to better absorb energy, it is
   essential to conduct parametric analysis on their crashworthiness. In
   this paper, the effect of the geometric parameters on the
   crashworthiness performance is analyzed thoroughly on both macro-and
   micro-sized scales. At the macro scale, the effect of the slenderness
   ratio and size of the unit cell are analyzed. Additionally, the critical
   slenderness ratio is derived to distinguish the deformation modes under
   axial impact loading. At the micro scale, analysis of the effect of the
   angles and thickness of beams on the crashworthiness performance is
   conducted. It is found that the crashworthiness performance of
   double-arrowed auxetic structure is more sensitive to the parameters of
   the long-inclined beam than those of the short one. The discussion in
   this paper can help engineers to better design and optimize the
   double-arrowed crash box. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Cells sense and respond to mechanical forces, regardless of whether the
   source is from a normal tissue matrix, an adjacent cell or a synthetic
   substrate. In recent years, cell response to surface rigidity has been
   extensively studied by modulating the elastic modulus of poly(ethylene

   ratio, another fundamental material property parameter has not been
   explored, primarily because of challenges involved in tuning the
   Poisson's ratio in biological scaffolds. Two-photon polymerization is
   used to fabricate suspended web structures that exhibit positive and
   negative Poisson's ratio (NPR), based on analytical models. NPR webs
   demonstrate biaxial expansion/compression behavior, as one or multiple
   cells apply local forces and move the structures. Unusual cell division
   on NPR structures is also demonstrated. This methodology can be used to
   tune the Poisson's ratio of several photocurable biomaterials and could
   have potential implications in the field of mechanobiology.}},

Abstract = {{This article summarizes the method of analytical formulation and
   computational approach of stress intensity factor and plastic zone
   calculation for auxetic materials, which have negative Poisson's ratio.
   A chiral structure-based material is selected as an object of the study
   due to its popularity. The stress intensity factor is used in
   combination with the von Mises yielding condition to estimate the
   plastic zone's shape and size. The results show that macroscopically the
   shape of the plastic zone for auxetic material is the same with that of
   ordinary materials. However, its size is smaller due to the reduction in
   its Young's modulus from the solid material of which the auxetic
   material is made. Microscopically, an auxetic material has its plastic
   zone shape that is unique to its microstructure. Homogenization theory
   was convenient to use to bridge between the microscopic and macroscopic
   models.}},

Abstract = {{A new two-dimensional carbon-based material consisting of pentagonal and
   hexagonal elements is identified by numerical experiments, which is
   called phgraphene and possesses not only a tunable semimetallic feature
   but also a direction-dependent even sign-changed Poisson's ratio. The
   structural stability of such a new material is first checked
   systematically. It is found that phgraphene has a similar energy as the
   gamma-graphyne, a thermally stable structure from the room temperature
   to 1500 K, and elastic constants satisfying the Born-Huang criterion.
   Both the band structure and density of states are further verified with
   different techniques, which demonstrate a Dirac semimetallic
   characteristic of phgraphene. A more interesting finding is that the
   band structure can be easily tuned by an external loading, resulting in
   the transition from semimetal to semiconductor or from type I to type
   III. As a new material that may be applied in the future, the mechanical
   property of phgraphene is further evaluated. It shows that phgraphene is
   a typically anisotropic material, which has not only direction-dependent
   Young's moduli but also direction-dependent even sign-changed Poisson's
   ratios. The microscopic mechanisms of both the electrical and mechanical
   properties are revealed. Such a versatile material with tunable band
   structure and auxetic effect should have promising applications in the
   advanced nano-electronic field in the future.}},

Abstract = {{Monte Carlo simulations in the isobaric-isothermal ensemble with
   variable shape of the periodic box are used to study elastic properties
   of two-dimensional (2D) model systems of hard discs with parallel layers
   of hard cyclic hexamers. Both the particles in their pure phases form
   elastically isotropic crystals. However, the crystal of discs shows
   positive and that of hexamers negative Poisson's ratio (PR). The studied
   systems with layers are of low symmetry. Hence, a general analytic
   formula for the orientational dependence of PR in 2D systems is applied
   to such systems. It is shown that, by changing parameters of the
   particles and their relative concentration, as well as orientation of
   the layers, one can obtain systems which are non-auxetic (their PR is
   positive), auxetic (their PR is negative), or partially auxetic ones
   (their PR is negative for some directions and positive for other ones).
   If the disks and hexamers are interpreted as small molecules, the
   obtained results indicate that by introducing auxetic nano-layers one
   can strongly modify PR of crystals or even thin layers. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Recent advances in lithography technology and the spread of 3D printers
   allow us a facile fabrication of special materials with complicated
   microstructures. The materials are called ``designed materials{''} or
   ``architectured materials{''} and provide new opportunities for material
   development. These materials, which owing to their rationally designed
   architectures exhibit unusual properties at the micro- and nano-scales,
   are being widely exploited in the development of modern materials with
   customized and improved performance. Meta-materials are found to possess
   superior and unusual properties as regards static modulus (axial stress
   divided by axial strain), density, energy absorption, smart
   functionality, and negative Poisson's ratio (NPR). However, in spite of
   recent developments, it has only been feasible to fabricate a few such
   meta-materials and to implement them in practical applications. Against
   such a backdrop, a broad review of the wide range of cellular auxetic
   structures for mechanical metamaterials available at our disposal and
   their potential application areas is important. Classified according to
   their geometrical configuration, this paper provides a review of
   cellular auxetic structures. The structures are presented with a view to
   tap into their potential abilities and leverage multidimensional
   fabrication advances to facilitate their application in industry. In
   this review, there is a special emphasis on state-of-the-art
   applications of these structures in important domains such as sensors
   and actuators, the medical industry, and defense while touching upon
   ways to accelerate the material development process.}},

Abstract = {{Investigations into the changes of Poisson's ratio as well as other
   mechanical properties of selected types of refractories subjected to
   thermal shocks have been carried out. The investigations included
   several types of porous refractory materials e.g. magnesia,
   magnesia-spinel, magnesia-chrome, chrome-magnesia, mullite, silica and
   low cement chamotte castable. The Poisson's ratio value of the examined
   materials decreased after each thermal shock. Decreasing of Poisson
   ratio caused by a stronger drop in Young's modulus than that for shear
   modulus was explained.
   It was found that some tested materials were characterized by low values
   of Poisson's ratio, which after series of severe thermal shocks
   decreased even to negative values. In order to explain the observed
   phenomenon, an attempt to correlate the obtained results with the
   microstructure of materials before and after a series of thermal shocks
   was undertaken. A hypothetical model of the microstructure of a porous
   ceramic material with negative Poisson ratio was proposed. (C) 2011

   shape despite subsequent plastic deformation. The exposure to specific
   temperature profiles induces a shape memory effect on auxetic (negative
   Poisson's ratio) foam specimens, returning them to their initial
   dimensions. This behaviour is a one-way effect, and it is a property of
   the polyurethane (PU) constituent of the foam. The foam specimens were
   transformed from conventional Poisson's ratio to auxetic, returned to
   conventional and once again to auxetic under multiple mechanical and
   thermal loading. At each stage the foams were mechanically characterized
   under cyclic tensile and compressive loading. The manufacturing route
   adopted for the auxetic PU specimens involved a multiaxial compression
   of the native foam, heating of the compressed specimens above the T-g of
   the foam polymer, and cooling under running water. Twenty specimens,
   divided equally between two varieties of PU-based foam, were fabricated.
   Two different compression ratios were used during auxetic conversion for
   both kinds of foam, and the same final temperature of 135 degrees C was
   adopted. Tensile and compressive cyclic tests were performed in order to
   measure the tangent modulus (i.e. stiffness), Poisson's ratios and
   energy dissipated per unit volume. Remarkable differences before and
   after the memory effect took place were found, showing mechanical
   behaviour unique to each of these phases. The shape memory effect plays
   an important role in the mechanical behaviour of the auxetic foams. (C)

Abstract = {{More and more researches have been focused on auxetic composite
   materials and a number of composite structures have been fabricated,
   synthesized or theoretically predicted. Since their structures are
   complex, their mechanical behavior is very difficult to be
   characterized. The purpose of the present paper is to systematically
   investigate the negative Poisson's ratio effect of a novel
   three-dimensional auxetic orthogonal textile composite under
   compression. Firstly, a set of equations are derived for the theoretical
   calculation of the Poisson's ratio of the composite under uniaxial
   compression via an analytical analysis. Secondly, a finite element model
   (FEM) is created by ANSYS Parameter Design Language and is verified by
   experiment. The deviation between the simulation and experimental
   results are carefully discussed. Thirdly, the effects of geometry
   parameters and material properties on the negative Poisson's ratio
   behavior of the composite are discussed based on the FEM simulated
   results. At last, a general basis is concluded. It is expected that the
   outcomes of this study could be useful to guide the design and
   fabrication of auxetic textile composites with required negative
   Poisson's ratio behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Diamond-like structures, that include sp(2) and sp(3) hybridized carbon
   atoms, are of considerable interest nowadays. In the present work,
   various carbon auxetic structures are studied by the combination of
   molecular dynamics (MD) and analytical approach. Two fullerites based on
   the fullerene C-60 and fullerene-like molecule C-48 are investigated as
   well as diamond-like structures based on other fullerene-like molecules
   (called fulleranes), carbon nanotubes (called tubulanes) and graphene
   sheets. MD is used to find the equilibrium states of the structures and
   calculate compliance and stiffness coefficients for stable
   configurations. Analytical methods are used to calculate the engineering
   elastic coefficients (Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, shear modulus
   and bulk modulus), and to study their transformation under rotation of
   the coordinate system. All the considered structures are partial
   auxetics with the negative value of Poisson's ratio for properly chosen
   tensile directions. It is shown that some of these structures, in a
   particular tension direction, have a very high Young's modulus, that is,
   1852 GPa for tubulane TA6.}},

Abstract = {{Textile structures with negative Poisson's ratio (PR) behavior are
   called auxetic textile structures. They have received increasing
   attention in recent years and have been designed and fabricated through
   spinning, knitting, weaving and non-woven methods. However, auxetic
   textile structures fabricated using braiding method have not been
   reported so far. This paper reported a novel type of auxetic braided
   structure based on a helical structural arrangement. The geometry of the
   structure and its deformation mechanism were first introduced and
   described. Then a special manufacturing process was developed by the
   modification of commonly used tubular braiding technology. Various
   auxetic braids were fabricated with different structural parameters and
   yarns and tested under uniaxial extension conditions. The results showed
   that all manufactured braids exhibited high negative PR behavior and
   maintained this behavior until the fracture of the component wrap yarn.
   Among three structural parameters discussed, namely wrap angle, braiding
   angle and braiding yarn diameter, the wrap angle had more effects on the
   tensile properties of auxetic braided structure than the other two
   parameters. The success of fabricating auxetic braids with commercially
   available yarns in this study provides an alternative way to manufacture
   auxetics from positive PR materials.}},

Title = {{Isogeometric shape optimization of missing rib auxetics with prescribed
   negative Poisson's ratio over large strains using genetic algorithm}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{193}},
Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents an isogeometric shape optimization framework using
   genetic algorithm to design 2D auxetic structures with prescribed
   Poisson's ratio over large tensile or compressive strains in the
   nonlinear deformation regime. The design domain is parametrized using
   NURBS to allow smoother shape variation of the structure and enable
   accurate fabrication of the optimized structures. The versatility of the
   framework is illustrated through the optimization of a missing rib
   structure with four ligaments under different loading conditions. The
   manufacturability of specimens using the NURBS and PolyJet 3D printing
   technology is also shown. The first example focuses on achieving
   constant negative Poisson's ratio up to -0.7 within the applied tensile
   strain of 50\% under plane stress condition. As auxetics experiments
   under large compressive strain are rarely performed and published, the
   second example demonstrates the optimization for compressive loading.
   The Poisson's ratio determined from experiments matches well with the
   numerical results. The experiments highlight that for very flexible
   materials, deformation under self-weight and contacts between adjacent
   unit cells are significant factors in compression, and further
   investigations are needed.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, two new 2D re-entrant topologies with negative Poisson's
   ratio are presented and their mechanical properties (Poisson's ratio and
   energy absorption capacity) are studied using finite element method as a
   function of geometric parameters. The first topology (model 1) was
   constructed by adding two sinusoidal-shaped ribs into the classical
   re-entrant topology, while the second topology (model 2) was made by
   introducing extra vertical ribs to reinforce the sinusoidal-shaped ribs.
   Simulation results show that model 1 and model 2 topologies can reach a
   minimum value in Poisson's ratio of - 1.12 and - 0.58 with an
   appropriate geometric aspect ratio, respectively. The energy absorption
   capacities of model 1, model 2 and classical re-entrant model were
   studied at various compression velocities. Enhanced energy absorption
   capacities were observed in the two new re-entrant topologies compared
   with the classical re-entrant topology. Model 2 exhibited the highest
   energy absorption capacity and a highest plateau stress. The plateau
   stress of model 1 was about half that of model 2, and when the
   compression velocity is more than 20 m/s, the plateau stress of model 1
   became lower than that of the classical re-entrant model.}},

Abstract = {{Open cell foams with auxeticity and modulus 5 times larger than the
   stiffest auxetic polymeric open cell foam featured in scientific
   literature are developed in this paper by using vacuum bags and
   autoclave following a thermoforming process. The resulting foam is
   transverse isotropic with microstructures exhibiting elongated
   semi-reticulated configurations, and contains a plane in which the
   auxetic behavior is evident. Tensile and compression quasi-static tests
   were carried out on samples cut along different directions and with
   different thicknesses. Foams have been also subjected to tensile
   training at different maximum strains to assess their mechanical
   performance. The tensile modulus and Poisson's ratio values of the
   auxetic foams produced in this work can reach 25 MPa and-0.4 in one
   plane and can feature a negative Poisson's ratio up to-1.3 for thinner
   specimens. Smaller thicknesses and higher tensile training strains can
   also reduce the stiffness but enhance the auxeticity of this porous
   material. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic metamaterials have generated a great deal of interest in recent
   years. In this letter, a novel approach which can be used to produce
   such auxetic metamaterials is presented. This method involves the
   introduction of patterned slit perforations within a sheet/block of
   material in order to create systems which resemble a large variety of
   auxetic systems ranging from rotating units to chiral honeycombs. These
   perforated systems have also been shown to have the potential to exhibit
   giant negative Poisson's ratios. (C) 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co.

Abstract = {{In an effort to tailor functional materials with customized anisotropic
   properties-stiffness and yield strain, we propose porous materials
   consisting of flexible mesostructures designed from the deformation of a
   re-entrant auxetic honeycomb and compliant mechanisms. Using an analogy
   between compliant mechanisms and a cellular material's deformation, we
   can tailor the in-plane properties of mesostructures; low stiffness and
   high strain in one direction and high stiffness and low strain in the
   other direction. An analytical model is developed to obtain the
   effective moduli and yield strains of the porous materials by combining
   the kinematics of a rigid link mechanism and deformation of flexure
   hinges. A numerical technique is implemented with the analytical model
   for the nonlinear constitutive relations of the mesostructures and their
   strain-dependent Poisson's ratios. A finite element analysis (FEA) is
   used to validate the analytical and numerical models. The designed
   moduli and yield strain of porous materials with an aluminum alloy are 2
   GPa and 0.28\% in one direction and 0.2 MPa and 28\% in the other
   direction. These porous materials with mesostructures have high negative
   Poisson's ratios, v(xy){*} down to -82 due to the large rotation of the
   link member in the transverse direction caused by the input displacement
   in the longitudinal direction. The porous materials also show higher
   moduli for compressive loading due to the contact of flexure hinges.
   This paper demonstrates that compliant mesostructures can be used for
   next-generation material design in terms of customized mechanical
   properties; modulus, strength, strain, and Poisson's ratio. The proposed
   mesostructures can also be easily manufactured using a conventional
   cutting method.}},

Abstract = {{The method for determining the Poisson's ratio of isotropic spheres was
   studied via resonant ultrasound spectroscopy (RUS). To that end, The
   mode structure maps for freely vibrating isotropic spheres were obtained
   via finite element method over the full range of Poisson's ratio (-1 to
   +0.5). RUS measurements for spherical samples (indium, steel, SiO2, 13.5
   wt\% In-Sn, and copper foam) were compared with the numerical results
   and the Poisson's ratios were determined as +0.4, +03, +0.2, -0.08, and
   -0.3, respectively. The effects of slight shape imperfection upon the
   first 12 modes were analyzed for various Poisson's ratios, and were
   found to be negligible in interpretation of the experimental results.

Title = {{Experimental and numerical analysis of mounting force of auxetic dowels
   for furniture joints}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{226}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{Limited number of papers describe the practical use of auxetics in the
   wood and furniture sector. Only one paper describes the auxetic nails.
   None of them analyzed the impact of using auxetics on the strength of
   furniture joints. The aim of this investigation was to design and
   manufacture different kinds of auxetic dowels with corresponding muffs
   and experimentally, theoretically, and numerically analyze the minimum
   mounting forces, contact pressures, and friction coefficients of these
   dowels in particleboard. Firstly, auxetic properties of the dowels were
   numerically determined, and then obtained values were confirmed by real
   compression tests in order to be sure that the dowels had negative
   Poisson's ratios. All dowels were manufactured from polyamide (PA12)
   with 3D printing Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) technology. Static
   compression tests were carried out for obtaining the minimum mounting
   force needed to insert the dowel into the muff. Numerical analyses were
   performed by means of Abaqus/Explicit v6.14-2 software. Contact
   pressures and friction coefficients were also theoretically calculated
   and compared to the results of numerical analyses and real tests. At the
   end of the tests, the auxetic dowels gave lower mounting force values
   than the non-auxetic dowels. Mounting force values of dowels decreased
   as the dowel hole diameter and size of inclusions are increased.
   Furthermore, the contact pressures on the surface of the auxetic dowels
   were considerably lower than in the non-auxetic dowels. In conclusion,
   it could be said that the auxetic dowels could be utilized as an
   alternative fastener for the traditional furniture dowels. Therefore,
   withdrawal strength and corner joint tests of the auxetic dowels should
   be investigated in future studies.}},

Abstract = {{Critical drawback of poor stiffness in traditional auxetic materials
   limits them to be applied where negative Poisson's ratio behavior and
   excellent load-bearing capacity are simultaneously desired. In this
   work, a general prescription for designing auxetic lattice structures
   with high stiffness and controllable isotropic/anisotropic elastic
   properties is proposed. Based on it, we rationally design a class of
   novel auxetic lattice structures whose deformation is mainly governed by
   the stretching mechanisms and conducted an investigation on a tree-like
   re-entrant structure. A combination of theoretical predictions,
   numerical simulations and tensile test experiments have been carried out
   to gain a comprehensive understanding of the structural in-plane elastic
   mechanical properties along both the principal axes as well as in the
   off-axis directions. Besides, theoretical model for designing tree-like
   re-entrant structure with isotropic elastic properties is established
   and experimentally verified with specimens fabricated with CFRP
   composite. The results of this research has proven the tree-like
   re-entrant structure exhibits excellent effective Young's modulus, shear
   modulus and obvious negative Poisson's ratio effect along
   omni-direction. Investigation on the directional dependence of
   structural effective elastic properties has further indicated the
   proposed structure presents a great potential for designing auxetic
   material with controllable anisotropic elastic properties. In
   particular, the proposed structure is capable in achieving isotropic
   design with any negative Poisson's ratio between -1 and 0. The design
   philosophy presented in this paper provides a general prescription for
   solving the challenge of poor stiffness in traditional auxetic materials
   and paves a new way for isotropic auxetic design. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Materials with unusual mechanical properties can be potentially used as
   matrices to create high-performance lightweight composites. The
   appearance of materials with negative Poisson's ratio (auxetics), has
   led to the evaluation of auxetic composites for possible engineering
   applications. Because the experimental evaluation of composites with
   specific properties is expensive and time consuming, computational
   modelling and simulation provide efficient alternatives to predict the
   parameters of the composites. In this paper a finite element method was
   used to find the engineering constants (Young's modulus and Poisson's
   ratio) of auxetic composites consisting of concentric cylindrical
   inclusions made of combinations of auxetic and classic (non-auxetic)
   materials. It has been observed that not only the mechanical properties
   of the different composite phases influence the effective mechanical
   properties of the whole composite, but also the location of the same
   material phases do matter.}},

Abstract = {{Tight clastic reservoirs are an important aspect of hydrocarbon
   exploration and development worldwide. The Xu5 section of the Upper
   Triassic Xujiahe Formation in the western Sichuan Basin of central China
   contains tight terrestrial clastic reservoirs. The depth of these
   reservoirs is greater than 3000 m, while the thickness is generally
   greater than 500-580 m; the tight sandstone and shale reservoirs are
   frequently interbedded. Based on the proportion of sandstone and shale,
   the reservoirs can be divided into four types: sand-rich, interbedded
   Type I, interbedded Type II, and shale-rich. Horizontal wells and
   multistage fracturing are used due to the complexity and significant
   heterogeneity of the tight clastic reservoirs in the study area. The
   Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of the reservoir rocks are the two
   most significant parameters that must be evaluated when implementing
   these key techniques. Based on mechanical and acoustic tests, a new
   assessment system for the Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio based on
   the Hoek-Brown criterion was proposed. This evaluation system does not
   require the shear wave time difference; thus, the increase in error
   caused by the unreliability of the shear wave time difference can be
   avoided when assessing strata with complex geological structures. This
   method can be directly applied in single wells using only conventional
   longitudinal wave time difference log data. After converting the wave
   velocity of the high experimental frequency into the wave velocity of
   the logging frequency using the acoustic dispersion technique, the
   analysis results were applicable to the log evaluations. The
   relationship between the Hoek-Brown criterion parameters and the
   mechanical and acoustic parameters of the rock were systematically
   analyzed. By distinguishing the lithologies, the equations for the
   Young's moduli of tight sandstones and shales were established based on
   the Hoek-Brown criterion. The Young's modulus can be expressed using
   only the longitudinal wave velocity (V-p). A significant negative
   correlation exists between the Poisson's ratio and Young's modulus;
   therefore, the Poisson's ratio can be evaluated from the Young's
   modulus. The errors of the Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio predicted
   by the proposed assessment method are small, which meets engineering
   requirements and validates the accuracy of the method. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional lattice structures with specific geometric features have
   been reported to have a negative Poisson's ratio, termed as auxetic
   metamaterials, that is, stretching-induced expansion in the transversal
   direction. In this paper, we designed a novel auxetic metamaterial; by
   utilizing the shape memory effect of the constituent materials, the
   in-plane moduli and Poisson's ratios can be continuously tailored.
   During deformation, the curved meshes ensure the rotation of the mesh
   joints to achieve auxetics. The rotations of these mesh joints are
   governed by the mesh curvature, which continuously changes during
   deformation. Because of the shape memory effect, the mesh curvature
   after printing can be programmed, which can be used to tune the rotation
   of the mesh joints and the mechanical properties of auxetic metamaterial
   structures, including Poisson's ratios, moduli, and fracture strains.
   Using the finite element method, the deformation of these auxetic meshes
   was analyzed. Finally, we designed and fabricated gradient/digital
   patterns and cylindrical shells and used the auxetics and shape memory
   effects to reshape the printed structures.}},

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional hierarchical re-entrant honeycomb structures were
   designed and the mechanical behaviors of the structures were studied
   using a finite element method. Hierarchical re-entrant structure of
   order n (n >= 1) was constructed by replacing each vertex of a lower
   order (n - 1) hierarchical re-entrant structure with a smaller
   re-entrant hexagon with identical strut aspect ratio. The Poisson's
   ratio and energy absorption capacity of re-entrant structures of
   different hierarchical orders were studied under different compression
   velocities. The results showed that the Poisson's ratio of the first and
   second order hierarchical structures can reach -1.36 and -1.33 with
   appropriate aspect ratio, 13.8\% and 12.1\% lower than that of the
   zeroth order hierarchical structure. The energy absorption capacity of
   the three models increased with an increasing compression velocity; the
   second order hierarchical structure exhibited the highest rate of
   increase in energy absorption capacity with an increasing compression
   velocity. The plateau stresses of the first and second order
   hierarchical structures were slightly lower than that of the zeroth
   order hierarchical structure; however the second order hierarchical
   structure exhibited the highest energy absorption capacity at high
   compression velocity (60 m s(-1)).}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this work was to propose a method for dynamic testing
   of Poisson's ratio of dimension lumber. Based on the first-order bending
   mode shape of cantilever slab, Sitka Spruce was selected as research
   object using instruments including four-channel dynamic resistance
   strain gauge and CRAS vibration and a set of collection-analysis system
   for dynamic signal. Free vibration of cantilever specimen of Sitka
   Spruce and mild steel can be stimulated by knocking, and the fundamental
   vibration should be reserved by filtering processing. Additionally,
   decaying curve of oscillatory waves for transverse and longitudinal
   strain of fundamental vibration should also be recorded and displayed.
   Obtained from the positive (negative) peak in oscillatory wave curve for
   transverse strain, Poisson's ratios along grain and across grain on
   radial section and that across grain on transverse section of Sitka
   Spruce specimens were measured. Then measured results were applied to
   analyse the accuracy of calculated modulus of elasticity obtained by
   plugging the first-order bending frequency measured by cantilever slab
   into equation of cantilever beam, and this method is proved to be robust
   and accurate. The method based on first-order bending mode shape of
   cantilever slab to measure dimension lumber Poisson's ratio is efficient
   and simple, with good repeatability and high accuracy. Besides, the same
   method was also applied to test Poisson's ratio of mild steel to
   validate the correctness of the method on wood. It is observed that the
   positive (negative) peak in oscillatory wave curve for transverse strain
   is corresponding to that for longitudinal strain, meaning that the phase
   difference, between oscillatory wave curves for transverse strain and
   longitudinal strain, is 180 degrees, or that transverse strain and
   longitudinal strain are reversed. The average value should be taken
   after calculating the ratios between peak-to-peak values read from the
   first channel and the second channel in oscillatory wave curve. The
   results show that the Poisson's ratio along grain of Sitka Spruce
   specimen is one order higher than that across grain, which indicates the
   anisotropy of wood. The test results validated that the elastic modulus
   of the lumber can be accurately derived by substituting the first-order
   fixed frequency, measured with the cantilever plate of Sitka Spruce
   specimen, into the cantilever theoretical equation. This research can
   provide reference to practical measurement and assessment of mechanical
   properties of wood and steel.}},

Abstract = {{A class of three-dimensional lattice structures of cubic symmetry is
   designed by spatially assembling and merging a number of two-dimensional

   Particularly, they possess negative effective Poisson's ratios. If the
   inclined and non-inclined walls are of dissimilar thermal expansion
   coefficients, they can further attain isotropic negative or positive
   effective thermal expansion coefficients with a magnitude as large as
   several to dozens of times that of the constituent materials. Owing to
   these novel properties, they are well suitable as structural or

Abstract = {{Materials and structures with negative Poisson's ratio exhibit a
   counter-intuitive behaviour. Under uniaxial compression (tension), these
   materials and structures contract (expand) transversely. The materials
   and structures that possess this feature are also termed as `auxetics'.
   Many desirable properties resulting from this uncommon behaviour are
   reported. These superior properties offer auxetics broad potential
   applications in the fields of smart filters, sensors, medical devices
   and protective equipment. However, there are still challenging problems
   which impede a wider application of auxetic materials. This review paper
   mainly focuses on the relationships among structures, materials,
   properties and applications of auxetic metamaterials and structures. The
   previous works of auxetics are extensively reviewed, including different
   auxetic cellular models, naturally observed auxetic behaviour, different
   desirable properties of auxetics, and potential applications. In
   particular, metallic auxetic materials and a methodology for generating
   3D metallic auxetic materials are reviewed in details. Although most of
   the literature mentions that auxetic materials possess superior
   properties, very few types of auxetic materials have been fabricated and
   implemented for practical applications. Here, the challenges and future
   work on the topic of auxetics are also presented to inspire prospective
   research work. This review article covers the most recent progress of
   auxetic metamaterials and auxetic structures. More importantly, several
   drawbacks of auxetics are also presented to caution researchers in the
   future study.}},

Abstract = {{Nature has evolved with a recurring strategy to achieve unusual
   mechanical properties through coupling variable elastic moduli from a
   few GPa to below KPa within a single tissue. The ability to produce
   multi-material, three-dimensional (3D) micro-architectures with high
   fidelity incorporating dissimilar components has been a major challenge
   in man-made materials. Here we show multimodulus metamaterials whose
   architectural element is comprised of encoded elasticity ranging from
   rigid to soft. We found that, in contrast to ordinary architected
   materials whose negative Poisson's ratio is dictated by their geometry,
   these type of metamaterials are capable of displaying Poisson's ratios
   from extreme negative to zero, independent of their 3D
   micro-architecture. The resulting low density metamaterials is capable
   of achieving functionally graded, distributed strain amplification
   capabilities within the metamaterial with uniform micro-architectures.
   Simultaneous tuning of Poisson's ratio and moduli within the 3D
   multi-materials could open up a broad array of material by design
   applications ranging from flexible armor, artificial muscles, to
   actuators and bio-mimetic materials.}},

Abstract = {{The ship's pedestal is the connection structure between the ship's
   equipment and the hull, and is also the basis for the installation of
   the equipment. The pedestal bears both the static load generated by the
   weight of the equipment and the dynamic load generated during the
   operation of the equipment, and at the same time transmits the external
   load received by the hull to the equipment, and the load it bears is
   very complicated. If there is a problem with the pedestal in an impact
   environment, the accuracy of the system equipment will be affected, the
   system equipment will not work properly. Negative Poisson's ration
   structures have a unique set of properties because of their tensile
   expansion, such as increased shear modulus, enhanced fracture toughness,
   better energy absorption and co-curvature. In recent years, the negative
   Poisson's ration honeycomb structure has been applied to the pedestal of
   marine equipment, which demonstrates good vibration damping effect.
   However, the pedestal has two functions: vibration damping and impact
   resistance, there is not much research on the impact resistance of the
   pedestal. In this paper, an ``arrow-shaped{''} honeycomb pedestal is
   taken as the research object. Firstly, the analytical expression of the
   Poisson's ration of the honeycomb pedestal is derived theoretically and
   the influence of each parameter on the Poisson's ration is analyzed.
   Secondly, the effect of Poisson's ration on the impact resistance of the
   pedestal was analyzed by ensuring that the pedestal height was constant.
   It was found that with the reduction of Poisson's ration, the impact
   resistance of the pedestal and the output impact environment of the
   pedestal panel were effectively optimized. Finally, by ensuring that the
   height of the pedestal is constant and the Poisson's ration is the same,
   the influence of the number of honeycomb layers on the impact resistance
   of the pedestal is analyzed.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials or structures on the application of a tensile or
   compressive load expand or contract laterally, respectively. Over the
   years, multiple auxetic structures have been proposed. The most studied
   type is the re-entrant honeycomb model. In this work, a novel modified
   re-entrant honeycomb model is proposed to improve the elastic properties
   of the structure by adding additional members to the unit cell.
   Analytical equations for the Poisson's ratio, strain, deflection and
   Young's modulus are derived in two orthogonal directions. The proposed
   model provides significantly higher values of Negative Poisson's Ratio
   (NPR) for the same relative density in loading in one direction at the
   cost of other orthogonal direction when compared to the existing
   re-entrant honeycomb model. The results are evaluated for multiple
   geometric parameters for the calculation of NPR. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Materials with negative Poisson's ratios (auxetic) get fatter when
   stretched and thinner when compressed. This paper discusses a new
   explanation for achieving auxetic behaviour in foam cellular materials,
   namely a `rotation of rigid units' mechanism. Such auxetic cellular
   materials can be produced from conventional open-cell cellular materials
   if the ribs of cell are slightly thicker in the proximity of the joints
   when compared to the centre of the ribs with the consequence that if the
   conventional cellular material is volumetrically compressed (and then
   `frozen' in the compressed conformation), the cellular structure will
   deform in such a way which conserves the geometry at the joints (i.e.
   behave like `rigid units') whilst the major deformations will occur
   along the length of the more flexible ribs which form `kinks' at their
   centres as a result of the extensive buckling. It is proposed that
   uniaxial tensile loading of such cellular systems will result auxetic
   behaviour due to re-unfolding of these `kinks' and re-rotation of the
   `rigid joints'. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Based on lightweight design concepts, lattices are increasingly
   considered as internal structures. This work deals with the simulation
   of periodically constructed lattices to characterize their behaviour
   under different loadings considering various material models. A
   thermo-mechanical analysis was done, which is resulting in negative
   CLTE-values (Coefficient of Linear Thermal Expansion). Simulations with
   linear-elastic behaviour were evaluated regarding the tensile,
   compression and shear modulus and the Poisson's ratio. Some of the
   investigated structures behave auxetic. Beside the linear elastic
   behaviour, also the hyper-elastic and visco-elastic behaviour of some
   structures were investigated. Furthermore, elasto-plastic simulations
   were performed where the applied loading was biaxial. As a result the
   initial yield surfaces were presented. The individual RVEs

Abstract = {{Mechanical metamaterials exhibit unusual mechanical properties that
   originate from their topological design. Origami graphene may provide a
   platform for constructing novel carbon nanostructures. In the current
   study, a novel composite material that incorporates aligned graphene
   with localized origami shapes into the copper matrix is designed. Unlike
   many auxetic materials that have void phase, the proposed layer-by-layer
   assembled composite material appears to be solid in the microscopic
   scale. Based on the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, it is observed
   that depending on the origami shapes, the in-plane Poisson's ratio of
   origami graphene reinforced copper (100) composites can be tuned from
   positive to negative and, more importantly, it is discovered that the
   Young's modulus of the graphene/Cu composites can also be tuned from
   positive to negative in certain in-plane directions.}},

Month = {{JUN 15}},
Abstract = {{The effective elastic properties 3-layered plates consisting of auxetic
   and nonauxetic cubic crystals are investigated based on stretching and
   bending modes. In many cases effective Young's modulus is higher than
   Young's modulus of the stiffest layer with sufficiently thick auxetic
   layers. In stretching, 3-layered nonauxetic-auxetic-nonauxetic plates
   exhibit positive out-of-plane Poisson's ratio. In-plane Poisson's ratios
   are negative in the case of relatively soft nonauxetic layers and
   positive for stiff nonauxetics. The effective Young's moduli can exceed
   the original Young's moduli of all three layers of the
   auxetic-nonauxetic-auxetic category. For this category, both effective
   Poisson's ratios are negative more often and in-plane Poisson's ratio
   increases with Young's moduli of the original nonauxetics.
   In addition to well-known Poisson's ratio under stretching, the concept
   of Poisson's ratio under pure bending is introduced. There is a large
   difference between them in the case of 3-layered plate. Effective
   in-plane Poisson's ratio for symmetrical 3-layered plates are different
   depending on the loading mode, i.e. the outer layers exert a greater
   influence under bending mode in comparison to stretching mode.
   Therefore, nonauxetic-auxetic-non-auxetic cubic plates exhibit an
   overall auxetic and nonauxetic behaviour under stretching and bending
   modes, respectively, while the reverse is true for
   auxetic-nonauxetic-auxetic cubic plates.}},

Abstract = {{The strain-dependent behaviour characteristic of auxetic (i.e. having a
   negative Poisson's ratio) polymers has been modelled using a simple
   geometric model which consists of rectangular nodules interconnected by
   fibrils. Careful consideration of the correct form of the model to use
   depending on the experimental method employed to test samples of auxetic
   ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) has resulted in very
   good agreement between the experimental and theoretical Poisson's ratios
   and total engineering strain ratios when the deformation is
   predominantly due to hinging of the fibrils.
   Auxetic UHMWPE has been processed to yield a very wide range of
   Poisson's ratios depending on its microstructural parameters (i.e.
   nodule shape and size, fibril length and the angle between the fibril
   and nodule). These can be predicted using the model, allowing the
   possibility of tailoring Poisson's ratio of the material.}},

   naturally occurring auxetic material which has attracted a lot of
   research in recent years is alpha-cristobalite, a silicate for which
   negative Poisson's ratios have been experimentally measured. We present
   the results of force-field based molecular modelling studies which will
   provide an insight into nano-level deformations that occur when this
   silicate is subjected to externally applied uniaxial mechanical
   stresses. These results will suggest that the auxetic behaviour can be
   explained in terms of a `rotation of rigid units' model and, more
   specifically we will show that the auxetic behaviour in the (010) and
   (100) planes may be explained in terms of `rotating rectangles' which
   are the projections of the three-dimensional silicate framework in the
   (010) and (100) planes. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{12}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{An incremental (or tangent) bulk modulus for finite isotropic elasticity
   is defined which compares an increment in hydrostatic pressure with the
   corresponding increment in relative volume. Its positivity provides a
   stringent criterion for physically reasonable response involving the
   second derivatives of the strain energy function. Also, an average (or
   secant) bulk modulus is defined by comparing the current stress with the
   relative volume change. The positivity of this bulk modulus provides a
   physically reasonable response criterion less stringent than the former.
   The concept of incremental bulk modulus is extended to anisotropic
   elasticity. For states of uniaxial tension an incremental Poisson's
   ratio and an incremental Young's modulus are similarly defined for
   nonlinear isotropic elasticity and have properties similar to those of
   the incremental bulk modulus. The incremental Poisson's ratios for the
   isotropic constraints of incompressibility, Bell, Ericksen, and constant
   area are considered. The incremental moduli are all evaluated for a
   specific example of the compressible neo-Hookean solid. Bounds on the
   ground state Lame elastic moduli, assumed positive, are given which are
   sufficient to guarantee the positivity of the incremental bulk and
   Young's moduli for all strains. However, although the ground state
   Poisson's ratio is positive we find that the incremental Poisson's ratio
   becomes negative for large enough axial extensions.}},

Abstract = {{The main content dealt with in the paper was to present a flexible
   auxetic re-entrant honeycomb fabric, which was made of a formulated
   thermoplastic polyurethane material PolyFlex with super elastic
   properties by 3D printing technology. The auxetic fabric shows
   perpendicular expansion under tension and is flexible. So. its special
   property makes auxetic fabric have great potential in future functional
   materials. Wherein, the honeycomb cell angle is a key factor affecting
   Poisson's ratio of fabric. In this paper, flexible re-entrant honeycomb
   structures with different cell angle are manufactured using 3D printing
   technology. The shape change under tension of two directions were
   investigated. The re-entrant honeycomb structures presented negative
   Poisson's ratio immediately when stretched. The shape change consisted
   of three stages in X-1-direction, the same as that in X-2-direction. A
   noticeable discovery was that the shape change in X-1-direction posed an
   out-plane change after the first shape change stage, while the shape
   change in X-2-direction always remained in-plane in the whole tension
   process. The tensile modulus tested was consistent with the tendency of
   theoretical analysis of previous work. The bending rigidities were
   tested and similar to fabrics of poplin and denim. The results indicate
   that the auxetic fabric is suitable for special clothing.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials and structures exhibit the very unusual property of
   becoming wider when stretched and narrower when squashed (i.e. they have
   a negative `Poisson's ratio'). This property results in many beneficial
   effects in the characteristics of the system that make auxetics superior
   to conventional systems in many practical and high tech applications,
   including aeronautics where, for example, auxetics are being proposed as
   potential components for the production of better quality lifting
   devices such as helicopter rotor blades or airplane wings. This work
   reviews and discusses the behaviour of known and novel cellular systems,
   which exhibit this unusual but highly desirable property.}},

   by taking into account the different types of deformations acting inside
   the cell walls. The curved wall honeycomb possesses higher magnitudes of
   the Poisson's ratio (12) in the auxetic configuration compared to
   classical center symmetric configuration with straight cell wall. The
   presence of the curvature also allows creating configurations with
   positive Poisson's ratio even for negative internal cell angles, and
   makes this honeycomb design attractive for mechanical tailoring.}},

   fluctuation is proportional to the thickness of the HSPS, but the

   Total and local Poisson's ratios of HSPS at the 30 degrees polar angle
   are lower than those obtained at the 0 degrees polar angle over the

Abstract = {{Elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio of diamond-like carbon (DLC) film
   was measured by a simple method using DLC bridges which are free from
   mechanical constraint of substrate. The DLC films were deposited on Si
   wafer by C6H6 r.f. glow discharge at the deposition pressure 1.33 Pa.
   Because of the high residual compressive stress of the film, the bridge
   exhibited a sinusoidal displacement by removing the constraint of the
   substrate. By measuring the amplitude with known bridge length, we could
   determine the strain of the film required to adhere to the substrate.
   Combined with independent stress measurement by laser reflection method,
   this method allows calculation of the biaxial elastic modulus, E/(1-nu),
   where E is the elastic modulus and nu Poisson's ratio of the DLC film.
   By comparing the biaxial elastic modulus with plane-strain modulus,
   E/(1-nu(2)), measured by nano-indentation, we could further determine
   the elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio, independently. The elastic
   modulus, E, increased From 87 to 133 GPa as the negative bias voltage
   increased from 400 to 550 V. Poisson's ratio was estimated to be about
   0.20 in this bias voltage range. For the negative bias voltages less
   than 400 V, however, the present method resulted in negative Poisson's
   ratio which is physically impossible. The limitation of the present
   method was also discussed.}},

   ratio}},
Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{22}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel honeycomb structure that exhibits a negative
   Poisson's ratio (NPR). In contrast to other NPR honeycomb structures
   studied in the past, the new structure can be easily fabricated using
   conventional technology and materials on a large scale of production
   with a low cost. The geometry of the structure is first described, and
   then an elastic analysis based on standard beam theory is carried out to
   establish the relation of its Young's modulus with relevant geometrical
   parameters and material properties. The effects of the geometrical
   parameters in non-dimensional forms on the Young's modulus of the
   structure are discussed. The compressive tests were performed on samples
   of the structure made with the same aluminum alloy but with different
   geometrical parameters to verify the theoretical analysis. The results
   obtained from both the theoretical calculations and experiments show
   that the proposed NPR honeycomb structure has a very obvious NPR
   behavior. Moreover, its elastic modulus is significantly affected by its
   geometrical parameters, and can be optimized for specific applications
   through the design and control of honeycomb geometry parameters.}},

Abstract = {{Negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) material attracts a lot of attentions for
   its unique mechanical properties. However, achieving NPR is at the
   expense of reducing Young's modulus. It has been observed that the
   composite stiffness can be enhanced when blending positive Poisson's
   ratio (PPR) material into NPR material. Based on the respective
   interpolation of Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio, two concurrent
   topology optimization problems with different types of constraints,
   called Problem A and B, are respectively discussed to explore the
   Poisson's ratio effect in porous microstructure. In Problem A, the
   volume constraints are respectively imposed on macro and micro
   structures; in Problem B, besides setting an upper bound on the total
   available base materials, the micro thermal insulation capability is
   considered as well. Besides considering the influence of micro thermal
   insulation capability on the optimized results in Problem B, the similar
   and dissimilar influences of Poisson's ratios, volume fractions in
   Problem A and B are also investigated through several 2D and 3D
   numerical examples. It is observed that the concurrent structural
   stiffness resulting from the mixture of PPR and NPR base materials can
   exceed the concurrent structural stiffness composed of any individual
   base material.}},

   half-space is considered in the small-scale contact range. Based on the
   first-order asymptotic solution, a simple analytical approximation is
   suggested for the indentation scaling factor that takes into account the
   elastic layer's finite thickness as well as the effect of the elastic
   substrate. The influence of both Poisson's ratios on the substrate
   effect is studied in detail, and the error of the 1/10 rule of Buckle is
   estimated for a relatively large range of the elastic moduli mismatch.

Abstract = {{A new kind of chiral stent was designed by three-dimensional lozenge
   grid structure structure with four ligaments. Based on the conventional
   beam theory and energy conservation principle, in-plane Poisson's ratio
   and equivalent Young's modulus are derived, and finite element analysis
   was employed to validate the analytical estimates of the elastic module.
   Then the FEM models are used to investigate the elastic deformation
   behaviours of lozenge grid structure. The calculated results of
   equivalent elastic modulus based on beam theory are in consistent with
   those obtained by finite element method. The theoretical and numerical
   results show that lozenge grid structure stent proposed in this paper is
   negative Poisson's ratio material. The presented theory could be used in
   designing new hierarchical honeycomb structures for multifunctional
   applications.}},

Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{A theoretical analysis of longitudinal stretching of a thin rectangular
   two-layered plate formed of hexagonal crystals with the same orientation
   is given. The effective elastic properties (Young's modulus and
   Poisson's ratios) of the plate are dependent on such properties of the
   constituent crystal as the sign and value of Poisson's ratios, the ratio
   of Young's moduli and the ratio of the thicknesses of the layers. These
   dependencies can be either simple or complex. It is shown that effective
   Young's modulus of the two-layered plate always exceeds the result
   calculated by the rule of mixtures of Voigt. For small differences
   between Young's moduli (or Poisson's ratios) of the initial crystals,
   the accuracy of predicting effective Young's modulus by the rule of
   mixtures turns out to be quite satisfactory. Effective in-plane
   Poisson's ratio can be either larger or smaller than the prediction by
   the rule of mixtures. Special results were obtained for plates of the
   auxetic-nonauxetic type. In the case of plates with varying layers
   thickness ratios, the increase in the thickness of the auxetic layer
   makes it possible to control the value of negative effective in-plane
   Poisson's ratio of the two-layered auxetic-nonauxetic plate.}},

Title = {{Directional instability-driven strain-dependent 3D auxetic metamaterials}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{199}},
Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic metamaterials have received increasing interest due to their
   distinct mechanical properties. However, most developed auxetic
   metamaterials feature a uniform auxeticity in the elastic deformation
   stage, which limits their functional applications. Here, based on
   double-elliptic-ring (DER) partial auxetic structures, an enhanced
   double-elliptic-ring (EDER) structure with strain-dependent auxeticity
   is introduced. The proposed EDERs consist of DERs and an enhanced
   structure (ES). Under compression, the ES will exhibit directional
   instability owing to the shrinking of DERs, and these directional
   instabilities will enhance the auxetic behaviors of EDERs. Analytical
   and simulation models are carried out to explore the equivalent Young?s
   modulus and Poisson?s ratio of EDERs and are validated via experiments.
   The results show that the strain value in the shrinking direction is
   different in different regions due to the directional instability of the
   ES which occurs layer by layer. By varying the geometric parameters of
   the ES of the EDERs, its deformation can be programmed and EDERs display
   varying localized deformation mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{Fabrics with zero or negative Poisson's ratio are referred as auxetic
   fabrics, which have the unusual property of lateral expansion or zero

   to produce auxetic fabrics has gained the interest of researchers in
   recent years. However, this approach is limited to knitted fabrics only.
   The development of auxetic fabric using conventional yarns and weaving
   technology is a research area that is still unaddressed. This paper
   reports a study on the development of a novel class of stretchable
   auxetic woven fabrics by using conventional yarns and weaving machinery.
   The phenomenon of differential shrinkage was successfully employed to
   realize auxetic geometries capable of inducing auxetic behavior in woven
   fabrics, and a series of auxetic woven fabrics were fabricated with
   elastic and non-elastic yarns and a dobby machine. The uni-axial tensile
   tests showed that auxetic woven fabrics developed exhibited zero or

Abstract = {{Helical auxetic yarn (HAY) is a newly developed composite yarn with

   Results revealed that the utilization of the fine steel multifilament in
   the developed HAY samples enormously improves the stiffness of HAY. It

Journal = {{THIN-WALLED STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{149}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic honeycombs exhibit low weight, shear stiffness, and excellent
   energy absorption capacity and thus have great potential for achieving
   the requirements of crashworthiness and lightweight in automotive
   fields. This work presents a novel auxetic structure called the
   star-triangular honeycomb (STH), in which the horizontal and vertical
   ligaments of the star honeycombs (SH) are replaced with triangular
   structures. The dynamic crushing behaviors of the STH under three
   different crushing velocities were investigated using 1D shock theory.
   The results show that the STH has a more obvious negative Poisson's
   ratio effect than the SH and that transverse contraction mainly occurs
   in the first plateau stage. Theoretical models were deduced based on the
   collapse mechanism of the typical unit revealed by numerical simulation
   for STH crushing strength prediction. The theoretical predictions agreed
   well with the simulation results, and two different plateau stresses
   appeared under low-velocity crushing. In addition, the influences of the
   STH geometric parameters and crushing velocity on the energy-absorbing
   capacity and densification strain were systematically explored. The
   parameter analysis indicated that the effects of the cell-wall thickness
   and incline angle on the dynamic response and energy absorption capacity
   of the STH under low-and medium-velocity crushing are more significant
   than those under high-velocity crushing. Moreover, the STH showed better
   energy absorption capacity than the SH. Thus, this design is expected to
   provide a novel means of improving the mechanical properties of
   honeycombs.}},

Abstract = {{The unusual thermal expansion properties of a prototype nanoporous,
   crystalline solid have been determined by studying epitaxially grown,
   highly oriented thin films rigidly anchored to a solid substrate using
   out-of-plane and in-plane X-ray diffraction (XRD). The analysis of the
   data for the particular metal organic frameworks (MOFs) studied here,
   HKUST-I, reveals a thermal expansion which is negative for the direction
   perpendicular and positive for the direction parallel to the substrate
   surface. The corresponding anisotropic coefficients of thermal expansion
   (CTE) amount to (-75 +/- 16) x 10(-6) K-1 in the direction perpendicular
   to the substrate and to (11.7 +/- 3.7) x 10(-6) K-1 in the direction
   parallel to the substrate surface. These values substantially differ
   from the intrinsic CTE, measured for powder MOFs (-4.1 x 10(-6) K-1).
   The substrate-induced anisotropic thermal expansion allows for a direct
   measurement of the Poisson's ratio of MOF materials, which is hardly
   measurable for powder MOFs. The Poisson's ratio of HKUST-1 was
   determined to be 0.69 +/- 0.37. Furthermore, thermal cycling experiments
   of the HKUST-1 SURMOFs reveal a pronounced stability, a necessary
   requirement for using MOFs in thermal response sensor devices and for
   high-temperature membrane separation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Auxetic (negative Poisson's ratio) and gradient open cell foams have
   shown promise for their conformability and high impact energy
   absorption-useful in applications like protective equipment, footwear

   the cell structure of auxetic closed cell foam, to produce novel
   intentionally anisotropic and gradient auxetic closed cell foam. Pins
   passed through the foam constrained or stretched regions during steaming
   to further modify cell structure, and impart gradients in cell
   structure, Young's modulus and Poisson's ratios. Fabricated foams had
   Poisson's ratios between 1 and -1. Imparted Young's moduli of 1-12 MPa
   were similar to foams used in footwear, prosthesis, helmets and other
   impact protection. The effect of changes to cell structure on Young's
   moduli and Poisson's ratio are explained by combining analytical models
   of auxetic open cell and conventional closed cell foam.}},

Title = {{Sample size determination for a three-arm equivalence trial of Poisson

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOPHARMACEUTICAL STATISTICS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{2, SI}},
Pages = {{239-256}},
Abstract = {{Assessing equivalence or similarity has drawn much attention recently as
   many drug products have lost or will lose their patents in the next few
   years, especially certain best-selling biologics. To claim equivalence
   between the test treatment and the reference treatment when assay
   sensitivity is well established from historical data, one has to
   demonstrate both superiority of the test treatment over placebo and
   equivalence between the test treatment and the reference treatment.
   Thus, there is urgency for practitioners to derive a practical way to
   calculate sample size for a three-arm equivalence trial. The primary
   endpoints of a clinical trial may not always be continuous, but may be
   discrete. In this paper, the authors derive power function and discuss
   sample size requirement for a three-arm equivalence trial with Poisson
   and negative binomial clinical endpoints. In addition, the authors
   examine the effect of the dispersion parameter on the power and the
   sample size by varying its coefficient from small to large. In extensive
   numerical studies, the authors demonstrate that required sample size
   heavily depends on the dispersion parameter. Therefore, misusing a
   Poisson model for negative binomial data may easily lose power up to
   20\%, depending on the value of the dispersion parameter.}},

Abstract = {{Honeycombs or foams with reentrant microstructures exhibit effective

   be enhanced. By combining the filler and skeleton, the hierarchical
   composite materials are constructed. The magnitude of the enhancement
   depends on inner and outer filler's modulus mismatch, as well as the
   types of filling. Filler's auxeticity also largely enhances overall
   auxeticity of the outer- and all-filled honeycomb. In addition, for
   outer-filled honeycomb, its effective viscoelastic modulus and damping
   are significantly increased, while maintaining relatively light weight,
   due to local stress concentration.}},

   Poisson's ratio and enhanced energy absorption}},
Journal = {{THIN-WALLED STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{160}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{In order to improve the energy absorption capacity of the honeycomb, a
   combined auxetic honeycomb is designed in this paper. By using the
   double-inclined walls replacing the horizontal walls of the star-shaped
   honeycomb (SSH), and introducing a thin-walled circle contacting with
   the four concave corners of the SSH, the star-circle honeycomb (SCH) is
   designed. The in-plane dynamic crushing behaviors was explored based on
   finite element method (FEM). There are three types of deformation modes
   observed with different impact velocity, including low-, medium- and
   high-velocity loading modes and the stress-strain curve exhibits two
   plateau stress stages. Based on the deformation characteristics of the
   representative unit, theoretical calculation models were established to
   estimate the plateau stress of the SCH under lowand high-velocity
   loading according the conservation of energy and the theoretical
   calculation was in keep well with the numerical simulation. A
   deformation modes map was summarized to investigate the effects of the
   impact velocity and the relative density on the deformation modes and
   the energy absorption capability and the dynamic Poisson's ratio were
   studied. The result shows that the SCH presents better energy absorption
   compared with SSH as well as retaining the negative Poisson's ratio
   property. The deformation mechanism was revealed form the structural
   design and plastic hinge dissipation. This work presents a different
   design strategy for the auxetic honeycomb, expected to guide the design
   of more novel auxetic with better energy absorption and mechanical
   property.}},

   Self-Avoiding Membranes under Conditions of Non-Zero Anisotropic Strain}},

Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{8}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Entropic surfaces represented by fluctuating two-dimensional (2D)
   membranes are predicted to have desirable mechanical properties when
   unstressed, including a negative Poisson's ratio ({''}auxetic{''}
   behavior). Herein, we present calculations of the strain-dependent
   Poisson ratio of self-avoiding 2D membranes demonstrating desirable
   auxetic properties over a range of mechanical strain. Finite size
   membranes with unclamped boundary conditions have positive Poisson's
   ratio due to spontaneous non-zero mean curvature, which can be
   suppressed with an explicit bending rigidity in agreement with prior
   findings. Applying longitudinal strain along a singular axis to this
   system suppresses this mean curvature and the entropic out-of-plane
   fluctuations, resulting in a molecular-scale mechanism for realizing a
   negative Poisson's ratio above a critical strain, with values
   significantly more negative than the previously observed zero-strain
   limit for infinite sheets. We find that auxetic behavior persists over
   surprisingly high strains of more than 20\% for the smallest surfaces,
   with desirable finite-size scaling producing surfaces with negative
   Poisson's ratio over a wide range of strains. These results promise the
   design of surfaces and composite materials with tunable Poisson's ratio
   by prestressing platelet inclusions or controlling the surface rigidity
   of a matrix of 2D materials.}},

Pages = {{182-191}},

Abstract = {{An auxetic braided structure was developed in our previous work for
   overcoming the slippage problem encountered in the double-helix yarn.
   However, the influences of the micro-geometric parameters on the
   macroscopic behavior, which are significant for the structure's design
   and application, have not been addressed yet. By using a standard
   tubular braiding technology, several samples of the auxetic braided
   structure were fabricated in this work and the design concept and
   manufacture process were described in detail. Then, systematic
   parameters studies were completed through experimentally validated
   finite element models. The study showed that the braided structure could
   achieve a robust auxetic behavior and its Poisson's ratio and stiffness
   were strongly dependent on their initial micro-geometric parameters,
   especially initial braiding angle and diameter of component yarns. A
   maximum negative Poisson's ratio of -9.49 could be achieved by lowering
   the angle value to 15 degrees. Higher negative Poisson's ratio effect
   could be obtained with grosser stiff yarn and finer elastic yarns.
   However, the existence of the elastic wraps would diminish the
   auxeticity of the braided structure, which should be taken into
   consideration in design and application.}},

Abstract = {{Poisson's ratio is the ratio of the displacement in the lateral
   direction to the displacement in the longitudinal direction when a
   material is deformed. The value of Poisson's ratio is constant for
   isotropic and homogeneous materials. The range of Poisson's ratio varies
   from -1 to 0.5 theoretically, but the value is typically positive.
   Recently, negative Poisson's ratios have attracted significant attention
   to researchers. Negative values are observed in some artificial
   structures; however, these structures do not exhibit isotropic
   characteristics. In this study, the characteristics of negative
   Poisson's ratios were investigated, and it was found that reentrant
   lattice structures can have negative Poisson's ratio values. Conceptual
   design for such structures was carried out, and detailed design
   considering the isotropic characteristics was performed through
   optimization to extremize the negative value of the Poisson's ratio. The
   optimization formulation was defined, and the size/shape structural
   optimization techniques were employed in finalizing the structures.}},

Title = {{Enhancement of Young's moduli and auxetic windows in laminates with

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},

Volume = {{58}},
Pages = {{95-114}},

Abstract = {{Recently an enhancement of certain mechanical properties of composites
   have been shown to be attained by the introduction of auxetic phases
   (materials with negative Poisson's value) such as indentation
   resistance, fracture toughness and improved energy absorption. Here one
   aim is to use well-known closed-form formulas for the effective
   stiffness and engineering constants of a periodic composite where the
   repetitive cell is a laminate of n elastic isotropic constituents. The
   formulas are given as a function of the elastic stiffnesses or in terms
   of the engineering constants of the constituents and their volume
   fraction. Effective mechanical properties are independent of the order
   in which the laminas are taken. In order to confirm the theoretical
   formulas and show them reliable, comparisons with two independent
   numerical calculations using finite element are given. They are
   excellent. For a bilaminate the conditions by which Young's moduli are
   enhanced are given. Also we provide expressions for auxetic and
   enhancement windows. The stiffness constants exhibit certain
   characteristics associated with auxetics such as the negatively of
   non-diagonal components of the stiffness tensor. It is shown that the
   laminas combination of positive-positive materials may be produce
   enhancement of Young's moduli as some auxetic-auxetic ones. The relative
   indentation compliance of a circular punch upon transversely isotropic
   medium is calculated using Fabrikant's formulas. Two different
   indentations are considered. In one the indenter and the bilaminate are
   frictionless contact and in the other they are bonded. The indentation
   attains the asymptotic limits of Boussinesq or Mossakovskii-Spence when
   the auxetic phase is very thin compared with the width of the
   non-auxetic phase and in the opposite case. The results given here may
   be of interest in practical applications using composites with auxetic
   constituents when the microstructure is small compared with the
   dimensions of the laminate. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The synthesized understanding of the mechanical properties of negative
   Poisson's ratio (NPR) convex-concave honeycomb tubes (CCHTs) under
   quasi-static and dynamic compression loads is of great significance for
   their multifunctional applications in mechanical, aerospace, aircraft,
   and biomedical fields. In this paper, the quasi-static and dynamic
   compression tests of three kinds of 3D-printed NPR convex-concave
   honeycomb tubes are carried out. The sinusoidal honeycomb wall with
   equal mass is used to replace the cell wall structure of the
   conventional square honeycomb tube (CSHT). The influence of geometric
   morphology on the elastic modulus, peak force, energy absorption, and
   damage mode of the tube was discussed. The experimental results show
   that the NPR, peak force, failure mode, and energy absorption of CCHTs
   can be adjusted by changing the geometric topology of the sinusoidal
   element. Through the reasonable design of NPR, compared with the equal
   mass CSHTs, CCHTs could have the comprehensive advantages of relatively
   high stiffness and strength, enhanced energy absorption, and damage
   resistance. The results of this paper are expected to be meaningful for
   the optimization design of tubular structures widely used in mechanical,
   aerospace, vehicle, biomedical engineering, etc.}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The crystal structure and mechanical properties of silver oxalate,
   AgC2O4, are determined using first-principles solid-state methods. The
   set of calculated mechanical properties include the bulk modulus and its
   pressure derivatives, the Young and shear moduli, the Poisson's Ratio
   and the ductility, hardness, and anisotropy indices. Silver oxalate is a
   highly anisotropic brittle material possessing a small bulk modulus of
   approximate to 9.6 GPa. It displays the negative Poisson's ratio (NPR)
   phenomenon, the value of the lowest NPR having a very large magnitude,
   -1.27. Besides, it exhibits the most extreme form of the negative linear
   compressibility (NLC) phenomenon found to date. Silver oxalate displays
   anisotropic NLC for external pressures in the range -0.1 to -2.4 GPa
   directed along the {[}010] crystallographic direction and isotropic NLC
   for isotropic pressures in the range -0.51 to 13.4 GPa. The lowest value
   of the negative compressibility, -831.9 +/- 10 TPa-1, is found for an
   isotropic pressure of -0.16 GPa. The absolute value of the computed
   lowest NLC is extremely large, about three times larger than the
   absolute value ofthe lowest NLC found so far. The NLC pressure range is
   also very wide, its width being more than two times the largest range
   found to date.}},

Abstract = {{Poisson's ratio is one of the fundamental features of materials,

   novel hyperbolic two-dimensional graphene-like structure (GLS) showing a
   negative Poisson's ratio behavior by first-principles calculation. The
   thermodynamic, dynamic, lattice dynamic, and mechanical stabilities of
   the GLS were carefully studied. In addition, we also explored the
   electronic structure, mechanical characteristics, and optical-electronic
   characteristics. The GLS not only displays a negative Poisson's ratio in

Abstract = {{Auxetics are materials showing a negative Poisson's ratio. This
   characteristic leads to unusual mechanical properties that make this an
   interesting class of materials. So far no systematic approach for
   generating auxetic cellular materials has been reported. In this

   cellular materials based on eigenmode analysis. The fundamental
   mechanism generating auxetic behavior is identified as rotation. With

Abstract = {{Hard-body models reproduce many fundamental features of real physical
   systems and are convenient tools to study the role of molecular shape
   and its influence on macroscopic, for example, elastic, properties of
   condensed matter. In this article, a degenerate (aperiodic) crystal of
   hard dimers with arrays of nanochannels introduced in the direction
   {[}001] is studied by Monte Carlo simulations. The nanochannels are
   filled by hard spheres of diameter sigma' which can be different from
   the diameter sigma of spheres forming dimers. It is shown that, by
   modifying the ratio o'/o, one can qualitatively modify the Poisson's
   ratio of the system. In particular, one can obtain partial auxetics
   (i.e., systems with negative Poisson's ratio in some directions) with
   auxetic directions {[}110] or {[}111]. The applied method is convenient
   to determine Poisson's ratio in all directions for crystals of arbitrary
   symmetry. Explicit formulae for Poisson's ratio in main directions of
   the studied structures are given. (C) 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co.

Abstract = {{In the present work, two new designs of honeycomb structures were
   presented based on the basic re-entrant structure namely,
   splined-reentrant and stiffened-reentrant honeycombs. The new structures
   were designed in order to enhance the in-plane stiffness and maintaining
   the auxetic behavior of the structure. In this study, finite elements
   modeling and experimental work were carried out to evaluate the in-plane
   properties of the new designs. The effect of the geometrical parameters
   such as rib length and rib thickness of the unit cell of the new designs
   on the in-plane properties was investigated. Finite elements results
   showed that the in-plane stiffness of the new designs was improved
   significantly compared to the basic re-entrant structure. Also, the
   stiffened-reentrant structure showed better enhancement of the stiffness
   than the splined-reentrant structure. For example the modulus of
   elasticity of the stiffened-reentrant structure exceeds 16x that of the
   basic re-entrant structure in x-direction and was over two times in the
   y-direction with lower values of the negative Poisson's ratio.
   Compression tests were carried on honeycomb samples made of steel using
   laser cutting technique with different geometrical parameters. Test
   results for the three designs were compared with the finite element
   results and they were in a good agreement.}},

Abstract = {{Young's modulus, fracture stress, and Poisson's ratio are important
   mechanical characteristics for micromechanical devices. The Poisson's
   ratio of a material is a good measure to elucidate its mechanical
   behavior and generally is the negative ratio of transverse to axial
   strain. A nanocrystalline (NCD) and an ultrananocrystalline (UNCD)
   diamond sample with grain boundaries of different chemical and
   structural constitutions have been investigated by an ultrasonic
   resonance method. For both samples, the elastic moduli are considerably
   reduced, compared with the elastic modulus of single crystal diamond
   (sc-diamond). Depending on the chemical and structural constitution of
   grain boundaries in nano-and ultrananocrystalline diamond different
   values for Poisson's ratio and for the fracture strength are observed.
   We found a Poisson's ratio of 0.201 +/- 0.041 for the
   ultrananocrystalline sample and 0.034 +/- 0.017 for the nanocrystalline
   sample. We discuss these results on the basis of a model for granular
   media. Higher disorder in the grain boundary leads to lower shear
   stiffness between the single grains and ultimately results in a decrease
   of Young's and shear modulus and possibly of the fracture strength of
   the material. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{12}},

Abstract = {{Customarily, in-plane auxeticity and synclastic bending behavior (i.e.
   out-of-plane auxeticity) are not independent, being the latter a
   manifestation of the former. Basically, this is a feature of
   three-dimensional bodies. At variance, two-dimensional bodies have more
   freedom to deform than three-dimensional ones. Here, we exploit this
   peculiarity and propose a two-dimensional honeycomb microstructure with
   out-of-plane auxetic behavior opposite to the in-plane one. With a
   suitable choice of the lattice constitutive parameters, in its continuum
   description such a structure can achieve the whole range of values for
   the bending Poisson coefficient, while retaining a membranal Poisson
   coefficient equal to 1. In particular, this structure can reach the
   extreme values, -1 and +1, of the bending Poisson coefficient.
   Analytical calculations are supported by numerical simulations, showing
   the accuracy of the continuum formulas in predicting the response of the
   discrete structure.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic polymeric materials are a special kind of materials that exhibit
   negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) effect. They get fatter when stretched

   property which can be achieved at different structural levels from
   molecular to macroscopic levels. The internal structure of material
   plays an important role in obtaining auxetic effect. Because of NPR
   effect, auxetic polymeric materials demonstrate a series of particular
   characteristics when compared with conventional materials. In recent
   years, a variety of auxetic polymeric materials have been designed and
   fabricated for diverse applications. This article presents a review on
   advances in this area. The emphasis is focused on the geometrical

Abstract = {{In this work, an analytical model of a 3D re-entrant honeycomb auxetic

   beam model and a Timoshenko beam model. Analytical solutions for the

   in all principal directions were obtained, which indicate a wide range
   of mechanical property control via geometrical designs. The results were
   compared with experimentation and finite element analysis, and it was
   verified that the analytical model provides a convenient and relatively
   accurate method in the prediction of the performance for the auxetic
   cellular structures once the manufacturing related factors are
   adequately incorporated into the model. It was also found that the model
   provides less accurate predictions when higher-order coupling effects
   such as warp locking becomes significant under lower structural

Abstract = {{Helical auxetic yarns (HAYs) spun by ring spinning have a large residual
   torque, which restricts their application. To address this problem, the
   hollow-spindle covering system was adopted to prepare structurally
   stable HAYs consisting of the core yarn and the wrap yarn. Four types of
   HAYs were manufactured, and a self-designed automatic stretching device
   was prepared for recording the alteration of yarn diameter. These
   as-fabricated yarns were measured and characterized in terms of their
   deformation behavior and auxetic performance. The strain-stress curves
   of these HAYs have two peaks corresponding to their respective two
   component yarns during stretch until completely failure, and also it was
   found that the wrap component is always broken before the core yarn. By
   comparison, the maximum negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) of -2.55 was
   achieved with as-prepared HAYs composed of spandex and stainless steel
   monofilaments. Meanwhile, the structural stability of these yarns was
   discussed with respect to the residual torque, and the experimental
   results indicate that the residual torque of these HAYs is obviously
   smaller than that of conventional ring-spun yarns. These confirm the
   superiority of our proposed hollow-spindle method. Furthermore, the
   effects of the diameter of the core yarn and tensile modulus of the wrap
   yarn on the auxetic behavior were systematically investigated. It is
   found that a larger NPR can be obtained with a thicker diameter of core
   yarn and a higher tensile modulus of wrap yarn. It is also demonstrated
   that an appropriate combination of the component modulus and geometric
   parameters is essential to fabricate HAY with an obvious auxetic
   behavior.}},

Title = {{Epsilon-Negative Carbon Aerogels with State Transition from Dielectric
   to Degenerate Semiconductor}},
Journal = {{ADVANCED ELECTRONIC MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Aerogels with negative parameters have become a research hotspot since
   the discovery of negative Poisson's ratio and negative thermal expansion
   coefficient in aerogels. The negative parameters are originally brought
   up and studied in electromagnetic metamaterials, leaving a question that
   whether aerogels can be used to construct metamaterials with negative
   electromagnetic parameters. Here, the authors show that negative
   permittivity (epsilon-negative) property can be achieved in carbon
   aerogels, and its value is adjusted continuously by changing the
   composition of carbon aerogels but keeping their microstructure
   unchanged. This is a novel strategy different from the typical
   array-structure-containing metamaterials. Moreover, a physical state
   transition is found when increasing the carbonization temperature, where
   the initial low-loss dielectric state evolves into a high-loss one upon
   increasing the temperature from 400 to 700 degrees C followed by a final
   degenerate semiconductor state when increasing the temperature to 800
   degrees C and above. This work can provide a new method toward the
   design of electromagnetic metamaterials, starting by choosing the
   component materials with optimal composition.}},

Abstract = {{A number of basic features of the mechanical properties of a cubic
   symmetry solid material are identified and discussed within the
   framework of the XY-plane approach, where X?=?G/K, Y?=?G/W, K is the
   bulk modulus and G, W are shear moduli. An anisotropic part of the Debye
   temperature is analysed, which was found to be weakly dependent on X and
   is mainly determined by Y which quantifies the material elastic
   anisotropy. The anisotropic part has a considerable effect on the Debye
   temperature of partially auxetic materials. An empirical
   ductility-brittleness criterion is considered, which indicates that many
   auxetics may deform in a brittle manner. A possible correlation between
   directional tensile deformation and the surface of the most extreme
   Poisson's ratio (PR) values is suggested. Finally, the reasons for the
   paucity of cubic materials in the part of the XY-plane with low Y values
   is investigated using static microscopic models in which the particles
   interact with nearest and next nearest neighbours only. An example of a
   type of microscopic model system located in this empty region has been
   found, which consists of a system under tension, where the interparticle
   interaction decays with distance in an oscillatory way. The results
   obtained suggest that a rather unconventional form of the interparticle
   interaction set and thermodynamic conditions may therefore be required
   to develop a solid material with these mechanical properties.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetics ( materials or structures) are systems with a negative
   Poisson's ratio, a property that arises from the way various geometric
   features in the structure ( or internal structure in the case of
   materials) deform when subjected to uniaxial loads. Such systems are
   normally studied by examining the behaviour of idealised representations
   of structures, which deform in a controlled fashion ( e. g. deforming
   solely through hinging or stretching). Methods used for the analysis
   typically involve construction of real physical macro-models and/or
   derivation of analytical expressions for the mechanical properties. This
   paper proposes an alternative method for analysing such structures
   whereby idealised ``hinging{''} or ``stretching{''} structures are
   constructed within a molecular modelling environment using dummy atoms
   and examined using standard molecular mechanics techniques. We will show
   that this methodology of ``empirical modelling using dummy atoms{''}
   (EMUDA) successfully reproduces the known properties of 2D conventional
   and auxetic hexagonal honeycombs hence confirming the suitability of
   this technique for studying auxetic structures.}},

Abstract = {{The relationship between elastic anisotropy and extreme Poisson's ratio
   behaviour (either positive or negative) in single-crystalline materials
   has been investigated using experimentally determined single-crystal
   elastic constants for a wide range of solid materials. This makes use of
   a recently proposed elastic anisotropy index that is applicable to all
   crystal symmetries. For many real materials we find a striking
   correlation between the value of the elastic anisotropy index and the
   magnitudes of maximum and minimum Poisson's ratios this is independent
   of crystal symmetry. This structure property relationship provides new
   examples of auxetics and shows that negative Poisson's ratios are
   actually not uncommon among many classes of inorganic (and organic)
   materials, including elemental metals, alloys, ionic solids, molecular
   solids and giant covalent networks. (C) 2010 Acta Materialia Inc.

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials and structures as a class of metamaterials have been
   extensively studied and evaluated for many applications. This paper
   focuses on the fabrication and vibration damping of the carbon fiber
   composite auxetic double-arrow corrugated sandwich panels (DACSPs). The
   negative Poisson's ratio effects of the composite auxetic DACSPs are
   analytically studied based on energy method. 3D finite element (FE)
   models combined with Modal Strain Energy (MSE) approach are developed to
   investigate their vibration and damping characteristics. To validate the
   numerical models in the present study, the composite auxetic DACSPs and
   such structures inserted with high damping layer are designed and
   manufactured. Modal vibration and three-point bending tests are
   conducted to investigate their vibration damping and bending responses.
   The results show that the 3D FE models combined with MSE approach are
   valid to predict the modal properties of the composite auxetic DACSPs.
   The influence of the different inclined corrugated angles on the natural
   frequencies and damping loss factors are plotted and discussed.
   Meanwhile, the effect of Poisson's ratio on the nominal Young's modulus,
   natural frequencies and damping loss factors of the composite auxetic
   DACSPs are also revealed. It is observed from the results that it is
   possible to obtain both increased stiffness and high damping capacity of
   such composite auxetic DACSPs by optimizing the inclined corrugated
   angles and inserting suitable damping layers.}},

Abstract = {{Poisson's ratio sigma in linear elasticity theory is the ratio of the

   common macroscopic materials, sigma is a positive quantity, implying
   that the rod becomes thinner when stretched. If the rod is a
   polyelectrolyte that bears a charge density above the threshold for
   counterion condensation, then the condensed layer of counterions should
   be regarded as an integral part of the rod. We show on a simple model
   that Poisson's ratio is then negative for high charge densities. For the
   charge density characteristic of DNA, the negative value found for sigma
   is in approximate agreement with the negative value inferred from
   measurements of the bending and twisting moduli of DNA.}},

   a new design of three-dimensional periodic cellular auxetic material
   based on geometrical and mechanical methodology. The projections of the
   optimized periodic modules in two horizontal directions are
   geometrically same with auxetic hexahedral poem, so that the optimized
   periodic material can perform auxetic in both two horizontal directions
   under vertical compression. Parametric model is simulated to prove the
   design.}},

   ratio}},
Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{171}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Artificial auxetic materials with negative Poisson's ratio enable
   distinctive elastic response in the direction orthogonal to the loaded
   direction, i.e. shrinking when compressed and expanding when stretched,
   compared to conventional materials. Such distinctive mechanical
   characteristic makes auxetic materials unique in practice. Current
   studies in this aspect focus mainly on the realization of beam-dominated
   microstructures such as reentrant and chiral lattices and of cellular
   microstructures with orthogonal elliptical hole pattern. In this study,
   a novel two-dimensional auxetic microstructure is designed by
   introducing peanut-shaped holes in solid bulk matrix. Compared to the
   microstructure with elliptical hole pattern, the present design can
   produce slightly larger negative Poisson's ratio and achieve
   significantly lower stress level. The samples consisting of a number of
   centimeter-scale unit cells with the peanut-shaped holes are fabricated
   efficiently via additive manufacturing technique. Experiment and finite
   element simulation of tensile test are carried out on the specific
   sample to demonstrate the auxetic effect of the present design and
   simultaneously verify the computational model. Finally, effects of some
   parameters on Poisson's ratio, which may control the auxetic behavior of
   the present microstructure, are discussed for better understanding
   deformation mechanism of the proposed auxetic material.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional porous piezoelectric ceramics can possess superior figures
   of merit only at very high values of porosity, leading to bad
   fragileness, small stiffness, low toughness, and the difficulty of
   polarization. To this end, this study for the first time shows that it
   is possible that the piezoelectric ceramic with ultra-low porosity is
   capable of superior figures of merit based on the concept of auxetic
   piezoelectric ceramics. Owing to the ultra-low porosity and auxetic
   effect, the auxetic piezoelectric ceramic shall also possess larger
   stiffness, higher toughness, and is more easily polarized. First, the
   auxetic piezoelectric ceramic with ultra-low porosity is proposed to
   achieve highly tunable electromechanical properties on the basis of the
   rotating square mechanism. Then, using a multiscale finite element
   method, the effects of geometric architecture and polarization
   directions on the electromechanical properties including Poisson's
   ratios, elastic coefficients, piezoelectric stress coefficients,
   dielectric coefficients, and figures of merit in the auxetic
   piezoelectric ceramics are investigated in detail. Furthermore, the
   stress fields in conventional and proposed porous piezoelectric ceramics
   subjected to mechanical and electrical loads are compared and discussed.
   Finally, it can be concluded that the auxetic piezoelectric ceramic
   exhibits (a) giant negative Poisson's ratios (smaller than-5), (b)
   negative elastic coefficients, (c) more extensible, higher piezoelectric
   sensitivity, lower acoustic impedance, stronger crack resistance than
   conventional porous piezoelectric ceramics with the same porosity, and
   (d) larger stiffness than conventional porous piezoelectric ceramics
   with similar figures of merit.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials exhibit a negative Poisson's ratio behavior that makes
   them useful for a variety of structural applications by virtue of their
   ability to counterintuitively deform due to a reentrant cellular
   structure. This property allows the cellular material to expand
   laterally when pulled in the longitudinal direction or, conversely,
   contract laterally when compressed, with the manner of deformation of
   the internal structure depending upon the configuration of the cellular
   structure. The purpose of this research was to develop carbon black
   nanoparticle-reinforced natural rubber vulcanizates and to investigate
   the effects of carbon black reinforcement on the mechanical behavior of
   an idealized auxetic foam structure using modeling and numerical
   simulation techniques. This has been achieved by mechanically
   characterizing vulcanized natural rubber of various nanoparticle
   loadings and then using the test data to perform finite element (FE)
   simulations on the foam models. Material models have been developed in
   the FE simulation software ANSYS by curve fitting experimental data
   (hyperelastic) to theoretical material models. Large deformation
   analysis of this foam structure has been carried out to determine
   structural reorganizations and negative Poisson's ratio effect in the

Abstract = {{This paper presents a theoretical analysis of the auxetic plied yarn
   (APY) structure formed with two types of single yarns having different
   diameter and modulus. A model which can be used to predict its
   deformation behavior under axial extension is developed based on the

   experimental data obtained in the previous study, and then used to
   predict the effects of different structural and material parameters on
   the auxetic behavior of the APY. The calculation results show that the
   developed model can correctly predict the variation trend of the auxetic
   behavior of the APY, which first increases and then decrease with the
   increase of the axial strain. The calculation results also indicate that
   the auxetic behavior of the APY simultaneously depends on the diameter
   ratio of the soft yarn and stiff yarn as well as the ratio between the
   pitch length and stiff yarn diameter. The study provides a way to design
   and fabricate APYs with the same auxetic behavior by using different
   soft and stiff yarns as long as these two ratios are kept unchanged.}},

Abstract = {{An engineered Negative Poisson's Ratio (NPR) material is investigated in
   this paper for its design variations based on two design variables. The
   investigated material properties include effective Young's modulus,
   Poisson's ratio, material density, and load-bearing efficiency in terms
   of rigidity/weight ratio of the material. Nonlinear behaviors of the
   design variations are also investigated for large deformation
   applications. it is seen that by varying the two design variables, the
   NPR can reach as low as minus sixty in a special design. Any NPR number
   between a positive number and minus sixty can be obtained within the
   design domain through the design process. The nonlinear analysis results
   show that the effective material properties vary depending on the load
   amplitude, and the NPR material becomes stiffer and stiffer when the
   compression load is increased.
   The finite element method is utilized with a multi-step linearization
   method to predict the nonlinear behaviors of NPR materials. This will
   allow the effective material properties to be calculated for any given
   load amplitude. The new capability can be then used to design desired
   NPR material in a function-oriented material design (FOMD) environment
   for advanced application development. Both linear and nonlinear analysis
   results are presented and compared in this paper in order to demonstrate
   the necessity of accounting for geometric nonlinearity in the NPR
   material design process. An NPR material simulation and design system,
   called FOMD-NPR, has also been developed at MKP Structural Design
   Associates, Inc. for designing innovative NPR materials for various

   a rigid rotating squares effect. Changes in the sizing parameters of
   aspect ratio, intercell spacing, and number of unit cells are made

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials with large negative Poisson's ratios are fabricated by
   highly oriented carbon nanotube structures. The Poisson's ratio can be
   obtained down to -0.50. Furthermore, negative Poisson's ratios can be
   maintained in the carbon nanotube/polymer composites when the nanotubes
   are embedded, while the composites show much better mechanical
   properties including larger strain-to-failure (similar to 22\%) compared
   to the pristine nanotube thin film (similar to 3\%). A theoretical model
   is developed to predict the Poisson's ratios. It indicates that the
   large negative Poisson's ratios are caused by the realignment of curved
   nanotubes during stretching and the theoretical predictions agree well
   with the experimental results.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with re-entrant cell honeycombs which show
   in-plane negative Poisson's ratio values, in which their anisotropic
   mechanical properties are described using the cellular material theory.
   Out-of-plane shear moduli are affected by the unit cell geometric
   parameters and, for some ranges of the latter, it is possible to obtain
   higher values of the shear moduli compared to those of a regular
   hexagonal honeycomb, in particular for cell geometries with a negative
   Poisson's ratio. A first order sandwich plate theory is applied in order
   to obtain the fundamental frequencies of sandwich laminates in
   cylindrical bending and for the simply supported case. Sensitivities of
   the frequencies per unit mass versus the geometric cell parameters are
   also calculated. The results suggest that the dynamic performance of a
   sandwich structure could be significantly improved with a proper design
   of the unit cell shape of the honeycomb. In particular, re-entrant cell
   cores offer improvements in bending stiffness capabilities for
   particular cell parameter ranges. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{The Poisson's ratio of a material characterizes its response to uniaxial
   strain. Materials normally possess a positive Poisson's ratio - they
   contract laterally when stretched, and expand laterally when compressed.
   A negative Poisson's ratio is theoretically permissible but has not,
   with few exceptions of man-made bulk structures, been experimentally
   observed in any natural materials. Here, we show that the negative
   Poisson's ratio exists in the low-dimensional natural material black
   phosphorus and that our experimental observations are consistent with
   first-principles simulations. Through applying uniaxial strain along
   armchair direction, we have succeeded in demonstrating a cross-plane
   interlayer negative Poisson's ratio on black phosphorus for the first
   time. Meanwhile, our results support the existence of a cross-plane
   intralayer negative Poisson's ratio in the constituent phosphorene
   layers under uniaxial deformation along the zigzag axis, which is in
   line with a previous theoretical prediction. The phenomenon originates
   from the puckered structure of its in-plane lattice, together with
   coupled hinge-like bonding configurations.}},

Abstract = {{Monte Carlo computer simulations with variable shape of the periodic box
   were performed for a few two-dimensional, hard-body models showing
   elastically isotropic solid phases. Two examples of homomolecular (i.e.
   consisting of identical molecules) systems of anisotropic molecules are
   discussed which form unusual solid phases, showing negative Poisson's
   ratio and know as auxetic ones, at densities and pressures higher than
   the elastically isotropic solid phases. Sharp extremes of the Poisson's
   ratio were observed for both systems at freezing of the orientational
   degrees of freedom of the molecules: a minimum was observed for the
   system for which the auxetic phase with frozen rotation is isotropic and
   a maximum was found for the other system. This indicates that isotropic
   auxetic phases can have auxetic precursors with much more negative
   Poisson's ratios than those characterizing the auxetic phases
   themselves. An example of a hetero-molecular (i.e. mixture consisting of
   different molecules), elastically isotropic system is also discussed -
   the polydisperse hard disc system. The simulations revealed a maximum of
   the Poisson's ratio in the close packing limit at any nonzero
   polydispersity. Although no manifestation of any auxetic behaviour has
   been found in this system, the obtained results indicate other unusual
   effect - a jump (discontinuity) of the Poisson's ratio at close packing
   when the polydispersity tends to zero. The results obtained in this work
   demonstrate that the Poisson's ratio can play the role of a sensitive
   indicator of (at least) some structural changes in solids. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{Double arrowhead honeycombs (DAHs) are auxetic cellular materials with
   negative Poisson's ratio (NPR). The quasi-static and impact behaviors of
   both uniform and functionally graded DAHs are explored. Analytical
   expressions for the in-plane Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio and
   quasi-static yield stress of uniform DAHs are derived and are found to
   be consistent with finite element (FE) predictions, showing that the
   quasi-static yield stress of DAHs is dependent upon the geometrical
   parameters and NPR. Systematical simulations of uniform DAHs subject to
   different impact velocities reveal that there exists a critical impact
   velocity beyond which the dynamic plateau stress is insensitive to the
   effect of NPR. A semi-empirical expression of the plateau stress is
   obtained. For functionally graded DAHs, they are shown to only have
   improved energy absorption capacity under high velocity impacts.
   Moreover, the results of uniform DAHs are shown to be able to be adopted
   to interpret the simulated plateau stress of functionally graded DAHs
   under impact loading. The deformation mechanisms associated with the
   impact resistance of DAHs are also discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{To date, microstructural modelling of auxetic materials has relied
   mainly on the assumption of both a regular and a homogeneous
   microstructure present throughout the bulk material. The disorder within
   a material is seen as something undesirable, with the expectation that
   disorder or heterogeneity will tend to reduce the range of properties
   available. In this work the presence of short-range variations in the
   elastic Moduli are considered together with the resulting effect on a
   material's Poisson's ratio. It is shown that such variations alone can
   Cause a Material with a mean positive Poisson's ratio to become negative
   (auxetic). In addition, anisotropic variations can enhance the magnitude
   of a negative Poisson's ratio. (C) 2008 Acta Materialia Inc. Published

Abstract = {{Although a number of interesting physical properties such as a negative
   Poisson's ratio (NPR) and Dirac semimetal (DS) properties have been
   recently predicted in two-dimensional (2D) materials, the realization of
   a 2D material that exhibits both of these DS and NPR features has rarely
   been reported. Here by adopting particle swarm optimization (PSO)
   algorithms combined with first-principles methods, we successfully
   construct a novel SiO monolayer (Pmna), the dynamic and thermal
   stability of which was characterized using phonon spectrum calculations
   and molecular dynamics simulations. In particular, Young's modulus and
   Poisson's ratio calculations showed that thePmnamonolayer exhibits high
   mechanical anisotropy with an in-plane NPR originating from its puckered
   atomic arrangement. More notably, the band structure of thePmnamonolayer
   possesses zero bandgap with four Dirac cones in its first Brillouin
   zone, exhibiting a DS feature. From the calculations of orbital-resolved
   band structures, the Dirac cone was revealed to originate from the
   orbital hybridization of Si and O atoms. ThePmnamonolayer is the first
   2D structure in the Si-O system that has both an NPR and Dirac
   semi-metal properties, providing a new model for exploring 2D
   multifunctional materials.}},

Abstract = {{A simple method to measure the elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio of
   diamond-like carbon (DLC) films deposited on Si wafer was suggested.
   This method involved etching a side of Si substrate using the DLC him as
   an etching mask. The edge of DLC overhang free from constraint of Si
   substrate exhibited periodic sinusoidal shape. By measuring the
   amplitude and the wavelength of the sinusoidal edge, we can determine
   the strain of the film required to adhere to the substrate. Combined
   with independent stress measurement by laser reflection method, this
   method allows calculation of the biaxial elastic modulus, E/(1 - nu);
   where E is the Elastic modulus and nu Poisson's ratio Of the DLC films.
   By comparing the biaxial elastic modulus with plane-strain modulus, E/(1
   - nu(2)), measured by nano-indentation, me could further determine the
   elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio, independently. This method was
   employed to measure the mechanical properties of DLC films deposited by
   C6H6 r.f. glow discharge at the deposition pressure 1.33 Pa. The elastic
   modulus, E, increased from 94 to 128 GPa as the negative bias voltage
   increased from 400 to 550 V. Poisson's ratio was estimated to be about
   0.22 in this bias voltage range. For the negative bias voltages less
   than 400 V, however, the present method resulted in negative Poisson's
   ratio. The limitation of the present method was discussed.}},

   orthotropic plate theory with shear correction factors is applied in
   order to describe the static and dynamic behaviour of symmetric sandwich
   plates with different core to sheet thickness ratios. Comparisons are
   made with analogous structures with regular honeycomb. The maximum
   deflections due to uniform pressure and buckling loads are enhanced,

   Auxetic Yarn}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS RESEARCH EXPRESS}},

Volume = {{6}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The auxetic materials and structures exhibiting negative Poisson's ratio
   are essentially used in filtration, medical devices, energy absorbing
   applications, etc. The auxetic materials excel at traditional materials
   due to better mechanical performance. This paper presents the auxetic
   fabrics produced using Helical Auxetic Yarn (HAY). The HAY was developed
   by wrapping a stiffer yarn (multifilament Kevlar) on core yarn
   (multifilament Polypropylene), by varying wrap to core angle from 8
   degrees to 20 degrees. The recent research works report the auxeticity
   of HAY woven fabric, but the scope is limited to a particular weave
   pattern with a certain warp to core angle. In this study, the developed
   HAYs were used to weave fabrics in four different weaving patterns. The
   woven fabrics were produced using HAY as warp and Kevlar as weft.
   Furthermore, auxetic effect exhibited by HAY and subsequent woven
   fabrics was studied. It was found that the lower wrap to core angle in
   HAY yielded higher auxetic effect. Moreover, the matt woven fabric
   developed using 8 degrees HAY exhibited maximum auxetic effect. The
   developed structure can be effectively used for filtration or energy
   absorbing applications.}},

Abstract = {{The Poisson's ratio of materials describes the ratio of the transverse
   to axial strain. While most materials exhibit non-negative Poisson
   ratio, here we focus on the topological properties of negative ratio
   materials also known as auxetic constructs. Digital modelling and
   physical fabrication are employed to generate and test experimental
   auxetic configurations. The first set of studies employ 2D space-filling
   tessellations integrating both negative and positive Poisson ratio
   cells. The tessellations are designed through binary state transitions
   and gradual morphing transitions. A second set of studies explores the
   topological optimization of a single negative Poisson cell configuration
   following the logic that a cell constitutes the building block of
   auxetic materials. The third set of studies focuses on the translation
   of heterogeneous Poisson ratio 2D tessellations into 3D constructs.
   Here, two methods of fabrication are explored: lamination method and
   cellular grading. The precision of the cellular grading method renders
   it particularly suitable for multi-material 3D printing fabrication
   which is theoretically studied and proposed. Space-filling heterogeneous
   tessellation studies are applied to architectural and product design
   proposals. These proposals exhibit properties that could serve to design
   and develop further research on real-world applications.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic honeycombs show in-plane negative Poisson's ratio properties;
   they expand in all directions when pulled in only one, and contract when

   effect that affects the linear elastic properties of the whole cellular
   solid. In this paper finite element simulations are carried out to
   calculate the in-plane Poisson's ratio and Young's moduli of re-entrant
   cell honeycombs for different geometric layout combinations (side cell
   aspect ratio, relative thickness and internal cell angle) subjected to
   uniaxial loading. The results show a high sensitivity of the mechanical
   properties for particular ranges of the geometric cell parameters. An
   image data detection technique is used to extract displacements and
   strains from an aramid paper re-entrant honeycomb sample in a tensile
   test. The comparison between numerical and experimental results shows

   are described in terms of the changes in specimen dimensions and
   associated strains. From these quantities, Poisson's ratios are
   determined for the large strain regime involved. The property of being
   able to open pores by stretching the material is a useful feature in
   various types of filtration application. In particular, where the
   long-term efficiency of the process is hindered by ingress of particles
   into the system which block the active pore structure, the marriage of
   permeability and mechanical deformation via a negative Poisson's ratio
   offers an alternative to other methods of clearance. This notion is
   illustrated by the use of some very simple tests in which the foam is
   challenged by glass beads of uniform diameter. Simple air pressure-drop
   tests are also performed on auxetic and conventional foams to
   demonstrate that the change in permeability due to mechanical
   deformation enables a means of varying the pressure-drop acting across
   an auxetic foam to a far greater degree than is possible for the
   conventional foams. (C) 2007 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA,

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new kind of hierarchical tube with a negative Poisson's
   ratio (NPR) is proposed. The first level tube is constructed by rolling
   up an auxetic hexagonal honeycomb. Then, the second level tube is
   produced by substituting the arm of the auxetic sheet with the first
   level tube and rolling it up. The Nth (N >= 1) level tube can be built
   recursively. Based on the Euler beam theory, the equivalent elastic
   parameters of the NPR hierarchical tubes under small deformations are
   derived. Under longitudinal axial tension, instead of shrinking, all
   levels of the NPR hierarchical tubes expand in the transverse direction.
   Using these kinds of auxetic tubes as reinforced fibers in composite
   materials would result in a higher resistance to fiber pullout. Thus,
   this paper provides a new strategy for the design of fiber reinforced
   hierarchical bio-inspired composites with a superior pull-out mechanism,
   strength and toughness. An application with super carbon nanotubes
   concludes the paper.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a systematic approach for designing 3D auxetic
   lattice materials, which exhibit constant negative Poisson's ratios over
   large strain intervals. A unit cell model mimicking tensile tests is
   established and based on the proposed model, the secant Poisson's ratio
   is defined as the negative ratio between the lateral and the
   longitudinal engineering strains. The optimization problem for designing
   a material unit cell with a target Poisson's ratio is formulated to
   minimize the average lateral engineering stresses under the prescribed
   deformations. Numerical results demonstrate that 3D auxetic lattice
   materials with constant Poisson's ratios can be achieved by the proposed
   optimization formulation and that two sets of material architectures are
   obtained by imposing different symmetry on the unit cell. Moreover,
   inspired by the topology-optimized material architecture, a subsequent
   shape optimization is proposed by parametrizing material architectures
   using super-ellipsoids. By designing two geometrical parameters, simple
   optimized material microstructures with different target Poisson's
   ratios are obtained. By interpolating these two parameters as polynomial
   functions of Poisson's ratios, material architectures for any Poisson's
   ratio in the interval of nu is an element of {[} -0.78, 0.00] are
   explicitly presented. Numerical evaluations show that interpolated
   auxetic lattice materials exhibit constant Poisson's ratios in the
   target strain interval of {[}0.00, 0.20] and that 3D auxetic lattice
   material architectures with programmable Poisson's ratio are achievable.

Abstract = {{Two very important factors which determine the effectiveness of a pump
   are its volumetric and energy efficiencies. Yin and Ghoneim constructed
   a prototype of a flexible body pump with a very high volumetric
   efficiency or pumping potential (the relative volume reduction due to a
   relative input stroke) {[}1]. The high volumetric efficiency is
   attributed to the geometry of the pump's structure (hyperboloid) as well
   as the high negative effective Poisson's ratio of the 3 layer
   ({[}0/13/0]) flexible-matrix-composite (carbon/polyurethane) laminate
   adopted for the body of the pump. The energy efficiency was not
   evaluated. An important factor in assessing the energy efficiency of
   flexible-body pumps is the effective damping (a measure of the energy
   dissipation per cycle) of the flexible body material. An objective of
   the current work is to determine the effective damping inherent in the
   3-layer laminate, as a function of the two angle orientations 0 and (3,
   employed for the design of the flexible body pump. Thereby, the best
   fiber angle orientation, for the highest volumetric as well as energy
   efficiency, can be considered. The contribution of this `` work is
   twofold: 1) viscoelastic characterization (longitudinal, transverse, and
   shear complex moduli, as well as the in-plane complex Poisson's ratio)
   of the polyurethane/carbon composite, used in the Geo-polymer lab at
   RIT; the results may be utilized as benchmarks for other researchers
   using similar carbon/polyurethane in dynamic applications, and 2)
   provide a comprehensive study of the effect of the two angles 0 and 13
   on the effective damping factors of the three-layer laminate. Together
   with the similar study on the negative Poisson's ratio {[}1], a better
   design of the laminate for the most efficient flexible-body pump
   performance can be established.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetics expand laterally when uniaxially stretched. In many cases, this
   behaviour has been attributed to the interplay between the geometry of
   the system and its deformation mechanism. This work revisits a class of
   2D motifs, the so-called chiral honeycombs, which are closely associated
   with auxetic behaviour. More specifically, we show that systems based on
   this motif, particularly those having a Poisson's ratio of -1, can be
   engineered with specific constraints that limit the in-plane expansion,
   with the result that on inducing deformation of the systems, these veer
   out-of-plane to form dome-like structures. This effect is demonstrated
   in simple prototypes and it is shown through a simplified mathematical
   model that the extent of curvature can be controlled through the various
   parameters that describe such structures.}},

   optimization technique}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN MATERIALS AND PROCESSING TECHNOLOGIES}},
Abstract = {{Structures that possess Negative Poisson's Ratio are known as auxetics.
   The successful application of auxetics requires appropriate design
   optimisation. Hence, in the present work, customised auxetics namely
   re-entrant honeycomb, missing rib and anti-tri-chiral has been developed
   using a two-step hybrid optimisation technique. The technique is based
   on the amalgamation of multiobjective optimisation and topological
   optimisation. A combined objective is set as maximum elastic moduli and
   minimum Poisson's ratio with prioritised objective as maximum elastic
   moduli and mass as the response constraint. Initially, an optimal shape
   of a unit cell based on the Pareto front has been chosen considering the
   prioritised objective. Thereafter, finite element simulation was
   performed to evaluate the auxetic behaviour followed by topological
   optimisation using the density-based method. Using the developed model,
   the morphological and mechanical properties of the designed auxetics
   have been compared. The re-entrant honeycomb structure has been found as
   the most reliable auxetics with the highest elastic modulus and auxetic
   behaviour. The induced maximum stress in the array and structure of
   re-entrant honeycomb was 320.7 MPa and 168.77 MPa respectively. The
   results revealed that the developed methodology can be utilised as an
   advanced tool for achieving topologically optimised auxetics with
   desired properties.}},

   is sensitive to the rate of loading, while the negative Poisson's ratio
   for the metamaterial with initial auxetic behaviour is insensitive to
   the loading rate. It was also found that the deformation pattern is

Title = {{A novel category of 3D chiral material with negative Poisson's ratio}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITES SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{160}},
Pages = {{111-118}},
Month = {{MAY 26}},
Abstract = {{A new design thought for 3D auxetic material is proposed based on the
   rotaion mechanism of chiral honeycombs. Two kinds of cell shape of the
   3D auxetic material are studied as example, which are developed from the
   tetrachiral honeycombs with circular loops and square loops,
   respectively, with inclined rods connecting the neighbor layers. By
   replacing the tetrachiral honeycomb layers by other chiral honeycombs,
   such as trichiral, hexachiral honeycombs, other kinds of 3D chiral
   material with negative Poisson's ratio can be obtained. Moreover, since
   the cells' deformation of the 3D material is dominated by that of
   ligaments and rods under small deformation, the elastic properties of
   the 3D auxetic material are almost independent of the loops' shape.
   Thus, the loop can be designed to any shape instead of the traditional
   circular loop in order to obtain priory mechanical properties under
   large deformation. Based on beam theory and micromechanical method, the
   analytical formulas of both the elastic mudulus and Poisson's ratio are
   deduced for this category of 3D chiral material, which are verified by
   numerical simulations but also the experiment of 3D printed model. The
   verification results indicate that the formulas have higher precision
   and wider application scope. The influence of layer space on the
   equivalent parameters and the conditions for isotropic realization are
   discussed base on the analytical formulas. By changing the oblique
   direction of the inclined rods, another new 3D material can be obtained
   with positive Poisson's ratio in two directions and negative Poisson's
   ratio in the other one direction, for which the analytical formulas are
   still applicable. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Foams have previously been fabricated with a negative Poisson's ratio
   (termed auxetic foams). A novel model is proposed to explain this and to
   describe the strain-dependent Poisson's function behaviour of honeycomb
   and foam materials. The model is two-dimensional and is based upon the
   observation of broken cell ribs in foams processed via the compression
   and heating technique usually employed to convert conventional foams to
   auxetic behaviour. The model has two forms: the ``intact{''} form is a
   network of ribs with biaxial symmetry, and the ``auxetic{''} form is a
   similar network but with a proportion of cell ribs removed. The model
   output is compared with that of an existing two-dimensional model and
   experimental data, and is found to be superior in predicting the
   Poisson's function and marginally better at predicting the stress-strain
   behaviour of the experimental data than the existing model, using
   realistic values for geometric parameters. (C) 2000 Acta Metallurgica

   auxetic foam sheets}},
Journal = {{ACTA MATERIALIA}},

Volume = {{126}},
Pages = {{426-437}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Large sheets of polyurethane open-cell foam were compressed (or
   stretched) using pins and a conversion mould whilst undergoing thermal
   softening and controlled cooling. Sheets (final dimensions 355 x 344 x
   20 mm) were fabricated with uniform triaxial compression, with and
   without through thickness pins, and also with different compression
   regimes (uniform triaxial compression or through thickness compression
   and biaxial planar tension) in opposing quadrants. The samples
   fabricated under uniform triaxial compression with and without pins
   exhibited similar cell structure and mechanical properties. The sheets
   fabricated with graded compression levels displayed clearly defined
   quadrants of differing cell structure and mechanical properties. The
   graded foam quadrants subject to triaxial compression displayed similar
   cell structure, tangent moduli and negative Poisson's ratio responses to
   the uniform foams converted with a similar level of triaxial
   compression. The graded foam quadrants subject to through-thickness
   compression and biaxial planar tension displayed a slightly re-entrant
   through-thickness cell structure contrasting with an in-plane structure
   resembling the fully reticulated cell structure of the unconverted
   parent foam. This quadrant of graded foam displayed positive and
   negative Poisson's ratios in tension and compression, respectively,
   accompanied by high and low in plane tangent modulus, respectively. The
   strain-dependent mechanical properties are shown to be fully consistent
   with expectations from honeycomb theory. The triaxially compressed
   quadrants of the graded sheet exhibited 4 times lower peak acceleration
   than quadrants with through-thickness compression and biaxial planar
   tension in 6 J impact tests using a steel hemispherical drop mass. (C)

Journal = {{CARBON}},

Volume = {{143}},
Pages = {{125-137}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Ten different simulation models are used to investigate the effects of
   content and chirality of graphene on the mechanical properties of
   nanolayered graphene/Cu composites. The increasing volume fraction of
   graphene can significantly enhance the Young's modulus and tensile
   strength of composites, but it leads to a lower yield strain. The
   negative Poisson's ratio of composites (NPRC) under uniaxial tension is
   observed at an atomic level. The corresponding mechanism is revealed by
   enhanced surface effect and inhomogeneous distribution of stress due to
   graphene-Cu interface. The strengthening mechanism of graphene is
   investigated by constraining effect in elastic region and blocking
   effect in plastic region. In a multi-layer structure, the middle copper
   film shows better tensile properties as its movement is constrained
   between two graphene layers. The blocking effect plays an important role
   in the interface interaction between graphene and dislocations. Graphene
   effectively blocks dislocations from penetrating through and restricts
   the synergistic movement of copper atoms. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{A highly fibrillar auxetic form of ultra-high molecular weight
   polyethylene (UHMWPE) has been fabricated by using a powder processing
   route comprising two stages-sintering and extrusion. The resulting
   material has a low density (720 kg/m(3)) and low flexural strength and
   modulus (up to 6 MPa and 62 MPa, respectively) but much larger negative
   Poisson's ratio when compared with auxetic UHMWPE fabricated using an
   additional preliminary compaction stage followed by sintering and
   extrusion. The effects of die geometry on the mechanical properties of
   this material are examined. The indentation resistance and ultrasonic
   attenuation of the novel, highly fibrillar auxetic material were
   measured, and it was found that the indentation resistance was enhanced
   only at very low loads (i.e. 5 N and 10 N) when compared with
   conventionally processed UHMWPE. After this, the lack of structural
   integrity of the material outweighed the benefits of its being auxetic.
   However the ultrasonic attenuation was found to be extremely good, and
   much enhanced over conventionally processed UHMWPE, with the attenuation
   coefficient being at least 47 dB/cm, compared with 8 dB/cm.}},

Volume = {{7}},

Pages = {{5111-5129}},
Abstract = {{The surge of interest in so-called ``designer materials{''} during the
   last few years together with recent advances in additive manufacturing
   (3D printing) techniques that enable fabrication of materials with
   arbitrarily complex nano/micro-architecture have attracted increasing
   attention to the concept of mechanical metamaterials. Owing to their
   rationally designed nano/micro-architecture, mechanical metamaterials
   exhibit unusual properties at the macro-scale. These unusual mechanical
   properties could be exploited for the development of materials with
   advanced functionalities, with applications in soft robotics,
   biomedicine, soft electronics, acoustic cloaking, etc. Auxetic
   mechanical metamaterials are identified by a negative Poisson's ratio
   and are perhaps the most widely studied type of mechanical
   metamaterials. Similar to other types of mechanical metamaterials, the
   negative Poisson's ratio of auxetics is generally a direct consequence
   of the topology of their nano/micro-architecture. This paper therefore
   focuses on the topology-property relationship in three main classes of
   auxetic metamaterials, namely re-entrant, chiral, and rotating (semi-)
   rigid structures. While the deformation mechanisms in the
   above-mentioned types of structures and their relationship with the
   large-scale mechanical properties receive most attention, the emerging
   concepts in design of auxetics such as the use of instability in soft
   matter and origamibased structures are discussed as well. Furthermore,
   the data available in the literature regarding the elastic properties of
   auxetic mechanical metamaterials are systematically analyzed to identify
   the spread of Young's modulus-Poisson's ratio duos achieved in the
   auxetic materials developed to date.}},

Title = {{Crashworthiness of novel concentric auxetic reentrant honeycomb with
   negative Poisson's ratio biologically inspired by coconut palm}},
Journal = {{THIN-WALLED STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{154}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Lightweight auxetic reentrant honeycombs (ARH) with negative Poisson's
   ratio (NPR) are very promising for crashworthiness applications due to
   high specific-strength and energy-absorption (EA). To dig up the
   potential of ARH, a bio-inspired self-similar ``concentric auxetic
   reentrant honeycomb (CARH){''} is proposed to reinforce the EA. Finite
   element model is established and verified via available reference
   results for quasi-static-, low-, medium- and high-velocity compression.
   Two types of CARHs including CARH-I and CARH-II are designed to
   systematically explore the crashworthiness. The quasi-static and dynamic
   compression behaviors and EA characteristics are compared among
   different structures. There is a harvest that the bio-inspired CARHs
   show higher plateau stress and EA than the traditional ARH, while
   CARH-II > CARH-I. To clearly understand strengthening mechanisms,
   different global and unicellular shrinkage deformation modes (e.g.,
   ``x{''}, ``X{''}, ``I{''}, ``V{''}, etc.) are revealed under different
   velocities. Summarily, the enhancement is due to coupling deformation
   and energy-dissipation of more plastic-hinges. The horizontal strain of
   each layer is studied to reveal the NPR effect, which shows a
   significant velocity effect on the horizontal strain. From parametric
   studies, typical parameters (e.g. wall-thickness, distance and number of
   concentric walls) have considerable effects on crashworthiness of CARH.
   The present bio-inspired design and findings offer a reference for the
   development of honeycomb with special functions.}},

Abstract = {{This work is devoted to the experimental determination of Poisson's

   cylindrical samples of a single-crystal heat-resistant nickel alloy with
   crystallographic orientations of (CGOs) {[}001], {[}011], and {[}111].
   The modulus of elasticity for the samples of these orientations has also
   been determined. It has been established that, in samples of
   heat-resistant nickel singlecrystal alloy with CGO {[}011], Poisson's
   ratio can vary from negative to positive values depending on the
   azimuthal orientation, i.e., on the crystallographic directions that lie
   in the plane perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the sample. To
   control the azimuthal CGO of cylindrical samples {[}011], a special
   metallographic procedure was developed based on the determination of the
   dendritic structure on the butt ends of these samples using etching. The
   data on the azimuthal orientation were subsequently used to place a
   sensor in order to determine the transverse deformation in these

Abstract = {{Common materials have Poisson's ratio values ranging from 0.0 to 0.5.
   Auxetic materials exhibit negative Poisson's ratio. They expand
   laterally when stretched longitudinally and contract laterally when

   auxetic materials has attracted more and more attention. It is reflected
   in the extent of available research work exploring the auxetic potential
   of various textile structures and subsequent increase in the number of
   research papers published. Generally there are two approaches to
   producing auxetic textiles. The first one includes the use of auxetic
   fibers to produce an auxetic textile structure, whereas the other
   utilizes conventional fibres to produce a textile structure with auxetic
   properties. This review deals with auxetic materials in general and in
   the specific context of auxetic polymers, auxetic fibers, and auxetic
   textile structures made from conventional fibers and knitted structures

Journal = {{EXTREME MECHANICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{42}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Unprecedented sign change of Poisson's ratio not only paves the way for
   diverse applications, but it provides a sense of deep understanding of
   `hidden' mechanics, yet to be discovered. Stochastically distributed
   multi-walled carbon nanotubes in the form of buckypaper can possess
   negative Poisson's ratio, but the underlying design principles are still
   unclear. Herein, we explored analytical approaches, namely, energy
   minimization, structural modeling, and force-balance as a means to
   target negative Poisson's ratio in the buckypaper. Though `zero'
   Poisson's ratio is still achievable, the controlling parameters could
   not be identified. Guided by a `keyed-brick' structure, a simple
   geometrical model is then constructed to account for sliding effects in
   carbon nanotubes for contemporary understanding of auxetic behavior
   (negative Poisson's ratio). The alignment of carbon nanotubes plays a
   prominent role in augmenting the magnitude of negative Poisson's ratio.

Title = {{Geometry: The leading parameter for the Poisson's ratio of

Abstract = {{Control over the deformation behaviour that a cellular structure shows
   in response to imposed external forces is a requirement for the
   effective design of mechanical metamaterials, in particular those with
   negative Poisson's ratio. This article sheds light on the old question
   of the relationship between geometric microstructure and mechanical
   response, by comparison of the deformation properties of bar-and-joint
   frameworks with those of their realisation as a cellular solid made from
   linear-elastic material. For ordered planar tessellation models, we find
   a classification in terms of the number of degrees of freedom of the
   framework model: first, in cases where the geometry uniquely prescribes
   a single deformation mode of the framework model, the mechanical
   deformation and Poisson's ratio of the linearly-elastic cellular solid
   closely follow those of the unique deformation mode; the result is a
   bending-dominated deformation with negligible dependence of the
   effective Poisson's ratio on the underlying material's Poisson's ratio
   and small values of the effective Young's modulus. Second, in the case
   of rigid structures or when geometric degeneracy prevents the
   bending-dominated deformation mode, the effective Poisson's ratio is
   material-dependent and the Young's modulus (E) over tilde (cs) large.
   All analysed structures of this type have positive values of the
   Poisson's ratio and large values of (E) over tilde (cs). Third, in the
   case, where the framework has multiple deformation modes, geometry alone
   does not suffice to determine the mechanical deformation. These results
   clarify the relationship between mechanical properties of a
   linear-elastic cellular solid and its corresponding bar-and-joint
   framework abstraction. They also raise the question if, in essence,
   auxetic behaviour is restricted to the geometry-guided class of
   bending-dominated structures corresponding to unique mechanisms, with
   inherently low values of the Young's modulus. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) layered materials with
   orthorhombic symmetry and distinct planar crystallographic lattices down
   to the monolayer limit, can potentially display in-plane anisotropy and
   diverse functionalities arising from their structural anisotropy.
   Typically, group-IV monopnictides (SiP, SiAs, GeP and GeAs) and
   dipnictides (SiP2, SiAs2, GeP2 and GeAs2) are two prototypical types of
   synthetic vdW layered materials characterized by orthorhombic symmetry
   and in-plane anisotropy in their 2D layered structural forms. In the
   current work, in order to provide deep insights into the in-plane
   anisotropic properties and especially to explore the new functionalities
   associated with in-plane anisotropy that have not yet been uncovered
   experimentally so far, we perform first-principles calculations to
   systematically investigate the structural, mechanical, electronic and
   optical properties, and electromechanical responses for 2D group-IV
   monopnictide AB and dipnictide AB(2) (A = Si and Ge, B = P and As)
   monolayers. Based on our calculations, both 2D monopnictide and
   dipnictide monolayers are predicted to exhibit in-plane anisotropy in
   their mechanical, electronic and optical absorption properties,
   including distinct elastic constants, Young's moduli, effective carrier
   masses and optical absorption along the two planar directions.
   Especially, owing to the unique 2D puckered crystal structure composed
   of corner-sharing AB(4) tetrahedrons, AB(2) monolayers can exhibit an
   extraordinarily large in-plane negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) of up to
   -0.32, making these group-IV dipnictides rare 2D auxetic materials.
   Moreover, compared to the centrosymmetric AB monopnictides, 2D AB(2)
   monolayers are characterized by acentric symmetry, where non-zero
   electric polarization can be obtained along one of the planar axes. Such
   a structural polarity can lead to a sizable negative longitudinal
   piezoelectric coefficient d(33) as large as -11.84 pC N-1. These
   intriguing properties arise from the in-plane anisotropy making 2D
   group-IV dipnictides of great promise for applications such as nanoscale
   auxetic sensors and low dimensional electromechanical devices.}},

Abstract = {{Poisson's ratio (PR), the relation between lateral contraction of an
   elastic rod when subjected to a longitudinal extension, has a long and
   interesting history. For isotropic bodies, it can theoretically range
   from + 1/2 to - 1; the experimental gamut for anisotropic materials is
   even larger. For the vast majority of materials the PR is positive for
   all combinations of directions. But as far back as the 1800s, Voigt and
   others found that for some materials negative values were encountered.
   Negative PR (nPR) values remained for man), years merely a curiosity,
   but more recently some of the interesting technological consequences
   have come to he recognized {[}1-3]. Some of the counterintuitive
   acoustic possibilities of nPRs are analogous, in a certain fashion, to
   those arising with negative refraction electromagnetic materials {[}4].
   Even when a material does not have nPR properties, if it is
   piezoelectric, then the PR can be altered, sometimes by, appreciable
   amounts, by changing the electrical boundary conditions {[}5-6]. We
   review Poisson's ratio in crystals, describing technologically important
   materials that have small, or negative PRs. Potential applications of
   the nPR property are also mentioned.}},

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{83}},
Month = {{SEP-OCT}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a stiffening method by which new inclined walls are
   added to the classical re-entrant honeycomb cell. This modification
   boosts the in-plane rigidity of the re-entrant cell without significant
   loss from auxetic behaviour. This study focuses on the in-plane
   elasticity moduli and negative Poisson's ratios along the principal
   axes. Analytical expressions that calculate the elasticity moduli and
   negative Poisson's ratios are derived; both finite element modelling and
   experiments reported in the literature validate the expressions of this
   work. Further, the variation in the in-plane elastic properties of the
   core cell is examined by altering the new wall's geometric, sectional,
   and material parameters. The results from the analytical expressions and
   the finite element models match very closely and demonstrate the boosted
   rigidity of the cell proposed in this work. This work also provides a
   benchmark of the new cell against the classical cell that can be used to
   tailor the in-plane elasticity moduli and negative Poisson's ratios to
   suit the needs of different applications.}},

   behaviors emerge from periodic cellular structures regardless of the

   top-down approaches and macroscopic with unit cells of microns or
   larger. There are also molecular auxetics including natural crystals
   which are not designable. There is a gap from few nanometers to microns,
   which may be filled by biomolecular self-assembly. Herein, we
   demonstrate two-dimensional auxetic nanostructures using DNA origami.
   Structural reconfigurations are performed by two-step DNA reactions and
   complemented by mechanical deformation studies using molecular dynamics
   simulations. We find that the auxetic behaviors are mostly defined by
   geometrical designs, yet the properties of the materials also play an
   important role. From elasticity theory, we introduce design principles

Abstract = {{Eight diamond-like structures (tubulanes) of different morphology based
   on carbon nanotubes are studied by the combination of molecular dynamics
   simulation and analytical calculations. Molecular dynamics is used for
   the structure relaxation, stability analysis, and calculation of the
   stiffness and compliance coefficients of stable tubulanes. Six stable
   tubulanes which can be elastically deformed are distinguished among the
   considered structures. Engineering elastic constants such as Young's
   modulus, Poisson's ratio, shear modulus, and bulk modulus are found by
   analytical methods. Two of the studied structures, TA6 and TB, are found
   to be partial auxetics having negative Poisson's ratio with the minimum
   values of -0.01 and - 0.8, respectively. The maximum Young's modulus for
   tubulanes TA6, TA8, and TB is found to be > 1 TPa. In combination with
   hardness close to that of diamond, considered phases with their
   outstanding mechanical properties can be potentially used as protective
   coatings.}},

Abstract = {{Buckling is one type of unstable structural response which has been
   known for centuries. Although buckling is generally regarded as a type
   of undesirable phenomenon, many investigations reported that it can be
   utilized to generate buckling-induced metamaterials and structures with

   buckling-induced auxetic behavior will disappear when the base material
   is changed from elastomer to metal. A pattern scale factor (PSF) method
   to recover auxeticity of metallic metamaterials and structures was
   mentioned in previous studies, but the method has not been specifically
   introduced. Herein, a more detailed introduction of the PSF method is
   made and some successful case studies are presented.}},

Abstract = {{Materials and structures with negative Poisson's ratio are characterized
   as auxetics. They are interesting for engineering applications due to
   their non-conventional behavior. However, most of the auxetic structures
   suffer with a disadvantage that they are difficult to be fabricated
   because of their complicated geometry structure. To overcome this
   problem, an auxetic structure made of tubes and corrugated sheets using
   conventional technology is proposed in this study. Its auxetic effect is
   investigated by both geometrical analysis and finite element method. For
   validating the analyses, a real auxetic structure is made with aluminum
   material and tested under compression condition. All the results
   obtained show that the proposed structure has very significant negative
   Poisson's ratio effect under compression. The study has provided a
   simple way to fabricate auxetic structure for using in a wide range of
   industrial fields at a low cost.}},

Title = {{Double-core helical auxetic yarn: a Novel structure, geometrical
   modeling and experimental verification}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE TEXTILE INSTITUTE}},
Abstract = {{In this work, a new structure for designing auxetic yarn and its
   geometrical analysis is presented. The proposed structure is referred to
   as a double-core helical auxetic yarn (DC-HAY). It consists of two core
   components of soft yarn with a larger diameter and one wrap component of
   stiff yarn with a smaller diameter. A primary geometrical model for
   predicting the Poisson's ratio of the structure was presented through
   the deformation analysis of the DC-HAY during the tensile loading. Also,
   the primary proposed model was modified by considering the non-linear
   behavior of Poisson's ratio of the core components. For the verification
   of the proposed models, some experiments were conducted based on the
   initial wrapping angle, as well as the diameter ratio and modulus ratio
   of components. The results showed that the proposed yarn structure
   exhibits an apparent auxetic outcome. Moreover, the modified model is
   capable of predicting the maximum negative Poisson's ratio of the DC-HAY
   with a desirable error. Furthermore, it was found that the higher
   modulus ratio of components, higher diameter ratio of components and the
   lower initial wrapping angle will result in a higher maximum NPR, which
   were -8.23, -8.16 through the main lateral directions of samples.}},

   is shown that the tubes have a positive Poisson's ratio in the entire
   range of chiral angles, unlike nanotubes obtained by rolling up crystal
   plates with the {[}010] orientation. Poynting's coefficient of nanotubes
   rolled up from plates with the {[}011] orientation becomes negative at
   certain chiral angles, which corresponds to a change in the twisting
   direction of the nanotubes under tension. The description of the
   dependence of the elastic properties of nanotubes on the chiral angle
   and thickness within anisotropic elasticity theory agrees qualitatively
   with the results of molecular statics simulations. The results for some

Abstract = {{In recent years, three-dimensional auxetic structures have attracted
   great interest. Generally, three-dimensional auxetic structures are of
   complicate geometries which make them difficult to fabricate, benefiting
   from the development of additive manufacturing technologies, many
   three-dimensional auxetic structures can be made from metals or
   polymers. However, to the authors' knowledge, the additive manufacturing
   technology of fiber reinforced polymer is not fully developed, and none
   three-dimensional auxetic structure made from fiber reinforced polymer
   has been reported before. To integrate the high specific stiffness, high
   specific strength, and light weight merits of high-performance fiber
   reinforced polymer composites into three-dimensional auxetic structures
   with unique properties, research on composite three-dimensional auxetic
   structures made from fiber reinforced polymer should be conducted. This
   paper presents the composite three-dimensional re-entrant auxetic
   structures made from carbon fiber reinforced polymer laminates using an
   interlocking assembly method. The auxetic nature of the composite
   structure has been verified by experimental testing and finite element
   simulations. Based on the finite element models, the dependences of the
   Poisson's ratio and effective compression modulus of the composite
   auxetic three-dimensional re-entrant structure on the re-entrant angle
   have been studied and compared to metal three-dimensional re-entrant
   structure. A comparative study of the Poisson's ratio and specific
   stiffness of carbon fiber reinforced polymer composite auxetic structure
   with the three-dimensional printed polymer and metal auxetic structures
   in literature has also been conducted.}},

Abstract = {{We describe a new class of negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) open cell
   PU-PE foams produced by blocking the shape memory effect in the polymer.
   Contrary to classical NPR open cell thermoset and thermoplastic foams
   that return to their auxetic phase after reheating (and therefore limit
   their use in technological applications), this new class of cellular
   solids has a permanent negative Poisson's ratio behavior, generated
   through multiple shape memory (mSM) treatments that lead to a fixity of
   the topology of the cell foam. The mSM-NPR foams have Poisson's ratio
   values similar to the auxetic foams prior their return to the
   conventional phase, but compressive stress strain curves similar to the
   ones of conventional foams. The results show that by manipulating the
   shape memory effect in polymer microstructures it is possible to obtain
   new classes of materials with unusual deformation mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{With the development of functional and structural materials, increasing
   interests have been shown in the field of biomaterials with a negative
   Poisson's ratio (auxetic), which exhibit the unusual property of
   becoming thinner when compressed. This unusual property makes it
   potentially a synthetic replacement biomaterial with adequate mechanical
   property and wear resistance. In this study, the potential of applying
   the auxetic ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) for the
   artificial hip joint was discussed. The contact mechanics
   characteristics in artificial hip joint replacement under different
   Poisson's ratios of -1<mu <= 0.5 were investigated and compared using
   the finite element method. The results show that Poisson's ratio had
   great effect on the contact mechanics in artificial hip joint
   replacement. Therefore, the future work should focus on tailoring an
   auxetic UHMWPE with a suitable Poisson's ratio for artificial hip joint
   replacements.}},

Abstract = {{Most materials shrink laterally like a rubber band when stretched, so
   their Poisson's ratios are positive. Likewise, most materials contract
   in all directions when hydrostatically compressed and decrease density
   when stretched, so they have positive linear compressibilities. We found
   that the in- plane Poisson's ratio of carbon nanotube sheets (
   buckypaper) can be tuned from positive to negative by mixing single-
   walled and multiwalled nanotubes. Density- normalized sheet toughness,
   strength, and modulus were substantially increased by this mixing. A
   simple model predicts the sign and magnitude of Poisson's ratio for
   buckypaper from the relative ease of nanofiber bending and stretch, and
   explains why the Poisson's ratios of ordinary writing paper are positive
   and much larger. Theory also explains why the negative in- plane
   Poisson's ratio is associated with a large positive Poisson's ratio for
   the sheet thickness, and predicts that hydrostatic compression can
   produce biaxial sheet expansion. This tunability of Poisson's ratio can
   be exploited in the design of sheet- derived composites, artificial
   muscles, gaskets, and chemical and mechanical sensors.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials exhibiting a negative Poisson's ratio are shown to
   have better indentation resistance, impact shielding capability, and
   enhanced toughness. Here, we report a class of high-performance
   composites in which auxetic lattice structures are used as the
   reinforcements and the nearly incompressible soft material is employed
   as the matrix. This coupled geometry and material design concept is
   enabled by the state-of-the-art additive manufacturing technique. Guided
   by experimental tests and finite element analyses, we systematically
   study the compressive behavior of the 3D printed auxetics reinforced
   composites and achieve a significant enhancement of their stiffness and
   energy absorption. This improved mechanical performance is due to the
   negative Poisson's ratio effect of the auxetic reinforcements, which
   makes the matrix in a state of biaxial compression and hence provides
   additional support. This mechanism is further supported by the
   investigation of the effect of auxetic degree on the stiffness and
   energy absorption capability. The findings reported here pave the way
   for developing a new class of auxetic composites that significantly
   expand their design space and possible applications through a
   combination of rational design and 3D printing. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Auxetic composites have attracted considerable attention in recent years
   and have demonstrated a high potential of applications in different
   areas due to their wonderful properties as compared to non-auxetic
   composites. In this study, a three-dimensional (3D) auxetic textile
   structure previously developed was used as reinforcement to fabricate
   auxetic composites with conventional polyurethane (PU) foam. Both the
   deformation behavior and mechanical properties of the auxetic composites
   under compression were analyzed and compared with those of the pure PU
   foam and non-auxetic composites made with the same materials and
   structural parameters but with different yarn arrangement. The results
   show that the negative Poisson's ratio of composites can be obtained
   when suitable yarn arrangement in a 3D textile structure is adopted. The
   results also show that the auxetic composites and non-auxetic composites
   have different mechanical behaviors due to different yarn arrangements
   in 3D textile structure. While the auxetic composites behave more like
   damping material with lower compression stress, the non-auxetic
   composite behaves more like stiffer material with higher compression
   stress. It is expected that this study could pave a way to the
   development of innovative 3D auxetic textile composites for different
   potential applications such as impact protection. (C) 2016 WILEY-VCH

Journal = {{ADVANCED COMPOSITES AND HYBRID MATERIALS}},
Abstract = {{Of late, metamaterials have been designed such that they possess
   properties that can switch between positive and negative signs depending
   on the external environment. This paper draws inspiration from an
   Islamic geometric design at the Alhambra Palace for designing a
   metamaterial that exhibits positive coefficients of thermal, pressure,
   and moisture expansions upon cooling, pressurizing, and drying but
   manifests negative coefficients of thermal, pressure, and moisture
   expansions with heating, deceasing pressure, and moistening such that
   the metamaterial always shrinks with environmental changes with
   reference from the original state. The metamaterial is constructed by
   using straight bimaterial strips with alternating orientation that are
   joined at the rigid hexagonal junction nodes to form equilateral
   triangular array such that it transforms into the hexachiral honeycomb
   structure regardless of how the environmental conditions change. Results
   indicate that every effective in-plane expansion coefficient is almost
   linearly proportional to its corresponding environmental change. In
   addition to exhibiting sign-switching expansion coefficients, the
   metamaterial displays positive Poisson's ratio in its original state but
   manifests negative Poisson's ratio upon environmental change(s).}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a study of using weft-knitting technology to
   fabricate negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) knitted fabrics, which exhibit
   the unusual property of becoming wider when stretched. Based on a
   geometrical analysis of a three-dimensional NPR structure constructed
   with parallelogram planes of the same shape and size, a new kind of NPR
   weft-knitted fabric was firstly designed and fabricated on a
   computerized flat-knitting machine. Then the NPR values of these fabrics
   were evaluated and compared with those from the theoretical
   calculations. The results show that all knitted fabrics have the NPR
   effect, which decreases with increased strain in the course direction.
   This variation trend is consistent with the theoretical prediction. The
   results also show that the main structure parameter affecting the NPR
   effect of a fabric is the opening angle at its initial state. Fabric
   with a smaller opening angle will have higher NPR values. This paper
   demonstrates the feasibility of fabricating NPR-knitted fabrics by using
   weft-knitting technology if a suitable structure and parameters are

   expansion. In addition, their manufacture using ceramic materials is
   still challenging. In this study we present a very promising approach
   for the development of auxetic metamaterials and devices based on the
   use of lithography-based ceramic manufacturing. The process stands out
   for its precision and complex three-dimensional geometries attainable,
   without the need of supporting structures, and for enabling the
   manufacture of ceramic auxetics with their geometry controlled from the
   design stage with micrometric precision. To our knowledge it represents
   the first example of application of this technology to the manufacture
   of auxetic geometries using ceramic materials. We have used a special
   three-dimensional auxetic design whose remarkable NPR has been
   previously highlighted.}},

Abstract = {{Materials that possess a negative Poisson's ratio are called Auxetics.
   They are characterized by the counterintuitive behavior of expanding in
   tension and contracting in compression. To justify this deformation
   behavior, there have been developed theoretical modelations like the
   reentrant and bowtie models. However, the most generalized models are
   based on geometries that possess rigid trusses and hinging nodes. This
   does not portrait the reality of the application of these models. In
   this study, there have been performed simulations, using kinematic
   analysis to characterize the auxetic behavior of the theoretical
   rigid/hinging models and finite element analysis to characterize elastic
   models that represent real bodies. There were determined and compared
   the Poisson's ratios of the theoretical and elastic reentrant and
   bowtie. Additionally it was shown that there is a significant difference
   between the results. In conclusion the theoretical models predict lower
   values of Poisson's ratio, while the elastic models that simulate a real
   body show less auxetic behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Negative Poisson's ratio copper foam was prepared and characterized
   experimentally. The transformation into re-entrant foam was accomplished
   by applying sequential permanent compressions above the yield point to
   achieve a triaxial compression. The Poisson's ratio of the re-entrant
   foam depended on strain and attained a relative minimum at strains near
   zero. Poisson's ratio as small as - 0.8 was achieved. The strain
   dependence of properties occurred over a narrower range of strain than
   in the polymer foams studied earlier. Annealing of the foam resulted in
   a slightly greater magnitude of negative Poisson's ratio and greater
   toughness at the expense of a decrease in the Young's modulus.}},

Abstract = {{Tendons are visco-elastic structures that connect bones to muscles and
   perform the basic function of force transfer to and from the skeleton.
   They are essential for positioning as well as energy storing when
   involved in more abrupt movements such as jumping. Unfortunately, they
   are also prone to damage, and when injuries occur, they may have
   dilapidating consequences. For instance, there is consensus that
   injuries of tendons such as Achilles tendinopathies, which are common in
   athletes, are difficult to treat. Here we show, through in vivo and ex
   vivo tests, that healthy tendons are highly anisotropic and behave in a
   very unconventional manner when stretched, and exhibit a negative
   Poisson's ratio (auxeticity) in some planes when stretched up to 2\%
   along their length, i.e. within their normal range of motion.
   Furthermore, since the Poisson's ratio is highly dependent on the
   material's microstructure, which may be lost if tendons are damaged or
   diseased, this property may provide a suitable diagnostic tool to assess
   tendon health.
   Statement of significance
   We report that human tendons including the Achilles tendons exhibits the
   very unusual mechanical property of a negative Poisson's ratio (auxetic)
   meaning that they get fatter rather than thinner when stretched. This
   report is backed by in vivo and ex vivo experiments we performed which
   clearly confirm auxeticity in this living material for strains which
   correspond to those experienced during most normal everyday activities.
   We also show that this property is not limited to the human Achilles
   tendon, as it was also found in tendons taken from sheep and pigs. This
   new information about tendons can form the scientific basis for a test
   for tendon health as well as enable the design of better tendon
   prosthesis which could replace damaged tendons. (C) 2015 Acta Materialia

Journal = {{MECHANICS RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{The question is discussed on the possibility of utilization of such
   simplest fractional derivative viscoelastic models as Kelvin-Voigt and
   standard linear solid models for the description of the dynamic response
   of viscoelastic bodies, namely: beams and plates. It has been shown that
   the adoption of the Kelvin-Voigt model with the fractional derivative in
   conjunction with the time-independent Poisson's ratio for the
   description of the dynamic behavior of a viscoelastic Kirchhoff-Love
   plate results in the fact that the given problem is reduced to the
   equivalent problem on dynamic response of an elastic Kirchhoff Love
   plate in a viscoelastic medium with fractional damping. If Young's
   operator is preassigned via the fractional derivative Kelvin-Voigt model
   in conjunction with the time-independent coefficient of volume
   extension-compression for solving the same problem, what seems to be
   more logical from the point of view of experimental data, then such a
   model tunes out to be inapplicable at all, while if the shear operator
   is governed by the fractional derivative Kelvin-Voigt model, then such a
   model could describe the behavior of so-called auxetic materials with
   negative Poisson's ratios. As for the fractional derivative standard
   linear solid model, then it remains to be correct both with and without
   considering the volume relaxation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In comparing a material's resistance to distort under mechanical load

   advances, we emphasize the significance of relationships outside the

Abstract = {{Mechanical metamaterials represent a class of deformable systems, which
   exhibit macroscopic deformations, mechanical, and/or thermal properties.
   These emerge due to the structure of their subunits rather than their
   materials composition and typically exhibit anomalous (normally
   negative) macroscopic structural, mechanical, or thermal
   property/properties caused by a change in shape/size of the system.
   Herein, a class of honeycombs is discussed, which push to the extreme
   the classical definition of ``mechanical metamaterials,{''} exhibiting
   temperature-tunable Poisson's ratio properties. More specifically,
   centrosymmetric honeycombs with T-shaped joints constructed from
   different materials are shown to exhibit temperature-dependent Poisson's
   ratio values, which can be either positive or negative (auxetic)
   depending on the external stimulus the system is subjected to. The sign
   and magnitudes of the Poisson's ratio values are explained in terms of
   particular geometries that these composite honeycomb systems attain at
   different temperature conditions. In particular, auxeticity is
   attributed to the transformation of the T-shaped units to re-entrant
   units. Practical aspects on how these properties may be achieved are
   discussed, including the possibility that the changes in shape, and
   hence Poisson's ratios, are inducedviadifferent extents of dryness on
   opposite surfaces of ligaments made from absorbent materials.}},

Abstract = {{Effective properties and dynamic response of a sandwich panel made of
   two face sheets and auxetic core are analyzed in this study by computer
   simulations. The inner composite layer is made of a cellular auxetic
   structure immersed in a filler material of a given Poisson's ratio
   (filler material fills the voids in structure). Each cell is composed of
   an auxetic structure (re-entrant honeycomb or rotating square), i.e.,
   exhibiting negative Poisson's ratio without any filler. Influence of
   filler material on the effective properties of the sandwich panel is
   investigated. The proposed structure shows interesting structural
   characteristics and dynamic properties. Our results clearly show that it
   is possible to create auxetic sandwich panels made of two solid
   materials with positive Poisson's ratio. This is even possible if the
   filler material is nearly incompressible, but can move in out-of-plane
   direction. Moreover, effective Young's modulus of such sandwich panels
   becomes very large if the Poisson's ratio of the filler material tends
   to -1. (C) 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA, Weinheim}},

Abstract = {{Some exceptional materials become fatter when stretched and are
   described as auxetics or having negative Poisson's ratio. Auxetic
   textiles belong to this class of extraordinary materials that are
   increasingly attaining some prominence in many applications of technical
   textiles. We have sustained the efforts to fabricate auxetic fabric
   structures based on non-auxetic yarns. The focus is to combine our
   knowledge of geometry and fabric structural characteristics to engineer
   auxetic textiles and to determine the properties of such auxetic textile
   fabrics. To realize our objective, we designed and investigated
   hexagonal knit structures as auxetic textiles offering optimum
   performance. The factors that influence Poisson's ratio are identified
   as yarn type, number of chain courses and strain level. Also, a method
   has been developed for quantifying the geometrical structural unit cell
   of the auxetic structure based on measured parameters, namely a1, a2,
   b1, b2, h and c, as detailed in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{Force field based simulations have been employed to model the structure,
   and mechanical and mass transport properties of the all-silica zeolite
   MFI (ZSM5-Si96O192). Undeformed and deformed MFI subject to uniaxial
   loading in each of the three principal directions were investigated. The
   mechanical properties are predicted to include negative on-axis
   Poisson's ratios ( auxetic behaviour) in the x(1)-x(3) plane of the
   undeformed structure, and are strain-dependent. Transformation from
   positive-to-negative Poisson's ratio behaviour, and vice versa, is
   predicted for most on-axis Poisson's ratios at critical loading strains.
   Simulations of the simultaneous sorption of neopentane and benzene guest
   molecules onto the undeformed host MFI framework indicate a low
   neopentane-to-benzene loading ratio, consistent with experimental
   observation. The sorption of these two molecular species onto deformed
   MFI is Poisson's ratio-and strain-dependent. Uniaxial tensile loading
   along a direction containing a negative on-axis Poisson's ratio leads to
   an increase in the loading of the larger neopentane molecules with
   respect to benzene, strongly correlated with the increase in volume
   associated with auxetic behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials (i.e. materials with a negative Poisson's ratio)
   expand laterally when stretched and become thinner when compressed. This
   unusual yet very useful property arises from the way by which the nano
   or microstructure of the material deforms when subjected to uniaxial
   mechanical loads. This paper discusses a novel class of molecular-level
   auxetic (networked polymers) built from calix{[}4] arene building
   blocks. These calix{[} 4] arene subunits are connected in such a way
   that they mimic the shape of a ``folded macrostructure{''} which is
   known to exhibit auxetic behaviour. We confirm through force-field based
   simulations that these newly proposed networked polymers exhibit
   negative Poisson's ratios, the magnitudes of which can be changed by
   introducing slight variations in the molecular structure of these
   polymers. We also develop simple geometry-based models which explain the
   values of the Poisson's ratios obtained through the force-field based
   simulations, and which give an insight into the features of the
   molecular structure that are responsible for the auxetic effect.}},

Abstract = {{We conducted molecular statics simulations to investigate the negative
   Poisson's ratio (auxetic behavior) of periodic porous graphene
   structures based on the rotating rigid unit mechanism. To obtain a
   negative Poisson's ratio, simple voids were periodically introduced into
   graphene. We showed that the Poisson's ratio of the designed graphene
   structure is strongly dependent on the aspect ratio of the voids, and it
   can approach the theoretical limit of -1.0. More importantly, the
   graphene periodic structure maintains its auxetic behavior even under
   large strains (epsilon similar to 0.20). Hence, it can be employed in a
   wide range of applications requiring structures that can endure large
   deformation. In addition, we found that the key factor in the auxeticity
   of the investigated structures is the deformation occurring at the void
   tips. (C) 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA, Weinheim}},

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional auxetic materials have attracted considerable attention
   due to their potential applications in medicine, tougher composites,
   defense, and so on. However, they are scare especially at low dimension,
   as auxetic materials are mainly realized in engineered materials and
   structures. Here, using first-principles calculations, we identify a
   compelling two-dimensional auxetic material, single-layer Ag2S, which
   possesses large negative Poisson's ratios in both in-plane and
   out-of-plane directions, but anisotropic ultralow Young's modulus. Such
   a coexistence of simultaneous negative Poisson's ratios in two
   directions is extremely rare, which is mainly originated from its
   particular zigzag-shaped buckling structure. In addition, contrary to
   the previously known metal-shrouded single-layer M2X (M = metal, X =
   nonmetal), single-layer Ag2S is the first nonmetal-shrouded M2X.
   Electronic calculations show that it is an indirect-gap semiconductor
   with gap value of 2.83 eV, and it can be turned to be direct with
   strain. These intriguing properties make single-layer Ag2S a promising
   auxetic material in electronics and mechanics.}},

   tensile testing machine and a Deben microtensile testing machine. The
   film is elastically anisotropic with the Poisson's ratio and Young's

Abstract = {{A new design principle is suggested for constructing auxetic structures
   - the structures that exhibit negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) at
   macroscopic level. We propose 2D assemblies of identical units made of a
   flexible frame with a sufficiently rigid reinforcing core at the centre.
   The core increases the frame resistance to the tangential movement thus
   ensuring high shear stiffness, whereas the normal stiffness is low being
   controlled by the local bending response of the frame. The structures
   considered have hexagonal symmetry, which delivers macroscopically
   isotropic elastic properties in the plane perpendicular to the axis of
   the symmetry. We determine the macroscopic Poisson's ratio as a ratio of
   corresponding relative displacements computed using the direct
   microstructural approach. It is demonstrated that the proposed design
   can produce a macroscopically isotropic system with NPR close to the
   lower bound of -1. We also developed a 2D elastic Cosserat continuum
   model, which represents the microstructure as a regular assembly of
   rigid particles connected by elastic springs. The comparison of values
   of NPRs computed using both structural models and the continuum approach
   shows that the continuum model gives a healthy balance between the
   simplicity and accuracy and can be used as a simple tool for design of
   auxetics. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Classical elasticity theory indicates that the existence of negative
   Poisson's ratios (NPRs), i.e. auxetic behavior in materials, will result
   in an increase in shear stiffness. Motivated by the assumption of
   gaining potential structural benefits, this study undertook to examine
   two main issues: (i) the feasibility of inducing auxetic behavior into
   thin-walled structures; and (ii) in cases where it is possible, whether
   it leads to shear stiffness enhancement. In the present study, the
   geometry of a membrane was chosen as a geometric model to address these
   issues. The results obtained in this study reveal that on the one hand
   the model effective elastic properties, E{*} and G{*}, are lower than
   those of the material the Surface is fabricated from, E{*} similar to
   1\% of the material elastic modulus and G{*} similar to 80\% of its
   shear modulus. On the other hand, the obtained properties are much
   higher than those observed for other available auxetics like honeycombs,
   foams and polymers. (C) 2008 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Mean-field theory of elastic moduli of a two-phase disordered composite
   with ellipsoidal inclusions is reviewed together with an indication as
   to how interactions among inclusions may be taken into account. In the
   mean-field approximation, the effective Poisson ratio sigma(e) in
   composites with auxetic inclusions of various shapes such as discs,
   spheres, blades, needles, and disks is studied analytically and
   numerically. It is shown that phase properties such as inclusion volume
   or area fraction phi and matrix and inclusion Poisson ratios (sigma(m)
   and sigma) and Young's moduli (E-m and E) have a marked effect on
   sigma(e). The earlier theoretical findings of the existence of
   auxeticity windows and the widening effect of inclusion-inclusion
   interactions on the window for delta=E/E-m are reconfirmed for
   composites of auxetic spheres in both two and three dimensions, with new
   auxeticity windows discovered for the other inclusion shapes. For a
   composite with sigma= -0.8, sigma(m) = 0.25, and phi=0.4, it is found
   that the sphere is the most sigma(e)-lowering or
   negative-sigma(e)-producing inclusion shape for delta around 1/2, while
   disklike inclusions yield a most negative sigma(e) for delta greater

Abstract = {{This paper details a new 2D auxetic honeycomb that was structured by
   mirroring the horizontal series-connected parallelograms along the
   vertical direction. A combination of analytical, numerical, and
   experimental methods was used to gain a deep understanding of the
   elastic behavior of the new honeycomb and examined its dependence on the
   geometric parameters. The results showed that the new honeycomb can
   achieve a negative Poisson's ratio via a novel mechanism. Furthermore,
   the newly developed 2D honeycomb was extended to three dimensions, and
   three kinds of 3D structures were conceived via different splicing
   methods. A preliminary numerical study was conducted to explore the
   mechanical properties of the 3D structures. An auxetic effect was found
   in two principal orthogonal coordinate directions of those 3D structures
   when they were compressed along the other principal axis. This work may
   provide a new insight into the design of both the 2D and 3D auxetics.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic foam was a new kind of material which exhibit negative Poisson's
   ratio effect. It has a wide application prospect. However, auxetic foam
   would gradually expand to its original volume with time increasing, and
   the negative Poisson's ratio effect will disappear. The practical use of
   the auxetic foam has been limited, and it becomes an urgent problem to
   be solved before its application. The preparation conditions and the
   recovery ability of auxetic foam, the 60 ppi open cell polyurethane (PU)
   foam was used as the parent material. The PU foams were compressed in
   three dimensions and been heat treated at setting temperatures. After
   cooling down, the auxetic foams were made. In this study, all samples
   were set with the same radial compression ratio, but three different
   axial compression ratios. During the heat treatment process, the setting
   temperatures were 140 degrees C, 150 degrees C and 160 degrees C
   respectively. It was found that the setting temperature in the condition
   of this study should be heated until 150 degrees C to obtain the

Abstract = {{In this paper, an investigation on the low-velocity impact (LVI)
   response of a shear deformable beam laminated by carbon nanotube
   reinforced composite (CNTRC) layers is performed. The composite beam is
   ``auxetic{''} due to the negative out-of-plane Poisson's ratio (NPR)
   through special symmetric stacking sequences of layers that are designed
   based on the Classical Laminate Theory. To study the effect of the
   out-of-plane NPR on the LVI response of the composite beam, a newly
   defined Hertz model is developed. The motion equations of Karman type
   for the CNTRC laminate beam are derived in the framework of the Reddy
   beam theory and solved by means of a two-step perturbation approach
   while the dynamic equation of the impactor is built on Newton's Law.
   Since temperature-dependent material properties of both carbon nanotube
   (CNT) and matrix are employed, the thermal influence on the LVI behavior
   is also investigated. Moreover, a piece-wise method is employed herein
   to investigate the effect of functionally graded (FG) patterns of the
   CNT reinforcements on the impact response. Numerical results elucidating
   the effects of temperature, FG distribution, and CNT volume fraction on
   the out-of-plane Poisson's ratio and impact response of the beam are
   obtained by using a Range-Kutta method and discussed in details.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials (or metamaterials) have negative Poisson ratios (NPR)
   and display the unexpected properties of lateral expansion when
   stretched, and equal and opposing densification when compressed. Such
   auxetic materials are being used more frequently in the development of
   novel products, especially in the fields of intelligent expandable
   actuators, shape-morphing structures and minimally invasive implantable
   devices. Although several micromanufacturing technologies have already
   been applied to the development of auxetic materials and devices,
   additional precision is needed to take full advantage of their special
   mechanical properties. In this study, we present a very promising
   approach for the development of auxetic materials and devices based on
   the use of deep reactive ion etching (DRIE). The process stands out for
   its precision and its potential applications to mass production. To our
   knowledge, it represents the first time this technology has been applied
   to the manufacture of auxetic materials with nanometric details. We take
   into account the present capabilities and challenges linked to the use
   of DRIE in the development of auxetic materials and auxetic-based
   devices.}},

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{DEC 4}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic materials have negative Poisson's ratios and so expand rather
   than contract in one or several direction(s) perpendicular to applied
   extensions. The auxetics community has long sought synthetic molecular
   auxetics - non-porous, inherently auxetic materials which are simple to
   fabricate and avoid porosity-related weakening. Here, we report,
   synthetic molecular auxeticity for a non-porous liquid crystal
   elastomer. For strains above similar to 0.8 applied perpendicular to the
   liquid crystal director, the liquid crystal elastomer becomes auxetic
   with the maximum negative Poisson's ratio measured to date being -0.74
   +/- 0.03 - larger than most values seen in naturally occurring molecular
   auxetics. The emergence of auxeticity coincides with the liquid crystal
   elastomer backbone adopting a negative order parameter, Q(B) = -0.41 +/-
   0.01 - further implying negative liquid crystal ordering. The reported
   behaviours consistently agree with theoretical predictions from Warner
   and Terentjev liquid crystal elastomer theory. Our results open the door
   for the design of synthetic molecular auxetics.}},

   compressibility: A brief review}},
Journal = {{PROGRESS IN MATERIALS SCIENCE}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Mechanical metamaterials are man-made structures with counterintuitive
   mechanical properties that originate in the geometry of their unit cell
   instead of the properties of each component. The typical mechanical
   metamaterials are generally associated with the four elastic constants,
   the Young's modulus E, shear modulus G, bulk modulus K and Poisson's
   ratio v, the former three of which correspond to the stiffness,
   rigidity, and compressibility of a material from an engineering point of
   view. Here we review the important advancements in structural topology
   optimisation of the underlying design principles, coupled with
   experimental fabrication, thereby to obtain various counterintuitive
   mechanical properties. Further, a clear classification of mechanical
   metamaterials have been established based on the fundamental material
   mechanics. Consequently, mechanical metamaterials can be divide into
   strong-lightweight (E/rho), pattern transformation with tunable
   stiffness, negative compressibility (-4G/3 < K < 0), Pentamode
   metamaterials (G << K) and auxetic metamaterials (G >> K),
   simultaneously using topology optimisation to share various fancy but
   feasible mechanical properties, ultralight, ultra-stiffness,
   well-controllable stiffness, vanishing shear modulus, negative
   compressibility and negative Poisson's ratio. We provide here a broad
   overview of significant potential mechanical metamaterials together with
   the upcoming challenges in the intriguing and promising research field.

Title = {{Negative poisson's ratio in single-layer black phosphorus}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The Poisson's ratio is a fundamental mechanical property that relates
   the resulting lateral strain to applied axial strain. Although this
   value can theoretically be negative, it is positive for nearly all
   materials, though negative values have been observed in so-called
   auxetic structures. However, nearly all auxetic materials are bulk
   materials whose microstructure has been specifically engineered to
   generate a negative Poisson's ratio. Here we report using
   first-principles calculations the existence of a negative Poisson's
   ratio in a single-layer, two-dimensional material, black phosphorus. In
   contrast to engineered bulk auxetics, this behaviour is intrinsic for
   single-layer black phosphorus, and originates from its puckered
   structure, where the pucker can be regarded as a re-entrant structure
   that is comprised of two coupled orthogonal hinges. As a result of this
   atomic structure, a negative Poisson's ratio is observed in the
   out-of-plane direction under uniaxial deformation in the direction
   parallel to the pucker.}},

Abstract = {{This work discusses the concept of allowing the control of the stiffness
   of a particular class of re-entrant auxetic magneto-mechanical
   metamaterials through the introduction of magnets to the system. It is
   shown, through experimental testing backed up by a theoretical model,
   that the appropriate insertion of magnets in such a system will alter
   its stiffness, possibly even making it exhibit `negative stiffness'.
   This leads to a completely different behaviour of the structure in terms
   of stability. It is also reported that the investigated mechanical
   metamaterials may exhibit both negative stiffness and negative Poisson's
   ratio at the same time. Moreover, it is shown that the effect which
   magnets have on the stiffness of the system may be fine-tuned upon
   replacing magnets with electromagnets. Such systems have the potential
   to be used in a wide range of practical applications such as vibration
   damping devices where achieving a negative stiffness is of fundamental

Abstract = {{Chiral cellular structures inspired by the microstructure of
   biomaterials can display auxetic performances, such as negative
   Poisson's ratio (NPR), negative stiffness, energy dissipation, and
   acoustic absorption. In this study, novel chiral-type cylindrical shells
   were designed and fabricated via 3D printing method. Theoretical
   analysis, finite element analysis, and experiments were conducted to
   investigate the mechanical properties and deformation characteristics of
   cylindrical shell with various categories of chiral-type cells. Results
   revealed that the anti-chiral shell and chiral-axial shell can achieve
   auxetic behavior, namely, NPR behavior and compressive-twist response,
   which are beneficial for energy absorption and vibration isolation
   performance. Given the distinction in the geometrical configuration of
   unit cell, the cylindrical shells exhibited extremely diverse mechanical
   properties. The analytical formulae of axial compressive modulus were
   deduced based on Euler-Bernoulli beam theory, and the applicability and
   accuracy were verified. The new mechanical metastructures offer
   potential applications as smart actuators, biomechanical devices, and

Title = {{Elastic properties of an orthotropic binary fiber-reinforced composite
   with auxetic and conventional constituents}},
Journal = {{MECHANICS OF MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{48}},
Pages = {{1-25}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Closed-form expressions for the nine effective elastic constants of a
   binary fiber-reinforced composite with transversely isotropic
   constituents with positive (conventional) and negative (auxetic)
   Poisson's ratio are considered. Such formulae were obtained by means of
   the asymptotic homogenization method and were verified numerically with
   an independent finite element model. The overall properties display
   explicit dependence on (i) the properties of the constituents, (ii) the
   volume fraction or radius of inclusion and (iii) the array periodicity.
   They are finally obtained by solving a normal infinite symmetric linear
   system of algebraic equations by truncation to a relatively small order
   term. This allows a fast solution and low computation cost. The overall
   orthotropy of the elastic properties is obtained by varying the distance
   between the fibers in two of the principal directions leading to
   different spacial aspect ratio for fiber distribution. In addition to
   this, an analytical relation between the effective properties based on
   the symmetry of the stiffness tensor is introduced. With the previous
   elements, we present reliable predictions for auxetic and conventional
   composites of this kind wherein a significant enhancement in Young's
   modulus is found in a composite with an auxetic matrix reinforced by
   conventional fibres. Finally, we compute auxeticity windows (i.e.,
   intervals of volume fraction where the composite is auxetic) when the
   fibres are auxetic. It is reported that spacial fiber aspect ratio plays
   a key role in the composite auxetic behavior. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) materials have drawn significant interest
   because the enhanced toughness, shear resistance, and vibration
   absorption that typically are seen in auxetic materials may enable a
   range of novel applications. In this work, we report that single-layer
   graphene exhibits an intrinsic NPR, which is robust and independent of
   its size and temperature. The NPR arises due to the interplay between
   two intrinsic deformation pathways (one with positive Poisson's ratio,
   the other with NPR), which correspond to the bond stretching and angle
   bending interactions in graphene. We propose an energy-based deformation
   pathway criteria, which predicts that the pathway with NPR has lower
   energy and thus becomes the dominant deformation mode when graphene is
   stretched by a strain above 6\%, resulting in the NPR phenomenon.}},

   mechanism of borophene with defects}},
Journal = {{THIN SOLID FILMS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{709}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{In this work, we used molecular dynamics simulations to study the effect
   of vacancy defects and impurity defects on the tensile properties of
   monolayer borophene under uniaxial tension. The effects of the number of
   point defects and defect angle on the fracture behavior and the tensile
   properties were investigated under different tensile strains along the
   zigzag direction and armchair direction. Furthermore, the impact of
   temperature on their mechanical properties has been analyzed and
   discussed. We find that borophene has anisotropic properties, Young's
   modulus of the borophene nanosheet at 1 K is 165.03 Nm(-1) in the zigzag
   direction and 390.02 Nm(-1) in the armchair direction. The borophene has
   a negative Poisson's ratio in the direction perpendicular to the atomic
   plane. The mechanical strength and the ultimate strain of borophene
   decrease as increasing the temperature. Moreover, the stress
   concentration around the vacancy defect leads to the initial crack
   formed at the vacancy position and the reduction of the fracture
   strength. If increasing the dimension of the vacancies projected onto
   the direction, which is perpendicular to the tensile direction, the
   fracture strength, fracture strain, and Young's modulus will decrease.
   Besides, the mechanical strength of borophene is reduced by the
   substitutional C atoms defects. With the angle defect of theta = 60
   degrees the fracture of nanosheet which has C impurity defects easier
   occurs than the angle defect of theta = 0 degrees in both zigzag and
   armchair tensile directions.}},

Abstract = {{How can we modulate the inherent Poisson's ratio value of soft
   elastomeric materials? The theoretical limit value of the Poisson's
   ratio of isotropic materials can be defined from -1 to 0.5 but
   elastomers generally take the Poisson's ratio of 0.5. Herein, we
   introduce and establish the concept of a mechanical meta elastomer
   called ``auxetic elastomer{''}. This is a continuum-solid elastomer
   having unique programmable elastic properties of Poisson's ratio that
   are beyond their conventional ranges, and include in-plane negative and
   out-of-plane high positive Poisson's ratios. Leveraging these unique
   deformation characteristics, we applied auxetic elastomers as a soft
   dielectric material for a highly stretchable capacitive-type strain
   sensor that overcomes the inherent performance limitations in terms of
   the low gauge factor. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional carbon diamond-like phases consisting of sp
   (3)-hybridized atoms, obtained by linking of carcasses of fullerene-like
   molecules, are studied by methods of molecular dynamics modeling. For
   eight cubic and one hexagonal diamond-like phases on the basis of four
   types of fullerene-like molecules, equilibrium configurations are found
   and the elastic constants are calculated. The results obtained by the
   method of molecular dynamics are used for analytical calculations of the
   elastic characteristics of the diamond- like phases with the cubic and
   hexagonal anisotropy. It is found that, for a certain choice of the
   dilatation axis, three of these phases have negative Poisson's ratio,
   i.e., are partial auxetics. The variability of the engineering
   elasticity coefficients (Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, shear
   modulus, and bulk modulus) is analyzed.}},

Abstract = {{Negative Poisson's ratio materials, or auxetics, have drawn attention
   for the past 30 years. The auxetic effect could lead to improved
   mechanical properties such as acoustic damping, indentation resistance,
   or crashworthiness. In this work, two 3D auxetic lattices are
   introduced. Auxeticity is achieved by design through pre-buckling of the
   lattice struts. The influence of geometrical parameters on the effective
   elastic properties is investigated using computational homogenization
   method with periodic boundary conditions. Effective Young's modulus is
   3D mapped to reveal anisotropy and identify spatial orientations of
   interest. The effective Poisson ratio is computed for various geometric
   configurations to characterize auxeticity. Finally, the influence of
   effective elastic properties on energy dissipation under compression is
   explored for elastoplastic lattices with different loading directions,
   using finite element simulations. Results suggest that loading 3D
   auxetic lattices along their stiffest direction maximizes their
   crashworthiness.}},

Abstract = {{A two-dimensional auxetic lattice structure was fabricated from a PZT

   m were laser cut into inverted honeycomb lattice structure with
   re-entrant cell geometry (theta = -25 degrees) and poling direction
   oriented perpendicular to the lattice plane. The in-plane strain
   response upon applying an uniaxial compression load as well as an
   electric field perpendicular to the lattice plane were analyzed by a 2D
   image data detection analysis. The auxetic lattice structure exhibits
   orthotropic deformation behavior with a negative in-plane Poisson's
   ratio of -2.05. Compared to PZT bulk material the piezoelectric auxetic
   lattice revealed a strain amplification by a factor of 30-70. Effective
   transversal coupling coefficients d(31)(al) of the PZT lattice exceeding
   4 x 10(3) pm V-1 were determined which result in an effective
   hydrostatic coefficient d(h)(al) 66 times larger than that of bulk PZT.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic cellular materials are modern materials which have some unique
   and superior mechanical properties. As a consequence of the structural
   deformation of their internal cellular structure they exhibit a negative
   Poisson's ratio, i.e. they significantly increase in volume when
   stretched and vice versa. The effect of negative Poisson's ratio is
   useful in many applications to enhance certain physical properties such
   as the density, stiffness, fracture toughness, energy absorption and
   damping. These properties can be further tailored by using variable cell
   geometry and density distribution, which can be achieved with
   functionally graded porosity of auxetic materials. This review paper
   provides the state-of-the-art overview of the auxetic materials, their
   development, most common geometries, fabrication methods, mechanical
   properties, applications and further possibilities for their

   a reduced Poisson's ratio. In particular, swivelling mesogens of seven

Abstract = {{Analytical and Molecular Mechanics methods have been used to study the
   deformation mechanisms acting at the molecular level in the auxetic
   polymorph of crystalline silica (alpha-cristobalite). The analytical
   models indicate that alpha-cristobalite deforms by concurrent
   tetrahedral dilation and cooperative rotation when stretched along the
   x(3) axis, and that a second phase is predicted to exist for this
   loading scenario, having a geometry similar to that of `idealised'
   beta-cristobalite. This is supported by preliminary Molecular Mechanics
   simulations, which also indicate that the cooperative rotation predicted
   for loading along x(3) is not sufficient to describe the deformation
   mechanism for loading along x(1). A negative hydrostatic pressure offset
   is observed to lead to a change in the sign of the predicted Poisson's
   ratio from positive to negative, leading to improved agreement of the
   Molecular Mechanics model with experiment.}},

   lattice geometries}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{3}},

Abstract = {{Previously, auxetic materials were realized by designing building blocks
   with specific geometries or tuning topology of spring networks. Here, we
   propose a new approach by properly manipulating the disorder, especially
   the bond stiffness disorder, of an unstressed spring network. When
   randomly distorting a spring network initially with a close-packed
   lattice structure, we find that the resultant unstressed network becomes
   auxetic. Resulted from the distortion, longer bonds are likely to
   contribute more to the shear modulus but less to the bulk modulus.
   Inspired by this correlation, we realize isotropic auxeticity in the
   unstressed triangular lattice, by distributing each bond a spring
   constant according to a virtual lattice distortion. In the perspective
   of previous approaches, however, it is not straightforward to figure out
   how the close-packed lattices can be turned into auxetic independent of
   directions. The key of our approach is the correlated disorder induced
   by the (virtual) lattice distortion, which leads to a sufficiently large
   nonaffine contribution responsible to the auxeticity.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials and structures exhibit the unexpected behaviour of
   getting wider when stretched and thinner when compressed. This behaviour
   requires the structures ( the internal structure in the case of
   materials) to have geometric features, which must deform in a way that
   results in the structure expanding when stretched. This paper assesses
   the potential for auxetic behaviour of a novel class of two-dimensional
   periodic structures which can be described as ``connected stars{''} as
   they contain star-shaped units of different rotational symmetry which
   are connected together to form two-dimensional periodic structures.
   These structures will be studied through a technique based on
   force-field based methods ( the EMUDA technique) and it will be shown
   that some, but not all, of these structures can exhibit auxetic
   behaviour. An attempt is made to explain the reasons for the presence or
   absence of a negative Poisson's ratio in these systems.}},

   that the kabob-like polymers with auxegens lying vertically on the main
   chain can acquire auxeticity while those with auxegens lying
   horizontally on the main chain cannot. Besides, a half kabob-like or
   pseudo-ladder polymer with auxegens linked at the intersection of the
   beam and the arm does show auxeticity when adopting constrictive
   conformers. It is, however, worthwhile noting that the origins of

Abstract = {{Auxetic behavior (negative values of Poisson's ratio) in some cubic
   metals for a stretch along a cube-face diagonal was investigated in
   detail by R. H. Baughman et al., F. Milstein, K. Huang, M. Jain, M. P.
   Verma. Directions with extreme values of Poisson's ratio in crystals for
   a stretch along a cube-face diagonal and corresponding lateral strain
   along the orthogonal cube-face diagonal and cube-axis were considered by
   the authors. In this paper the stereographic projections of Poisson's
   ratio for a set of natural crystals with cubic, hexagonal and monoclinic
   symmetry were computed. From these stereographic projections the
   Poisson's ratio for any possible directions of stretch and lateral
   strain in the crystal were calculated and orientations of stretch and
   lateral strain with extreme values of Poisson's ratio were obtained.
   Crystals with auxetic behavior were revealed. Orientations of stretch
   directions and lateral strain directions with negative values of
   Poisson's ratio were determined. By analysis of the above results cuts
   with optimal negative values of Poisson's ratio were revealed in zinc,
   molybdenum sulfide, carbon, graphite, polypropylene, monoclinic natural
   minerals labradorite and augite, a complex silicate and in a set of
   cubic alloys. The exotic behavior of change of cross-section of a
   cylindrical rod during stretching along the rod axis was revealed in the

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{This paper proposes a three-dimensional (3D) lattice meta-material made
   by extending the existing two-dimensional enhanced auxetic model to a 3D
   one. With narrow ribs embedded into every cell of the typical 3D
   re-entrant honeycomb (TRH), the new structure can also be considered as
   an enhanced design of the TRH. A combination of theoretical and
   numerical analysis is carried out to gain a deeper understanding of the
   elastic behavior of the new 3D structure and its dependence on the
   geometric parameters. The new structure is proved analytically and
   numerically to exhibit a negative Poisson's ratio, while its Young's
   modulus is significantly improved compared to that of the TRH. It is
   remarkable that the Young's modulus of the new structure increases
   linearly with the relative density while an approximate square relation
   is found between that of the THR and the relative density, which reveals
   that the dominated deformation model of the micro-structures has been
   changed by the embedded ribs from bending to stretching. The present
   layout may be promising for some special applications due to its
   superior performance and may provide a new concept for the optimization
   design of 3D auxetic materials, whose stiffness is relatively low.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate auxetic isotropic elastic materials with the Poisson's
   ratio of exactly -1 and isotropic materials with the Poisson's ratio of
   near 0.5 (incompressible). In both cases the energy is not positive
   definite, which can lead to the material instability. In incompressible
   materials, the instability manifests itself in the emergence of
   non-uniform displacement distribution. Investigation of the behavior of
   such materials with respect to damage or crack accumulation is based on
   the notion that during the instantaneous process of fracture formation,
   the fracture acts as a negative stiffness element; after the fracture is
   formed, it immediately turns into a conventional fracture with usual
   positive stiffness. We demonstrate that the cracks formed due to tensile
   or combined tensile and shear fracturing of the material are capable of
   momentarily bringing the Poisson's ratio of nearly incompressible
   material to 0.5, which instantaneously turns the material into unstable.
   On the other hand, the formation of shear cracks leads to reduction in
   the Poisson's ratio bringing the material away from the point of
   instability. Opposite to this, cracks of all kinds do not change the
   Poisson's ratio in extreme auxetics (the Poisson's ratio equal to -1).
   Thus the auxetic materials remain stable with respect to fracture
   formation.}},

Journal = {{EXTREME MECHANICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{30}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{It is known that metamaterials with negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) can
   be designed to possess negative thermal expansion (NTE) property.
   However, it is uncommon to use NTE structures to obtain NPR behavior. In
   this paper, based on a typical NTE unit structure, two novel
   meta-structures with auxetic behavior are proposed, which are
   demonstrated by the micro-scale mechanical experiments and numerical
   simulations. By changing the angle of the structure, the Poisson's ratio
   of the structures could be positive, zero and negative. The extreme
   negative Poisson's ratio of the structures is about -0.94. Moreover, the
   thermal expansion of the novel 2D structures can also be designed and
   modulated to be positive, zero and negative. This concept of building 2D
   metamaterials with NPR in this study would open up new avenues to
   understand and design metamaterials with NPR and NTE for potential
   engineering applications, such as smart sensors and electronic
   components. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Longitudinal wave motion in width-constrained auxetic plates}},
Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{This paper investigates the longitudinal wave velocity in auxetic plates
   in comparison to conventional ones, in which the plate is constrained
   from motion in the width direction. By taking into account the thickness
   change of the plate and its corresponding change in density, the
   developed wave velocity is casted not only as a function of Young's
   modulus and density, but also in terms of Poisson's ratio and
   longitudinal strain. Results show that density and thickness variations
   compensate for one another when the Poisson's ratio is positive, but add
   up when the Poisson's ratio is negative. Results also reveal that the
   classical model of longitudinal wave velocity for the plate is accurate
   when the Poisson's ratio is about 1/3; at this Poisson's ratio the
   influence from density and thickness variations cancel each other.
   Comparison between the current corrected model and the density-corrected
   Rayleigh-Lamb model reveals a number of consistent trends, while the
   discrepancies are elucidated. If the plate material possesses a negative
   Poisson's ratio, the deviation of the actual wave velocity from the
   classical model becomes significant; auxeticity suppresses and enhances
   the wave velocity in compressive and tensile impacts, respectively.
   Hence the use of the corrected model is proposed when predicting
   longitudinal waves in width-constrained auxetic plates, and auxetic
   materials can be harnessed for effectively controlling wave velocities
   in thin-walled structures.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presented a detailed study of the negative Poisson's ratio
   (NPR) effect on shrinkage deformation and crushing stress of metallic
   auxetic reentrant honeycomb under low, medium and high-velocity
   compressions. Instead of the traditional calculating method for the
   crushing stress of auxetic honeycomb, the new theoretical formula
   considering the NPR effect was proposed. The theoretical and finite
   element (FE) results showed that the crushing stress of reentrant
   honeycomb had been underestimated according to the traditional nominal
   stress strain curve. Not only had that, but also the theoretical results
   showed that the NPR effect could enhance the inertial effect during
   dynamic compression. Subsequently, under the medium and high-velocity
   compressions, the dynamic deformations of reentrant honeycomb were
   obviously different from that under low-velocity compression and those
   of metallic cellular materials with positive Poisson's ratio (such as Al
   foam and traditional hexagonal honeycomb) under medium or high-velocity
   compressions. In view of these differences, a new shrinkage deformation
   mechanism of reentrant honeycomb was proposed and a characterization
   parameter in contrast to the Poisson's ratio was presented to describe
   its dynamic shrinkage deformation capacity.}},

Abstract = {{A computational finite element analysis based on a structural molecular
   mechanics approach was conducted to predict effective mechanical
   stiffness properties of a novel 3D carbon structure, pillared graphene
   structure (PGS), which is constituted with several graphene sheets and
   single-walled carbon nanotubes. Four sets of representative unitcell
   models were developed atomistically for predicting the mechanical
   properties of PGSs having different values of pillar length and
   inter-pillar distance. We introduced proper selections of the periodic
   geometry and boundary conditions which enabled our unitcell model to
   yield consistent results on the property prediction without any size or
   edge effects. The parametric study shows that the pillar length and
   inter-pillar distance significantly affect the effective in-plane and
   through-thickness properties. PGSs with shorter pillars in height yield
   higher planar Young's and shear moduli, while those with smaller
   interpillar distance yield higher through-thickness moduli. Negative
   in-plane Poisson's ratios are observed for all sets of PGSs and are
   associated with the curvature at the junction. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Materials with an isotropic negative coefficient of thermal expansion
   (CTE) of the order of -10(-3) K-1 are rare, and almost all of them are
   porous. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we show that graphene
   origami structures obtained by pattern-based hydrogenation can exhibit a
   negative CTE. The magnitude and anisotropy of the CTE can be controlled
   by parameters of the pattern-based hydrogenation that determine the
   stiffness and Poisson ratio, respectively. We achieve an isotropic CTE
   of -20.7 x 10(-3) K-1, which is an enhancement by three orders of
   magnitude as compared to reports for other graphene-based structures and
   comes close to the record of all known materials. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Various carbon nanostructures and their properties are of great interest
   nowadays. It is well known that graphene has unique mechanical
   properties among other carbon nanomaterials and at some conditions
   graphene can show auxetic behavior which means that it can have negative
   Poisson's ratio. From the consideration of the mechanical properties of
   graphene and 3D carbon-based nanomaterials, several groups of promising
   candidates to be auxetics can be mentioned. In this study, mechanical
   properties of strained graphene and different diamond-like
   three-dimensional structures based on carbon nanotubes (tubulanes) are
   investigated by molecular dynamics method. It is shown that graphene has
   negative Poisson's ratio under homogeneous tensile strain above 0.12. It
   is found that three of the studied tubulanes have negative Poisson's
   ratio.}},

Abstract = {{Application of auxetic materials in automobile and biomedical
   engineering is widely reported and their usage in civil engineering is
   emerging. This paper reports the manufacturing and characterising of
   cementitious polymer mortar auxetic foam composites suitable for wall
   rendering. The deformation behaviour of the composites with the high
   negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) auxetic foam embedded in polymer cement
   mortar matrix has been experimentally evaluated and compared to the
   commonly used mortar composites containing fiberglass mesh layers (that
   exhibits positive Poisson's ratio). It is shown that the auxetic
   embedded polymer cement composite outperformed other composites through
   elimination of delamination and minimisation of brittleness. The auxetic
   foams used in this research were manufactured from the inexpensive open
   cell polyurethane foam through a thermo-mechanical process and
   characterised through lab tests; the maximum Poisson's ratio determined
   was 1.5. Sixty composite specimens tested under axial compression
   exhibited a maximum NPR of 0.11. The results were validated numerically.
   The numerical model was then used to examine the effectiveness of the
   relative thickness of the auxetic foam layers and the polymer cement
   matrix for maximising the NPR of the composites. The results show that
   through auxetic material embedment, delamination and brittleness
   suffered by the cementitious composites could be eliminated. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{In this study, the responsive-behavior of auxetic and non-auxetic
   polymer gels to mechanical loads is modeled. The elastic deformation
   patterns of gels with different structural and mechanical properties are
   depicted. The first strain gradient theory is employed to model the
   random structure of crosslinked polymer gels. The applicability of the
   first strain gradient theory to model the mechanics of polymer gels is
   demonstrated. The equations governing the elastostatic equilibrium of
   polymer gels under finite strain gradient and infinitesimal strain
   gradient regimes are derived depending on the strain and its first-order
   gradient. An analytical solution for the plane strain deformation is
   derived. This solution is harnessed to investigate effects of Poisson's
   ratio and the strain gradient on the plane strain deformation of auxetic
   and non-auxetic polymer gels. The results revealed that Poisson's ratio
   and the micro-strain field significantly influence the elastic
   extensibility and elastic compressibility of polymer gels. Depending on
   its Poisson's ratio and the nature of its microstructure, a polymer gel
   may exhibit homogeneous/inhomogeneous deformation, and its rigidity may
   be enhanced/degraded. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic (negative Poisson's ratio) cellular materials expand in all
   direction when pulled in only one, thus behaving in an unusual manner
   compared to ``classical{''} materials. Negative Poisson's ratio
   honeycombs and open cell foams have shown increased shear modulus,
   indentation resistance and low cut-off frequency acoustic properties. In
   this paper FEM microstructure models are used to compute the static and
   viscoelastic properties of closed-cell and two-phase foam composites.
   The complex modulus of the materials is calculated making use of the
   correspondence principal and evaluating the strain energy distributions
   for the different phases. The results are compared to the ones given by
   models representing a global in-plane uniaxial loading. The static and
   storage modulus values of two-phase composite foam are significantly
   enhanced by the presence of a re-entrant (auxetic) skeleton layout. The
   loss factor shows also a significant sensitivity on the volume fraction
   and strain energy distribution on the microstructure unit cells. Static
   and free-vibration simulations on sandwich beams with different core
   cellular materials show that it is possible to obtain both enhanced
   stiffness per unit weight values and modal loss factors using two-phase
   cellular solids with a re-entrant skeleton.}},

   strength of 580 MPa was observed with no fracture occurring through
   1.6\% elongation. The Young's modulus was 160 GPa in the loading
   direction with a Poisson's ratio of -0.37 on the (100) major face. A
   specimen with a tensile axis orientation of {[}100] showed slip lines
   corresponding to slip on the \{211\}<111>with tau(CRSS) = 240 MPa.
   Discontinuous yielding began at 0.8\% elongation, which was thought to
   result from twinning, kink band formation, or stress-induced
   transformation. The Young's modulus was 65 GPa in the loading direction
   with a Poisson's ratio of 0.45 on the (001) major face. A maximum
   tensile strength of 515 MPa was observed with fracture occurring after
   2\% elongation. A sizeable elastic anisotropy of 19.9 was identified for
   Fe-27.2 at. \% Ga accompanied by a Poisson's ratio of -0.75 to produce a
   large in-plane auxetic behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials with negative Poisson's ratio have potential
   applications across a broad range of engineering fields. Several FE
   based design techniques have been developed to achieve auxetic materials
   with targeted effective properties, mostly in linear deformation regime.
   In this paper, an isogeometric shape optimization framework for
   designing 2D auxetic materials with prescribed deformation over large
   strain intervals is presented Taking into account practical
   manufacturing considerations, a minimum thickness for each member is
   imposed via a spline-based geometric constraint. The capability of the
   framework is demonstrated through two examples. First, the paper
   considers shape optimization of smoothed hexa-petals in plane strain
   condition to achieve constant Poisson's ratios ranging from a null value
   to -0.5 to an effective tensile strain of 50\%. The second example
   showcases the shape optimization of smoothed tri- and hexa-petals in
   plane stress condition for targeted nonlinear deformation behaviour of
   cat's skin up to 90\% tensile strain. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials exhibit the unusual property of becoming fatter when
   uniaxially stretched and thinner when uniaxially compressed (i.e. they
   exhibit a negative Poisson ratio; NPR), a property that may result in
   various enhanced properties. The NPR is the result of the manner in
   which particular geometric features in the micro- or nanostructure of
   the materials deform when they are subjected to uniaxial loads. Here, we
   propose and discuss a new model made from different-sized rigid
   rectangles, which rotate relative to each other. This new model has the
   advantage over existing models that it can be used to describe the
   properties of very different systems ranging from silicates and zeolites
   to liquid-crystalline polymers. We show that such systems can exhibit
   scale-independent auxetic behaviour for stretching in particular
   directions, with Poisson's ratios being dependent on the shape and
   relative size of different rectangles in the model and the angle between
   them.}},

   level set method combined with a meshfree algorithm}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{229}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Two-dimensional (2-D) micro-architectured mechanical metamaterials are
   designed using a topology optimization approach that integrates a
   parametric level set method (PLSM) with a meshfree method based on
   compactly supported radial basis functions (CS-RBF). The PLSM is
   employed as the optimization algorithm to achieve desired
   microstructures with targeted material properties. The effective elastic
   properties, including the bulk modulus, shear modulus and Poisson's
   ratio, are predicted using a strain energy-based homogenization method
   and the CS-RBF meshfree algorithm. Two sets of optimizations are
   implemented: one is for the case of a single solid material, and the
   other is for the case of two solid materials, each involving an
   additional void phase. Three numerical examples are provided for each
   case with the same optimization objectives: maximizing the effective
   bulk modulus, maximizing the effective shear modulus, and minimizing the
   effective Poisson's ratio under given volume fraction constraints. The
   numerical results reveal that the newly proposed approach can generate
   smooth topological boundaries and optimal microstructures. In
   particular, the current method can topologically optimize auxetic
   metamaterials with a negative Poisson's ratio. It can also be extended
   to design other periodic metamaterials, including those with a negative
   coefficient of thermal expansion or frequency bandgaps.}},

Abstract = {{We develop mechanical and numerical homogenization models for the large
   strains response of auxetic structures in order to derive their
   effective elastic response accounting for large changes of the geometry.
   We construct a strain driven nonlinear scheme for the computation of the
   stress-strain relation of these repetitive networks over a reference
   representative unit cell (abbreviated as RUC). Homogenization schemes
   are developed to evaluate the effective nonlinear mechanical response of
   periodic networks prone to an auxetic behavior, in both planar and 3D
   configurations, which are substituted by an effective micropolar
   continuum at the intermediate mesoscopic level. The couple stress part
   of the homogenized constitutive law takes into account the impact of the
   local rotations at the mesoscopic level and allows computing the bending
   response. This methodology is applied to four planar auxetic periodic
   lattices (the re-entrant hexagonal honeycomb and alternative honeycomb
   topologies, including the arrowhead, Milton and hexachiral structures),
   and to the 3D re-entrant and pyramid-shaped lattices. We have
   considering successively the in-plane and out-of-plane responses of
   these structures. The transition to an auxetic behavior is shown to be
   triggered by the imposed strain over the unit cell boundary. The
   computed evolutions of Poisson's ratio versus the imposed stretch
   traduce an enhanced auxetic response as the stretch is increased. A
   satisfactory agreement is obtained between the homogenized stress strain
   responses and the responses computed numerically by finite element
   simulations performed over a repeating unit cell. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{It is confirmed, by considering a wide range of laminated composites

   a correspondingly large value of the in-plane axial Poisson's ratio

   expansivity may be obtained - much further negative than for any
   monolithic materials. The use of laminated composites also overcomes
   some of the previously reported limitations of a device to control
   thermal expansion when made with monolithic materials. The use of the
   device, as a platform to control the expansivity of an optical fibre
   containing a Bragg grating, is discussed in detail and it is shown that
   the required negative expansivity of -10(-5) K-1 may easily be obtained

Abstract = {{Most of the auxetic materials that have been characterized
   experimentally or studied analytically are anisotropic and this limits
   their possible applications, as they need to be carefully oriented
   during operation. Here, through a combined numerical and experimental
   approach, we demonstrate that 2D auxetic materials with isotropic
   response can be easily realized by perforating a sheet with elongated
   cuts arranged to form a periodic pattern with either six-fold or
   three-fold symmetry. Moreover, we also show that the auxetic behavior
   can be easily tuned by varying the length of the cuts and that it is
   retained even under large levels of applied deformation beyond the limit
   of small strains. This novel, simple and scalable design can serve as an
   important guideline for designing and fabricating isotropic auxetic
   materials that can have a significant impact on a wide range of
   applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{One of the most important goal of modern material science is designing
   structures which exhibit appropriate properties. These properties can be
   obtained by optimization methods which often use numerical calculations
   e.g. finite element method (FEM). This paper shows the results of
   topological optimization which is used to obtain the greatest possible
   negative Poisson's ratio of the two-phase composite. The shape is
   anti-tetra-chiral two-dimensional unit cell of the whole lattice
   structure which has negative Poisson's ratio when it is built of one
   solid material. Two phase used in optimization are two solid materials
   with positive Poisson's ratio and Young's modulus. Distribution of
   reinforcement hard material inside soft matrix material in
   anti-tetra-chiral domain influenced mechanical properties of structure.
   The calculations shows that the resultant structure has negative
   Poisson's ratio even eight times smaller than homogenous anti-tetra
   chiral structure made of classic one material. In the analysis FEM is
   connected with algorithm Method of Moving Asymptote (MMA). The results
   of materials' properties parameters are described and calculated by
   means of shape interpolation scheme - Solid Isotropic Material with
   Penalization (SIMP) method.}},

Abstract = {{As promising metamaterials, 3D periodic auxetic cellular structures
   (PACSs) have attracted great interest. However, they usually consist of
   intricate geometries which make their fabrication a significant
   challenge. The present paper is focused on introducing the interlocking
   assembly concept into the fabrication of 3D PACSs. There are distinct
   advantages of the interlocking assembly method compared with the
   additive manufacturing methods mainly used before. Based on the
   interlocking assembly method, the dependences of mechanical properties
   mainly including the Poisson's ratio and the Young's modulus of the
   structure on the re-entrant angle were investigated through a
   combination of uniaxial compression experiments and numerical
   simulations, excellent qualitative and quantitative agreement was found.
   Using the experimentally verified numerical model, the effects of the
   strut thickness and the ratio of the vertical strut length to oblique
   strut length on the mechanical properties of the structure were
   investigated. Results show that the compression modulus of the structure
   will increase with the structure becomes more re-entrant, but there
   exists an extreme value for Poisson's ratio with the reentrant angle
   around 45 which differs from former studies. With the thickening of the
   struts the compression modulus of the structure monotonously increases
   and the Poisson's ratio of the structure will gradually changes from
   negative to positive then gradually approaches to the Poisson's ratio of
   the parent material. The vertical strut length to oblique strut length
   ratio plays fewer roles on the mechanical properties compared with the
   re-entrant angle and the strut thickness. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Negative refraction of Lamb modes: A theoretical study}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{98}},
Number = {{21}},
Month = {{DEC 26}},
Abstract = {{This paper provides a theoretical investigation of negative refraction
   and focusing of elastic guided waves in a freestanding plate with a
   steplike thickness change. Under certain conditions, a positive phase
   velocity (forward) Lamb mode can be converted into a negative phase
   velocity (backward) mode at such interface, giving rise to negative
   refraction. A semianalytical model is developed to study the influence
   of various parameters such as the material Poisson's coefficient, the
   steplike thickness, the frequency, and the incidence angle. To this end,
   all the Lamb and shear horizontal propagating modes and also a large
   number of their inhomogeneous and evanescent counterparts are taken into
   account. The boundary conditions applied to the stress-displacement
   fields at the thickness step yields an equation system. Its inversion
   provides the transmission and reflection coefficients between each mode
   at the interface. The steplike thickness and Poisson's ratio are shown
   to be key parameters to optimize the negative refraction process. In
   terms of material, Duralumin is found to be optimal as it leads to a
   nearly perfect conversion between forward and backward modes over broad
   frequency and angular ranges. An excellent focusing ability is thus
   predicted for a flat lens made of two symmetric thickness steps. A laser
   ultrasonic experiment quantitatively confirms those theoretical
   predictions. This study paves the way toward the optimization of elastic
   devices based on negative refraction, in particular for cloaking or
   superfocusing purposes.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES}},

Volume = {{136}},
Pages = {{143-154}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials possess the fascinating property of expanding
   laterally when stretched longitudinally. However, previous
   investigations into behavior under large deformation of such materials
   in tension have been very limited. This work systematically analyses the
   tensile behavior beyond yield of re-entrant hexagonal honeycombs in the
   two principal directions. Analytical modeling is performed by
   considering the plastic, nonlinear behavior of cell walls based on
   idealized mechanisms. The analytical results are compared with those of
   the corresponding finite element simulations. Two material models have
   been studied, a rigid-perfectly plastic material model and that with
   strain hardening. Plastic Poisson's ratio is calculated as the ratio of
   the incremental strains in the two perpendicular directions and this
   ratio changes significantly, from negative to positive, for the
   re-entrant honeycombs in tension. The elastic slope of stress-strain
   curves is also considered and initial yielding point is determined. The
   influences of various geometrical and material parameters on the
   response of re-entrant honeycombs are discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Auxetics exhibit the unusual property of a negative Poisson's ratio,
   meaning they get wider rather than thinner when stretched. This work
   employs force-field based simulations to study the effect of solvent
   molecules on the structure and mechanical properties of porous
   polyphenylacetylene auxetic organic networked polymers. In particular,
   nano-level re-entrant honeycombs 1,4- and 2,8-reflexyne were exposed to
   three types of solvent molecules (ethanol, propanol and benzene) at
   different concentrations by performing Monte-Carlo based sorption
   simulations in two scenarios, one where the solvent was permitted into
   the pores of the system upon exposure, and one were the solvent could
   also enter in between the layers of the polymer. Results indicate that
   the presence of solvent molecules within the molecular framework of the
   networked polymers has a significant effect on their density and
   stiffness but does not influence the Poisson's ratio of the material.
   The effect on the stiffness was found to be highly dependent on various
   factors, including the properties of the network and the type and amount
   of solvent adsorbed. These results have important implications in future
   case scenarios which may involve the synthesis of such systems, and it
   throws light on how the mechanical properties could be affected due to
   contamination, while also identifying new methods on how to tailor such
   properties by exposing the material to specific solvents.}},

Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, star-shaped honeycombs are analyzed in terms of their
   equivalent mechanical behaviors and band gap properties. Firstly, by
   applying Castigliano's second theorem, the effective Young's modulus and
   Poisson's ratio are derived by an analytical method used in structural
   mechanics. On the basis of Bloch's theorem, the dispersion
   characteristics are then analyzed by the dynamic matrix in conjunction
   with the Wittrick-Williams (W-W) algorithm. It should be noted that the
   presented method can form a more simple stiffness and mass matrices of
   the proposed structures, compared with the traditional finite element
   (FE) method. Thereafter, the effects of the geometrical parameters on
   the effective constants and band gaps are investigated and discussed.
   Numerical results demonstrate that the negative Poisson's ratio provides
   an enhanced effective Young's modulus of the considered honeycombs.
   Furthermore, the band gap exists in a much lower frequency region with
   an unchanged summing band gap width when the Poisson's ratio is in
   negative values. In general, the work can serve as a guide for the
   optimal design of cellular structures.}},

Journal = {{ENGINEERING COMPUTATIONS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{3-4}},
Pages = {{260-276}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - Auxetic materials differ from conventional materials by the
   manner in which they respond to stretching; they tend to get fatter when
   stretched, resulting in a negative Poisson's ratio. The purpose of this
   paper is to present a numerical methodology for design of microstructure
   of 2D and 3D auxetic materials with a wide range of different negative
   Poisson's ratios.
   Design/methodology/approach - The proposed methodology is based on a
   combination of finite element method and a genetic algorithm. The
   problem is formulated as an optimization problem of finding
   microstructures with prescribed behavioral requirements. Different
   microstructures are generated and evolved using the genetic algorithm
   and the behavior of each microstructure is analyzed using the finite
   element method to evaluate its fitness in competition with other
   generated structures.
   Findings - Numerical examples show that it is possible to design a large
   number of new auxetic materials, each with a different value of negative
   Poisson's ratio.
   Originality/value - The proposed methodology can be used as an effective
   method to tailor new materials with prescribed values of negative (or
   positive) Poisson's ratio. The methodology can also be used to optimize
   other material properties.}},

Abstract = {{This report employed molecular statics simulation and

   evidences to show that cubic materials can exhibit auxetic behavior in a
   principal direction under proper loading conditions. When a stress
   perpendicular to the loading direction is applied, cubic materials can
   exhibit a negative Poisson's ratio at finite strain. The negative
   Poisson's ratio behavior, including its direction and value, is highly
   dependent on the direction and magnitude of the transversely applied
   stresses. As a result, we show that it is possible to tune the direction
   and magnitude of the negative Poisson's ratio behavior of cubic
   materials by controlling the transverse loadings. (C) 2016 WILEY-VCH

Abstract = {{The thermal properties of the new negative Poisson's ratio honeycomb
   structure is investigated. The Poisson's ratio is calculated subject to
   pure bending. On this basis, the influence of auxetic effect caused by
   negative Poisson's ratio on thermal conductivity is further
   investigated. The thermal anisotropic characteristics are also reported
   in accordance with the anisotropic physical mechanism. Applying this
   structure to the satellite antenna reflection surface, the thermal
   deformation value of the antenna reflection surface under a uniform
   temperature field can be calculated by finite element analysis. Using
   particle swarm optimization, the optimization target is the accuracy of
   the antenna reflection surface profile and the total mass of the
   antenna. The optimization parameter is the design parameters of the
   negative Poisson's ratio honeycomb structure. The results show that the
   satellite's overall profile accuracy is reduced by 22.6\%. Effectively
   improving the accuracy of the reflective surface of the antenna.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials (or metamaterials) are those with a negative Poisson
   ratio (NPR) and that display the unexpected property of lateral
   expansion when stretched, as well as an equal and opposing densification
   when compressed. Such geometries are being progressively employed in the
   development of novel products, especially in the fields of intelligent
   expandable actuators, shape morphing structures and minimally invasive
   implantable devices. Although several micromanufacturing technologies
   have already been applied to the development of auxetic geometries and
   devices, additional precision is needed to take full advantage of their
   special mechanical properties. In this study we present a very promising
   approach for the development of auxetic metamaterials and devices based
   on the use of direct laser writing. The process stands out for its
   precision and complex three-dimensional (3D) geometries attainable
   without the need of supporting structures. To our knowledge it
   represents one of the first examples of the application of this
   technology to the manufacture of auxetic geometries and mechanical
   metamaterials, with details even more remarkable than those shown in
   very recent studies, almost reaching the current limit of this additive
   manufacturing technology. We have used some special 3D auxetic designs
   whose remarkable NPR has been previously highlighted.}},

Title = {{Influence of re-entrant hexagonal structure and helical auxetic yarn on
   the tensile and auxetic behavior of parametric fabrics}},
Journal = {{TEXTILE RESEARCH JOURNAL}},
Abstract = {{This paper focuses on systematically analyzing the influence of macro
   fabric structure and yarn architecture on the mechanical and auxetic
   performance of parametric auxetic fabrics. Re-entrant hexagonal (REH)
   and helical auxetic yarn (HAY) were adopted as a macro fabric structure
   and weft yarn to produce three kinds of auxetic fabrics: REH fabric with
   HAY as weft yarn (REH-HAY); REH fabric with elastic yarn as weft yarn
   (REH-1, REH-2, REH-3); and plain fabric with HAY as weft yarn
   (NREH-HAY). By controlling the existence of the HAY and REH structure,
   the influence of the REH structure and HAY on the mechanical and auxetic
   properties was thoroughly analyzed. It is demonstrated that both the REH
   macrostructure and HAY micro configuration can contribute to the
   performance of the auxetic fabric. Specifically, in the presence of the
   REH structure and HAY, the auxeticity was found to a 77\% increase
   compared with NREH-HAY and the breaking strain and load rises by about
   37.50\% and 90.42\%, respectively. Notably, the variation of the
   polyurethane (PU) weft yarn per unit length influenced the tensile and
   auxetic performance to a lesser extent, while by changing PU to HAY, a
   significant increase of negative Poisson's ratio value from -1.155 to
   -1.492 was noticed without greatly jeopardizing the stretchability.
   Furthermore, the cyclic tensile results demonstrate the stability and
   elasticity of the fabric. The comparative analysis can give guidance to
   optimize fabric design and inspire the innovative design of the auxetic
   textiles, all of which will pave the way for a quantitative and
   optimizing design for auxetic textiles.}},

Title = {{Design of polymeric auxetic matrices for improved mechanical coupling in
   lead-free piezocomposites}},
Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{While lead-free piezocomposites offer an environmentally friendly
   solution to mechanical sensing and energy harvesting, they lag
   state-of-the-art lead-based materials in terms of performance. It is
   therefore important to develop new material designs to bridge this
   performance gap. Considering composites where rigid piezoelectric
   inclusions are embedded in soft matrices, a major cause of poor
   performance is weak coupling of applied strains to the inclusions. We
   show here that by designing matrices with negative Poisson's ratios
   (auxetic matrices) it is possible to considerably improve this coupling.
   We first demonstrate this concept using a matrix which is inherently
   auxetic where we show an improvement of 40\%-50\% in the piezoelectric
   response. Based on the observations made, we develop a scalable design
   for auxetic matrices using conventional non-auxetic polymeric materials.
   This is done by embedding rigid auxetic structures in softer matrices.
   We show that with such designed auxetic matrices, which are amenable to
   fabrication through 3D printing, it is possible to achieve considerably
   larger piezoelectric response with a significant retention of the matrix
   softness. Particularly, we show that auxetic designs can show
   piezoelectric enhancements exceeding 300\% compared to non-auxetic
   reference designs having similar a non-auxetic rigid backbone of similar
   volume as the auxetic backbone. Therefore, the use of matrices with
   negative Poisson's ratios is a promising design avenue to decouple
   mechanical coupling of strain to inclusions and matrix hardness. This
   strategy can pave way to design of softer piezocomposites with superior
   responses employing only structured polymeric materials without the use
   of expensive nanomaterials.}},

Abstract = {{Materials having a negative Poisson's ratio (auxetic) get fatter rather
   than thinner when uniaxially stretched. This phenomenon has been often
   explained through models that describe how particular geometric features
   in the micro or nanostructure of the material deform when subjected to
   uniaxial loads. Here, a new model based on scalene rigid triangles
   rotate relative to each other will be presented and analysed. It is
   shown that this model can afford a very wide range of Poisson's ratio
   values, the sign and magnitude of which depends on the shape of the
   triangles and the angles between them. This new model has the advantage
   that it is very generic and may be potentially used to describe the
   properties in various types of materials, including auxetic foams and
   their relative surface density. Specific applications of this model,
   such as a blueprint for a system that can exhibit temperature-dependent
   Poisson's ratios, are also discussed.}},

Pages = {{96-104}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The global maximum and global minimum Poisson's ratio (PR) surfaces,
   regions of different auxetic behaviour and the domains of the different
   extreme directions of cubic materials are shown and discussed in terms
   of the elastic moduli ratios, X = G/K, Y = G/W, where K is the bulk
   modulus and G, W, are shear moduli. A straightforward way is given to
   classify any cubic material as being auxetic, nonauxetic and partially
   auxetic, as well as calculating its extreme PR values. A decomposition
   of the XY plane with the elastic constant ratio lambda = C-12/C-44 is
   introduced to facilitate the interpretation of cubic materials under
   hydrostatic pressure, P > 0, and isotropic tension, P < 0, which are two
   qualitatively different situations. Using this representation it is
   demonstrated that cubic materials with lambda > 0 can be auxetic only
   under `negative' pressure (P < 0). It is shown that the influence of
   pressure on the auxetic behaviour is different for the positive and
   negative X cases. In particular, a cubic material with 0 > lambda > 1
   may be auxetic at negative as well as positive pressure. The work
   demonstrates the crucial role of P in obtaining desired auxetic
   behaviour. Microscopic mechanisms which tune the cubic system to
   targeted regions in the XY plane are investigated with a fcc crystal of
   particles interacting via the pairwise spherically symmetric potential,
   phi(r). It is found that all fcc static models in which the range of
   interaction is only between nearest neighbour particles are placed on a
   universal curve in the XY plane. It is shown that auxetic behaviours can
   be achieved with simple static phi(r) analytic forms. The influence of
   the next neighbour interactions on the universal curve is also
   considered. In order to assess the role of thermal fluctuations,
   molecular dynamic simulations for two different phi(r) (the
   Lennard-Jones (LJ) and the tethered particle potentials) were performed.
   At low temperatures the studied systems are well represented by the
   universal curve and on increasing temperature a systematic departure
   from it is observed. (C) 2010 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA,

Journal = {{EXTREME MECHANICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{40}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Auxetics are materials that contract laterally when compressed, rather
   than expand, in contrast to common experience. Here we show that common
   metals and plastics can be rendered auxetic through the introduction of
   a regular array of holes. Under compression, these hard holey materials
   bypass localized failure modes, such as shear banding, and instead
   deform via a global pattern transformation previously reported in
   elastomeric structures. Despite significant variations in internal
   structure, the pattern transformation responsible for auxetic behaviour
   in both metals and plastics is governed by the buckling of the slender
   struts that comprise the microarchitecture. Furthermore, in contrast to
   elastomeric structures, holey sheets made from hard materials exhibit
   significant negative post-buckling stiffness. This suggests that, beyond
   the geometrical nonlinearities associated with topological
   modifications, material nonlinearities which arise during plastic
   deformation offer further potential for altering the material properties
   of the constituent. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a novel extrusion process for manufacturing
   helical auxetic yarn (HAY). A range of semi-coextruded HAYs have been
   manufactured in a cost-effective, consistent and readily usable form.
   The semi-coextruded HAYs were compared to the conventional spun yarns in
   terms of tensile properties and auxetic behavior. The results show the
   presence of the auxetic effect in newly fabricated semi-coextruded HAYs.
   Similar to the traditional spun HAYs, the new HAYs are sensitive to
   parameters such as the initial wrap angle, the core/wrap diameter ratio
   and component moduli. Importantly, a few new manufacturing parameters
   have been identified for tailoring the auxetic behavior of the
   semi-coextruded HAYs. The semi-coextruded HAYs are auxetic when an
   instantaneous true Poisson's ratio analysis method is applied. The
   semi-coextruded HAYs give a larger maximum negative Poisson's ratio than
   the conventional HAYs due to the advantages of the pre-formed helical
   wrap structure.}},

Title = {{Cementitious cellular composites with auxetic behavior}},
Journal = {{CEMENT \& CONCRETE COMPOSITES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{111}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic behavior refers to material with negative Poisson's ratio. In
   this research, a new type of cementitious auxetic material is developed.
   A novel crack bridging auxetic mechanism is discovered which is in
   contrast with a local buckling mechanism commonly employed to trigger
   auxetic behavior. Taking advantage of 3D printing techniques,
   cementitious cellular composite (CCC) specimens with auxetic cellular
   structures were produced. Meanwhile, cementitious materials with
   different fiber content were used as constituent material. Uniaxial
   compression and cyclic loading tests were performed on the CCCs.
   Experiments show that with proper constituent material, CCCs can exhibit
   auxetic behavior which is induced by crack bridging process of the
   cementitious constituent material. In addition, strain hardening
   behavior can be identified in the stress-strain curve under uniaxial
   compression and consequently high specific energy absorption is
   obtained. Furthermore, 2.5\% of reversible deformation which is
   significantly higher than conventional cementitious materials under
   cyclic loading is obtained within 25,000 cycles. Obvious fatigue damage
   is observed in the first 3000 cycles, afterwards signs of mechanical
   properties recovering can be found. The discovered auxetic mechanism
   indicates a new designing direction for brittle materials to achieve
   auxetic behaviors.}},

Title = {{Electric Auxetic Effect in Piezoelectrics}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{125}},
Number = {{19}},
Month = {{NOV 2}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic materials are characterized by a negative Poisson's ratio that
   they expand laterally in the directions perpendicular to the applied
   stretching stress and vice versa. Piezoelectrics will change their
   dimensions when exposed to an external electric field. Here we introduce
   the concept of the ``electric auxetic effect{''}: electric auxetic
   materials will contract or expand in all dimensions in response to an
   electric field. Such unusual piezoelectric response driven by an
   electric field is a close analogy to the auxetic effect driven by a
   stress field. A key feature of electric auxetic materials is that their
   longitudinal and transverse piezoelectric coefficients are of the same
   sign. We demonstrate using first-principles calculations that the
   Pca2(1) orthorhombic phase of ferroelectric HfO2 exhibits both the
   negative longitudinal piezoelectric effect and the electric auxetic
   effect. The unusual negative longitudinal piezoelectric effect arises
   unexpectedly from the domination of the negative internal-strain
   contribution over the positive clamped-ion contribution, a character
   often found in van der Waals solids. We confirm a few more electric
   auxetic materials with finite electric field calculations by screening
   through a first-principles-based database of piezoelectrics.}},

Abstract = {{An important feature that drives the auxetic behaviour of the
   star-shaped auxetic structures is the hinge-functional connection at the
   vertex connections. This feature poses a great challenge for
   manufacturing and may lead to significant stress concentrations. To
   overcome these problems, we introduced smoothed petal-shaped auxetic
   structures, where the hinges are replaced by smoothed connections. To
   accommodate the curved features of the petal-shaped auxetics, a
   parametrisation modelling scheme using multiple NURBS patches is
   proposed. Next, an integrated shape design frame work using isogeometric
   analysis is adopted to improve the structural performance. To ensure a
   minimum thickness for each member, a geometry sizing constraint is
   imposed via piece-wise bounding polynomials. This geometry sizing
   constraint, in the context of isogeometric shape optimization, is
   particularly interesting due to the non-interpolatory nature of NURBS
   basis. The effective Poisson ratio is used directly as the objective
   function, and an adjoint sensitivity analysis is carried out. The
   optimized designs smoothed petal auxetic structures are shown to achieve
   low negative Poisson's ratios, while the difficulties of manufacturing
   the hinges are avoided. For the case with six petals, an in-plane
   isotropy is achieved. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials having a network like structure are analyzed in terms
   of their deformation mechanisms and equivalent homogenized mechanical
   properties thanks to the discrete asymptotic homogenization method. This
   systematic and predictive methodology is exemplified for five different
   2D periodical lattices: the re-entrant hexagonal, hexachiral, cross
   chiral, rafters and the re-entrant square. The equivalent moduli and
   Poisson's ratio are expressed in closed form versus the microbeam
   geometrical parameters and rigidities. As a novel result, the predicted
   homogenized properties depend on the slenderness of the beam, hence
   providing more accurate results in comparison to the literature. The
   studied lattices allow to explore the two main mechanisms responsible
   for negative Poisson's ratio, the re-entrant and the rolling-up
   mechanism. Non-standard overall behaviors, such as traction-shear
   coupling occurring for the cross chiral lattice, are evidenced. Negative
   values of the Poisson's ratio are obtained in a certain range of the
   configuration parameter of each lattice. Comparisons of the obtained
   homogenized moduli with finite element simulations show a very good
   accuracy of the predicted effective mechanical behavior. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{Auxeticity is the result of internal structural degrees of freedom that
   get in the way of affine deformations. This paper proposes a new
   understanding of strains in disordered auxetic materials. A class of
   iso-auxetic structures is identified, which are auxetic structures that
   are also isostatic, and these are distinguished from conventional
   elasto-auxetic materials. It is then argued that the mechanisms that
   give rise to auxeticity are the same in both classes of materials and
   the implications of this observation on the equations that govern the
   strain are explored. Next, the compatibility conditions of Saint Venant
   are demonstrated to be irrelevant for the determination of stresses in
   iso-auxetic materials, which are governed by balance conditions alone.
   This leads to the conclusion that elasticity theory is not essential for
   the general description of auxetic behaviour. One consequence of this is
   that characterisation in terms of negative Poisson's ratio may be of
   limited utility.
   A new equation is then proposed for the dependence of the strain on
   local rotational and expansive fields. Central to the characterization
   of the geometry of the structure, to the iso-auxetic stress field
   equations, and to the strain-rotation relation is a specific fabric
   tensor. This tensor is defined here explicitly for two-dimensional
   systems, however, disordered. It is argued that, while the proposed
   dependence of the strain on the local rotational and expansive fields is
   common to all auxetic materials, iso-auxetic and elasto-auxetic
   materials may exhibit significantly different macroscopic behaviours.}},

Abstract = {{This work presents a comparative analysis between the cyclic loading
   compressive behaviour of conventional, iso-density non-auxetic and
   auxetic (negative Poisson's ratio) thermoplastic polyurethane foams.
   While the three types of foam share the same base material (open cell
   rigid PU), one batch is transformed into auxetic, (i.e., negative
   Poisson's ratio) using a special manufacturing process involving
   moulding and exposure to particular temperature profiles to stabilize
   the microstructure transformation. The specimens have been loaded in
   cyclic compression with a sinusoidal waveform in displacement control.
   The static tests show the specific stress-strain compressive mechanical
   behaviour of these auxetic thermoplastic foams, opposite to conventional
   ones and other similar data on auxetics available in open literature.
   The effect of the load loss, stiffness degradation, the evolution of
   dynamic rigidity and accumulation of energy dissipation versus the
   number of cycles are discussed for different loading levels. The
   analysis of the results shows that the fatigue behaviour until failure
   occurs in two stages, subjected to cyclic loading, depends on the
   loading level. The hysteresis loop tends to close itself as function as
   the number of cycles N, while the slope of the dynamic stiffness
   decreases with increasing N, therefore with decrease of dissipated
   energy. The energy dissipated by the auxetic foams is significantly
   higher than the one from conventional parent phase and the iso-density
   foams at every number of cycles and loading level. (c) 2006 Elsevier

Title = {{Varying the performance of helical auxetic yarns by altering component
   properties and geometry}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{140}},
Pages = {{369-377}},
Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a systematic study of the helical auxetic yarn (HAY)
   via careful in-house fabrication and characterisation of a wide range of
   polymeric fibres and yarns. It provides a better understanding of the
   auxetic behaviour of the HAY in order to tailor their properties for
   specific applications. The study focused on three parameters: component
   moduli, the core/wrap diameter ratio and the initial wrap angle. The
   results show that a larger difference in component moduli, a higher
   core/wrap diameter ratio and a lower initial wrap angle can produce a
   larger maximum negative Poisson's ratio value and thereby a better
   auxetic performance for HAYs. All three parameters could be carefully
   utilised when in combination to achieve the required auxetic behaviour
   of HAYs. Moreover, the instantaneous true Poisson's ratio analysis
   accurately presents the instantaneous behaviour of highly strain
   dependent HAYs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   negative Poisson's ratio}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{173}},
Month = {{MAY 1}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic structures with negative Poisson's ratio have been widely
   studied due to their unique mechanical properties. In this paper, a
   novel auxetic cylindrical double-arrowed honeycomb (DAH) is proposed.
   First, an analytical model to predict the elastic mechanical properties
   of DAH structure in the longitudinal and circumferential directions is
   developed utilizing the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory. Then, the finite
   element models are utilized to verify the analytical method. However,
   the results show that the analytical model cannot accurately predict the
   elastic mechanical properties when the radial width is large.
   Furthermore, the analytical model is revised to predict elastic
   properties considering the effect of the radial width. The effect of the
   geometric parameters on the elastic properties is also investigated. The
   quasi-static compression experiments of ABS auxetic DAH prototypes are
   conducted to validate the revised analytical models. It is observed that
   the revised analytical model can accurately predict the elastic
   mechanical properties of DAH structures.}},

Abstract = {{Using molecular dynamics simulations, we find an in-plane negative
   Poisson's ratio intrinsically existing in the graphene-based
   three-dimensional (3D) carbon foams (CFs) when they are compressed
   uniaxially. Our study shows that the negative Poisson's ratio in the
   present CFs is attributed to their unique molecular structures and
   triggered by the buckling of the CF structures. This mechanism makes the
   negative Poisson's ratio of CFs strongly depend on their cell length,
   which offers us an efficient means to tune the negative Poisson's ratio
   in nanomaterials. Moreover, as the buckling modes of CFs are
   topographically different when they are compressed in different
   directions, their negative Poisson's ratio is found to be strongly
   anisotropic, which is in contrast to the isotropic positive Poisson's
   ratio observed in CFs prior to buckling. The discovery of the intrinsic
   negative Poisson's ratio in 3D CFs will significantly expand the family
   of auxetic nanomaterials. Meanwhile, the mechanism of nano-auxetics
   proposed here may open up a door to manufacture new auxetic materials on
   the nanoscale.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF SOLIDS}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{H2O ice is known to exist as a number of different polymorphs. One such
   polymorph is ice X, a symmetrical phase of ice which is known to be
   stable at high pressures and low temperatures. In this work, the
   mechanical properties of ice X have been studied through DFT
   simulations, and it has been shown that ice X has the potential to
   exhibit auxetic behaviour (negative Poisson's ratio) at 45 degrees
   off-axis in the (100), (010) and (001) planes. Studying the deformation
   of two orthogonally interconnected rhombi has shown that this predicted
   negative Poisson's ratio can be attributed to the interplay between
   distortion and hinging of these rhombi. Moreover, it has been shown that
   the auxetic potential of ice X increases with an increase in hydrostatic
   pressure, which behaviour is explained by the rhombi approaching
   quasi-perfect behaviour resulting in a decrease in the distortion of the
   rhombi and an increase in hinging mechanism.}},

   Hard Cyclic Tetramers}},
Journal = {{PHYSICA STATUS SOLIDI-RAPID RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{Poisson's ratios of 2D crystals of hard, cyclic tetramers, further
   referred to as tetramers, are investigated by Monte Carlo (MC)
   simulations. The tetramers, very simple model molecules, which are
   composed of four identical hard disks of diameter sigma with centers
   forming a square of side d, are studied in the isobaric-isothermal
   ensemble. It is found that, at the same thermodynamical parameters, but
   depending on the anisotropy parameter alpha=d/sigma, the tetramers
   spontaneously form crystalline phases, representing each of the five
   Bravais lattices (BLs) which are possible in the 2D space. The following
   BLs are observed: 1) the oblique (monoclinic) one, 2) the rectangular
   (orthorhombic) one, 3) the centered rectangular (orthorhombic) one, 4)
   the hexagonal one, and 5) the square (tetragonal) one. Among them,
   structures showing auxetic, partially auxetic, and nonauxetic behaviour
   are found. This fact makes the tetramer an interesting example of a
   prototype ``molecule,{''} which, depending on its shape, assembles
   materials of all possible behaviors regarding Poisson's ratio. It is

Abstract = {{In the framework of the theory of anisotropic elasticity, a theoretical
   analysis of the out-of-plane extension of thin two-layered plates of
   hexagonal crystals is carried out. The six-fold axes of all pairs of
   crystals are assumed to be perpendicular to the plane of the plates.
   Formulae for effective Young's modulus and effective Poisson's ratio are
   obtained. It is shown that in most cases effective Young's moduli exceed
   Reuss's average, and thus the rule of mixtures is violated. Equality of
   these characteristics is possible if the ratios of Young's moduli and
   the ratios of Poisson's ratios of crystal pairs are the same. Effective
   Poisson's ratio may be greater or less than the corresponding Reuss's
   average. In addition, it was found that effective Young's modulus can
   surpass Young's moduli of both crystals forming a two-layered plate.
   Effective Poisson's ratio can be both larger and smaller than Poisson's
   ratios of the initial pair of crystals. The general theoretical
   conclusions are illustrated by numerical estimates using the
   experimental values of the elastic constants of the known hexagonal
   crystals.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{177}},
Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{A novel 3D closed-cell cellular structure with different negative
   Poisson's ratio under tension and compression was presented. The 3D
   closed-cell cellular structure was generated by assembling the plane
   repeat units and sinusoidal wavy sheets units into the frame seamlessly.
   Four kinds of cellular structures with different responses under tension
   and compression are introduced. The mechanical properties of the
   proposed models were investigated. By choosing different repeated units,
   either positive or negative Poisson's ratio in three orthogonal
   directions can be achieved. Experiments and numerical simulations
   results show that the 3D closed-cell cellular structures have different
   responses under tension and compression loads. Considering material
   nonlinearities, the numerical results are analyzed using the
   instantaneous Poisson's ratio. The instantaneous Poisson's ratio can
   transit from negative to positive as the loads increase in 4 models. The
   results show that we can predict the auxetic response in a specific
   direction based on the repeated units that assembled into the frame.
   This designed structure provides an effective way to achieve a
   combination of negative, positive or zero Poisson's ratio.}},

Abstract = {{The fabrication of auxetic fabrics by using conventional yarns and
   machinery has gained extraordinary interest from researchers in recent
   years. However, to date this approach has only been adopted to fabricate
   auxetic knitted fabrics and uni-stretch auxetic woven fabrics. This
   paper reports a study that aimed to develop a new class of bi-stretch
   woven fabrics with auxetic behavior using conventional elastic and
   non-elastic yarns, and available weaving machinery. Bi-stretch auxetic
   woven fabrics were firstly designed based on a foldable geometry
   possessing negative Poisson's ratio by consideration of different design
   parameters, including the yarn float length, the placement of tight and
   loose weaves, and the arrangement of elastic and non-elastic yarns in
   the weft direction, and then fabricated on a dobby weaving machine
   equipped with multiple weft supplies and a separately controlled second
   beam assembly attachment. The fabricated fabrics were finally tested on
   a tensile machine to assess their auxetic behavior in both the warp and
   weft directions. The results showed that the bi-stretch woven fabrics
   developed exhibit negative Poisson's ratio up to -0.36 and -0.27 when
   stretched along the warp and weft directions, respectively, and could be
   applied for clothing applications that require enhanced shape fit and
   comfort.}},

   Performance}},
Journal = {{MICROMACHINES}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic structures have attracted attention in energy absorption
   applications owing to their improved shear modulus and enhanced
   resistance to indentation. On the other hand, four-dimensional (4D)
   printing is an emerging technology that is capable of 3D printing smart
   materials with additional functionality. This paper introduces the
   development of a NiTi negative-Poisson's-ratio structure with
   superelasticity/shape memory capabilities for improved ballistic
   applications. An analytical model was initially used to optimize the
   geometrical parameters of a re-entrant auxetic structure. It was found
   that the re-entrant auxetic structure with a cell angle of -30 degrees
   produced the highest Poisson's ratio of -2.089. The 4D printing process
   using a powder bed fusion system was used to fabricate the optimized
   NiTi auxetic structure. The measured negative Poisson's ratio of the
   fabricated auxetic structure was found in agreement with both the
   analytical model and the finite element simulation. A finite element
   model was developed to simulate the dynamic response of the optimized
   auxetic NiTi structure subjected to different projectile speeds. Three
   stages of the impact process describing the penetration of the top
   plate, auxetic structure, and bottom plate have been identified. The
   results show that the optimized auxetic structures affect the dynamic
   response of the projectile by getting denser toward the impact location.
   This helped to improve the energy absorbed per unit mass of the NiTi
   auxetic structure to about two times higher than that of the solid NiTi
   plate and five times higher than that of the solid conventional steel
   plate.}},

Abstract = {{Iron-Gallium alloy (Galfenol) is a magnetostrictive material
   (lambda(sat) similar to 400 ppm) with potential for robust transduction.
   In addition, Galfenol is auxetic in the < 110 > direction with Poisson's
   ratio values of as low as -0.7. In recent years, this phenomenon has
   been examined with several experimental protocols. The negative
   Poisson's ratio of Fe-Ga (attributed to lattice softening under applied
   stresses) has been documented using tensile tests (with and without a dc
   magnetic bias) and resonant ultrasound spectroscopy. In addition,
   density functional theory has been used to produce simulations that
   explain atomic mechanisms for the observed highly auxetic behavior in
   this alloy. This paper examines the auxetic response of Galfenol to
   varying magnetic fields and zero applied stress. An energy based
   mathematical model of the coupled magnetoelastic properties of the alloy
   is derived and used to predict Poisson's ratio at magnetic saturation.
   The results from this approach with no mechanical excitation shows an
   increase in the Poisson's ratio with increase in the Ga content of the
   alloy. This is opposite to the trends observed with applied stresses
   where there is a decrease in the Poisson's ratio with increase in the Ga
   content. Experimental results for Galfenol of compositions between 15
   and 33 atomic percent Gallium will be presented and compared with values
   from the magnetoelastic model.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, 3D structures with negative Poisson's ratio (auxetic)
   have attracted great interest. Many polymer and metal 3D auxetic
   structures have been manufactured using additive manufacturing
   technology, however composite 3D auxetic structures are rarely reported.
   Auxetic structures are normally of low stiffness which causes
   limitations on the structural applications of them. The specific
   stiffness and strength of auxetic structures can be significantly
   improved by making them from high-performance fibre reinforced polymer
   (FRP) composites. Consequently, research of composite 3D auxetic
   structures made from FRP should be conducted. This paper presents the
   composite 3D double-arrow-head (DAH) auxetic structure made from carbon
   fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) using an assembly method. Experimental,
   finite element and theoretical methods are adopted to study the
   mechanical properties of the composite 3D DAH auxetic structures.
   Results show that the Poisson's ratios and effective compression moduli
   of the composite 3D DAH auxetic structures vary depending on the
   compression strain amplitude, and the structures become more auxetic and
   stiffer with the increase of the compression strain. The specific
   stiffness of the composite 3D DAH structure is much higher than that of
   the metal structure. In addition, the dependences of the structures
   Poisson's ratio and effective compression modulus on the geometry
   parameters have also been given. Making auxetic structures from
   high-performance FRP composites can significantly improve their
   mechanical properties which will enable them to have a much wider
   variety of applications.}},

Abstract = {{Materials with a negative Poisson's ratio (PR) are called auxetics; they
   are characterized by expansion/contraction when tensioned/compressed.
   Given this counterintuitive behavior, they present very particular
   characteristics and mechanical behavior. Geometrical models have been
   developed to justify and artificially reproduce such materials' auxetic
   behavior. The focus of this study is the exploration of a reentrant
   model by analyzing the variation in the PR of reentrant structures as a
   function of geometrical and base material parameters. It is shown that,
   even in the presence of protruding ribs, there may not be auxetic
   behavior, and this depends on the geometry of each reentrant structure.
   Values determined for these parameters can be helpful as approximate
   reference data in the design and fabrication of auxetic lattices using
   reentrant geometries.

Abstract = {{Auxetic metamaterials and structures have excellent mechanical
   properties such as shear resistance, impact resistance, fracture
   resistance, energy absorption and vibration isolation, permeability
   variability, synclastic curvature in bending, etc. Auxetic metamaterials
   have broad application prospects in the fields of aerospace, navigation,
   mechanical automation, biomedicine, national defense and military and
   textile industry. Based on the deformation mechanism of auxetic
   metamaterials and structure, the physical models of re-entrant
   mechanism, rotating rigid mechanism, chiral/antichiral mechanism,
   fibril/nodule mechanism, miura-folded mechanism, buckling-induced
   mechanism, helical auxetic yarn structure were reviewed. These models
   can be widely applied in various engineering applications such as light
   laminated plates, fluid transportation and yarn to improve their
   properties. Finally, prospects to the upcoming challenges and progress
   trends of auxetic metamaterials and structures are made. It is pointed
   out that the application of negative Poisson's ratio effect can help
   compensate the change of volume and area under the deformation of
   uniaxial loading. Then the shock resistance of turbine blade, antenna
   and car suction box can be improved. As a result, this review can
   provide benefits for the development of auxetic metamaterials.}},

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{130}},
Pages = {{211-219}},

Abstract = {{Materials with a negative Poisson's Ratio (PR), known as auxetics,
   exhibit the counterintuitive behavior of becoming wider when uniaxially
   stretched and thinner when compressed. Though negative PR is
   characteristic of polymer foams or cellular solids, tight as well as
   highly porous rocks have also been reported to exhibit negative PR. The
   paper proposes a novel auxetic structure based on pore-space
   configuration observed in rocks. We developed a theoretical auxetic 3D
   model consisting of rotating rigid bodies. To alleviate the mechanical
   assumption of rotating bodies, the theoretical model was modified to
   include crack-like features being represented by intersecting, elliptic
   cylinders. We then used a 3D printer to create a physical version of the
   modified model, whose PR was tested. We also numerically explored how
   the compressibility of fluids located in the pore-space of the modified
   model as well as how the elastic properties of the material from which
   the model is made of affect its auxetic behavior. We conclude that for a
   porous medium composed of a single material saturated with a single
   fluid (a) the more compliant the fluid is and (b) the lower the PR of
   the solid material, the lower the PR value of the composite material.

   Although auxetic metamaterials have been extensively investigated using

   elasticity, the shear properties of an auxetic structure should be
   enhanced owing to the negative Poisson's ratio. However, this study used
   homogenisation and experimental approaches to demonstrate that the shear
   elasticity is highly non-linear with respect to the characteristic
   geometrical parameters of a unit cell and that shear properties,
   particularly normal elasticity, are not always improved. Furthermore,
   the estimation of the shear elasticity based on the classical isotropic
   continuum elasticity relations can result in misleading values and
   should be avoided.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials with negative Poisson's ratio have recently attracted
   the interest of the scientific community. This is because these
   materials have the potential to deliver specific functions thanks to a
   discretization of their constitutive matter that is intended as an
   aggregation of macro-scaled cellular structures characterized by
   specific geometries. Many auxetic structures with different geometries
   and auxetic response have been proposed. Downscaling the cellular
   structures (e.g. micro scale) has the potential to improve the overall
   auxetic properties of the material, yet there is not enough research on
   the behavior of these structures at the microscale. This paper studies
   the auxetic behavior of a modified hexachiral structure formed by
   microscale elements. First an optimization study was performed to define
   the most appropriate geometrical dimensions. Then the auxeticity of the
   proposed cell was assessed carefully introducing a new Coefficient of
   Auxeticity which allowed to capture complex mechanical responses (e.g.
   including cellular rotations) as those faced with the proposed design.
   The proposed miniaturized design shows an outstanding stable auxetic
   response up to 20\% strain of the micro-cell. It is believed that this
   study has the potential to pave the way to a new class of auxetic
   materials.}},

Abstract = {{In this current work, a Ti-6Al-4V 3-D re-entrant lattice auxetic
   structure is manufactured by the electron beam melting (EBM) process.
   Four different design configurations (two negative Poisson's ratio
   values x two relative densities) were manufactured and tested under
   compressive stress. Two failure modes were observed whose occurrence
   appeared to be dependent on the ratio of vertical strut length to
   re-entrant strut length. A small deflection analytical model is
   presented that predicts yield strength and modulus for one type of
   design with good accuracy. Results also show that the re-entrant lattice
   structure possesses superior mechanical properties compared to regular
   foam structures. Limitations of the analytical model are also discussed.

Abstract = {{The static bulk and shear modulus of poly (N-isopropylacrylamide) /water
   gel (NIPA gel) have been obtained as a function of temperature by
   measuring the change of sample size induced by an applied tension.  It
   is deduced that the method gives the static elastic moduli of gels to a
   good approximation except just above the discontinuous transition
   temperature T(o), where the stress-induced shift of T(o) made the
   estimation of elastic strain impossible.  Two kinds of NIPA gels with
   different polymer concentration and crosslinking density were used as
   samples, of which one undergoes a discontinuous volume phase transition
   and the other a continuous one.  In both gels, the bulk modulus softens
   drastically towards the transition showing that the soft mode of this
   transition is a uniform and isotropic volume-deformation mode.  The
   shear modulus, on the other hand, shows only a small anomaly at the
   transition.  The anomaly exhibited by the Poisson's ratio sigma is quite
   peculiar, i.e., it becomes negative and approaches - 1 towards the
   critical point.  It is shown that the results can be explained fairly
   well on the basis of the Flory-type phenomenological theory extended to
   take into account the concentration dependence of the interaction

   auxetic material with ultra-low density, named as a novel cross-chiral
   structure (NCCS), are systematically studied under quasi-static and
   dynamic compression. The results reveal that this auxetic material shows
   strong anisotropy and enhanced mechanical properties in the principal
   directions. Compared to the previously reported auxetic materials, it
   exhibits higher modulus and strength as well as superior energy
   absorption capability with the relative density less than 0.1, which is
   validated by both numerical simulations and experiments. In addition,
   the results indicate that the presented model can be optimized to
   achieve excellent mechanical properties and outstanding energy
   absorption capability with ultra-low densities, by tailoring strut's
   tilt angle and relative density. This architectured metamaterial is
   expected to find a bright future in the applications of energy
   absorption such as sandwich cores of armor.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, materials with negative poisson's ratio properties have
   attracted great interest from both scientific and industry fields, since
   they exhibit special properties: such as dramatic increases in the cross
   section when a force is applied in the vertical direction and
   contraction when compacted. In this paper, polyolefin blends with
   negative poisson's ratios were prepared successfully. The value of the
   negative poisson's ratio of the polyolefin blends was investigated by
   using a YJY stress flake deformation transducer. A maximum value of - 9
   was observed for the poisson's ratio of the blends, and the stable value
   for samples may reach - 1.4. The morphology of the blends was also
   studied. The results showed that the convacation phenomenon occurred
   between the two components when the samples were stretched. It also
   showed that it is possible to get materials with negative poisson's
   ratio by decreasing the compatibility of the two components in the
   blends.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic spacer fabrics are a novel kind of three-dimensional (3D) fabric
   structure with a negative Poisson's ratio. They have found a number of
   applications in functional garments, protective pads and sportive shoes
   due to their unusual properties. In this paper, a study on deformation
   behaviors of 3D spacer fabrics that could be fabricated on a large scale
   is reported. Through experimental observations of deformation of a basic
   hexagonal unit at different tensile strains, two different geometrical
   models are proposed for the fabric structure when extended in the course
   direction and wale direction, respectively. Based on the geometrical
   models, two semi-empirical equations between the Poisson's ratio and
   tensile strain are established for both tensile directions. The study
   shows that the established semi-empirical equations fit well with
   experimental results. Therefore, they could be used in the design and
   prediction of 3D auxetic spacer fabrics with different values of
   geometrical parameters.}},

Abstract = {{To analyze the influence of an adjacent foundation on ground stiffness,
   a new concept of ground stiffness influence coefficient is introduced,
   which is defined as the ratio of the ground stiffness with the adjacent
   foundation to that without. Based on the Mindlin solution, an analytical
   expression of the influence coefficient is derived from a system of two
   rigid, surface, rectangular foundations under three-dimensional elastic
   half space. Through calculating the influence coefficient, we analyze
   the influences of clear distance, side-length ratio of foundations and
   Poisson's ratio of the ground soil on ground stiffness when the adjacent
   foundation exists. It is shown that: (1) The ground stiffness can be
   improved when the effect of the adjacent foundation is taken into
   account. (2) The influence of the adjacent foundation on ground
   stiffness shows a positive correlation with the side-length ratio and
   the Poisson's ratio, and a negative correlation with the clear distance.
   (3) The influence is more significant in clay ground than in other kinds
   of ground, such as silt ground. (4) It is not necessary to consider the
   influence of adjacent foundation when the clear distance is larger than
   15 times the side length of the foundation or the side-length ratio is
   less than 0.1. In other cases, however, we should decide whether or not
   it is necessary to consider the influence of both the clear distance and
   the side-length ratio.}},

Title = {{FLEXURAL RIGIDITY OF THIN AUXETIC PLATES}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The influence of auxeticity on the mechanical behavior of isotropic
   plates is considered herein by evaluating the plate flexural rigidity as
   the Poisson's ratio changes from 0.5 to -1. Since the change in plate's
   Poisson's ratio is followed by a change in at least one of the three
   moduli, any resulting change to the plate flexural rigidity is only
   meaningful when at least one of the moduli is held constant. This was
   performed by normalizing the plate flexural rigidity by a single
   modulus, a square root of two moduli product, or a cube root of three
   moduli product to give a dimensionless plate flexural rigidity. It was
   found that the plate flexural rigidity decreases to a minimum as the
   plate Poisson's ratio decreases from 0.5 to 0 when only the Young's
   modulus is held constant. Thereafter the plate flexural rigidity
   increases with the plate auxeticity. Results also reveal that when only
   the shear modulus or when the bulk modulus is held constant, the plate
   flexural rigidity decreases or increases, respectively, with the plate
   auxeticity. Intermediate trend in the plate flexural rigidity is
   observed when the product of two moduli is held constant. When the
   product of all three moduli is held constant, the plate flexural
   rigidity increases with the plate auxeticity, and the change is
   especially drastic when the plate Poisson's ratio is near to the upper
   and lower limits of Poisson's ratio for isotropic solids. Results from
   this work are useful for structural designers to control the flexural
   rigidity of plate made from auxetic materials.}},

Abstract = {{Graphene monolayers engineered to adopt a corrugated conformation are
   found to exhibit very pronounced lateral expansion characteristics upon
   uniaxial stretching in specific directions, i.e. giant negative
   Poisson's ratio (auxeticity). Such anomalous properties are manifested
   in-plane and may be controlled through the shape and amplitude of the
   wave-like pattern of the corrugation, which in the case of graphene may
   be controlled through the introduction of patterned defects'. This
   confirms that auxeticity via corrugation can be achieved even at the
   nanoscale, as demonstrated here for graphene with patterned defects',
   suggesting that this mechanism should be operational at different scales

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials with negative Poisson's ratio are alternatively used
   in engineering applications. In engineering design, light-weight auxetic
   material with low stress and negative Poisson's ratio is the main topic.
   The peanut pattern can be reduced the weight by decreasing the
   equivalent density. The unit cell of the peanut pattern lattice can be
   drilled with four circle holes. In this study, the auxetic two-dimension
   material with modified peanut pattern is used to study the effect of the
   pattern geometric shape and the equivalent density on the stress and the
   Poisson's ratio. A four-circle punched pattern has been designed with
   the original peanut pattern. The equivalent density will be changed by
   varying their radius lengths. The results show that, the stress and the
   Poisson's ratio can be reduced by increasing the radius length. In the
   other words, by decreasing the equivalent density, the stress and the
   Poison's ratio is decreased. The parabolic relationship between the
   radius length and the stress is found with R-square value more than 0.95
   similar to the relationship between the radius length and the Poissong's

Abstract = {{Auxetic composites are non-conventional materials with negative
   Poisson's ratio (NPR). They have received great attention in recent
   years due to their particular properties and high application potential
   in different areas. In this study, a novel kind of auxetic composite was
   proposed and fabricated via an injecting and foaming process by using
   multilayer orthogonal auxetic structure as reinforcement and
   polyurethane foam as matrix. The NPR effect and mechanical behavior of
   the composite under quasi-static compression were investigated and
   compared with those of the pure polyurethane foam and non-auxetic
   composite. The results obtained show that the auxetic composite
   fabricated has an obvious NPR effect and behaves more like a damping
   material with a large range of deformation strain. The study has
   provided a simple way to design and fabricate auxetic composite
   materials by using suitable arrangement of reinforcement materials in a
   multilayer orthogonal structure. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials are those which expand when stretched and contract
   when pushed. One area which is currently attracting attention is in the
   production of auxetic fibres and textiles. Here, the history of auxetic
   microporous polymers and subsequent fibres development and production is
   reviewed along with attempts to understand how the auxetic effect is
   achieved based on the observed microstructures. Larger scale auxetic
   polymers appear to have a different causal mechanism to auxetic fibres.
   A natural development from the production of auxetic fibres is to use
   the fibres to produce textiles. Progress in this area is examined
   together with work towards using conventional fibres to produce a
   textile which is auxetic due to its structure rather than its
   constituents. Possible applications are also presented.}},

Abstract = {{Impact induced geometrically non-linear vibrations of a viscoelastic
   plate are investigated for the case when the shear operator is governed
   by the fractional derivative Kelvin-Voigt model in conjunction with the
   time-independent coefficient of volume extension-compression. Such a
   model could describe the behavior of so-called auxetic materials with
   negative Poisson's ratios. The modified method of multiple time scales
   involving the expansion of the fractional derivative in terms of a small
   parameter has been utilized for solving nonlinear governing equations of
   motion. The asymptotic behavior of the roots of the characteristic
   equation for determining the frequencies of the system as a function of
   the retardation time is studied and three modes of vibration in the
   process of impact interaction are described.}},

Title = {{In-plane crashworthiness of re-entrant hierarchical honeycombs with
   negative Poisson's ratio}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{229}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Both auxetic structures and hierarchical honeycombs are marked with
   lightweight and excellent mechanical properties. Here, we combine the
   characteristics of auxetic structures and hierarchical honeycombs, and
   propose two re-entrant hierarchical honeycombs constructed by replacing
   the cell walls of re-entrant honeycombs with regular hexagon
   substructure (RHH) and equilateral triangle substructure (RHT). The
   honeycombs are subjected to in-plane impact in order to investigate the
   crashworthiness by using the commercial software LS-DYNA. The plateau
   stress of RHH and RHT in x and y directions are derived by a two-scale
   method. The results from numerical simulation indicate that the specific
   energy absorption of RHT and RHH is improved by up to 292\% and 105\%.
   RHT and RHH improve the mean crushing force value by 298\%, 108\%
   respectively compared with the classic re-entrant honeycomb (RH) under
   quasi-static loading at stress plateau region. The RHT and RHH still
   have the characteristic of negative Poisson's ratio. Additionally, the
   parametric studies are further carried out to investigate the effects of
   impact velocities and relative densities on crashworthiness. All the
   findings of this study indicate that the proposed two hierarchical
   honeycombs exhibit an improved crushing performance, and RHT provides
   the highest energy absorption capacity among all specimens.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, the auxetic fabrics have gained much importance in the
   scientific and industrial community due to their excellent
   impact-resistance property. Due to this property, they have several
   applications, including automotive, aerospace, and ballistic areas. The
   auxetic three-dimensional (3D) woven fabrics are a less explored domain
   in the auxetic community. Herein, special attention is given to the
   numerical analysis of the 3D auxetic structure. The negative Poisson's
   ratio of 3D auxetic structures is studied using ANSYS workbench
   structural analysis module. The effect of binding yarn float length on
   negative Poisson's ratio is tested on ten different 3D orthogonal
   through the thickness structures with binding yarn float length of 1:1,
   2:1, and 3:1. Furthermore, the effect of the number of binding yarns and
   the number of layers is also studied numerically. The results show that
   the auxeticity of the woven structure increases with increasing the
   number of binding yarns and their float length. Moreover, decreasing the
   number of layers from 3 to 1 increases the auxeticity.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports quasi-static and low-kinetic energy impact testing of
   auxetic and conventional open-cell polyurethane foams. The auxetic foams
   were fabricated using the established thermo-mechanical process
   originally developed by Lakes. Converted foams were subject to
   compression along each dimension to 85\% and 70\% of the unconverted
   dimension during the conversion process, corresponding to linear
   compression ratios of 0.85 and 0.7, respectively. The 0.7 linear
   compression ratio foams were confirmed to have a re-entrant foam cell
   structure and to be auxetic. Impact tests were performed for kinetic
   energies up to 4J using an instrumented drop rig and high speed video. A
   flat dropper was employed on isolated foams, and a hemispherical-shaped
   dropper on foams covered with a rigid polypropylene outer shell layer.
   The flat dropper tests provide data on the rate dependency of the
   Poisson's ratio in these foam test specimens. The foam Poisson's ratios
   were found to be unaffected by the strain rate for the impact energies
   considered here. Acceleration-time data are reported along with
   deformation images from the video footage. The auxetic samples displayed
   a six times reduction in peak acceleration, showing potential in impact
   protector devices such as shin or thigh protectors in sports equipment
   applications. (C) 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA, Weinheim}},

Journal = {{COMPOSITES PART B-ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{94}},
Pages = {{379-388}},
Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{Composites with elliptic inclusions of long semi-axis a and short
   semi-axis b are studied by the Finite Element method. The centres of
   ellipses form a square lattice of the unit lattice constant. The
   neighbouring ellipses are perpendicular to each other and their axes are
   parallel to the lattice axes. The influence of geometry and material
   characteristics on the effective mechanical properties of these
   anisotropic composites is investigated for deformations applied along
   lattice axes. It is found that for anisotropic inclusions of low Young's
   modulus, when a + b -> 1 the effective Poisson's ratio tends to -1,
   while the effective Young's modulus takes very low values. In this case
   the structure performs the rotating rigid body mechanism. In the limit
   of large values of Young's modulus of inclusions, both effective
   Poisson's ratio and effective Young's modulus saturate to values which
   do not depend on Poisson's ratio of inclusions but depend on geometry of
   the composite and the matrix Poisson's ratio. For highly anisotropic
   inclusions of very large Young's modulus, the effective Poisson's ratio
   of the composite can be negative for nonauxetic both matrix and
   inclusions. This is a very simple example of an auxetic structure being
   not only entirely continuous, but with very high Young's modulus. A
   severe qualitative change in the composite behaviour is observed as a/b
   reaches the limit of 1, i.e. inclusions are isotropic. The observed
   changes in both Poisson's ratio and Young's modulus are complex
   functions of parameters defining the composite. The latter allows one to
   tailor a material of practically arbitrary elastic parameters. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{In this study, some new 2D auxetic metamaterials were investigated and
   called octagonal auxetic metamaterials. The structures were examined by
   numerical and experimental approaches and 3D printing additive
   manufacturing technique was employed to fabricate the structures from
   thermoplastic polyurethane elastomer (TPU) which is considered as a
   hyperelastic material. Auxetic behavior was caused by adding small
   triangles and squares to the vertices of the octagonal structure and
   applying high compressive strain. Although the octagonal structure
   showed negative Poisson's ratio at high compressive strain, the results
   suggested that adding triangles to the vertices of the octagonal
   structure as well as increasing the triangle edge length led to higher
   negative Poisson's ratio. In contrast, with small squares adding to the
   vertices of the octagonal structure, Poisson's ratio became slightly
   more negative. In addition, by increasing the square edge length,
   Poisson's ratio measured near zero or even positive values. Moreover, a
   parametric study was carried out by Python 3.6.5 programming language to
   find the best triangle and square edge length which caused the most
   auxeticity.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic structures exhibit negative Poisson's ratios based on the
   deflection characteristics of the macrostructural forms generated by
   integrating specific base units. Considering the advantages of the
   abnormal metamaterial behavior, auxetic structures attained considerable
   research attention. While theoretical predictions indicate the
   possibilities to achieve very high auxetic responses, practical
   implementation and experimental validation were limited due to the
   difficulties in manufacturing the complex structural forms. Practical
   realization of true auxetic structural solutions attained a great
   impetus with the advent of the additive manufacturing solutions, opening
   up wider opportunities and renewed interests. The current research is an
   attempt towards enhancing the auxetic nature of a square grid structure
   by numerical and experimental methods. Finite element simulations
   allowed to identify structural changes for improved auxeticity and
   experimental validation based on selective laser melted structures
   proved the trends to be true. Experimental results based on the

Abstract = {{In this paper, an auxetic design is proposed for the flexible membrane
   of a piezoelectric pulse sensor and computationally analyzed for a
   high-sensitivity vibration sensing in micro electro-mechanical system
   (MEMS). Auxetics are metamaterial structures with negative Poisson's
   ratio which enables sensor's flexible diaphragm to be expanded in both
   longitudinal and transverse directions easily. The sensitivity of a
   pulse sensor with an auxetic membrane was studied and compared to an
   equivalent plain membrane when the substrate was under harmonic bending.
   The sensing response was determined for the both models using detailed
   Finite Element Model (FEM) simulations. The sensor with the auxetic
   membrane demonstrated excellent sensitivity output over a harmonic
   pressure input which shows its strong potential for high-sensitive MEMS
   sensing applications. A detailed fabrication process is also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials or structures, especially 3D cellular lattice
   architectures with negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) have attracted great
   attention due to their unprecedented mechanical behaviors and promising
   applications in recent years. Many 3D auxetic architected cellular
   materials have been manufactured and characterized with polymers and
   metals using additive manufacturing technology as well as some fibre
   reinforced polymers (FRP) composites via assembly method, however metal
   3D printed auxetic structures with high-quality are rarely reported and
   FRP composites using assembly method contain a variety of defects which
   result in a knock-down effect on mechanical properties. Auxetic
   structures made from polymers are normally of low stiffness and strength
   and FRP composites are of low toughness and impact resistance, which
   causes limitations on their structural and functional applications. If
   rationally designed structures can be made from high-performance metal
   materials the specific stiffness and strength of which are much higher
   than polymers, their specific stiffness and strength can be
   significantly increased which will make them more suitable for various
   potential applications. This paper presents novel 3D double-U
   hierarchical structures (DUHs) based on double-V hierarchical structures
   (DVHs) with tunable Poisson's ratio and Young's modulus by tailoring the
   geometry parameters. Experimental, numerical and theoretical results
   show that DUHs have smooth geometry that can reduce manufacturing damage
   and stress concentration under elastic loading. Another advantage of
   DUHs is that the curved configurations have enhanced auxetic behavior
   and higher static collapse stress than DVHs under crushing. The advanced
   3D printing technology and those excellent mechanical properties of 3D
   DUHs meet the requirements of structural and functional applications.

Abstract = {{Over the years, great advances have been made in the field of auxetic
   metamaterials where one of the main focuses was the production of
   systems which can be produced through simple and relatively inexpensive
   means. In this work, auxetic systems created through the introduction of
   elliptical grooves, meant to mimic the rotating units mechanism, are
   proposed and analyzed. These systems were found to have the potential to
   exhibit Poisson's ratios ranging from ca.-1 to the Poisson's ratio of
   the material of the system itself, with some systems also possessing the
   remarkable property of a zero Poisson's ratio. The final product is a
   non-porous metamaterial with potentially tailor-made Poisson's ratio

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials with negative Poisson's ratios unusually exhibit
   intuitive mechanical behaviors, such as cross-section expansion instead
   of contraction during tension. Such behaviors are interesting because
   they may enhance unusual mechanical properties. However, controllable
   preparation of materials with negative Poisson's ratio is still a major
   challenge. In this study, we report the synthesis of a flexible auxetic
   graphene assembled macrofilm (GAMF) from graphene oxide nanosheets by a
   thermal annealing and press assistant method. The obtained materials
   exhibit good flexibility and significantly wide tunable negative
   Poisson's ratios ranging from -0.11 to -0.53. We also develop a
   reconstruction model for characterization the uniaxial tension of GAMF
   based on X-ray tomographic images. The tensile simulation result
   predicts the function relationship between Poisson's ratio and critical
   thickness of pore channels, which is in good agreement with the
   experimental data. As a result, an effective tunable way is proposed for
   customizable fabrication of GAMF with tunable negative Poisson's ratios,
   and the GAMF materials with good flexibility, high electrical
   conductivity and superior auxetic behavior looks promising for future
   development of wearable electronics. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper describes the fabrication of polymeric auxetic foam using a
   quasi tri-axial compression method. In this method, the conversion
   process is executed by applying a quasi tri-axial compression on
   conventional closed-cell polyurethane foams. In order to achieve optimum
   auxetic characteristics, the densification points in various directions
   are evaluated. In addition, the heating time of the compressed foam is
   also determined and applied to minimize the residual stress due to the
   volumetric compression. It leads to the fabrication of auxetic foams
   with achievable maximum re-entrancy and minimum collapsed cells without
   surface creasing. The results also show that the optimized auxetic foam
   exhibits isotropic behavior compared to its pre-cursor foam as verified
   by the morphological analysis. The produced foam has all the desired
   properties of auxetic foams. The auxetic foam with a negative Poisson's
   ratio may be have great potential as the supplementary materials in
   energy absorption and structural applications.}},

Abstract = {{Negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) material with unique geometry is rare in
   nature and has an auxetic response under strain in a specific direction.
   With this unique property, this type of material is significantly
   promising in many specific application fields. The curling structure
   commonly exists in knitted products due to the unbalanced force inside a
   knit loop. Thus, knitted fabric is an ideal candidate to mimic natural
   NPR materials, since it possesses such an inherent curly configuration
   and the flexibility to design and process. In this work, a weft-knitted
   Miura-ori fold (WMF) fabric was produced that creates a self-folding
   three-dimensional structure with NPR performance. Also, a finite element
   analysis model was developed to simulate the structural auxetic response
   to understand the deformation mechanism of hierarchical thread-based
   auxetic fabrics. The simulated strain-force curves of four WMF fabrics
   quantitatively agree with our experimental results. The auxetic
   morphologies, Poisson's ratio and damping capacity were discussed,
   revealing the deformation mechanism of the WMF fabrics. This study thus
   provides a fundamental framework for mechanical-stimulating textiles.
   The developed NPR knitted fabrics have a high potential to be employed
   in areas of tissue engineering, such as artificial blood vessels and
   artificial folding mucosa.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials with a negative Poisson's ratio have the fascinating
   property of expanding laterally when stretched longitudinally. This

   dynamic shear moduli on a range of auxetic foams and also examines
   variation in loss tangent. It is shown that both the static, elastic
   shear modulus and the dynamic loss tangent may increase with a negative
   Poisson's ratio. Such changes are attributed to modifications of the
   cell structure of the foam, not to changes in the material of the foam,
   during conversion to an auxetic foam. Such changes may have important

Abstract = {{Background: Auxetics, a special class of materials, tend to expand both
   in the radial and longitudinal directions when a unidirectional tensile
   force is applied. Recently, studies have come up with new designs for
   auxetic vascular and nonvascular stents which are deployed with
   commercial balloon catheters. There are some inherent limitations
   associated with a unidirectional application of expansion force in the
   effective deployment of stents. This work proposed a solution to some of
   these limitations through the use of a biaxial mode of a predetermined
   strain-based expansion mechanism.
   Method: The design incorporated a pressure-activated crank-slider
   mechanism. Fabrication of a prototype for experimental verification was
   carried out through milling and high-speed lathe machining. The testing
   of the device employed the use of auxetic stents, fabricated from a
   biocompatible polymer. A finite element study is presented to
   extrapolate experimental results to a broader range of operation and
   working conditions.
   Results and conclusions: The expansion mechanism is similar in operation
   to the opening of an umbrella. The length of the connected auxetic stent
   increases when internal hydraulic pressure is applied. The degree of
   linear expansion in 1 direction influences the expansion of auxetic
   stent in the lateral direction. As the device exerts pressure
   longitudinally, a larger amount of the force is distributed on the unit
   cells/hinges which ultimately results in an increased expansion of the
   stent.}},

   elements}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICS AND PHYSICS OF SOLIDS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{137}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{This work demonstrates auxetic behavior in a solid polycrystalline
   shunted piezoelectric cube. Piezoelectric elements are commonly bonded
   to structures to reduce vibrations by tuning an attached shunt circuit
   to resonate at the same frequency as the mechanical vibrations in the
   structure. Literature has provided an extensive analysis of vibration
   suppression in passively shunted piezoelectric systems, but in practice,
   the three-dimensional constitutive equations are almost always reduced
   to one-dimensional stresses and strains within the piezoelectric. In
   this work, resistive inductive shunt circuits are applied to the
   electrical terminals of a harmonically forced piezoelectric cube, and
   the directional displacements are determined in all three dimensions
   when it is loaded parallel and perpendicular to the poling direction, as
   well as dilatationally. By comparing these directional displacements,
   the effect of the shunt circuit on Poisson's ratio can be measured. It
   is demonstrated that an inductive shunt leads to a complex Poisson's
   ratio with a real part approaching positive and negative infinity over a
   discrete band of frequencies, implying that a polycrystalline
   piezoelectric cube can become auxetic through the application of a
   properly engineered shunt circuit. The auxetic behavior is explored
   through finite element modeling, and the derivation of analytical
   expressions for Poisson's ratio in shunted piezoelectric elements.

Volume = {{135}},
Pages = {{441-457}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials are materials which present negative Poisson ratios.
   This unusual behavior is due to their particular microstructures. It is
   frequent that during large deformation processes in auxetic foams, the
   value of the Poisson ratio also presents large variations, with
   transitions from auxetic to conventional behavior. In this paper we
   present a procedure to perform large strain finite element analysis of
   energy-conservative isotropic auxetic materials from a continuum
   perspective. Two possible approaches are used. The first one is based on
   uncoupled WYPiWYG hyperelasticity. This decomposition permits a simple
   analysis of the behavior using also infinitesimal bi-linear models. The
   second approach is a novel procedure for coupled hyperelasticity based
   on classical invariants. This latter procedure is amenable for obtaining
   the stored energy of highly compressible foams, including coupling terms
   and generic invariants, as for example those used by the analytical
   Blatz-Ko model or the hyperelastic model of Ciambella and Saccomandi,
   which was explicitly developed for auxetic foams. The applicability and
   efficiency of the method is shown through fmite element analyses of
   auxetic foams at large strains using the continuum approach. (C) 2017

   Auxetic materials and structures are intriguing systems that exhibit

Title = {{Enhancing indentation and impact resistance in auxetic composite
   materials}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITES PART B-ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{198}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic materials exhibiting a negative Poisson's ratio are of great
   research interest due to their unusual mechanical responses and a wide
   range of potential deployment. However, due to the cellular structure
   and the bending or rotation deformation nature of the elements in
   auxetic materials, they usually have relative low stiffness, limiting
   their applications where high stiffness, strength, hardness, and energy
   absorption are simultaneously desired. To overcome this limitation, we
   apply the auxetic lattice structures as the reinforcements combining
   with the nearly incompressible soft materials as the matrix to create a
   class of high-performance composites. This coupled geometry and material
   design concept is enabled by the state-of-the-art additive manufacturing
   technique. Guided by static and dynamic experimental testing, we
   systematically study the indentation behavior of the 3D printed auxetics
   reinforced composites and achieve a significant enhancement of their
   indentation stiffness and impact resistance compared with the
   non-auxetic reinforced composites. By digital image correlation
   processing of experimental tests and numerical simulation, this improved
   mechanical performance is found due to two deformation mechanisms. The
   first mechanism is the negative Poisson's ratio effect of the auxetic
   reinforcements, which makes the matrix in a state of biaxial compression
   during indentation and impact and hence provides additional support. The
   second mechanism is the negative Poisson's ratio effect of the overall
   composites, which makes the auxetic reinforced composites denser at the
   site of the indentation and therefore are more resistant to indentation.
   The results show that auxetic structures can lead to design stiffer,
   harder and tougher composite materials. The material design strategy
   provides insights into the development of classes of novel auxetic
   composites with a wide range of mechanical and structural applications.}},

Abstract = {{An effective anisotropic continuum formulation for auxetic cellular
   materials is the objective of this paper. A skeleton is modelled as a
   plane beam elastic structure with stiff joints. The skeleton topology,

   inferred from the deformation response of a representative volume
   element using the framework of micromechanical analysis. The strain
   energy of a unit cell is calculated by adding the tensile, shearing and
   bending strain energy of individual members. The equivalent continuum is
   based on averaging this energy, thus formulating the basis for computing
   the anisotropic stiffness matrix. The structural mechanics methodology

Abstract = {{A 2D `Rough Particle' model consisting of interlocking hexagons is
   reported. Analytical expressions for the in-plane Poisson's ratios and
   Young's moduli due to particle translation along the geometrically
   matched male and female interlocks are derived for the model. The
   dependency of the mechanical properties on each of the model
   (geometrical and stiffness) parameters is provided, and it is shown that
   the assembly of interlocking hexagons deforming by particle translation
   along the interlocks displays auxetic (negative Poisson's ratio)
   behaviour. The model predictions are compared with experimental
   mechanical properties for auxetic polypropylene (PP) films and fibres.
   The model predicts the experimental Poisson's ratio values very well
   (model: nu(xy) = -1.30, nu(yx) = -0.77; experiment (PP films): nu(||) =
   -1.12, nu(perpendicular to) = -0.77). The model generally overestimates
   the Young's moduli of the films, but is in reasonable agreement with the
   axial Young's modulus of the fibres.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials refer to materials that exhibit a negative Poisson's

   flatbed knitting machine to fabricate and experiment on an arrow-headed
   auxetic tubular fabric. The study used three kinds of yarns: nylon (PA),
   PES, and cotton as the materials for knitting the tubular samples. Three
   variations of an arrow-head design (4x4, 6x6, and 8x8) were also used as
   the three main structural patterns. The results reveal that the 6x6'
   structure gives the best auxetic effect among the three and the nylon
   (PA) yarn had the best auxeticity.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Most materials will shrink or expand laterally when stretched or
   compressed, i. e. they have positive Poisson ratios,but materials with
   negative Poisson ratios will undergo lateral expansion when stretched
   longitudinally and become thinner when compressed. And materials
   exhibiting this novel and counterintuitive behavior, now known as
   auxetic materials, have been successfully fabricated with many new
   applications. Currently, molecular auxeties, namely auxetic materials at
   the molecular level, have become the most exciting endeavor in the
   development of auxetic materials. In this paper, as new alternatives to
   the making of molecular auxetics, several types of centipede-like linear
   polymers both with single and double legs on the side chain,
   single-arrow-like, double-arrow-like organic compounds were designed as
   building blocks for self-assembling into auxetic network structures
   through hydrogen bonds. The second derivative method is used to
   calculate Poisson ratios after doing molecular mechanics (MM)
   optimization. The results show that all these self-assembly networks can
   be arranged as inverted honey-comb like structures and their Poisson's
   ratios in at least one plane are negative and even the self assembly of
   small molecules with special architecture may achieve auxeticity in some
   cases. Compared with many approaches proposed so far, that of the
   self-assembly of both single polymers and single small molecules into
   molecular auxetics reported here is quite novel. It provides a new route
   to synthesize molecular auxetics, which should be much easier than that
   for synthesizing two-dimensional cross-linked auxetic networks. Yet its
   successful realization requires great experimental efforts.}},

Abstract = {{The origin of negative Poisson's ratio in rutile-type oxides and

Abstract = {{Auxetic structure and tunable phase transitions are fascinating
   properties for future application. Herein, we propose two
   three-dimensional (3D) carbon honeycombs (CHC), known as Cmcm -CHC and
   Cmmm-CHC. Based on first-principles calculations, these novel 3D
   materials exhibit auxeticity with a fascinating negative Poisson's
   ratio, which stems from (i) the puckered structure of Cmcm -CHC along
   the tube axis and (ii) significant change of angle-dominant deformation
   for Cmmm-CHC in the armchair direction. In addition, the moderate strain
   drives semimetal to semiconductor phase transition in CHCs, which
   thoroughly establishes its C-C bond formation. In the meantime, two new
   phases, namely P6(3)/mmc-CHC and P6/mmm-CHC, form and exhibit
   semiconductor characteristics. Our results also show that Cmcm -CHC and
   P6(3)/mmc-CHC are superhard materials. The outstanding negative

Abstract = {{The purpose of the present study is to investigate the influences of
   changes in the microstructure of the re-entrant auxetic foam during the
   conversion-based fabrication on its elastic and plastic behaviors. The
   20 re-entrant honeycomb is used for the finite element (FE) study. The
   FE method is firstly validated with theoretical calculations. Then, for
   the first time, the irregularity of the re-entrant honeycomb is
   considered in the study of irregularity mechanical relationship.
   Compared to the regular re-entrant honeycomb, the irregular structures
   tend to have lower magnitudes of the effective elastic modulus, yield
   strength and Poisson's ratio. It is also highlighted that the
   irregularity has indirect effects on the effective mechanical properties
   of the re-entrant honeycomb by changing its relative density. Moreover,
   the residual convex units (the uncompressed convex corners of the
   conventional foams during the conversion-based fabrication) make the
   Poisson's ratio of the re-entrant honeycomb less negative. Therefore,
   the superior abilities brought by the negative Poisson's ratio such as
   the shear modulus and indentation hardness can be impaired by the
   residual convex units. Besides, the role of the residual stress is also
   explored with FE methods. The present study is helpful to the
   understanding of the structure mechanical relationship in the auxetic
   foams. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate a negative Poisson's ratio in carbon nanotube forest
   devices subjected to extension motion obtained by means of electrostatic
   actuation. Actuated devices were optically monitored, while
   electrostatic force was applied and the axial (parallel to the carbon
   nanotubes) and lateral (perpendicular to the carbon nanotubes) motions
   were extracted. Poisson's ratios were then calculated for the top,
   middle and bottom portions of the carbon nanotube forest devices. Since
   extension motion is associated with morphology change of enhancement of

   Large negative Poisson's ratios were obtained in the top portion (where
   morphology change is most significant), while other portions (where
   morphology change is less significant) demonstrated smaller value of
   negative Poisson's ratio. This property makes carbon nanotube forest

Abstract = {{Background: Cardiovascular heart disease is one of the leading health
   issues in the present era and requires considerable health care
   resources to prevent it. The present study was focused on the
   development of a new coronary stent based on novel auxetic geometry
   which enables the stent to exhibit a negative Poisson's ratio.
   Commercially available coronary stents have isotropic properties,
   whereas the vascular system of the body shows anisotropic
   characteristics. This results in a mismatch between
   anisotropic-isotropic properties of the stent and arterial wall, and
   this in turn is not favorable for mechanical adhesion of the
   commercially available coronary stents with the arterial wall. It is
   believed that an auxetic coronary stent with inherent anisotropic
   mechanical properties and negative Poisson's ratio will have good
   mechanical adhesion with the arterial wall.
   Methods: The auxetic design was obtained via laser cutting, and surface
   treatment was performed with acid pickling and electropolishing,
   followed by an annealing process. In vitro mechanical analysis was
   performed to analyze the mechanical performance of the auxetic coronary
   stent. Scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) was used to determine the
   effects of fabrication processes on the topography of the auxetic stent.
   Results and Conclusions: The elastic recoil (3.3\%) of the in vitro
   mechanical analysis showed that the auxetic stent design effectively
   maintained the luminal patency of the coronary artery. Also, the auxetic
   coronary stent showed no foreshortening, therefore it avoids the problem
   of stent migration, by expanding in both the radial and longitudinal
   directions. By virtue of its synclastic behavior, the auxetic stent
   bulges outward when it is radially expanded through an inflated balloon.}},

Abstract = {{Perforated systems constitute one of the most important classes of
   mechanical metamaterials. In this work, two types of ``I{''}-shaped slit
   perforation patterns are proposed which may be used to design perforated
   systems that mimic the deformation mechanisms of a variety of re-entrant
   and anti-tetrachiral honeycomb systems. Using finite element analysis,
   it is shown how these systems have the potential to exhibit a large
   spectrum of negative Poisson's ratios, ranging from extremely negative
   to zero, which are retained over a wide tensile strain range. A detailed
   analysis of the deformation behavior of these systems is also presented
   along with a comparison of the changes in overall expansion and
   Poisson's ratios of both systems observed upon loading with those
   predicted by previously formulated theoretical models of re-entrant and
   anti-tetrachiral systems. It is hoped that this work will be of
   considerable aid in the efforts of scientists to understand the
   underlying principles governing the production of auxetic mechanical
   metamaterials through the use of perforations and also stimulate further
   research on how these and similar mechanisms may be implemented in
   perforated systems to design other metamaterials with anomalous
   mechanical properties.}},

Title = {{Effect of annealing on the elastic moduli of amorphous zirconium
   tungstate}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NON-CRYSTALLINE SOLIDS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{403}},
Pages = {{102-106}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Amorphous zirconium tungstate (a-ZrW2O8), prepared at 7.7 GPa, was
   subjected to successive heat treatments at increasingly higher
   temperatures, up to 640 degrees C. Evidence of recrystallization into
   alpha-ZrW2O8 was found in the room temperature X-ray powder diffraction
   pattern of samples previously heated above 600 degrees C. Changes in
   elastic moduli and linear thermal expansion coefficient upon annealing
   of a-ZrW2O8 up to 600 degrees C cannot be accounted for by assuming a
   composite sample consisting of alpha-ZrW2O8 domains dispersed into an
   amorphous zirconium tungstate matrix. The irreversible relaxation of
   a-ZrW2O8 and recrystallization into alpha-ZrW2O8 is accompanied by an
   increase of bulk modulus (from 61.8(8) GPa to 74.4(9) GPa) and Poisson's
   ratio (from 0267(3) to 0302(3)) and diminution of density (from 6.54(1)
   g/cm(3) for a-ZrW2O8 to 5.18(1) g/cm(3) for alpha-ZrW2O8). Despite the
   greater density, a-ZrW2O8 (as well as gamma-ZrW2O8, a high pressure
   polymorph) is more compressible than alpha-ZrW2O8, possibly owing to the
   new degrees of freedom provided by lowering symmetry, which allow
   external stresses to be accommodated by polyhedral tilting. Furthermore,
   the observed increase of Poisson's ratio upon thermal treatments at
   increasingly higher temperatures indicates that annealing of a-ZrW2O8 is
   accompanied by the irreversible reduction in the average number of
   bridging oxygen atoms. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Chiral systems are a class of structures, which may exhibit the
   anomalous property of a negative Poisson's ratio. Proposed by
   Wojciechowski and implemented later by Lakes, these structures have
   aroused interest due to their remarkable mechanical properties and
   numerous potential applications. In view of this, this paper
   investigates the on-axis mechanical properties of the general forms of
   the flexing anti-tetrachiral system through analytical and finite
   element models. The results suggest that these are highly dependent on
   the geometry (the ratio of ligament lengths, thicknesses, and radius of
   nodes) and material properties of the constituent materials. We also
   show that the rigidity of an anti-tetrachiral system can be changed
   without altering the Poisson's ratio.}},

Abstract = {{This research presents a numerical method to design a two-dimensional

   established by combining the finite element method (FEM) with two
   different optimization procedures called bi-directional evolutionary
   structural optimization (BESO) and solid isotropic material with
   penalization (SIMP), respectively. The results show that by choosing any
   of the two methods of optimization (FEM and BESO or FEM and SIMP), each
   with a different objective function, it is possible to create
   microstructures that show negative Poisson's ratio. In addition, there
   is a significant resemblance between the results of both optimization
   methodologies. The final part of this study is to verify the outcome of
   optimization, both numerically and experimentally using

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials expand in at least one dimension, when stretched
   longitudinally i.e. they have negative Poisson's ratio. Development of
   2D woven auxetic fabrics (AF) is a new approach to develop mechanically
   stable auxetic textile structures. However, the mechanical response of
   such emerging structure is still not studied in detail yet, therefore
   different mechanical properties of 2D woven AF are compared with
   conventional non-auxetic fabric (NAF). AF was developed by orienting
   yarns in auxetic honey-comb (AHC) geometry and auxeticity is induced due
   to such orientation of yarns. AF was developed using conventional
   (non-auxetic) materials; cotton yarn and elastane cotton yarn in warp
   and weft dimension respectively, using air jet loom. Structure and
   auxeticity of AF were analyzed using a digital microscope and its
   different mechanical properties (tensile strength, tear strength,
   bursting strength, cut resistance, and puncture resistance) were
   studied. AF showed superior mechanical properties with a lower initial
   modulus, which is beneficial for different protective textiles
   applications like cut resistance gloves, blast resistant curtains, and
   puncture tolerant elastomeric composites.}},

Abstract = {{The growing interest in the field of negative Poisson's ratio materials
   is motivated by the attractive mechanical properties of these materials
   and the potential enhancements that might be derived from replacing a
   positive Poisson's ratio component with its auxetic counterpart. In this
   paper we report on preliminary results of an ongoing experimental study
   to test the hypothesis that an auxetic composite can be produced by
   embedding an auxetic fibre network within a conventional (positive
   Poisson's ratio) matrix. First we present results of tensile tests
   performed on samples of compressed mats of sintered stainless steel
   fibres which are known to have a negative Poisson's ratio out-of-plane.
   Next we present results of mechanical tests and imaging studies on
   composite samples made by infusing the stainless steel mats with a
   polymer. Finally we report on the auxetic behaviour observed in some
   polymer nanocomposites with a high loading of carbon nanofibers. We
   conjecture that the embedded nanofibers form an effective network and,
   like the stainless steel mats, the compression of the samples during
   fabrication renders the embedded networks auxetic. The compliance of the
   polymer matrix relative to the nanofiber network results in an auxetic
   composite. The results demonstrate the feasibility of the approach and
   the potential for developing new auxetic composites with auxetic fibre
   networks as the reinforcing phase. (C) 2010 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co.

   This paper presents an analytical model of a structure constructed from

   together with the results of mechanical tests of a structure having this
   geometry. It is shown that such systems can exhibit negative on-axis
   Poisson's ratio of -1 which means that they maintain their aspect ratio,
   while Poisson's ratio becomes less negative for loading off-axis. It is
   also shown that this model can explain the sign and anisotropy of

   from calix(4)arenes having the same geometry. (C) 2010 WILEY-VCH Verlag

Abstract = {{With the use of a three-stage thermal processing route, similar to that
   used previously for the production of ultra high molecular weight
   polyethylene possessing a negative Poisson's ratio (i.e. displaying
   auxetic behavior), an auxetic form of polyethylene has been fabricated.
   The polypropylene is processed by the compaction, sintering, and
   extrusion of a powder. The importance of powder morphology on the
   ability of polypropylene to achieve magnetic behavior has been examined,
   revealing that particle shape, size, and surface roughness are critical
   variables for successful processing. Negative Poisson's ratios of up to
   -0.22 at 1.6\% strain have been obtained. The data have been
   successfully interpreted by use of a simple geometric model based on the
   polymer microstructure. These suggest that, by further optimizing the

Abstract = {{Motivated by the authors' previous study on flexible honeycomb design
   with negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) often called `auxetic' {[}1], more
   geometric options of hexagonal honeycomb meso-structures are explored
   with various ratios of the vertical cell length, h to the inclined
   length, 1. While designing an effective shear modulus, e.g., G(12){*} of
   1 OMPa, of hexagonal honeycombs, we are searching honeycomb geometries.
   Using an aluminum alloy (7075-T6) as the constituent material, the
   in-plane linear elastic honeycomb model is employed to get effective
   shear moduli, effective shear yield strengths and effective shear yield
   strains of hexagonal honeycombs. The numerical parametric study based on
   the linear cellular theory is combined with honeycomb design to get the
   optimal cell geometry associated with a manufacturing limitation. The
   re-entrant geometry makes 7075-T6 NPR honeycombs flexible, resulting in
   an effective shear yield strength, (tau(pl){*})12 of 1.7MPa and an
   effective shear yield strain, (gamma(pl))12 of 0.17 when they are
   designed to have a G(12){*} of lOMPa.}},

Abstract = {{This work describes the theoretical, numerical and experimental in-plane
   and out-of-plane elastic behavior of a class of anti-tetrachiral lattice
   structures with in-plane negative Poisson's ratios and anisotropic
   behavior. Closed form analytical solutions related to the uniaxial
   stiffness, in-plane Poisson's ratio and bounds for the transverse shear
   modulus are derived, and compared against homogenization-based finite
   element methods and experimental tests performed on rapid
   prototyping-made samples. The bench-marked models are then used to
   investigate the behaviors of the anisotropic negative Poisson's ratio
   structures against the geometry parameters defining the unit cell. The
   results show the existence of large variations in linear elastic
   constants and degree of anisotropy, which can be achieved by changing
   the lattice geometry parameters. The analysis presented in this work
   provides meaningful guidance to assist design anti-tetrachiral
   anisotropic lattices, which could serve as sandwich panel cores in
   aerospace applications. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials have gained increasing interest in the last decades,
   fostered by auspicious applications in various fields. While the design
   of new auxetics has largely focused on metamaterials with deterministic,
   periodically arranged structures, we show here by theoretical and
   numerical analysis that pronounced auxetic behaviour with negative
   Poisson's ratios of very large magnitude can occur in random fibre
   networks with slender, reasonably straight fibre segments that buckle
   and deflect. We further demonstrate in experiments that such auxetic
   fibre networks, which increase their thickness by an order of magnitude
   and more than quintuple their volume when moderately extended, can be
   produced by electrospinning. Our results thus augment the class of
   auxetics by a large group of straightforwardly fabricable meta-materials
   with stochastic microstructure.}},

Abstract = {{Focusing on planar isotropic petal-shaped auxetics, an isogeometric
   design framework is presented to achieve tunable effective properties.
   Specifically, the design framework includes (i) a NURBS-based parametric
   modelling scheme that characterizes petal-shaped auxetics with a small
   number of design variables; (ii) a systematic consideration of petal
   form, component widths and base material properties; (iii) a
   semi-analytical sensitivity analysis method based on material
   derivatives; and (iv) constraints for effective stiffness and target
   Poisson ratio. Three cases are considered: Case A with the same
   component width, Case B with different component widths, and Case C for
   composite designs with multiple base materials. For each case, a design
   limit curve is obtained for the effective Poisson ratio over a range of
   effective stiffness constraints, to give a quick overview on the
   properties attainable for each design setting. The optimization
   framework is next demonstrated for designing composite petal-shaped
   auxetics with target effective properties.}},

Title = {{Experimentally program large magnitude of Poisson's ratio in additively
   manufactured mechanical metamaterials}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{173}},
Month = {{MAY 1}},
Abstract = {{Triangle and honeycomb mechanical metamaterials possess exclusive
   characteristic of programmable Poisson's ratio. Up to now, the Poisson's
   ratio of these metamaterials in reported experiments is only within the
   range of {[}-4, 1], which is far narrow than the theoretical prediction.
   In this work, triangle and honeycomb metamaterials were exclusively
   designed and were fabricated by additive manufacturing. The large
   magnitude of Poisson's ratios including both positive and negative
   values was obtained in experimental measurements. Theoretical analysis
   and numerical simulation were also performed and discussed with the
   experiments. The results reveal that, under large loading strain, the
   metamaterials suffer plastic and large deformation, making their
   Poisson's ratios show significant loading strain dependence. Below the
   critical loading strain, the metamaterials generate elastic deformation,
   and the experimentally measured Poisson's ratios agree well with the
   theoretical perditions and numerical calculation. The as-fabricated
   triangle and honeycomb metamaterials present programmable positive
   Poisson's ratio in the ranges of {[}0.75, 10.92] and {[}2.80, 13.79],
   respectively. Besides, the reentrant triangle and honeycomb
   metamaterials show programmable negative Poisson's ratio in the ranges
   of {[}-0.87, -7.01] and {[}-2.13, -10.24], respectively. These
   experimentally obtained ranges of Poisson's ratios are far larger than
   the literature reported experimental results, and provide experimental
   basis of these mechanical metamaterials to the applications in such as
   aerospace, civil and transportation.}},

Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{173}},
Month = {{JUL 5}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic structures exhibit certain abnormal mechanical responses such as
   negative Poisson's ratios, mainly through the intertwined deformation
   attributes of inter-connected members of macro structural forms.
   Considering the relative ease of achieving complex forms with the advent
   of the additive manufacturing technologies, there is a renewed interest
   in auxetic structures, as the already established as well as new
   structural shapes are physically produced and tested to ascertain the
   theoretical predictions. While the focus was mostly around the auxetic
   responses, the stress distribution patterns and in particular the stress
   concentration effects were mostly neglected. This paper fills this gap,
   evaluating the stress concentration aspects of a standard re-entrant
   auxetic structure. A new structure is designed and proven to be less
   stressed in comparison with the re-entrant form commonly reported in the
   literature by means of analytical, experimental, and numerical results.
   The new structure proposed has proved to be more auxetic up to 15\% of
   the external strain and with Poisson's ratios up to -2.5. (C) 2019 The

Abstract = {{This paper presents an innovative three-dimensional (3D) fabric
   structure for composite reinforcement. Different from most conventional
   3D fabric structures, the new structure displays a negative Poisson's
   ratio (NPR) effect under compression. Based on a manufacturing process
   developed by combining both non-weaving and knitting technologies, four
   NPR 3D fabric samples with different warp yarn diameters were first
   manufactured manually. Then, their Poisson's ratio (PR) values under
   compression along the fabric thickness direction were experimentally
   evaluated. A geometrical model was also proposed for the theoretical
   calculation of PR values of these fabrics and was compared with
   experimental data. The good agreements were obtained between the
   calculation and experiment. The results show that all the 3D fabrics
   display NPR effect under compression, which results in a unique feature
   that allows the structure to concentrate itself under the compressive
   load to better resist the load. This special feature makes this
   innovative 3D fabric structure very attractive for many potential
   applications such as automobile, aerospace, defense and sports
   equipment, where impact protection can be a highly desirable property.}},

Title = {{Deformation Behaviors of Auxetic Warp Knitted Fabrics Based on Reentrant
   Geometry}},
Journal = {{PHYSICA STATUS SOLIDI B-BASIC SOLID STATE PHYSICS}},
Abstract = {{A series of auxetic warp knitted fabrics based on reentrant geometry
   were developed in our previous study and their Poisson's ratio in the
   wale direction and course direction can be as low as -0.5 and -0.15,
   respectively. However, the quantitative relationships between structural
   parameters and auxetic effect, which can offer a guide to the design and
   manufacture process, are still unknown. Herein, the aim is to find such
   relationships. Based on the geometrical analysis, two semiempirical
   equations between Poisson's ratio and tensile strain are established
   when stretched in the wale direction and course direction, respectively.
   The study shows that the established semiempirical equations fit well
   with experimental results and can be used to predict auxetic effect of
   fabrics made with the same type of materials and similar structures.
   With the relationships proposed, warp knitted fabrics can be designed
   and manufactured directly without trials to obtain the desired auxetic
   effect, which can largely save the time and cost of production.}},

Abstract = {{Re-entrant anti-trichiral honeycomb is a typical auxetic material. The
   collapse process can be divided into three stages while its negative
   Poisson's ratio (NPR) effect under large deformation is still unclear.
   In the present paper, the NPR effects of re-entrant anti-trichiral
   honeycombs under large deformation are studied by numerical and
   theoretical method. Numerical results are verified by the experiments
   with respect to their deformation mechanism and stress-strain behavior.
   Theoretical formulas are derived to predict the NPR effect of the
   honeycomb under large deformation. The analytical predictions are in
   good agreement with the FEM results. It is revealed that the NPR effect
   of the honeycomb is magnified with the global strain in the second stage
   while is weaken in the third stage of the deformation process. The
   decrease of the ligament-ratio and the mean radius will result in more
   obvious NPR effect. Variation of cell-wall thickness doesn't have much
   impact on the Poisson's ratio in the second stage, while smaller
   cell-wall thickness will induce larger NPR in the third stage. The
   present work is supposed to shed light on the design and fabrication of
   re-entrant anti-trichiral honeycombs with desired Poisson's ratio.}},

Abstract = {{An experimental and numerical investigation of fatigue life and crack
   propagation in two-dimensional perforated aluminum structures is
   presented. Specifically, the performance of positive Poisson's ratio

   effective maximum stress despite having holes with larger stress
   concentrations. Digital image correlation is used to detect crack
   initiation and damage propagation much earlier than can be detected by
   the unaided eye. Accompanying finite element analyses reveal that
   auxetic structures have the advantage over their PPR counterparts by
   delaying crack initiation, spreading damage over a larger area, and
   having a stress intensity factor that decreases over a significant range
   of crack lengths. In addition, numerical simulations suggest that
   auxetic structures maintain their negative Poisson's ratios in the
   presence of cracks.}},

Abstract = {{Materials science has adopted the term of auxetic behavior for
   structural deformations where stretching in some direction entails
   lateral widening, rather than lateral shrinking. Most studies, in the
   last three decades, have explored repetitive or cellular structures and
   used the notion of negative Poisson's ratio as the hallmark of auxetic
   behavior. However, no general auxetic principle has been established
   from this perspective. In the present article, we show that a purely
   geometric approach to periodic auxetics is apt to identify essential
   characteristics of frameworks with auxetic deformations and can generate
   a systematic and endless series of periodic auxetic designs. The
   critical features refer to convexity properties expressed through
   families of homothetic ellipsoids.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, auxetic cellular solids in the forms of honeycombs and carbon
   nanotube reinforced composite (CNTRC) have great potential in a diverse
   range of applications. This paper studies the nonlinear free and forced
   vibration of sandwich cylindrical panel on visco-Pasternak foundations
   in thermal environment subjected to blast load The sandwich cylindrical
   panel consists of auxetic honeycombs core layer and two CNTRC face
   sheets. The Poisson' ratio of the auxetic core is negative and the
   material properties of CNTRC face sheets are assumed to continuously
   vary in the thickness direction according to four different types of
   linear functions. The blast load is determined from the distance of the
   center of blast to center of the structure and the mass of explosive
   materials. The fundamental equations are established based on Reddy's
   higher order shear deformation shell theory taking into account the
   effect of initial imperfection and visco-Pasternak foundations. The
   Galerkin and Runge-Kutta methods are used to obtain the nonlinear
   dynamic response and the natural frequency of the sandwich cylindrical
   panel. The numerical results show the effect of geometrical parameters,
   visco foundations, initial imperfection, temperature increment, nanotube
   volume fraction and blast load on the nonlinear vibration
   characteristics of the sandwich cylindrical panel. The accuracy of
   present approach and theoretical results is verified by some comparisons
   with the known data in the literature.}},

Title = {{A comprehensive analysis of auxetic honeycomb sandwich plates with
   graphene nanoplatelets reinforcement}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{259}},
Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{Nowadays, sandwich plates with cellular core structures are gaining the
   attention of researchers owing to their outstanding features. For a
   better insight into auxetic structures, in this study, we propose an
   excellent computational approach based on polygonal meshes to
   comprehensively examine the free vibration, buckling and dynamic
   instability behaviors of the auxetic honeycomb sandwich plate
   structures. A generalized C-0-type higher-order shear deformation theory
   (C-0-HSDT) in conjunction with both Laplace and quadratic serendipity
   shape functions is employed to approximate the strain fields for
   polygonal plate elements. The sandwich plate structures are constituted
   by an auxetic honeycomb core layer with negative Poisson's ratio and two
   skin layers reinforced by graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs). Ultra-light
   features of the plate structures can be obtained by using the auxetic
   honeycomb cells with negative Poisson's ratio while the GNPs are
   embedded into skin layers to enhance the structural stiffness. In order
   to determine the dynamic instability region of the sandwich plate,
   Bolotin's approach is utilized in the current research. Several
   numerical examples are carried out to investigate the influences of
   geometrical parameters of auxetic cell and GNPs reinforcement on the
   structural behaviors. The results obtained in the current research can
   be considered as benchmark ones to investigate auxetic sandwich plate
   structures.}},

Title = {{Accelerating Auxetic Metamaterial Design with Deep Learning}},
Journal = {{ADVANCED ENGINEERING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Metamaterials can be designed to contain functional gradients with
   negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) that have counterintuitive behavior
   compared with monolithic materials. These NPR materials, referred to as
   auxetics, are relevant to engineering sciences because of their unique
   mechanical expansion. Previous studies have explored compliant actuators
   using analytical and numerically derived mechanics of materials
   principles. However, the control of compliant gradient mechanisms
   frequently uses complex analytical equations combined with traditional
   control algorithms, making them difficult to design. To confront the
   design processes and computational load, herein, machine learning is
   used to predict errors in compliant auxetic designs based on a
   mathematically optimal deformation. Finite element analysis and
   experimental specimens validate the theoretical mechanical behavior of a
   specific auxetic configuration as well as demonstrate the capabilities
   of additive manufacturing of graded auxetic materials. Pseudorandomized
   images and their respective computational deformation results are used
   to train a regressive model and predict the deviation from optimal
   behavior. The model predicts the deviation from the desired behavior
   with a mean average percent error below 5\% for the validation set.
   Subsequently, a scalable workflow design process connecting the unique
   performance of auxetics to machine learning design predictions is
   proposed.}},

Journal = {{THIN-WALLED STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{155}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{In this study, two dimensional double-U auxetic honeycombs (2D DUHs)
   composed of curved shell members have been proposed based on traditional
   double-V (concave quadrilateral or re-entrant double-arrowhead) auxetic
   honeycombs (2D DVHs). Theoretical analysis, numerical simulation and
   compression experiments are adopted to characterize the mechanical
   properties including equivalent Young's modulus, equivalent Poisson's
   ratio, and quasi-static collapse process of 2D DVHs and DUHs. Specimens
   of the 2D DUHs and DVHs made of Aluminum alloy (A6061) are fabricated
   through wire cut electrical discharge machining. Both numerical and
   experimental results illustrate that concave DUHs exhibit tunable
   negative Poisson's ratio and equivalent stiffness level compared to
   DVHs. Furthermore, DUHs have smooth geometry configurations that can
   reduce stress concentration at elastic region and exhibit stronger
   auxetic behavior during large deformation. Those mechanical properties
   of 2D DUHs satisfy the requirements for practical engineering
   applications such as energy absorption. The dynamic crushing responses
   of 2D DVHs and DUHs are also investigated, and it is found that the
   crushing collapse modes and plateau stress improvement of 2D DUHs are
   related to the crushing velocity. Finally, the local impact responses of
   2D DVHs and DUHs are studied numerically, the influences of impact
   velocity and indenter size are considered. This study provides useful
   instructions for the design, fabrication and analysis of auxetic
   structures, which has a broad prospect in some advanced technical
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{Negative Poisson's ratio or auxetic foams were fabricated and studied
   for use in prosthetic applications. A thermomechanical process was used
   to convert conventional polyurethane (PU) foam into auxetic PU foam. Two
   types of auxetic PU foams were made using two different volumetric
   compression ratios, 3.02 and 3.86. Chemical composition analysis showed
   that chemical structure of the converted auxetic foam remained the same
   as the conventional PU foam after the thermomechanical process.
   Compression tests showed that the auxetic foams had higher stiffness
   than conventional foams, implying that the auxetic foams could be
   potentially used in seat cushions, shoe soles, and as liners in
   prosthetic applications. Compression fatigue tests showed that
   percentage loss in thickness in auxetic foam fabricated using lower
   compression ratio had loss in thickness that is comparable to
   conventional foam, whereas auxetic foam fabricated using higher
   compression ratio had greater loss in thickness. Our study indicates
   that the auxetic foams made using lower compression ratio need to be
   further explored for suitability in various rehabilitation applications.}},

Abstract = {{The Poisson's ratio characterizes the resultant strain in the lateral
   direction for a material under longitudinal deformation. Though negative
   Poisson's ratios (NPR) are theoretically possible within continuum
   elasticity, they are most frequently observed in engineered materials
   and structures, as they are not intrinsic to many materials. In this
   work, we report NPR in single-layer graphene ribbons, which results from
   the compressive edge stress induced warping of the edges. The effect is
   robust, as the NPR is observed for graphene ribbons with widths smaller
   than about 10 nm, and for tensile strains smaller than about 0.5\% with
   NPR values reaching as large as -1.51. The NPR is explained analytically
   using an inclined plate model, which is able to predict the Poisson's
   ratio for graphene sheets of arbitrary size. The inclined plate model
   demonstrates that the NPR is governed by the interplay between the width
   (a bulk property), and the warping amplitude of the edge (an edge
   property), which eventually yields a phase diagram determining the sign
   of the Poisson's ratio as a function of the graphene geometry.}},

Abstract = {{The auxetic composites are materials characterized by a negative
   Poisson's ratio value. Such composites can be made of conventional
   materials with a positive value of Poisson's ratio, but the specific
   arrangement of the composite reinforcement structures provides this
   composition with a negative Poisson's ratio. It is also possible to
   create such structures from already existing auxetic subassemblies. In
   comparison to conventional composites, the auxetic reinforced ones have
   a lot of positive features, i.e.: higher shear resistance, better crack
   resistance and better damping properties. The aim of this article was to
   present the review of elastomeric materials for the possible application
   as the matrix for composite reinforced by auxetic fabrics, especially
   fabrics made of Helical Auxetic Yam (HAY). (C) 2019 The Authors.

Abstract = {{It has been shown that the coefficient of dynamic friction between two
   surfaces decreases when ultrasonic vibrations are super imposed on the
   macroscopic sliding velocity. Instead of longitudinal vibrations, this
   paper focuses on the lateral contractions and expansions of an object in
   and around the half wavelength node region. This lateral motion is due
   to the Poisson effect (ratio of lateral strain to longitudinal strain)
   present in all materials. We numerically and experimentally investigate
   the Poisson-effect ultrasonic lubrication. A motor effect region is
   identified in which the effective friction force becomes negative as the
   vibratory waves drive the motion of the interface. Outside of the motor
   region, friction lubricationis observed with between 30\% and 60\%
   friction force reduction. A ``stick-slip{''} contact model associated
   with horn kinematics is presented for simulation and analysis purposes.
   The model accurately matches the experiments for normal loads under 120

   The influence of the arrangement of fibres, the volume fraction of

   means of FEM. The behaviour of the composite is investigated in order to
   determine if auxetic reinforcement improves rigidity and indentation

Abstract = {{Upon defining two types of semi-auxetic solids directional and
   positional semi-auxetic solids this chapter develops the elastic
   properties of a directional semi-auxetic solid based on a combined
   hexagonal and re-entrant honeycomb structure and the 3D kinematic
   characteristics of another directional semi-auxetic solid based on
   rotating units. This is followed by an analysis and proposed fabrication
   methods of directional semi-auxetic yarns. An analysis is then given for
   a functionally-graded beam from positive Poisson's ratio on one surface
   to a negative Poisson's ratio on the opposite surface. Finally analyses
   are given for the mechanical properties of positional semi-auxetic
   structures in the form of compound rods and sandwich structures. Results
   for positional semi-auxetic structures show that the extent of
   auxeticity depends not only on the auxeticity of the constituent
   structures and the relative volume fractions, but also on the modes of
   deformation, i.e. these structures exhibit overall conventional
   properties under one type of loading mode, but overall auxetic
   properties under a different type of loading mode.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials become thicker rather than thinner when stretched,
   exhibiting an unusual negative Poisson's ratio well suited for designing
   shape transforming metamaterials. Current auxetic designs, however, are
   often monostable and cannot maintain the transformed shape upon load
   removal. Here, inspired by ancient geometric motifs arranged in square
   and triangular grids, we introduce a class of switchable architected
   materials exhibiting simultaneous auxeticity and structural bistability.
   The material concept is experimentally realized by perforating various
   cut motifs into a sheet of rubber, thus creating a network of rotating
   units connected with compliant hinges. The metamaterial performance is
   assessed through mechanical testing and accurately predicted by a
   coherent set of finite element simulations. A discussion on a rich set
   of mechanical phenomena follows to shed light on the main design
   principles governing bistable auxetics. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Metamaterials that exhibit negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) are known as
   auxetics. They laterally expand or contract when they are axially
   tensioned or compressed. A re-entrant chiral auxetic structure (RCA) is
   a recently developed structure, which combines the topological features
   of re- entrant and chiral honeycombs. Comparative study between the RCA
   structure and popular benchmarks subjected to uniaxial compression has
   been conducted experimentally and numerically. Specimens have been
   fabricated from polyamide12 (PA12) using Multi Jet Fusion (MJF).
   Numerical models have been developed using ABAQUS/Explicit and verified
   by the experiments. The experimental measurements manifest the high
   accuracy of the MJF process to produce robust components with precise
   details. It has been found that the RCA structure outperforms the other
   types of honeycombs in terms of strength and specific energy absorption
   when loaded in the Y direction, while only the tetrachiral honeycomb
   surpasses the RCA structure in terms of specific energy absorption when
   loaded in the X direction. The auxeticity (NPR) of the RCA structure
   compressed in the Y direction was larger than that of the other
   honeycombs. Numerical models have been employed to study the effects of
   friction and the number of cells on the mechanical response of the RCA
   structure.}},

Title = {{Mechanical properties of a hybrid auxetic metamaterial and metastructure
   system}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF REINFORCED PLASTICS AND COMPOSITES}},
Abstract = {{We propose in this work an innovative hybrid auxetic metamaterial with a
   centersymmetric unit cell and tessellation topology similar to the one
   provided by the missing rib configuration. The tessellation proposed is
   applied to different core unit cells (star shape, cross-chiral shape
   with same dimensions, and reentrant). The effects of the geometric
   parameters of the cells on the in-plane mechanical properties of this
   hybrid auxetic metamaterial system are investigated via finite elements
   (FEMs). Representative unit cells (RUCs) with optimal mechanical
   behaviors are identified; those configurations exhibit the larger
   negative Poisson's ratios and enhanced specific moduli. Designs related
   to two groups of auxetic metastructures with cylindric and cubic shapes
   are then developed based on the optimized RUCs along x and y directions.
   The equivalent mechanical performance of these metastructures under
   internal pressure is evaluated from a numerical standpoint. Auxetic
   cylindrical metastructures can be tailored by adjusting the number of
   the optimized RUCs along the circumferential and longitudinal
   directions, together with the geometric parameters of the optimized RUC
   itself. These hybrid auxetic metamaterials and metastructures provide
   the potential for multifunctional applications in biomechanics, flexible
   electronics, and aerospace.}},

Abstract = {{Iron-gallium alloy (galfenol) is a body centered cubic (BCC)
   magnetostrictive alloy that, like many other BCC metals, is auxetic in
   the < 110 >\{100\} directions. For compositions of 12-33 at.\% gallium,
   Poisson ratio (nu) values as low as -0.7 are observed along these
   directions in response to a uniaxial elastic force (tensile tests,
   resonant ultrasound spectroscopy, etc.). In 2014, Raghunath and Flatau
   first reported that galfenol also exhibits positive strain in both these
   directions when the uniaxial force applied along the < 110 >\{100\}
   directions is provided solely by a magnetic field, i.e., with no
   external mechanical/elastic force or stress being applied to the alloy
   {[}Raghunath and Flatau, IEEE Trans. Magn. 50(11), 1-4 (2014)]. The
   observed response is a result of the intrinsic, atomic-scale,
   bi-directionally coupled magnetoelastic properties of these alloys. In
   this paper, we advance the understanding of the intrinsic atomic-scale
   magnetoelastic coupling of the alloy that leads to the observed
   magnetoelastic auxetic-like behavior by presenting simulations developed
   based on density functional theory, which we show match the experimental
   findings and energy-based simulations. The elastic anisotropy and the
   electronic mechanisms that lead to magnetoelastic auxetic-like behavior
   in galfenol are discussed. (C) 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA,

Abstract = {{The drilling-related geomechanics requires a better understanding of the
   encountered formation properties such as poroelastic parameters. This
   paper shows set of laboratory results of the dynamic Young's modulus,
   Poisson's ratio, and Biot's coefficient for dry and water-saturated
   Istebna sandstone samples under a series of confining pressure
   conditions at two different temperatures. The predicted results from
   Wyllie's equation were compared to the measured ones in order to show
   the effect of saturation on the rock weakening. A negative correlation
   has been identified between Poisson's ratio, Biot's coefficient and
   confining pressure, while a positive correlation between confining
   pressure and Young's modulus. The predicted dynamic poroelastic rock
   properties using the P-wave value from Wyllie's equation are different
   from measured ones. It shows the important influence of water saturation
   on rock strength, which is confirmed by unconfined compressive strength
   measurement. Linear equations have been fitted for the laboratory data
   and are useful for the analysis of coupled stress and pore pressure
   effects in geomechanical problems. Such results are useful for many
   drilling applications especially in evaluation of such cases as wellbore

Abstract = {{Macroscopic elastic properties of sintered, randomly packed balloons are
   estimated for various degrees of sintering and for a wide range of
   balloon wall thickness. Macroscopic elastic moduli are little affected
   by a balloon's inner/outer diameter ratio for thicker balloons, while
   those of thinner balloons are very sensitive to the ratio. The elastic
   moduli rapidly decline with decreasing wall thickness. They are larger
   in the direction of gravity than in the horizontal one, corresponding to
   gravity-affected packing structures. Specific elastic moduli have a peak
   against porosity. Poisson's ratios are negative in some cases of very
   thin balloon walls and very low sintering degree. Comparison of the
   present random packing with the regular simple cubic packing reveals
   that there is a significant difference between them in their elastic
   properties and their structures of anisotropy, although both have almost

Abstract = {{This paper illustrates various dynamic characteristics of open cell
   compliant polyurethane foam with auxetic (negative Poisson's ratio)
   behaviour. The foam is obtained from off-the-shelf open cell
   polyurethane grey foam with a manufacturing process based on mechanical
   deformation on a mould in a temperature-controlled oven. The Poisson's
   ratio is measured with an image processing technique based on edge
   detection with wavelet methods. Foam samples have been tested in a
   viscoelastic analyser tensile test machine to determine the Young's
   modulus and loss factor for small dynamic strains. The same samples have
   also been tested in an acoustic impedance tube to measure acoustic
   absorption and specific acoustic resistance and reactance with a
   transmissibility technique. Another set of tests has been set up on a
   cam plastometer machine for constant strain rate dynamic crushing
   analysis. All the tests have been carried out on auxetic and normal foam
   samples to provide a comparison between the two types of cellular
   solids. The results from the experimental tests are discussed and
   interpreted using microstructure models for cellular materials existing
   in the literature. The negative Poisson's ratio foam presented in this
   paper shows an overall superiority regarding damping and acoustic
   properties compared to the original conventional foam. Its dynamic
   crushing performance is also significantly superior to the normal foam,
   suggesting a possible use in structural integrity compliant elements.}},

Title = {{Behavior of auxetic structures under compression and impact forces}},
Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2018}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{In recent years, various auxetic material structures have been designed
   and fabricated for diverse applications that utilize normal materials
   that follow Hooke's law but still show the properties of negative
   Poisson's ratios (NPR). One potential application is body protection
   pads that are comfortable to wear and effective in protecting body parts
   by reducing impact force and preventing injuries in high-risk
   individuals such as elderly people, industrial workers, law enforcement
   and military personnel, and athletes. This paper reports an integrated
   theoretical, computational, and experimental investigation conducted for
   typical auxetic materials that exhibit NPR properties. Parametric 3D CAD
   models of auxetic structures such as re-entrant hexagonal cells and
   arrowheads were developed. Then, key structural characteristics of
   protection pads were evaluated through static analyses of FEA models.
   Finally, impact analyses were conducted through dynamic simulations of
   FEA models to validate the results obtained from the static analyses.
   Efforts were also made to relate the individual and/or combined effect
   of auxetic structures and materials to the overall stiffness and
   shock-absorption performance of the protection pads. An advanced
   additive manufacturing (3D printing) technique was used to build
   prototypes of the auxetic structures. Three different materials
   typically used for fused deposition modeling technology, namely
   polylactic acid (PLA) and thermoplastic polyurethane material (NinjaFlex
   (R) and SemiFlex (R)), were used for different stiffness and
   shock-absorption properties. The 3D printed prototypes were then tested
   and the results were compared to the computational predictions. The
   results showed that the auxetic material could be effective in reducing
   the shock forces. Each structure and material combination demonstrated
   unique structural properties such as stiffness, Poisson's ratio, and
   efficiency in shock absorption. Auxetic structures showed better shock
   absorption performance than non-auxetic ones. The mechanism for ideal
   input force distribution or shunting could be suggested for designing
   protectors using various shapes, thicknesses, and materials of auxetic
   materials to reduce the risk of injury.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents an evaluation of the mechanical behaviour of low
   porosity, ductile auxetic structures.
   Using time-averaged speckle interferometry and a specific experimental
   set-up, the eigenmodes and displacement fields of three low-porosity
   metallic auxetic samples were assessed and compared with the numerical
   simulations obtained using the commercial software Abaqus/Standard
   (Simulia Providence, RI).
   Guided by the finite element predictions, the eigenmode analysis was
   carried out by vibrating the specimens-each characterized by a different
   pore geometry-from 100 Hz to about 10 kHz analysing the structural
   response. A good agreement between the numerical calculations and the
   experimental results was found. This study not only validates the
   numerical-experimental approach used to analyse materials, but also to
   open a way to test and validate the performances of negative Poisson's
   ratio structures and meta-materials in general applications.
   Furthermore, the findings of this work provides a new convincing and
   reliable experimental data, enlarge the knowledge about the elastic
   instabilities in metallic auxetic structures, supporting their use in

Abstract = {{Door system plays a very important role in the domain of automobile
   passive safety. In order to improve its side crashworthiness, some
   affiliated impact components are assembled. Conventional impact parts
   can make the door system possess enough stiffness and strength so as to
   ensure the integrity of car body when side collision occurs. But for
   occupant protection, the excessive rigidity may increase the risk of
   occupant injury. To address this problem, this work first introduces a
   kind of negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) structure, and proposes a novel
   door system which is composed of NPR energy-absorbing block, NPR impact
   beam, inner panel, outer panel, and reinforcing plate. Next, parameter
   sensitivity analysis for each performance index is conducted to
   determine the corresponding variables when constructing the approximate
   model. Then, aiming at the disadvantages of the Technology for Order
   Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) and the Mean Square
   Deviation Method (MSDM) in processing performance index data, a novel
   integrated weighting method is used to determine the weighting
   coefficient of each performance index. Finally, considering side
   structural crashworthiness, occupant protection, and lightweight, the
   hierarchical optimization for the novel door system is conducted to
   further enhance its overall performance. The result demonstrates that
   compared with the conventional door, the optimal door can improve the
   performance of occupant protection and ensure the side crashworthiness
   more effectively.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials exhibit the unexpected feature of becoming fatter when
   stretched and narrower when compressed, in other words, they exhibit a
   negative Poisson's ratio. This counter-intuitive behaviour imparts many
   beneficial effects on the material's macroscopic properties that make
   auxetics superior to conventional materials in many commercial
   applications. Recent research suggests that auxetic behaviour generally
   results from a cooperative effect between the material's internal
   structure (geometry setup) and the deformation mechanism it undergoes
   when submitted to a stress. Auxetic behaviour is also known to be
   scale-independent, and thus, the same geometry/deformation mechanism may
   operate at the macro-, micro- and nano- (molecular) level. A
   considerable amount of research has been focused on the `re-entrant
   honeycomb structure' which exhibits auxetic behaviour if deformed
   through hinging at the joints or flexure of the ribs, and it was
   proposed that this `re-entrant' geometry plays an important role in
   generating auxetic behaviour in various forms of materials ranging from
   nanostructured polymers to foams. This paper discusses an alternative
   mode of deformation involving `rotating rigid units' which also results
   in negative Poisson's ratios. In its most ideal form, this mechanism may
   be constructed in two dimensions using `rigid polygons' connected
   together through hinges at their vertices. On application of uniaxial
   loads, these `rigid polygons' rotate with respect to each other to form
   a more open structure hence giving rise to a negative Poisson's ratio.
   This paper also discusses the role that,rotating rigid units' are
   thought to have in various classes of materials to give rise to negative
   Poisson's ratios. (c) 2005 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH A Co. KGaA, Weinheim.}},

Abstract = {{Developments in design and technology in the engineering and medical
   fields necessitate the use of smart and high-performance materials to
   meet higher engineering specifications. The general requirements of such
   materials include a combination of high stiffness and strength with
   significant weight savings, resistance to corrosion, chemical
   resistance, low maintenance, and reduced costs. Over the last three
   decades, it has been demonstrated that auxetic materials offer a huge
   potential for the fields of engineering, natural sciences, and
   biomedical engineering, and for many other industries, including the
   aerospace and defense industries, through their unique deformation
   mechanism and measured enhancements in mechanical properties. To meet
   future engineering challenges, auxetic materials are increasingly being
   recognized as integral components of smart and advanced materials.
   Although materials with a negative Poisson's ratio have been known since
   the early 1900s, they did not capture researchers' attention until the
   late 1980s. Since 1991, these materials have been known as auxetic
   materials. Since then, their benefits and applications have been
   expanded to all major classes of materials such as metals, ceramics,
   polymers, and composites, and they are also now being used in
   engineering applications. The goal of this review was to present the
   development of auxetic polymers, which were first fabricated in the form
   of polyurethane foam approximately three decades ago and are now used in
   the fabrication of non-woven nano/micropolymeric structures. This review
   could provide useful information for the future development of auxetic

   be tuned from positive to negative(the minimum can reach -1.05). Samples
   with identical geometric variables were fabricated via 3D printing, and
   their Poisson's ratios were measured and compared with the ones from

Abstract = {{Auxetic structures, due to their negative Poisson's ratios, should have
   a positive effect on the comfort of using seating furniture. The aim of
   this study was to develop numerical models of auxetic compression
   springs suitable for seat structures of office and home furniture.
   Analyses were conducted on real and numerical models of different spring
   structures having concave cell walls, subjected to uniaxial compression.
   By changing the modulus of elasticity for the material of the frame and
   geometry of the internal structure non-linear characteristics of
   rigidity and negative Poisson's ratios were established for designed
   springs. Based on numerical calculations structures best adapted to
   provide functionality for to the seats of resting and work furniture

Abstract = {{Hydrogenation is a viable approach in transforming two-dimensional (2D)
   nanosheets into three-dimensional (3D) nanoarchitectures. The present
   work reported self-folding of 2D graphene into 3D graphene Miura origami
   assisted by hydrogenation, and studied its Poisson's ratio under
   external strain using molecular dynamics simulation and continuum
   modeling. It was found that the graphene Miura origami possesses
   negative Poisson's ratio, being largely insensitive to the chirality of
   the folding creases and side lengths of the constituting parallelograms.
   We further demonstrated the good agreement of Poisson's ratio between
   the continuum prediction and MD simulation, and identified the origin of
   their deviation as localized stress concentration at the quad-junction
   of the graphene Miura origami. The present study provides insights into
   designing novel 3D nanoarchitectures of programmable functionalities

Abstract = {{In order to study the deformation behavior of double arrowhead (DAH)
   auxetic metamaterials under different forces with different directions
   as well as the effects of the geometry parameters on the Poisson's
   ratio, this paper assembled an advanced researching method by combining
   the industrial design of SolidWorks software, the finite element
   analysis of Abaqus software and three-dimensional printed technology.
   Results show that the DAH structure expanded in the direction
   perpendicular to the force first and contracted with the strain
   increasing when it was pulled by the uniaxial force, no matter which
   direction the force is applied. Besides, the auxetic effect of the DAH
   structure under the tensile force in the X direction is longer than that
   under the tensile force in the Y direction. It is more resistant to
   compression when the DAH structure is subjected to transverse tensile
   forces than when it is subjected to longitudinal tensile forces. The
   angle of the V-shaped short truss has a significant impact on the
   negative Poisson's ratio of the DAH structure, while the angle of the
   V-shaped long truss angle has little influence on its auxetic
   performance. Specifically, the smaller the angles, the better the
   auxetic effect.}},

Abstract = {{The dynamic response of cylindrical sandwich panels with aluminum foam
   core, hexagonal honeycomb core, and auxetic honeycomb core are compared
   numerically. A novel curved auxetic honeycomb core is designed, and the
   finite element models are built by employing ABAQUS-Explicit. To
   calibrate the numerical models, the experiments of sandwich panels with
   honeycomb core and aluminum foam cores are modeled. And the numerical
   results have a good agreement with the experiment date. The calibrated
   numerical models are used to simulate the dynamic response of
   cylindrical panels subject to external blast loadings. It is found that
   the cylindrical panels with auxetic honeycomb cores have a better
   performance than that with aluminum foam cores and hexagonal honeycomb
   cores in resisting blast loadings. A material concentration effect was
   observed in the auxetic honeycomb core due to the negative Poisson's
   ratio (NPR) effect. According to parameter studies, it is concluded that
   with the increase of curvature and face sheet thickness the
   blast-resistance of panels with both auxetic honeycomb core, hexagonal
   honeycomb core, and foam cores increased obviously, especially the
   panels with auxetic honeycomb cores. For the panels with auxetic
   honeycomb cores, increasing the back face sheet thickness can improve
   the blast-resistance performance more efficiently than increasing the
   thickness of front face sheet, which is opposite for the panels with
   foam cores and hexagonal honeycomb cores. Auxetic cores with a smaller
   unit cell aspect ratio and a smaller unit cell length ratio has a larger
   Poisson's ratio, and achieves better blast resistance performance. These
   simulation findings can guide well the theoretical study and optimal
   design of cylindrical sandwich structures subject to external blast
   loading. (C) 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic foams have a variety of unique properties due to their negative
   Poisson ratio such as high energy absorption and fracture toughness for
   applications such as sports safety equipment, packing material, and shoe
   soles. The viscoelastic behavior of this relatively new material has not
   been extensively studied and modeled. Better knowledge of the
   viscoelastic behavior over a broad range of deformation rates is
   critical when considering the mechanical properties of the material.
   Previous modeling for positive Poisson ratio materials has been
   completed successfully to characterize the behavior. This same modeling
   was applied to auxetic foams with less success. The influence of
   nonlinear compressibility effects greatly improved calibration and
   prediction. Model simulations across several orders of magnitude in
   deformation rates are validated against data. All results are
   statistically validated using maximum entropy methods to obtain
   posterior densities for the hyperelastic and fractional order
   parameters. Importantly, a maximum entropy algorithm is used such that
   heterogeneous data can be fused to inform and validate the model and
   quantify its uncertainty.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic structures and materials expand laterally when stretched. It has
   been argued that this property could be applied in the design of smart
   filters with tunable sieving properties. This work analyses the
   filtration properties of a class of auxetic structures which achieve
   their auxeticity through a rotating rigid unit mechanism, an archetypal
   mechanism known to be responsible for this behavior in a number of
   crystalline materials. In particular, mathematical expressions are
   derived for the space coverage of networks constructed from a variety of
   quadrilaterals, as well as the pore radius. The latter is indicative of
   the particle size that can pass through when the particle dimension is
   comparable to the pore size, whereas the space coverage is indicative of
   the rate of flow when the particles are of a much smaller dimension than
   the pore size. The expressions suggest that these systems offer a wide
   range of pore sizes and space coverages, both of which can be controlled
   through the way that the units are connected to each other, their shape
   and the angle between them.}},

Title = {{Fatigue performance of auxetic meta-biomaterials}},
Journal = {{ACTA BIOMATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{126}},
Pages = {{511-523}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Meta-biomaterials offer a promising route towards the development of
   life-lasting implants. The concept aims to achieve solutions that are
   ordinarily impossible, by offering a unique combination of mechanical,
   mass transport, and biological properties through the optimization of
   their small-scale geometrical and topological designs. In this study, we
   primarily focus on auxetic meta-biomaterials that have the extraordinary
   ability to expand in response to axial tension. This could potentially
   improve the longstanding problem of implant loosening, if their
   performance can be guaranteed in cyclically loaded conditions. The
   high-cycle fatigue performance of additively manufactured (AM) auxetic
   meta-biomaterials made from commercially pure titanium (CP-Ti) was
   therefore studied. Small variations in the geometry of the reentrant
   hexagonal honeycomb unit cell and its relative density resulted in
   twelve different designs (relative density: similar to 5-45\%,
   re-entrant angle = 10-25 degrees, Poisson's ratio = -0.076 to -0.504).
   Micro-computed tomography, scanning electron microscopy and mechanical
   testing were used to respectively measure the morphological and
   quasi-static properties of the specimens before proceeding with
   compression-compression fatigue testing. These auxetic meta-biomaterials
   exhibited morphological and mechanical properties that are deemed
   appropriate for bone implant applications (elastic modulus = 66.3-5648
   MPa, yield strength = 1.4-46.7 MPa, pore size = 1.3-2.7 mm). With an
   average maximum stress level of 0.47 sigma(y) at 10(6) cycles (range:
   0.35 sigma(y)sigma(y) - 0.82 sigma(y)sigma(y)), the auxetic structures
   characterized here are superior to many other non-auxetic
   meta-biomaterials made from the same material. The optimization of the
   printing process and the potential application of post-processing
   treatments could improve their performance in cyclically loaded settings
   even further.
   Statement of Significance
   Auxetic meta-biomaterials have a negative Poisson's ratio and,
   therefore, expand laterally in response to axial tension. Recently, they
   have been found to restore bone-implant contact along the lateral side
   of a hip stem. As a result, the bone will be compressed along both of
   the implant's contact lines, thereby actively reducing the risk of
   implant failure. In this case the material will be subjected to cyclic
   loading, for which no experimental data has been reported yet. Here, we
   present the first ever study of the fatigue performance of additively
   manufactured auxetic meta-biomaterials based on the re-entrant hexagonal
   honeycomb. These results will advance the adoption of auxetic
   meta-biomaterials in load-bearing applications, such as the hip stem, to
   potentially improve implant longevity. (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published

Abstract = {{Implications of the negative Poisson ratio with regard to the
   quasi-static and dynamic indentation compliances for isotropic
   homogeneous materials are considered. It has been shown that analogously
   to some solutions for three-dimensional stress or displacement fields
   concentrations, the indentation, vibrational, and impact compliances are
   significantly affected when Poisson's ratio of the material assumes
   negative values. It was observed that the friction at the contact
   interface between the indenter and the surface of an elastic medium
   strengthens the negative Poisson ratio effect. In the Hertzian contact
   problem, it was found out that the location of the maximum shear stress
   approaches the contact interface as Poisson's ratio is made sufficiently
   negative. In view of this fact, the local indentation of a coated
   elastic half-space, which is reinforced with an elastic plate, has been
   considered. It was shown that the reinforcement preserves the negative
   Poisson ratio effect, and the perfect bonding of the plate to the
   surface of an auxetic half-space significantly strengthens it. This
   theoretical work be considered as a first step towards an indentation
   and impact analysis of real auxetic materials. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Volume = {{132}},
Pages = {{874-884}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{We propose compliant cellular material (CCM), a mechanical metamaterial,
   with compliant porous structure (CPS) generated from a modified
   hexagonal topology. The objective of this study is to explore the
   synthesis of three-dimensional (3D) CCMs with CPSes and to understand
   the mechanical behaviors of CCMs. An orthotropic constitutive model of
   CCMs is constructed using the strain energy method, which uses the
   deformation of hinges around holes and rotation of links. Nonlinear
   behavior of a finite element (FE) based simulation is conducted to
   validate the analytical model. The moduli and yield strains of the 3D
   CCMs with an aluminum alloy are about 1.2 GPa and 0.4\% in the
   longitudinal direction and about 0.08 MPa and 30\% in the lateral
   direction. The CCMs have extremely high positive and negative Poisson's
   ratios (v(xy){*} similar to +/- 30) due to the large rotation of the
   link member in the transverse direction caused by an input displacement
   in the longitudinal direction. This paper demonstrates that compliant
   mesostructures can be used for next generation's mechanical
   metamaterials design in tailoring mechanical properties such as modulus,
   strength, yield strain, and Poisson's ratios. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In theory, a negative Poisson's ratio (i.e. auxetie) material has
   improved hardness, impact resistance, fracture toughness, and shear
   modulus over one with a positive Poisson's ratio and comparable
   stiffness. These enhanced properties make them attractive candidates for
   a wide range of applications, including ones in the biomedical industry.
   Over the past two decades there has been increasing interest in auxetie
   materials leading to the discovery and development of new auxetic
   materials at the micro- and macro-scales. It has been reported in the
   literature that some human trabecular bone is auxetic; however
   verification of this claim and measurement of the,Poisson's ratio of
   biological materials remains a challenge. This research need is the
   motivation for the current work.
   The central research objective of this project is to develop an approach
   to gain fundamental insight into the geometric characteristics of
   auxetic open cell materials by studying the underpinning mechanics
   behind the transition from positive to negative Poisson's ratio that
   takes place when open-cell foam is compressed and heat treated. The
   approach involves detailed image analysis and finite element modeling of
   the microstructure of polyurethane foam, which is commonly used as a
   test material to model the structure of human cancellous bone. By
   studying both conventional and auxetie foam, and the process by which
   conventional foams are transformed to auxetic, we seek to identify the
   critical features of auxetic open-cell structures. The results will lead
   to a better understanding of auxetic cellular materials in general, and
   will be used to develop a framework for use in determining the
   mechanical properties and potential auxeticity of human trabecular bone
   and to aid in the design of synthetic auxetic biomaterials. In this
   paper we report on preliminary results of our modeling efforts.}},

Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{234}},
Month = {{MAY 1}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, a work to improve to the auxetic re-entrant cell is
   reported. This work aims to conserve the negative or zero Poisson?s
   ratio feature of the classical re-entrant cell with no degradation while
   amplifying the in-plane elastic moduli. To develop and control the
   stiffness of the cell a new cell was created using a circular wall
   element in the middle of the classical re-entrant cell. The analytical
   expressions of the new re-entrant cell were derived and validated by
   finite element models. Derived analytical expressions of this work can
   be used to model the classical cell. Using this feature, validation of
   analytical and numerical models of this work is also provided with a
   classical cell?s experimental works reported in the literature. In the
   linear region, both the analytical and the finite element models match
   very closely with the literature experiments. Because of the highly
   non-linearity of the re-entrant structures, after the linear
   examination, this work was expanded to model the non-linear behaviour of
   both the classical and new cells numerically. Literature experiments
   also verify the non-linear finite element models of this work in means
   of the classical re-entrant cell?s results. Detailed design graphs are
   given for tuning the rigidity and negative Poisson?s ratios. The
   presented new design in this paper grants an extra rigidity while
   providing the same negative Poisson?s ratios with those of the classical
   cells.}},

   study the variation of Poisson ratio of the model as the function of
   model parameters in single-crystal and poly-crystal states. The role of
   the rotational degrees of freedom pertaining to the finite size

Abstract = {{Double-arrowed auxetic (DAA) structures with a negative Poisson's ratio
   have recently drawn increasing attention. This paper deduces the
   empirical formula of critical impact velocity to characterize the
   deformation modes of the DAA structures in two in-plane directions. A
   method is proposed to construct a theoretical model for predicting the
   dynamic crushing strength of DAA structure. The theoretical model is
   validated by numerical results to be sufficiently accurate to predict
   the dynamic crushing strength. It is also found that the dynamic
   crushing strength is only related to the relative density and impact
   velocity. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, as the development of additive manufacturing
   technology, 3D negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) materials attract many
   researchers' interest. In this paper, a novel 3D NPR material design
   method based on the tension-twist coupling effect has been proposed. A
   novel category of 3D NPR and positive Poisson's ratio (PPR) materials by
   linking multilayer 2D NPR materials through 3D chiral chains are
   proposed. The sign of the Poisson's ratio depends on the linkage pattern
   of the 3D chiral chain. Based on this method, 11 types of novel 3D NPR
   and PPR materials are presented. Experimental and numerical methods are
   adopted to study the mechanical properties of the proposed novel 3D NPR
   and PPR materials. Results show that the novel 3D materials present
   desirable NPR and PPR as we expected, which proved the effectiveness of
   the proposed design method.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents innovative work undertaken to evaluate the auxetic
   composite materials developed using weft-knitted fabrics with negative
   Poisson's ratio (NPR) produced from high-tenacity filaments of
   para-aramid (p-AR) and polyamide. The aim of this study is to develop
   polymeric composite materials reinforced with auxetic knitted fabrics
   and to evaluate the degree of transference of the auxetic behavior from
   the fibrous reinforcement to the composite produced. The results show
   that the NPR values remained in the composites. Regardless of the type
   of resin used, either epoxy or polyester, the highest values were
   obtained for samples produced with p-AR auxetic knitted fabrics. The NPR
   composites developed within this work present great potential for
   applications in industrial areas, including personal protection
   products, such as bulletproof vests, helmets, knee, and elbow
   protectors, and in all other areas where energy absorption is a key
   factor to be considered.}},

Abstract = {{So far, negative Poisson's ratio foam (auxetic foam) is usually prepared
   by the transformation of conventional polymer foam, and it is a
   challenge to prepare auxetic foam directly from polymer resin. In this
   work, a novel method based on the synergism between the phase transition
   of water and the permeability rate difference of the CO2 blowing agent
   from air in the foaming process is put forward to prepare auxetic foam
   directly from the polymer resin. Using this method, herein, nylon
   elastomer (NE) foam with auxetic behavior is successfully prepared from
   NE resin by a one-pot CO2 foaming method inside an autoclave aided by
   water; the obtained auxetic foam has a Poisson's ratio value of -1.29
   and has excellent tensile cycle stability and energy absorption
   performance. This method breaks through the bottleneck for preparing
   auxetic foams from the polymer resin directly, which is also green and
   environment-friendly. It is believed that the abovementioned method also
   applies to other thermoplastic polymers, which paves a way for designing
   and preparing multifunctional auxetic foam materials in the future via a
   one-pot CO2 foaming process. Furthermore, this work first demonstrates
   that the transformation between auxetic foam and positive Poisson's
   ratio foam is reversible due to the closed cell structure, which
   provides an opportunity to reversibly adjust the performance and the
   shape of polymer foam materials.}},

Abstract = {{Vibration study is of great practical importance, as vibration of
   continuous systems with constraints implies cyclic stresses and the
   inevitable fatigue damage. This chapter on vibration forms the first
   part of elastodynamics of auxetic solids, with special emphasis on
   plates (both circular and rectangular) as well as shells (both
   cylindrical and spherical). For circular plates with free and simply
   supported edges, the frequency parameter changes more rapidly in the
   auxetic region than in the conventional region; consequently the natural
   vibration frequencies of these plates can be effectively reduced by
   choosing auxetic materials. For rectangular plates, the effect of
   negative Poisson's ratio is evaluated for plates with all four sides and
   two sides being simply supported, as well as examples of rectangular
   plates with three sides being simply supported. In the case of
   cylindrical shells with simply supported edges, the results of frequency
   study imply that, when expressed in terms of flexural rigidity, the
   frequency is independent from the cylindrical shell radius at extreme
   auxetic behavior for isotropic case. In the case of spherical isotropic
   shells, the natural frequency diminishes as the Poisson's ratio of the
   shell material approaches 1 at constant flexural rigidity and at
   constant shear modulus. Finally, advanced topics on vibration damping,
   vibration transmissibility and acoustics of auxetic solids and
   structures are briefly reviewed.}},

Abstract = {{Materials with a negative Poisson's ratio have been modelled largely by
   regular 2D networks. These models represent the conceptual features of
   the microscale of materials with a negative Poisson's ratio. To date
   they do not reflect the detail or exact structure of any known auxetic
   material. In this paper, 2D materials have been constructed whose
   microstructure is represented exactly by the auxetic models. These
   materials are subjected to an axial strain and the measured Poisson's
   ratio is compared to the predictions by the models. The models are also
   amended to fit better the observed deformation within the 2D materials.
   The models are found to predict some behaviour reasonably well but only
   when model parameters are measured from the experimental data. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{Mechanical properties of the PdSe2 monolayer are calculated by using
   first-principles calculations. By adding uniaxial strain along x- and
   y-directions, our results show that the negative Poisson's ratio (NPR)
   can be observed in the Two Dimensional (2D) puckered structure of PdSe2
   monolayer. The occurrence of the NPR is directly caused by the fact that
   the decrease of Se-Se bond is larger than the increase of Se-Pd-Se bond
   when compressing the lattice along the x-direction. Our calculations
   exhibit that the electronic locality of Se-Se bond is strong and the
   orbit of the Se atom in the Se-Se bond has changed significantly.
   Consequently, our calculated results indicate that monolayer PdSe2 will
   have many potential applications in nanoelectronics and
   microelectromechanical devices.}},

Abstract = {{Although most materials used in practice possess positive Poisson's
   ratio in the range 0 to 1/2, there has been increasing number of auxetic
   materials being developed and investigated. The counter-intuitive
   property of auxetic materials opens up the possibility of solids and
   structures that behave in ways that have been overlooked in the past but
   are nevertheless consistent with physical laws. This article
   investigates how the auxeticity of a plate material influences the
   stresses and moments arising from lateral loads. Using classical plate
   theories, the optimal Poisson's ratio of simply supported rectangular
   plates under lateral loads are obtained on the basis of (a) stress
   minimization from the maximum bending and shearing stresses, and (b)
   moment minimization from the maximum bending and twisting moments.
   Results from stress minimization shows that the optimal Poisson's ratio
   is strongly influenced by the relative plate thickness and plate aspect
   ratio. Using the example of a simply supported rectangular plate under
   sinusoidal load, the optimal Poisson's ratio becomes more negative for
   higher aspect ratio. In addition, the optimal Poisson's ratio becomes
   more negative, until a limit of -1 is reached, for decreasing relative
   plate thickness. Results from moment minimization reveal that the
   optimal Poisson's ratio is strongly influenced by the load distribution.
   For a square plate, the optimal Poisson's ratio is a negative value if
   the load distribution is more concentrated than a sinusoidal load or if
   the central square patch of uniform load takes up less than 43\% of the
   plate area. These results suggest the usefulness of auxetic materials
   for lowering the stresses and moments in rectangular plates under most
   loading conditions.}},

   expansion enabled by ultrasonic additive manufacturing: Modeling,
   manufacturing, and testing}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{223}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{In aerospace applications, variations of temperature caused by changing
   environmental conditions or generation of heat is a common problem. The
   resulting thermal strains cause separation and alignment errors in
   optical systems, and stresses due to mismatches of thermal expansion at
   material interfaces cause failure of components and structures. Because
   minimizing weight, cost, and lead time are also critical requirements,
   lightweight, easily machined metals are attractive for aerospace
   applications, but these materials all have substantial coefficients of
   thermal expansion. Previous work has shown that the superposition of two
   metals with dissimilar coefficients of thermal expansion in periodic
   cellular configurations can result in a composite material with zero
   effective thermal expansion. However, fabrication of these material
   architectures typically is either impossible or requires manual
   assembly. Here, we propose methods to design and fabricate cellular
   metal composites with tunable thermal expansion and optimized specific
   stiffness that can be manufactured at useful scales entirely with
   automated methods. Samples were manufactured with ultrasonic additive
   manufacturing and computer-controlled machining, and thermal expansion
   was measured optically. The results demonstrate the practical
   fabrication of cellular metal composites with zero or negative thermal
   expansion in one direction, tunable thermal expansion in a second
   direction, and structural performance indices competitive with the
   indices of conventional aerospace alloys.}},

Abstract = {{Hard homonuclear dimers, each consisting of two identical and tangent
   hard disks, exhibit a thermodynamically stable, aperiodic solid phase,

   determined by the box fluctuation Monte Carlo method in the NpT
   ensemble. The computed elastic constants are well described by the free
   volume approximation and the coefficients of the leading singularities
   are estimated in the close packing limit. Three mechanisms decreasing
   Poisson's ratio are indicated: one is based on increasing the pressure
   to temperature ratio, another comes from the constrains imposed on the
   disks forming a dimer, yet another, working in the close packing limit,
   arises from molecular motions. It is also shown that Poisson's ratio
   increases with increasing concentration of vacancies. (c) 2006 Elsevier

Journal = {{DIAMOND AND RELATED MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{111}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Graphene aerogel (GA) is a promising candidate for energy absorption
   purposes because of its very low density, high specific surface area and
   porous structure. GA samples, prepared by the Sol-Gel method, were
   tested under quasi-static compression, and characterized via surface
   area analyzer, as well as scanning electron microscopy and transmission
   electron microscopy. The results show that 98\% (and above) porous GA
   samples, whose elastic modulus is 2.9 MPa, can support at least 35,000
   times its weight. Scaling analysis shows that the mechanical properties
   of GA are superior to those of conventional polymeric open-cell foams.
   The GA samples exhibit a negative structural Poisson's ratio under the
   uniaxial compression test, which is most likely due to the bread-like
   microstructural evolution. Due to the mesopores of the GA sample as well
   as the negative structural Poisson's ratio, the GA has considerable
   toughness.}},

Abstract = {{While the rule of mixture is applicable for addressing the overall
   Poisson's ratio of a concentrically aligned bi-layered rod under
   longitudinal loading, the same cannot be said for this rod under
   torsional loading due to the higher extent of deformation in the rod
   material further away from the torsional axis. In addition, the use of
   adhesives for attaching the solid inner rod to the hollow outer rod
   introduces an intermediate layer, thereby resulting in a tri-layered
   concentric rod if the adhesive layer is uniformly distributed. This
   paper investigates the effect of the adhesive properties on the overall
   auxeticity of a rod consisting of two concentrically aligned cylindrical
   isotropic foams with Poisson's ratio of opposite signs under torsional
   loads. An indirect way for obtaining Poisson's ratio of a concentrically
   tri-layered rod was obtained using a mechanics of materials approach.
   Results show that the auxeticity of such rods is influenced by the
   adhesive's stiffness, Poisson's ratio, thickness, and radius from the

Abstract = {{The mechanical behavior of a two-dimensional structure with negative
   Poisson` s ratio (auxetic structure) was experimentally studied. The
   concave hexagon (re-entrant honeycomb) with straight sides is often an
   element of auxetic structures. In this paper, a new design of a concave
   hexagon in which a part of straight elements is replaced with
   curvilinear elements is suggested. The sample (110 x 20 x 0.7 mm plate
   with the central part of 26.2 x 20 x 0.7 mm) was made by the laser
   cutting method from nonauxetic polyethyleneterephthalate (PET-a
   amorphous) plates. The transverse size of elements of hexagons is equal
   to sample thickness. The sample was subjected to a monotonous uniaxial
   tension until the last moment when it still maintained its planarity. As
   a result of experimental data processing the tensile force -
   displacement diagram was calculated. Variability of Poisson` s ratio
   depending on engineering deformations was studied. The analysis showed
   that auxetic structure at tension attained the maximum longitudinal
   deformation (before loss of stability) of 99 \%, and the maximum
   transverse deformation of 59 \%. Elastic deformations reached 2 \%.
   Poisson's ratio defined by analogy with elastic small deformations
   varies in the range from -0.19 to -0.60 with an increase of longitudinal
   and transverse deformations.}},

Abstract = {{Many models describing the deformation of general foam or auxetic
   materials are based on the assumption of homogeneity and order within
   the materials. However, non-uniform heterogeneity is often an inherent

   the porous PVA hydrogels with internal inby-concave pores (IICP) or
   interconnected pores (ICP) were designed and processed. The deformation
   of the PVA hydrogels under compression was tested and their Poisson's
   ratio was characterized. The results indicated that the size, shape and
   distribution of the pores in the hydrogel matrix had strong influence on
   the local Poisson's ratio, which varying from positive to negative at
   micro-scale. The size-dependency of their local Poisson's ratio
   reflected and quantified the uniformity and heterogeneity of the
   micro-porous structures in the PVA hydrogels. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Month = {{AUG 5}},
Abstract = {{Jounce bumpers in automotive suspension can absorb impact energy and
   improve Noise, Vibration and Harshness (NVH) performance of entire
   vehicle. In this paper, a negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) structure was
   introduced and applied on the jounce bumper. The NPR jounce bumper can
   be primarily described by few parameters and is convenient for design,
   analysis and optimization. Three NPR jounce bumper prototypes were
   manufactured and tested. The test results of prototype 1 indicated that
   the NPR jounce bumpers had excellent viscoelasticity characteristic to
   absorb impact energy owing to its high damping. Compared with
   traditional jounce bumper, the NPR jounce bumper can achieve similar
   mechanical behavior but with a smoother load-displacement curve, which
   is beneficial to the NVH performance. Moreover, numerical calculation
   was conducted. Its results were fairly reliable for the prediction of
   mechanical behavior of NPR jounce bumper. The numerical results implied
   the stress concentration areas and the displacement of failure. The
   deformation shapes of NPR jounce bumper were also discussed. Finally,
   prototypes 2 and 3 manufactured from 3D printing technology were tested
   to explore the possibility of the application of 3D printing technology

Title = {{Anisotropic elasticity drives negative thermal expansion in
   monocrystalline SnSe}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{103}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{Negative thermal expansion (NTE) materials have been at the center of
   attention for the past few decades as thermal expansion compensators in
   the fields of engineering, photonics, electronics, and medicine.
   Numerous crystalline materials exhibit NTE, wherein a combination of
   positive and negative linear thermal expansion coefficients results from
   their highly anisotropic elasticity. In this study, we selected SnSe, an
   anisotropic uniaxial NTE material as a model system where theoretical
   studies have linked its NTE along the c direction to transverse phonons
   and to positive Gruneisen parameters along all crystallographic axes.
   However, the fundamental origin of NTE in SnSe have not been
   experimentally resolved. Here we performed temperature-dependent
   resonant ultrasound spectroscopy (between 295-773 K) on
   single-crystalline SnSe to experimentally measure all nine independent
   elastic constants (C-11, C-22, C-33, C-44, C-55, C-66, C-12, C-13,
   C-23). Our data revealed a high degree of anisotropy in the
   temperature-dependent elastic constants with shear anisotropic factors
   show a contrasting pattern with increasing temperature. From this data
   we also deduced its material compressibility and negative Poisson's
   ratios in the major crystallographic directions that could explain its
   colossal linear thermal expansion coefficient along the c direction,
   reaching similar to-12 x 10(-5) K-1 at 773 K as reported in this study.
   Furthermore, we confirmed positive Gruneisen parameters along all the
   crystallographic axes and observe that SnSe behaves like a
   semicompressible parallelepiped with elastically coupled a and b axes,
   with the NTE being driven by the displacement of Sn atoms in the c
   direction.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This paper deals with the auxetic deformation behavior of periodically
   perforated aluminum sheets and their application for lightweight design.
   If commercially available metal sheets are provided with perforations,
   this can significantly change the mechanical properties of the sheets.
   For example, with certain perforation patterns, it is possible to
   achieve a negative Poisson's ratio in the sheet plane. Such material
   behavior is called auxetic. Macroscopic auxetic behavior can be
   explained by mechanisms that are based on the geometry of the
   perforation. Sheets are made of an isotropic aluminum alloy, provided
   with periodic perforation patterns and are mechanically characterized in
   tensile tests. The investigations focus on an exemplarily pattern with
   rectangular perforations leading to the auxetic behavior of the sheet.
   By means of passive thermography, highly stressed areas of the samples
   can be identified in situ and nondestructively during tests. The
   experimental results are verified in numerical simulations. The insights
   gained will help to better understand the mechanisms underlying the
   mechanical behavior of auxetically perforated sheet metal. Based on
   this, concepts for possible applications of auxetically perforated
   sheets in lightweight design can be developed for the future.}},

Abstract = {{Structural grade materials with Young's Modulus in the gigapascal range
   generally have very low damping, leading to requirement for auxiliary
   damping treatments in many applications. This article examines whether a
   high Young's Modulus and damping level can simultaneously be realized by
   introducing lossy polymeric infills into auxetic aluminum honeycombs.
   Using finite element analysis, auxetic honeycombs with varying cell
   geometry and infill stiffness, loaded in the x-and y-directions, are
   examined. From the results, it is observed that the best performance is
   achieved when auxetic honeycombs with shallow inclined walls and short
   vertical walls are loaded in the x-direction. Young's Modulus in excess
   of 10 GPa is achievable in combination with a loss factor of 5\%. If a
   higher loss factor of 10\% is required, Young's Modulus in the range of
   5.5-6.5 GPa can still be realized. The high loss factors achieved are
   attributed to the very high local strain levels in the polymeric infill
   in the central region of the cell between the top and the bottom cell
   walls, which are in close proximity, further increased by the large
   negative Poisson's ratios of the configuration.}},

Abstract = {{The human being has always been looking for optimal use of his
   surrounding materials and over the years, has managed to invent various
   structures with special properties. Lattice structures are widely used
   in various applications due to their lower weight and desirable
   compressive strength. An example of these structures is the honeycomb
   that is very popular and many studies have been done about it. A new
   type of lattice structures is auxetic structure that has negative
   Poisson's ratio due to its geometry. This characteristic has caused
   auxetic structures to have unique properties such as high shear
   strength, indentation resistance and energy absorption. Investigation of
   energy absorption of auxetic structures is a subject that has not been
   studied in researches. In this study, the ability of some auxetic
   structure for absorbing energy is investigated at quasi-static and low
   velocity impact transverse loading. Specimens with three types of
   geometries (re-entrant, arrowhead and anti-tetra chiral) are fabricated
   using additive manufacturing method (3D printing). Discussion about
   energy absorption and failure mechanisms of all three structures were
   carried out and compared in both types of loading. (C) 2019 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This study compared low strain rate material properties and impact force
   attenuation of auxetic foam and the conventional open-cell polyurethane
   counterpart. This furthers our knowledge with regards to how best to
   apply these highly conformable and breathable auxetic foams to
   protective sports equipment. Cubes of auxetic foam measuring 150 x 150 x
   150 mm were fabricated using a thermo-mechanical conversion process.
   Quasi-static compression confirmed the converted foam to be auxetic,
   prior to being sliced into 20 mm thick cuboid samples for further
   testing. Density, Poisson's ratio and the stress-strain curve were all
   found to be dependent on the position of each cuboid from within the
   cube. Impact tests with a hemispherical drop hammer were performed for
   energies up to 6 J, on foams covered with a polypropylene sheet between
   1 and 2 mm thick. Auxetic samples reduced peak force by similar to 10
   times in comparison to the conventional foam. This work has shown
   further potential for auxetic foam to be applied to protective
   equipment, while identifying that improved fabrication methods are
   required.}},

Abstract = {{Laser Freeform Fabrication allows additive manufacturing of functional
   parts from metallic powder materials. This yields potential for product
   innovations due to increased geometric degrees of freedom. Additional
   advantages are reduction of throughput time and economical manufacturing
   of small lot sizes. Hence, these processes are capable of producing
   structures of complex freeform geometry that cannot be manufactured at
   all with conventional processes {[}1]. This provides the possibility to
   manufacture designs that show a negative Poisson's ratio.. It gives the
   relation of the negative transverse strain to the longitudinal strain of
   a material exposed to uniaxial tension or compression. The longitudinal
   strain occurs in the load direction, whereas the transverse strain is
   found normal to this axis. Typically, the Poisson's ratio is greater
   than zero, i.e. in tension a material's volume can increase or remain
   constant while the behaviour in compression is vice versa. However, some
   materials can exhibit negative values between -1 and 0 meaning that they
   show unexpected behaviour by expanding transversely under tensile forces
   and vice versa under compression.
   This circumstance can be exploited in applications where parts are
   subject to compressive deformation but which are not allowed to expand
   laterally in order to not cause damage in adjacent components. Examples
   are crash impact absorbers and artificial intervertebral discs, etc.
   Experimental results were obtained from new honeycomb structures that
   were manufactured with Selective Laser Melting from stainless steel
   powder and tested in a universal testing machine under elastic,
   compressive deformation. Thus rules for successful design of honeycomb
   structures with negative Poisson's ratio were derived.}},

Abstract = {{A 2D mechanical metamaterial exhibiting perfectly auxetic behavior,
   i.e., Poisson's ratio of -1, is proposed in this paper drawing upon
   inspiration from an Islamic star formed by circumferential arrangement
   of eight squares, such as the one found at the exterior of the
   Ghiyathiyya Madrasa in Khargird, Iran (built 1438-1444 AD). Each unit of
   the metamaterial consists of eight pairs of pin-jointed Y-shaped rigid
   elements, whereby every pair of Y-elements is elastically restrained by
   a spiral spring. Upon intermediate stretching, each metamaterial unit
   resembles the north dome of Jameh Mosque, Iran (built 1087-1088 AD),
   until the attainment of the fully opened configuration, which resembles
   a structure in Agra, India, near the Taj Mahal. Both infinitesimal and
   finite deformation models of the effective Young's modulus for the
   metamaterial structure were established using strain energy approach in
   terms of the spiral spring stiffness and geometrical parameters, with
   assumptions to preserve the eight-fold symmetricity of every
   metamaterial unit. Results indicate that the prescription of strain
   raises the effective Young's modulus in an exponential manner until full
   extension is attained. This metamaterial is useful for applications
   where the overall shape of the structure must be conserved in spite of
   uniaxial application of load, and where deformation is permitted under
   limited range, which is quickly arrested as the deformation progresses.}},

Abstract = {{It is known that auxetic properties (for example, negative Poisson
   ratios, that is, when a solid experiences lateral expansion under
   stretching instead of lateral contraction) start showing themselves in
   materials where there is a certain kind of geometrical orientational
   correlations between ``rigid{''} constituents. Properly arranged
   orientational degrees of freedom of building blocks govern the
   characteristic distances in auxetic materials and thus determine the way
   in which the materials contract or expand. Very often the building
   blocks are filamentous. We suggest a way to arrange filamentous objects
   into highly interwoven regular structures which may exhibit auxetic
   properties with negative Poisson ratio. Our purely geometrical
   consideration can be extended to an irregular positional arrangement.
   This implies that a solid of sufficiently dense ``random{''}
   arrangements of filaments (for example, ``wool{''} of nanowires or of
   carbon nanotubes) may become auxetic. (C) 2007 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \&

Journal = {{THIN-WALLED STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{164}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The auxetic tubular materials have attracted wide attention owing to
   their unusual mechanical properties and potential applications in
   designing foldable devices. However, most of auxetic tubular structures
   designed by incorporating re-entrant, chiral or penetrated
   microstructures remain great challenging in stress concentration because
   of the presence of shape corners in these structures. In this study, a
   novel auxetic tubular structure is designed by incorporating the smooth
   peanut-shaped hole pattern and then is fabricated via 3D printing
   technique. Subsequently its mechanical properties and deformation
   characteristics are investigated by uniaxial compression experiments and
   finite element simulation. Results reveal that the designed tube
   exhibits significant auxetic performance under compression and the
   stress level within the structure is significantly reduced, in contrast
   to the auxetic tubular structure with orthogonal elliptical hole
   pattern. Finally, the effect of controlling parameters of the designed
   auxetic tubular structure on Poisson's ratio is studied to better
   understand its auxetic behavior and also provide tunable design of
   auxetic tubular structures.}},

Abstract = {{Two-component auxetic yarns with helical wrapping structure showed

   the deformation behavior of structure and cross section presented
   greater effect on Poisson's ratio and auxetic effect. However, the

   model with axial tension and the normal force was carried out to

   showed that the cross section of the filament was from circular shape to

Title = {{Mechanical responses of 3D cross-chiral auxetic materials under uniaxial
   compression}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{186}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic material is a metamaterial engineered to achieve negative
   Poisson's ratios through special design of microstructure. As a typical
   3D auxetic material, 3D cross-chiral structures (CCS) possesses
   significant auxetic behavior and the mechanical properties can be tuned
   over a wide range. In this paper, mechanical responses of CCS are
   systematically investigated by experiments, numerical simulations and
   theoretical analysis. Three typical failure modes are observed during
   the compression process. As the tilt angle of struts increases, the CCS
   shows a transition from the compression-dominated to the
   bending-dominated deformation mechanism. The Young's modulus of the CCS
   can be enhanced 8.5 times, simply by changing the angle of the strut by
   20 degrees. The CCS can also show a higher energy absorption capacity
   with absorption efficiency of about 50\%, which is higher than most
   previously reported cellular materials. Additionally, a new theoretical
   model based on large deformation theory is established to predict the
   plastic yield stress, and good agreement is obtained with the numerical
   simulations and experiments, which indicates that the present model can
   significantly improve the accuracy of the estimation. The results of
   this paper may be helpful for designing of energy absorbing devices and
   personal protection with 3D auxetic materials. (c) 2019 The Authors.

Abstract = {{In this study, a new vertical strut combined re-entrant auxetic
   structure was designed and its mechanical behaviors have been studied.
   An analytical model was established based on energy theorems considering
   bending, shearing and stretching. Numerical simulations and experiments
   were both carried out to confirm the validity of the analytical model
   based on beam theory. Results exhibited a good agreement between the
   refined analytical model, the numerical simulation and experimental
   study. Four deformation mechanisms were analyzed and the effect of
   deformation on the effective Poisson?s ratio (EPR) and elastic module
   were investigated. A parametric study was further performed to
   quantitatively illustrate the influences of the geometrical parameters
   on the effective elasticity properties of the designed structure. The
   results showed that the lightweight structures can significantly enhance
   the auxetic behavior and achieve a high degree of anisotropy with wide
   vertical strut lengths and internal angles compared with conventional
   re-entrant honeycomb configurations.}},

Abstract = {{To investigate the influence of auxetic behavior on thermally induced

   stress fields in locally heated three dimensional auxetic and cubic
   structures are compared. The simulations were carried out in Comsol for
   a cubic as well as a chiral array of 30 mm length in each spatial
   dimension (3 x 3 x 3 unit cells). The center cells of these arrays were
   heated for 20 s. For two boundary conditions (free and clamped),
   deformation mechanisms are analyzed. It is found, that the auxetic
   behavior can effectively reduce thermal stresses by internal node
   rotation and strut bending, especially for constrained (clamped)
   boundary conditions. A stress reduction of a factor of 3.3 in
   comparisons to a simple cubic cell array could be evaluated.}},

Title = {{Improved shear correction factors for deflection of simply supported
   very thick rectangular auxetic plates}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL AND MATERIALS ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 25}},
Abstract = {{Background: The first-order shear deformation theory (FSDT) for plates
   requires a shear correction factor due to the assumption of constant
   shear strain and shear stress across the thickness; hence, the shear
   correction factor strongly influences the accuracy of the deflection
   solution; the third-order shear deformation theory (TSDT) does not
   require a correction factor because it facilitates the change in shear
   strain across the plate thickness.
   Methods: This paper obtains an improved shear correction factor for
   simply supported very thick rectangular plates by matching the
   deflection of the Mindlin plate (FSDT) with that of the Reddy plate
   (TSDT).
   Results: As a consequence, the use of the exact shear correction factor
   for the Mindlin plate gives solutions that are exactly the same as for
   the Reddy plate.
   Conclusions: The customary adoption of 5/6 shear correction factor is a
   lower bound, and the exact shear correction factor is higher for the
   following: (a) very thick plates, (b) narrow or long plates, (c) high
   Poisson's ratio plate material, and (d) highly patterned loads, while
   the commonly used shear correction factor of 5/6 is still valid for the
   following: (i) marginally thick plates, (ii) square plates, (iii)
   negative Poisson's ratio materials, and (d) uniformly distributed
   loadings.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this research is to understand more fully the
   out-of-plane auxetic behavior of paper. In the reported research,
   initial characterization of the auxetic properties of common,
   commercially available papers is described. The results of these
   experiments suggest that the auxetic response seen in paper structures
   is related to the cellulose fiber network structure, as previously
   suggested, and is related to inter-fiber bonding and fiber organization
   in the sheet. These results also indicate that further study is needed
   to understand how materials and processing variables influence auxetic
   behavior. A mathematical model, attempting to explain auxetic response
   in an idealized arrangement of fibers is included. Ultimately, the
   fundamental understanding resulting from this research should lead to
   new product development opportunities for forest product-based paper
   materials as well as to the establishment of predictive
   structure-property relations for auxetic materials using paper as a

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a comparative analysis between the cyclic
   loading tensile behaviour of conventional and auxetic thermoplastic PU
   foams. While the two types of foam share the same base material (open
   cell PU-PE), one batch is transformed into an auxetic one (i.e.,
   negative Poisson's ratio) using a special manufacturing process
   involving moulding and exposure to particular temperature profiles to
   stabilise the transformation of the microstructure. The effect of the
   stiffness degradation and accumulation of energy dissipation versus the
   number of cycles are discussed for different loading levels r. The
   results show that the fatigue behaviour until failure, subjected to
   cyclic loading depends on the loading levels and occur in three stages.
   The results obtained shows also that the auxetic foam have enhanced
   characteristics under static loading and tensile fatigue compared to the
   conventional parent phase form. Crown Copyright (C) 2008 Published by

Abstract = {{One of the leading contributors to assembly and reliability issues in
   electronic packaging arises from warpage and interfacial stresses
   stemming from coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) mismatch of the
   interfacing components. Trends toward miniaturizing and increasing
   density of the electronic packages exacerbate the assembly problems,
   leading to issues such as die cracking and board level assembly yield
   loss. One potential solution may be found in the inclusion of auxetic
   structures, which demonstrate negative Poisson's ratio through
   re-entrant geometries, which has been investigated for use in augmented
   structural mechanics for impact energy absorption. Because of the unique
   structural design, auxetics become thicker perpendicularly under an
   applied tensile load, unlike typical material loading responses. This
   interesting behavior has opportunity for integration into electronic
   packages for stress mitigation under thermal cycling since the
   structures can disrupt the typical expansion behavior. Here, auxetic
   trace geometries and structures were evaluated in various packaging
   implementations (die and substrate level) for warpage and stress
   reduction under thermal cycling conditions. By replacing standard
   Manhattan-style layouts and power and ground plane features with
   re-entrant trace geometries, reductions in thermomechanically induced
   interfacial stresses were observed, in addition to considering heat
   spreading properties within a package. Herein, deformation of silicon
   chip with addition of raised re-entrant Evans auxetics and raised
   ellipse shape auxetic traces as well as deformation of direct bonded
   copper (DBC) substrate with and without re-entrant auxetic patterned
   pads are estimated and compared using Finite Element Analysis (FEA) in
   ANSYS software. To demonstrate the benefits of passive auxetic traces, a
   planar transformer with re-entrant Evans auxetic patterns on PCB layers
   has been examined under full-load operating condition and compared with
   a traditionally patterned transformers. A better thermal distribution
   and lower maximum temperature in the device are achieved by including
   auxetic patterned features. FEA simulation results also show stress
   reduction in windings and lower deformation in PCB layers. Inclusion of
   auxetic structures in passive metal deposition layers which are not part
   of the circuit is shown to reduce maximum stress and warp deflection, as
   well as improve thermal gradient distribution and reduce overall
   temperature for 2D planar and 3D stacked packages. Consequently, use of
   auxetic features may extend package reliability significantly.}},

Abstract = {{Sandwich panels are important components of advanced structures used in
   aerospace, automotive, railway, civil engineering etc. They are
   subjected to high and repeated variations of temperature which induce
   additional stresses as the core and the face sheets are from different
   materials having different coefficients of thermal expansion and moduli
   of elasticity. Therefore it is important to evaluate both mechanical and
   thermal stresses. In the literature one can find thermomechanical
   analyses of sandwich panels with metallic or composite face sheets and
   having a honeycomb or compact core made from polyurethane foam. In this
   paper was analysed a plane sandwich panel made from a cellular rigid
   polyurethane core, having a chiral configuration and auxetic properties
   (negative Poisson's ratio) exposed to a stationary temperature field
   with a linear variation from +25 degrees C on one sheet to -50 degrees C
   on the opposite sheet. Two boundary conditions were considered in the
   thermo-mechanical evaluation: the free panel and the panel simply
   supported around the edges.}},

Abstract = {{Cellular materials have two important properties: structures and
   mechanisms. These properties have important applications in materials
   design; in particular, they're used to determine the modulus and yield
   strain. The objective of this study is to gain a better understanding of
   these two properties and to explore the synthesis of three-dimensional
   (3D) compliant cellular materials (CCMs) with compliant porous
   structures (CPSes) generated from modified hexagonal honeycombs. An
   orthotropic constitutive CCM model in the Cartesian coordinate system is
   constructed using the strain energy method, which uses the deformation
   of hinges around holes and the rotation of links. A finite element (FE)
   based simulation is conducted to validate the analytical model. The
   moduli and yield strains of the 3D CCMs with an aluminum alloy are about
   1.2GPa and 0.4\% in the longitudinal direction and about 0.08MPa and
   30\% in the lateral direction. The CCMs have extremely high positive and
   negative Poisson's ratios (43, 30) due to the large rotation of the link
   member in the transverse direction caused by an input displacement in
   the longitudinal direction. This paper demonstrates that compliant
   mesostructures can be used for next generation materials design in
   tailoring mechanical properties such as moduli, strength, strain, and
   Poisson's ratios.}},

Abstract = {{When designing a flexible structure consisting of cellular materials, it
   is important to find the maximum effective strain of the cellular
   material resulting from the deformed cellular geometry and not leading
   to local cell wall failure. In this paper, a finite in-plane shear
   deformation of auxtic honeycombs having effective negative Poisson's
   ratio is investigated over the base material's elastic range. An
   analytical model of the in-plane plastic failure of the cell walls is
   refined with finite element (FE) micromechanical analysis using periodic
   boundary conditions. A nonlinear constitutive relation of honeycombs is
   obtained from the FE micromechanics simulation and is used to define the
   coefficients of a hyperelastic strain energy function. Auxetic
   honeycombs show high shear flexibility without a severe geometric
   nonlinearity when compared to their regular counterparts.}},

Abstract = {{A 3D numerical simulation of the mechanical behaviour of a chiral
   auxetic cellular structure subjected to multiaxial loading conditions is
   presented in this paper. The proposed computational models are used to
   study the geometry effect of the unit cell on the Poisson's ratio and
   deformation behaviour of the analysed chiral auxetic structure. A 3D
   computational model of a chiral auxetic structure is built using beam
   finite elements in the framework of LS DYNA software. Here, the lattice
   model is positioned between rigid plates and assembled in a way to
   simulate hydro-compression loading conditions. Between the contacting
   surfaces, interactions in normal (contact) and tangential (friction)
   directions are prescribed, with the node-to-surface approach. The
   developed computational model offers insight into the deformation
   (damage) behaviour of the analysed chiral auxetic cellular structure,
   and enables better understanding of its crushing behaviour under
   multiaxial loading.}},

Title = {{Hyperbolic-Like Structure with Negative Poisson's Ratio: Deformation
   Mechanism and Structural Design}},
Journal = {{PHYSICA STATUS SOLIDI B-BASIC SOLID STATE PHYSICS}},
Abstract = {{Mechanical metamaterials with negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) effect
   possess important practical applications in aerospace, nanotechnology,
   and other fields. The microstructure and its deformation mode directly
   determine the NPR ability and mechanical performance of auxetic
   metamaterials. Herein, inspired by the double-negative-index ceramic
   aerogels, a novel NPR structural model is proposed in which symmetric
   reentrant oblique ligaments and short transversal ligaments constitute
   the main framework inside a square, which is different from the
   traditional reentrant structure due to the hyperbolic-like skeleton and
   deformation modes. The influence of structural parameters on the NPR
   effect is investigated using the Timoshenko beam model and finite
   element simulations. The structural model is then extended to design
   multiple reentrant structures and assembled structures, respectively.
   The multiple reentrant structures include multiple pairs of
   symmetrically hyperbolic-like skeletons, and the distribution of
   horizontal ligaments can be regulated to achieve a better NPR effect.
   For assembled structures under compression, the local rotational
   deformation and buckling result in structural instability, demonstrated
   by inflection points in the NPR curves. Moreover, one special assembled
   structure is found for which there is a linear relationship between the
   compressive strain and NPR value. The insights should be significant for
   designing mechanical metamaterials with the NPR effect.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies the optimization of converting process parameters of
   conventional foam into the auxetic. The control factors of converting
   process are heat temperature, pressure and time. The aim of this study
   is to achieve an optimum combination of these control factors for
   obtaining maximum stiffness and minimum negative Poisson's ratio as the
   desired responses. A series of experiments were implemented based on the
   Taguchi orthogonal array design. In order to determine the optimum
   control factors level, three different multi-objective optimization
   methods i.e. grey relational analysis, fitness function and desirability
   function were employed. The optimum combinations achieved form all
   methods were verified through the confirmation tests. Although outcomes
   of all these methods, in the case of both Poisson's ratio and stiffness,
   were in a good agreement with the confirmation tests, however the result
   of grey relational analysis had the minimum mean error percentage. Also,
   all these methods reported the pressure, heat temperature and time as
   the first, second and third level of significance, respectively. This
   study allows manufacturer to select the optimization procedure
   appropriately and produce the auxetic foam with minimum waste material.}},

Title = {{A piezo-shunted kirigami auxetic lattice for adaptive elastic wave
   filtering}},
Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Tailoring the dynamical behavior of wave-guide structures can provide an
   efficient and physically elegant approach for optimizing mechanical
   components with regards to vibroacoustic propagation. Architectured
   materials as pyramidal core kirigami cells combined with smart systems
   may represent a promising way to improve the vibroacoustic quality of
   structural components. This paper describes the design and modeling of a
   pyramidal core with auxetic (negative Poisson's ratio) characteristics
   and distributed shunted piezoelectric patches that allow for wave
   propagation control. The core is produced using a kirigami technique,
   inspired by the cutting/folding processes of the ancient Japanese art.
   The kirigami structure has a pyramidal unit cell shape that creates an
   in-plane negative Poisson's ratio macroscopic behavior. This structure
   exhibits in-plane elastic properties (Young's and shear modulus) which
   are higher than the out-of-plane ones, and hence this lattice has very
   specific properties in terms of wave propagation that are investigated
   in this work. The short-circuited configuration is first analyzed,
   before using negative capacitance and resistance as a shunt which
   provides impressive band gaps in the low frequency range. All
   configurations are investigated by using a full analysis of the
   Brillouin zone, rendering possible the deep understanding of the
   dynamical properties of the smart lattice. The results are presented in
   terms of dispersion and directivity diagrams, and the smart lattice
   shows quite interesting properties for the adaptive filtering of elastic
   waves at low frequencies bandwidths.}},

Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{The advanced composites - laminates, composed of auxetic and non-auxetic
   layers, were developed and subjected to tensile loading tests to
   characterize their deformation behaviour. The two-layer laminates were
   composed of the polymer foam with auxetic cellular structure and the
   conventional knitted fabric bonded together by the rubber-based
   adhesive, based on polymer binder, resins, additives and flammable
   organic solvents. All base materials, structured foams and laminates
   were tested. The influence of the adhesive on mechanical properties of
   the knitted fabric was also evaluated. The results of the study show
   that the cheaply fabricated laminates of knitted fabric reinforced by
   structured Ethylene-Vinyl Acetate (EVA) foam offer stiffness enhancement
   and decrease of the Poisson's ratio of the conventional fabric. The
   laminates also limit fabric warping during the deformation, thus
   increasing its stiffness. This behaviour can be beneficial in many
   applications in the textile industry by enhancing properties in

Abstract = {{Auxetic structures attain certain abnormal mechanical attributes such as
   negative Poisson's ratios due to the macro level structural forms.
   Achieving the auxetic responses is often the central focus of the design
   of any auxetic structural form. However, the stress distribution across
   the structures and in particular, the stress concentration aspects are
   often paid little attention. A numerical simulation analysis is
   conducted in this paper to establish the stress distribution patterns as
   well as the stress concentration effects based on variations in the
   filleting around the critical points of the structure. A square grid
   auxetic structural form is selected and finite element simulation of the
   stress fields indicated specific roles of the slight geometrical
   modifications in terms of filleting leading to variations in both peak
   stresses and the locations of the stress concentration points. Optimum
   fillet dimensions could be established based on the results of the
   numerical experiments. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Title = {{Theoretical, emulation and experimental analysis on auxetic re-entrant
   octagonal honeycombs and its applications on pedestrian protection of
   engine hood}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{260}},
Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{In this article, a novel re-entrant octagonal honeycomb (ROH) with
   negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) configuration is proposed owing to its
   superior energy absorption and lightweight design performances.
   Regarding the effects of adjacent unit cells, a mechanics-based
   homogenization approach is put forward and employed to derive static
   mechanical properties including elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio of
   two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) ROHs under axial
   loading. Based on above, the predominant compression failure mode is
   explored. Then, the static mechanical properties and finite element
   model of ROH are validated by experiment and demonstrate high accuracy.
   Subsequently, to obtain dynamic responses of the ROH under dynamic
   impact loading, the relations among dynamic plateau stress and
   quasi-static plateau stress, initial density, dense strain and impact
   velocities are established under the conditions of mass conservation and
   momentum theorem based on one-dimensional shock wave theory and ideal
   rigid-perfectly plastic material model. Besides, dynamic energy
   absorption models of the ROH under dynamic loading are acquired in
   consideration of the effects of impact velocities on dense strain, the
   results show that theoretical models agree quite well with simulation
   results. On this basis, the application of ROH on automotive energy
   absorber is studied with the purpose of acquiring superior energy
   absorption and satisfying lightweight requirements simultaneously. Based
   on the decoupling thought of stiffness and pedestrian protection, a new
   design method of carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP) hood with ROH
   is put forward in consideration of energy absorption and lightweight
   requirements. Of this, ROH is regarded as sandwich structure to meet the
   demands of energy absorption, CFRP plates are treated as outer and inner
   skins to satisfy the needs of stiffness. Firstly, multi-objective
   optimization models are set up under the constraints of reasonable
   structural parameters and negative Poisson's ratio. Then, the
   NSGA-IIalgorithm is adopted to achieve the optimal Pareto fronts with
   the targets for maximum unit mass energy absorption and minimum density.
   Afterwards, the optimization on thicknesses of CFRP layers is carried
   out to achieve minimum mass under the constraint conditions that the
   static stiffness of CFRP hood is larger than that of steel hood. In
   addition, the layering sequence of inner and lower skins are also
   optimized. Finally, improved overall stiffness, optimized HIC values and
   similar lightweight space of CFRP hood with ROH are achieved in
   comparisons with CFRP hood without ROH. Compared with steel hood, the
   pedestrian protection performance of CFRP hood with ROH is greatly
   enhanced, 1st free mode increases by 33.9\%, and torsional stiffness and
   bending stiffness increase by 23.1\% and 30.8\%, respectively. While the
   weight decreases by 40.1\%. The results indicate that the CFRP hood with
   ROH presents outstanding advantages of pedestrian protection and
   lightweight design in terms of HIC and stiffness performance.}},

Title = {{Investigation of the auxetic oval structure for energy absorption
   through quasi-static and dynamic experiments}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMPACT ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{147}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Auxetics are structures and materials with a negative Poisson's ratio,
   meaning they contract in the direction perpendicular to the applied
   force under a compressive load. This phenomenon can lead to increased
   energy absorption, among other favourable parameters to protect against
   impulsive loadings. In this research, a structure with alternating oval
   perforations was investigated which gives rise to an auxetic geometry,
   referred to as an `auxetic oval' design within this paper. Quasi-static
   (strain rate = 0.001/s) and dynamic (strain rate = 100/s) experiments
   have been conducted on small-scale specimens, manufactured using
   subtractive fabrication (laser cutting). Different design criteria were
   examined to understand the mechanisms behind the energy absorption of
   the auxetic structures. A modified version of the energy efficiency
   method was developed to determine the densification strain of the
   auxetics. A shift from strain-softening to strain-hardening behaviour is
   seen as the number of cell layers increases, with the perfectly-plastic
   response ideal for energy absorbing structures. Inertia effects are
   present in the dynamic tests, showing an increase in plateau stress for
   several of the designs. The quasi-static and dynamic responses are
   fundamentally identical, meaning that the performance of the auxetics do
   not change under the range of strain rates examined.
   Digital image correlation has been successfully utilised in the analysis
   process. This includes confirmation of the mechanism giving rise to the
   auxetic behaviour (rigid rotating squares) and the calculation of the
   negative Poisson's ratio. Strain fields have been examined showing the
   regions of energy dissipation. Based on these results the auxetic oval
   design experiences bending dominated behaviour. Finally, a unique design
   has been developed, dubbed the `Hybrid Auxetic Oval', which shows
   favourable behaviour compared to the equivalent base auxetic oval design
   by mitigating the effects of fracture.}},

   metamaterials using a reconciled level set method}},
Journal = {{COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{83}},
Pages = {{15-32}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Metamaterials are defined as a family of rationally designed artificial
   materials which can provide extraordinary effective properties compared
   with their nature counterparts. This paper proposes a level set based
   method for topology optimization of both single and multiple-material
   Negative Poisson's Ratio (NPR) metamaterials. For multi-material
   topology optimization, the conventional level set method is advanced
   with a new approach exploiting the reconciled level set (RLS) method.
   The proposed method simplifies the multi-material topology optimization
   by evolving each individual material with a single level set function
   and reconciling the result level set field with the Merriman-Bence-Osher
   (MBO) operator. The NPR metamaterial design problem is recast as a
   variational problem, where the effective elastic properties of the
   spatially periodic microstructure are formulated as the strain energy
   functionals under uniform displacement boundary conditions. The adjoint
   variable method is utilized to derive the shape sensitivities by
   combining the general linear elastic equation with a weak imposition of
   Dirichlet boundary conditions. The design velocity field is constructed
   using the steepest descent method and integrated with the level set
   method. Both single and multiple-material mechanical metamaterials are
   achieved in 2D and 3D with different Poisson's ratios and volumes.
   Benchmark designs are fabricated with multi-material 3D printing at high
   resolution. The effective auxetic properties of the achieved designs are
   verified through finite element simulations and characterized using
   experimental tests as well. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetics (i.e. systems with negative Poisson's ratios) exhibit the
   unexpected feature of becoming fatter when stretched and narrower when
   compressed. This property is highly desirable as it imparts many
   beneficial effects on the material's macroscopic properties. Recent
   research suggests that in an idealised scenario, systems composed of
   connected `rigid squares' can. exhibit auxetic behaviour (Poisson's
   ratio = - 1) due to a mechanism involving relative rotation of the
   squares. This paper shows through force-field based molecular modelling
   simulations that although `rotating squares' are responsible for
   negative Poisson's ratios in various zeolite frameworks, in these real
   materials, the squares are not rigid and the auxeticity is not as
   pronounced as in the `idealised' model. In view of this, a new model
   system made from connected,semi-rigid' squares is proposed and
   analytical equations for the mechanical properties of this new model
   system are derived and discussed. It will be shown that the Poisson's
   ratios in this new model are highly dependent on the extent of rigidity
   of the squares and the direction of loading. It will also be shown that
   this new model provides a better description for the behaviour of
   auxetic zeolite frameworks than the original `rotating rigid squares'
   model. (C) 2007 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA, Weinheim.}},

Title = {{Dynamic indentation of auxetic and non-auxetic honeycombs under large
   deformation}},

Abstract = {{It is generally acknowledged that the indentation resistance or hardness
   of auxetic materials is higher than that of their conventional
   counterparts under elastic deformation. However, this property of the
   auxetic material may not always be superior to that of the non-auxetic
   materials when the deformation is relatively large with plasticity
   considered. In this study, we come up with an index to quantitatively
   depict the indentation resistance of the hexagonal honeycombs under
   large deformation. The indentation resistance of both the auxetic and
   nonauxetic hexagonal honeycombs is compared and discussed. Results show
   that in the premise of honeycombs possessing the same relative density,
   the indentation resistance of auxetic hexagonal honeycombs is not always
   higher than that of the non-auxetic honeycombs. This phenomenon is
   verified by the numerical simulations. Further analysis shows that there
   is a critical value of the absolute value of Poisson's ratio, which is
   determined by the cell-wall length ratio, to estimate the higher
   indentation resistance between the auxetic and non-auxetic hexagonal
   honeycombs. The influence of indentation velocity is also analyzed based
   on numerical simulations. This present work is supposed to shed light on
   the design and evaluation of the indentation resistance for both auxetic
   and conventional honeycombs.}},

Abstract = {{This study aims to provide fundamental understandings in several issues
   critical to the fabrication of auxetic polyurethane (PU) foams by
   thermal compression process: conversion and auxetic structure fixation
   mechanisms, materials characteristics essential for the successful
   auxetic conversion, and optimal conditions for auxetic conversion. Three
   flexible PU foams with similar morphology were selected for the study.
   First the commonalities as well as the differences between these foams
   in terms of their chemical composition, microstructure and
   thermomechanical properties were thoroughly analyzed. This is followed
   by the auxetic convertibility study of these three foams. Mechanisms for
   fixing the structure were elucidated and the windows for processing were
   interpreted in the context of polymer relaxation. Guided by these
   understandings, a series of auxetic foams were manufactured at a wide
   range of conditions. The processing conditions agreed very well with
   those suggested from the mechanistic investigation, validating the
   proposed auxetic conversion and structure fixation mechanisms. The
   mechanism was further confirmed by direct observation of the morphology
   of the fabricated auxetic foams. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In recent years, auxetic cellular materials such as auxetic reentrant
   honeycombs were widely studied due to its attractively negative
   Poisson's ratio. In this manuscript, the structure response of
   end-clamped sandwich beam with auxetic reentrant hexagonal aluminum
   honeycomb core locally subjected to foam projectile with high-velocity
   impact was experimentally and numerically studied. The reentrant
   honeycomb cores with different cell-wall thicknesses were fabricated by
   selective laser melting (SLM). According to experiment results, the
   failure modes of the sandwich beam were investigated. It was found that
   sandwich beam with different honeycomb cell's thicknesses could fail in
   different modes. Meanwhile, the local negative Poisson's ratio
   deformation was observed in the thin honeycomb core. Based on this, a
   finite element (FE) model was constructed to analysis the dynamic
   deformation evolution of two face sheets and auxetic reentrant honeycomb
   core. The local auxetic and expand deformations of honeycomb core were
   both found. Finally, the residual deflections of sandwich beam under
   impulsive loadings were discussed. (c) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Volume = {{475}},

Abstract = {{An auxetic design is proposed by soft-hard material integration and
   demonstrate negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) can be achieved by leveraging
   unique rotation features of non-connected hard particles in a soft
   matrix. A theoretical mechanics framework that describes rotation of
   hard particles in a soft matrix under a mechanical loading is
   incorporated with overall Poisson's ratio of the soft-hard integrated
   metamaterials. The theoretical analysis shows that the auxetic behaviour
   of the soft-hard integrated structures not only relies critically on
   geometry of particles, but also depends on their periodic arrangements
   in the soft matrix. Extensive finite-element analyses (FEA) are
   performed and validate the theoretical predictions of hard-particle
   rotation and overall Poisson's ratio of soft-hard integrated structures.
   Furthermore, uniaxial tensile tests are carried out on three-dimensional
   printed soft-hard integrated structures and confirm auxetic behaviour of
   soft-hard integrated structures enabled by the rotation of hard
   particles. Besides, Poisson's ratio varies nonlinearly with the
   thickness of specimens and reaches a maximum NPR far out of the bounds
   of plane stress and plane strain situations, which agrees well with FEA.
   This work provides a theoretical foundation for the design of mechanical
   metamaterials enabled by soft-hard material integration with auxetic
   deformation behaviour.}},

   we identify a hitherto-neglected single-layer PtI2, which can readily be

   an indirect-gap semiconductor with a band gap of 2.56 eV, and its band
   gap is extremely robust against external strain. We find that it is a
   promising two-dimensional photocatalyst, exhibiting outstanding
   catalytic performances toward oxygen evolution reactions, with the water
   oxidation reaction occurring spontaneously under light irradiation.
   Moreover, we unveil that single-layer PtI2 is a long-sought auxetic
   material with a negative Poisson's ratio of -0.54, arising from its
   particular puckered hinge crystal. Our findings highlight single-layer

Number = {{2}},
Month = {{AUG 20}},
Abstract = {{We report a three-dimensional instability-triggered mechanical
   metamaterial that simultaneously possesses negative stiffness, negative
   bulk modulus, and negative Poisson's ratio. This metamaterial is a
   periodic arrangement of binder-shell elements. Combining numerical
   simulation and micromechanics analysis, we show that the thin spherical
   shells dent inward under compression, which contributes to a negative
   Poisson's ratio. Snap-through instability is predicted by the Riks
   method-based simulation, revealing that the metamaterial exhibits
   negative incremental stiffness. Negative bulk modulus is an outcome of
   negative stiffness and negative Poisson's ratio. Interestingly, both
   incremental stiffness and incremental Poisson's ratio approach negative
   infinity under displacement-controlled loading when snap back takes
   place. We further show that a triply negative metamaterial can satisfy
   the strong ellipticity condition, providing a mechanism to prevent the
   formation of localized deformation bands even when material softening
   takes place. The proposed triply negative metamaterial can also serve as
   structural elements for applications such as extreme damping composites,
   extreme stiff composites, and mechanical actuators.}},

Abstract = {{For the purpose of fabricating three kinds of auxetic weft knitted
   fabrics, three different geometrical structures namely rotational
   structure, foldable structure and double-headed arrow topological
   structures with three different knit loop lengths were produced using
   computerized flat knitting machine. Experimental results show that all
   three different weft knitted fabrics have auxetic effect. The Poisson's
   ratio values of the three fabrics are inversely proportional to knit
   loop lengths. However, differences exist between the curves of Poisson's
   ratio relative to strain. With regards to the rotational and
   double-headed arrow topological structures, the curves tend to be
   monotonic, whilst that of the foldable structure takes the form of a
   parabola. This research thus confirms the possibility of producing
   auxetic fabrics based on several geometrical structures using flat
   knitting technology}},

Abstract = {{This paper treats the influence of auxetic foam on the crush response
   and energy absorption response of square-section tubes when subjected to
   uniaxial quasi-static loading. The study aims at quantifying the energy
   absorption capability of auxetic foam-filled square tubes for variations
   in wall thickness, initial height, aspect ratio and slenderness ratio of
   the tube. The capability of simulating the crush response of auxetic
   foam-filled tubes using the validated numerical models is also
   presented. Based on the experimental results, the influence of the
   auxeticfoam in the thin-walled square tubes was quantified in terms of
   energy absorption capacity, specific energy absorption and crush force
   efficiency. It is evident that a thicker tube filled with auxetic foam
   is preferable if the energy absorption level is the primary goal, yet
   this compromises the crush force efficiency. The outcome of this present
   study is the establishment of empirical models for estimating the
   quasi-static crushing response of auxetic foam-filled tubes with varying
   slenderness ratio and aspect ratio.}},

Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{In the present work, a new design of honeycomb is proposed by embedding
   the rhombic configuration into the normal re-entrant hexagonal honeycomb
   (NRHH), in order to enhance the honeycomb's in-plane mechanical
   properties. Both theoretical analysis and numerical simulations are
   employed to calculate the in-plane mechanical properties of the new
   honeycomb under uniaxial compression, including Young's modulus,
   Poisson's ratio and critical buckling strength. The results show that
   the new honeycomb can maintain auxetic performance, while both the
   in-plane Young's modulus and the critical buckling strength are
   significantly improved compared to the NRHH. Comparisons between the
   present design and other exiting enhanced periodic topologies are also
   carried out. With respect to them, the present design features superior
   performances. For these outstanding properties, this layout may provide
   a new concept for the optimization and design of auxetic materials. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper is devoted to a category of metamaterials called auxetics,
   identified by their negative Poisson's ratio. Our work consists in
   exploring geometrical strategies to generate irregular auxetic
   structures. More precisely we seek to reduce the Poisson's ratio nu, by
   pruning an irregular network based solely on geometric criteria. We
   introduce a strategy combining a pure geometric pruning algorithm
   followed by a physics-based testing phase to determine the resulting
   Poisson's ratio of our structures. We propose an algorithm that
   generates sets of irregular auxetic networks. Our contributions include
   geometrical characterization of auxetic networks, development of a
   pruning strategy, generation of auxetic networks with low Poisson's
   ratio, as well as validation of our approach. We provide statistical
   validation of our approach on large sets of irregular networks, and we
   additionally laser-cut auxetic networks in sheets of rubber. The
   findings reported here show that it is possible to reduce the Poisson's
   ratio by geometric pruning, and that we can generate irregular auxetic
   networks at lower processing times than a physics-based approach.}},

   rectangular blocks with fibril interconnections. In this paper,
   spherical nodes are used in order to approximate the granular nodule
   shape and for taking into consideration the 3D nature of the nodes.
   Assuming curvilinear motion of the nodes as a result of fibril rotation,
   a quantitative description of the Poisson's ratio is given as a function
   of the nodule density packing factor. Comparison with the 3D rectangular
   model shows that the spherical model gives a more conservative

Abstract = {{In recent years, auxetic metallic cellular material such as auxetic
   reentrant honeycomb is one of the research hotspot in metallic cellular
   materials due to its attractively negative Poisson's ratio. In this
   manuscript, the dynamic response of the end-clamped shallow sandwich
   arch with aluminum face sheets and auxetic reentrant hexagonal aluminum
   honeycomb core subjected to foam projectile with high-velocity impact
   was experimentally and numerically investigated. The reentrant honeycomb
   cores with different cell-wall thicknesses were fabricated by selective
   laser melting (SLM). The deformation processes of honeycomb core were
   captured by a high-speed camera. And deflection history of back face
   sheet was obtained using three-dimensional digital imaging correlation
   method (DIC) analysis system. Failure modes and deformation mechanisms
   of the sandwich arch were investigated. According to experiment results,
   the local negative Poisson's ratio deformation was found in honeycomb
   core. Then, a finite element (FE) model was established to study the
   dynamic deformation evolution of two face sheets and auxetic reentrant
   honeycomb core. The results showed that the honeycomb cells were not
   always undergoing shrinkage deformation and flowing into the loading
   center, while the local expand deformations of honeycomb core were also
   found.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTER METHODS IN APPLIED MECHANICS AND ENGINEERING}},

Abstract = {{A novel computational framework for designing metamaterials with
   negative Poisson's ratio over a large strain range is presented in this
   work by combining the density-based topology optimization together with
   a mixed stress/deformation driven nonlinear homogenization method. A
   measure of Poisson's ratio based on the macro deformations is proposed,
   which is further validated through direct numerical simulations. With
   the consistent optimization formulations based on nonlinear
   homogenization, auxetic metamaterial designs with respect to different
   loading orientations and with different unit cell domains are
   systematically explored. In addition, the extension to multimaterial
   auxetic metamaterial designs is also considered, and stable optimization
   formulations are presented to obtain discrete metamaterial topologies
   under finite strains. Various new auxetic designs are obtained based on
   the proposed framework. To validate the performance of optimized
   designs, a multiscale stability analysis is carried out using the Bloch
   analysis and rank-one convexity check. As demonstrated, short and/or
   long wavelength instabilities can occur during the loading process,
   leading to a change of periodicity of the microstructure, which can
   affect the performance of an optimized design. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Auxetic epoxy resin foams were produced by solid-state foaming thanks to
   the use of properly shaped precursors. In fact, a re-entrant hexagonal
   shape of the precursors is preserved during foaming and results in a
   foam with a complex structure: a thin macro-structure with the
   re-entrant geometry filled with foam. The auxetic behavior was observed
   by using tensile tests at different temperatures (room temperature, 80?,
   and 100?). Indentation tests were also carried out to evaluate the
   gradient properties across the lines of the thin re-entrant
   macro-structure. In order to show that the auxetic behavior depended on
   the internal macro-structure, tests were also performed on foam panels
   obtained by cylindrical tablets and, therefore, with a
   standard-hexagonal macro-structure. In conclusion, the auxetic behavior
   was observed only for the foam panels with re-entrant hexagonal
   structure at 80?. In this case, a negative Poisson's ratio is
   immediately achieved at small strains and tends to a zero plateau value
   for longitudinal strains up to 1\%.}},

Abstract = {{Graphene assembly, e.g. graphene aerogel, is an open-cell porous
   material with randomly distributed graphene sheets and voids. In this
   study, we propose a method to generate the 3D graphene assembly models
   which can reasonably display the structural properties of graphene
   aerogel. Our 3D graphene assembly models are firstly established by a
   Voronoi construction method that is usually used to build the
   polycrystalline materials. The optimization and relaxation are then
   conducted to obtain 3D graphene assembly with proper structures by using
   molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. In order to explore the mechanical
   properties of graphene assembly, the tensile and compressive tests are
   carried out by MD simulations. The results show that the 3D graphene
   assembly reveals auxetic behavior under compression while it has
   positive Poisson's ratio under tension. We also find that the Poisson's
   ratios are specifically related to the grain sizes and mass densities.
   Furthermore, from our simulation the stress-strain relations for the
   compressive tests and tensile tests are also obtained. The compressive
   Young's modulus, tensile Young's modulus, compressive strength and
   tensile strength are found to follow the power law relation to the mass
   density with the exponential factors of 2.31756, 2.33005, 2.6243 and
   1.5084, respectively.}},

Title = {{Shear Deformation in Rectangular Auxetic Plates}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING MATERIALS AND TECHNOLOGY-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{136}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Solids that exhibit negative Poisson's ratio are called auxetic
   materials. This paper examines the extent of transverse shear
   deformation with reference to bending deformation in simply supported
   auxetic plates as a ratio of Mindlin-to-Kirchhoff plate deflection for
   polygonal plates in general, with special emphasis on rectangular
   plates. Results for square plates show that the Mindlin plate deflection
   approximates the Kirchhoff plate deflection not only when the plate
   thickness is negligible, as is obviously known, but also when (a) the
   Poisson's ratio of the plate is very negative under all load
   distributions, as well as (b) at the central portion of the plate when
   the load is uniformly distributed. Hence geometrically thick plates are
   mechanically equivalent to thin plates if the plate Poisson's ratio is
   sufficiently negative. The high suppression of shear deformation in
   favor of bending deformation in auxetic plates suggests its usefulness
   for bending-based plate sensors that require larger difference in the
   in-plane strains between the opposing plate surfaces with minimal
   transverse deflection.}},

Title = {{Computational prediction of new auxetic materials}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 22}},
Abstract = {{Auxetics comprise a rare family of materials that manifest negative
   Poisson's ratio, which causes an expansion instead of contraction under
   tension. Most known homogeneously auxetic materials are porous foams or
   artificial macrostructures and there are few examples of inorganic
   materials that exhibit this behavior as polycrystalline solids. It is
   now possible to accelerate the discovery of materials with target
   properties, such as auxetics, using high-throughput computations, open
   databases, and efficient search algorithms. Candidates exhibiting
   features correlating with auxetic behavior were chosen from the set of
   more than 67 000 materials in the Materials Project database. Poisson's
   ratios were derived from the calculated elastic tensor of each material
   in this reduced set of compounds. We report that this strategy results
   in the prediction of three previously unidentified homogeneously auxetic
   materials as well as a number of compounds with a near-zero homogeneous
   Poisson's ratio, which are here denoted ``anepirretic materials{''}.}},

Abstract = {{This research is aimed at proposing an enhanced re-entrant hexagonal
   structure and examining its auxetic behavior in compressive or tensile
   load conditions. An integrated experimental and finite element analysis
   (FEA) approach was used to investigate the behavior of the proposed
   structures in combination with polymeric materials (thermoplastic
   polyurethane (TPU) materials such as Ninjaflex (R) and Semiflex (R)). We
   focused on the effect of nonlinearity of the structure on the overall
   stiffness and shock-absorption performance of the body protection pads.
   FEA models were used to examine how the stiffness and Poisson's ratio
   are affected by static load conditions and also how the dynamic loads
   are transmitted through the auxetic structure. The static FEA models
   were verified through experimental testing. Advanced additive
   manufacturing (3D printing) techniques such as Fused Deposition Modeling
   (FDM) were used to build fixtures and prototypes of the auxetic
   polymeric structures. Structural stiffness and Poisson's ratio were
   examined not only in tensile loading condition but also in compression.
   Axial and lateral deformations were measured for given axial forces on
   the experimental model, and the measured values of Poisson's ratio were
   compared with the computational results. It was shown that the enhanced
   re-entrant hexagonal structures had nonlinear behavior, which could be a
   useful property for developing body protection pads and
   stiffness-varying structures.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to design isotropic periodic microstructures
   of cellular materials using the bidirectional evolutionary structural
   optimization (BESO) technique. The goal was to determine the optimal
   distribution of material phase within the periodic base cell. Maximizing
   bulk modulus or shear modulus was selected as the objective of the
   material design subject to an isotropy constraint and a volume
   constraint. The effective properties of the material were found using
   the homogenization method based on finite element analyses of the base
   cell. The proposed BESO procedure utilizes the gradient-based
   sensitivity method to impose the isotropy constraint and gradually
   evolve the microstructures of cellular materials to an optimum.
   Numerical examples show the computational efficiency of the approach. A
   series of new and interesting microstructures of isotropic cellular
   materials that maximize the bulk or shear modulus have been found and
   presented. The methodology can be extended to incorporate other material
   properties of interest such as designing isotropic cellular materials
   with negative Poisson's ratio.}},

Title = {{On the application of additive manufacturing methods for auxetic
   structures: a review}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN MANUFACTURING}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic structures are a special class of structural components that
   exhibit a negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) because of their constituent
   materials, internal microstructure, or structural geometry. To realize
   such structures, specialized manufacturing processes are required to
   achieve a dimensional accuracy, reduction of material wastage, and a
   quicker fabrication. Hence, additive manufacturing (AM) techniques play
   a pivotal role in this context. AM is a layer-wise manufacturing process
   and builds the structure as per the designed geometry with appreciable
   precision and accuracy. Hence, it is extremely beneficial to fabricate
   auxetic structures using AM, which is otherwise a tedious and expensive
   task. In this study, a detailed discussion of the various AM techniques
   used in the fabrication of auxetic structures is presented. The
   advancements and advantages put forward by the AM domain have offered a
   plethora of opportunities for the fabrication and development of
   unconventional structures. Therefore, the authors have attempted to
   provide a meaningful encapsulation and a detailed discussion of the most
   recent of such advancements pertaining to auxetic structures. The
   article opens with a brief history of the growth of auxetic materials
   and later auxetic structures. Subsequently, discussions centering on the
   different AM techniques employed for the realization of auxetic
   structures are conducted. The basic principle, advantages, and
   disadvantages of these processes are discussed to provide an in-depth
   understanding of the current level of research. Furthermore, the
   performance of some of the prominent auxetic structures realized through
   these methods is discussed to compare their benefits and shortcomings.
   In addition, the influences of geometric and process parameters on such
   structures are evaluated through a comprehensive review to assess their
   feasibility for the later-mentioned applications. Finally, valuable
   insights into the applications, limitations, and prospects of AM for
   auxetic structures are provided to enable the readers to gauge the
   vitality of such manufacturing as a production method.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the electromechanical properties of two-dimensional MoS2
   monolayers with 1H, 1T, and 1T' structures as a function of charge
   doping by using density functional theory. We find isotropic elastic
   moduli in the 1H and 1T structures, while the 1T' structure exhibits an
   anisotropic elastic modulus. Moreover, the 1T structure is shown to have
   a negative Poisson's ratio, while Poisson's ratios of the 1H and 1T' are
   positive. By charge doping, the monolayer MoS2 shows a reversible strain
   and work density per cycle ranging from -0.68\% to 2.67\% and from 4.4
   to 36.9 MJ m(-3), respectively, making them suitable for applications in
   electromechanical actuators. We also examine the stress generated in the
   MoS2 monolayers and we find that 1T and 1T' MoS2 monolayers have
   relatively better performance than 1H MoS2 monolayer. We argue that such
   excellent electromechanical performance originate from the electrical
   conductivity of the metallic 1T and semimetallic 1T' structures and also

Abstract = {{This paper presents the out-of-plane mechanism of a laminated open-cell
   structure that is exerted by a simple control of the geometric
   configuration. We propose two types of structural units that are
   assembled with beam and column members in a tetragonal system, and with
   the geometric difference between them being the presence of a reinforced
   beam. For the two unit cells, we develop finite element models according
   to a homogenization method and analyze the macroscopic linear and
   nonlinear elastic properties. The numerical results show that the
   cellular structure, which is bridged by additional beams, exhibits
   strong auxeticity with high negative values of Poisson's ratio in the
   lamination direction, while retaining the in-plane negative Poisson's
   ratios. We assess the sensitivity of the linear and nonlinear
   out-of-plane response to changes in the component geometry. Finally, we
   discuss the large deformation behaviors of the out-of-plane mechanisms
   to quantify the amounts of three-dimensional rotations of the internal
   components.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic fabrics have gained an increasing attention in the auxetic
   material area in recent years. Especially, auxetic fabrics fabricated
   based on both weft-knitted and warp-knitted structures have made some
   important progress. However, all the knitted auxetic fabrics reported so
   far are fabricated based on 2D knitted structures, although some of the
   weft-knitted auxetic fabrics are finally formed into 3D forms. This
   paper reports a novel kind of 3D auxetic fabric fabricated based on a
   warp-knitted spacer structure with adoption of a special geometrical
   configuration which is formed with parallelograms. The auxetic behavior
   of these fabrics is discussed in terms of tensile direction, geometrical
   parameter, and repeated extension. The shape fitting ability on a
   spherical surface is also demonstrated. The results shows that the 3D
   auxetic fabrics have auxetic behavior in all the fabric plane directions
   and the highest auxetic effect is obtained when stretched in the weft
   direction of the fabric. The 3D auxetic fabrics also display an
   excellent shape fitting ability, which makes them very attractive for
   various applications where fitting to the human body's shape is highly
   required, such as bra cups, protectors for knees and elbows, shoes
   covers, etc. (C) 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA, Weinheim}},

Title = {{On the anisotropic and negative thermal expansion from dual-material

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{52}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{899-912}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Negative thermal expansion (NTE) and negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) are
   counterintuitive material properties that have gained popularity as the
   focus of many recent works. However, most of the structures previously
   studied only exhibit NTE or NPR exclusively. One important structure
   that has already been shown to exhibit NPR is the re-entrant triangle.
   In this work, the property of NTE in re-entrant triangular cellular
   structure composed of welded/bonded/brazed ribs of two different
   materials is investigated via analytical and finite element (FE)
   modelling. Based on analytical and FE analysis, the geometrical and
   material parameters for attaining NTE in the re-entrant metamaterial are
   established. The analysis and simulations reveal the dependence of NTE
   on the inclination of the longer chevron strut, the dimensionless rod
   coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), the ratio of thermal expansion
   coefficients of constituent struts but independent of scale and
   temperature. The extent of this property becomes more negative for
   higher values of the angle of the longer chevron strut with the
   vertical, higher ratios of CTE of the base to chevron strut material and
   for lower values of the non-dimensional re-entrant base material thermal
   expansion coefficient. The anisotropic and NTE behaviour is
   stretch-dominated. Effectively, combined with previous knowledge of NPR
   in the re-entrant triangle, NTE leads to further significance of such
   structures for many thermal and mechanical applications, such as
   composite materials, sensors and electronic components industries in
   both thermal and mechanical applications.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{135}},
Pages = {{339-352}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Sandwich panels composed of auxetic cellular cores and metal facets are
   presented for blast resistance applications. The performance of this
   hybrid composite structure under impulsive loading is numerically
   studied, taking into account the rate-dependent effects. The Johnson
   Cook law is used to model the behaviours of composite materials at high
   strain rates. Parametric analyses are performed to evaluate the
   performances of different designs of composite panels and compared with
   equivalent monolithic panels of identical areal masses in terms of
   deformations and dissipated plastic energy of the metal facets and
   auxetic crushable cores. Various design parameters are considered,
   including the auxetic unit cell effective Poisson's ratio, material
   properties, thickness of facet, and diameter of the unit cell truss
   member. To reduce the computational time, a quarter of the panel is
   modelled with shell elements for the facets and beam elements for the
   core. In blast events, auxetic composite panels are found to effectively
   absorb double the amount of impulsive energy via plastic deformation,
   and reduce up to 70\% of the back facet's maximum velocity when compared
   with monolithic ones. The maximum back facet displacement is also
   noticeably reduced by up to 30\% due to the densification and plastic
   deformation of the auxetic cores. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Studies concerning the relationship between the value of mu and a number
   of mechanical and thermal properties of amorphous polymers and glasses
   are analyzed with the aim to gain information about the origin of
   Poisson ratio mu in these systems. It is shown that the Poisson ratio
   features a more pronounced structure-sensitive behavior than the elastic
   modulus, although the Poisson ratio varies in a narrow range. The
   relationship between the Poisson ratio and the Gruneisen parameter is
   substantiated. In this context, the issue of the correlation between
   harmonic and anharmonic quantities is highlighted. The Poisson ratio is
   sensitive to lattice dynamics and atomic-molecular structures of
   polymers and glasses. When light atoms, for example, hydrogen atoms in
   polyethylene, are replaced with larger and heavier atoms on pendant
   chains of the macromolecular backbone, anharmonicity increases; that is,
   lattice Gruneisen parameter gamma (D) increases. As a result, the
   Poisson ratio increases because these quantities are related
   unambiguously. Conditions of preparing an isotropic material with a
   negative Poisson ratio (mu < 0) are discussed. The relative ultimate
   strain of the interatomic bond in glassy systems is a function of the
   Poisson ratio solely. The frozen elastic strain of amorphous polymers
   and glasses is likewise a single-valued function of the Poisson ratio.
   The discussed phenomena are interpreted in terms of the Kuz'menko and
   Pineda theories and the Berlin-Rothenburg-Bathurst model.}},

Abstract = {{Chiral honeycombs are one of the main classes of mechanical
   metamaterials with the potential to exhibit auxetic behaviour. In this
   work, we propose a new class of chiral metamaterials based on uniform
   Euclidean tessellations and their dual counterparts. In total, ten new
   structures were designed and analysed using Finite Element analysis
   under periodic boundary conditions, with eight of these systems showing
   the capability of possessing a negative Poisson's ratio. The
   relationship between the various geometric parameters defining the
   systems and the resultant mechanical properties was also studied. We
   show that `chiralisation', i.e. introduction of chirality and rotational
   elements within the system, has the ability to transform even complex
   geometries, which in their original state possess a high positive
   Poisson's ratio, into auxetic metamaterials and hope that this work can
   act as a blueprint for the design of auxetic structures with novel
   topologies.}},

Abstract = {{In the present work, the mechanical properties, in particular, the
   Poisson's ratio of four two-dimensional silica structures, called here
   alpha, beta, gamma, and delta are studied by means of molecular dynamics
   simulations. The alpha structure has been synthesized experimentally and
   the others have been reported as the most stable low-energy structures
   that reveal in-plane negative Poisson's ratio based on the first
   principles calculations. Among these structures, beta-silica exhibits
   the largest in-plane negative Poisson's ratio which is 2-4 times higher
   than penta-graphene. Our results illustrate that the classical molecular
   dynamics simulation reproduces results in agreement with those of the
   first principles calculations. Consequently, it enables us to study the
   mechanical responses of considerably larger systems at finite
   temperatures in contrast to the ab initio simulations. Furthermore, we
   systematically study the temperature effects on the stability and
   mechanical properties of these two-dimensional silica structures, up to
   their rupture points. It is found that the mechanical properties of
   these structures vary significantly with temperature, and gamma-silica
   exhibits a switchable behavior in its Poisson's ratio with temperature.}},

Abstract = {{A modelling method of auxetic yam (Helical Auxetic Yarn type)
   cooperating with the composite matrix was presented. The two component
   yarn surrounded by a flexible material is a fragment of composite, that
   consists of an auxetic fabric as a reinforcement and a flexible matrix.
   Such composite can be used in energy absorbing structures. The HAY as an
   auxetic material is characterized by a negative Poisson's ratio. The
   stiff fiber spirally wrapped around the elastic core with a larger
   diameter gives this structure anomalous behaviour during tensile.
   Stretching of such yarn increases its dimensions in transverse
   directions. Helical Auxetic Yams are sewn into fabric which is durable,
   flexible and light. The conducted analysis of the fragment of the
   composite reflecting one yarn allows for pre-adjustment of values of
   matrix material parameters. The purpose of the modelling is to determine
   the values of a composite matrix parameters that should allow the
   effective work of auxetic yam. If the matrix were too stiff, it would
   block the capability of bending the core fiber during stretching and the
   auxetic phenomenon would be cancelled. The key problem is performing
   these analyses with appropriate value of the Young's modulus of the
   composite matrix material to get the optimal composite structure. Finite
   Element Method analyses were conducted in LS-Dyna solver. Discrete model
   was build using hexagonal, solids elements. It was assumed that the
   matrix completely filled the spaces between the fibers, and at the
   outside it had the shape of the cylinder. The choice of such matrix
   shape allowed to carry out proper interpretation of the displacement
   values of nodes located at the boundary plane of the matrix model. The
   displacement of these nodes determines the proper work of the auxetic
   yarn. Relevant constitutive material models were used to reflect the
   work of the aramid wrap as well as the elastomeric core and matrix.
   Nodal displacement was applied to the one of the end of model to
   simulate tension under static conditions. FEM analyses were based on the
   implicit method, which is well suited for simulation of static
   processes, where final state is the most interesting. Based on the
   results of the conducted analyses, it was possible to choose the
   appropriate matrix material of the composite without preparation of many
   composite samples with various elastomer matrix and carrying out many
   experimental tests. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{We systematically analyse the mechanical deformation behaviour, in
   particular Poisson's ratio, of floppy bar-and-joint frameworks based on
   periodic tessellations of the plane. For frameworks with more than one
   deformation mode, crystallographic symmetry constraints or minimization
   of an angular vertex energy functional are used to lift this ambiguity.
   Our analysis allows for systematic searches for auxetic mechanisms in
   archives of tessellations; applied to the class of one- or two-uniform
   tessellations by regular or star polygons, we find two auxetic
   structures of hexagonal symmetry and demonstrate that several other
   tessellations become auxetic when retaining symmetries during the
   deformation, in some cases with large negative Poisson ratios nu < -1
   for a specific lattice direction. We often find a transition to negative
   Poisson ratios at finite deformations for several tessellations, even if
   the undeformed tessellation is infinitesimally non-auxetic. Our
   numerical scheme is based on a solution of the quadratic equations
   enforcing constant edge lengths by a Newton method, with periodicity
   enforced by boundary conditions.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{90}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{SEP 29}},
Abstract = {{An effective medium theory for resonant and nonresonant metamaterials
   for flexural waves in thin plates is presented. The theory provides
   closed-form expressions for the effective mass density, rigidity, and
   Poisson's ratio of arrangements of isotropic scatterers in thin plates,
   valid for low frequencies and moderate filling fractions. It is found
   that the effective Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio are induced by a
   combination of the monopolar and quadrupolar scattering coefficient, as
   it happens for bulk elastic waves, while the effective mass density is
   induced by the monopolar coefficient, contrarily as it happens for bulk
   elastic waves, where the effective mass density is induced by the
   dipolar coefficient. It is shown that resonant positive or negative
   effective elastic parameters are possible, being therefore the monopolar
   resonance responsible for creating an effective medium with negative
   mass density. Several examples are given for both nonresonant and
   resonant effective parameters and the results are numerically verified
   by multiple scattering theory and finite element analysis.}},

Abstract = {{The influences of the cell-wall angle on the indentation resistance of
   the re-entrant hexagonal honeycombs with negative Poisson's ratio are
   studied by employing both the numerical tests and the theoretical

   It is shown that the honeycomb's indentation resistance increases with
   the cell-wall angle in the same-density group, while the cell-wall angle
   plays a minor role in the same-cell-wall group. The theoretical analysis
   is employed to explain the phenomena. The effect of the negative
   Poison's ratio is calculated to increase with the cell-wall angle. The
   average stress of the re-entrant honeycomb during compression is deduced
   as a function of the cell-wall angle and the cell-wall size or the
   honeycomb's relative density. The analytical results are consistent with
   the numerical tests and give an explanation for the phenomena in tests.}},

Abstract = {{Seeking novel materials with specific applications is always an
   attractive theme in developing two-dimensional (2D) materials. Herein,
   we predicted a series of 2D pentagonal transition metal dichalcogenides,
   namely penta-MS2 (M = Mn, Ni, Cu/Ag and Zn/Cd) monolayers with alpha and
   beta configurations, by means of systematic density functional theory
   (DFT) computations. Six alpha-MS2 monolayers (M = Mn, Ni, Cu/Ag and
   Zn/Cd) and four beta-MS2 monolayers (M = Ni, Ag, Zn and Cd) were found
   to have sound thermodynamic, dynamic, thermal, and mechanical
   stabilities, and the coexistence of covalent and ionic bonding
   contributes to the structural stability of the pentagonal frameworks.
   All these 10 stable monolayers have low in-plane Young's moduli (8-94 N
   m(-1)), among which pentagonal beta-MS2 (M = Ni, Zn and Cd) monolayers
   have negative Poisson's ratios (NPRs). Three monolayers (alpha-CuS2,
   alpha-AgS2, and beta-AgS2) are metallic, and seven penta-MS2 monolayers
   (M = Ni, Zn and Cd with both alpha- and beta-phases, and alpha-MnS2) are
   semiconducting with band gaps in the range of 2.45-3.32 eV, and these
   band gaps can be tuned to 1.70-3.05 eV under rather feasible external
   strains (-8\% to 8\%). Notably, two monolayers, namely, alpha-NiS2 and
   beta-ZnS2, are promising candidates for the photocatalysis of water
   splitting under neutral conditions. This work not only predicted 10 new
   2D pentagonal transition metal dichalcogenides as synthesis targets, but
   also identified their promising applications for flexible nanomechanics,
   nanoelectronics and photocatalysis for water-splitting.}},

Pages = {{4135-4142}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study
   the effect of rippling on the Poisson's ratio of graphene. Due to the
   atomic scale thickness of graphene, out-of-plane ripples are generated
   in free standing graphene with topological defects (e.g. heptagons and
   pentagons) to release the in-plane deformation energy. Through MD
   simulations, we have found that the Poisson's ratio of rippled graphene
   decreases upon increasing its aspect ratio eta (amplitude over
   wavelength). For the rippled graphene sheet eta = 0.188, a negative
   Poisson's ratio of -0.38 is observed for a tensile strain up to 8\%,
   while the Poisson's ratio for eta = 0.066 is almost zero. During
   uniaxial tension, the ripples gradually become flat, thus the Poisson's
   ratio of rippled graphene is determined by the competing factors of the
   intrinsic positive Poisson's ratio of graphene and the negative
   Poisson's ratio due to the de-wrinkling effect. Besides, the rippled
   graphene exhibits excellent fracture strength and toughness. With the
   combination of its auxetic and excellent mechanical properties, rippled
   graphene may possess potential for application in nano-devices and
   nanomaterials.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, an analytical model of a 3D re-entrant auxetic cellular
   structure has been established based on energy method. In the model the
   overlapping of the struts as well as axial extension or compression
   (mostly neglected in former studies) were taken into consideration to
   make the model applicable when the struts are relative stubby which is
   common in engineering designs. Analytical solutions for the modulus and
   Poisson's ratios of the cellular structure in all principal directions
   were deduced. To validate the analytical model in present study,
   numerical calculations using brick elements were performed on unit cell
   models with periodic boundary conditions, and comparisons of the present
   model with analytical formulae and experimental results available in
   former literatures were also conducted. The results show that when the
   struts are slender enough, the bending of the struts play decisive role
   on the deformation of the structure and other mechanisms can be ignored;
   while when the struts become relative stubby, all the mechanisms
   including bending, shearing and axial loading need to be considered; The
   often-ignored axial extension or compression term may even play decisive
   role on determining the lateral Poisson's ratio of the structure when
   the struts are relative stubby. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Boron arsenate, BAsO4, is crystalline material (I4 over bar group) that
   was recently shown to be auxetic in its (001) plane for loading in any
   direction in this plane, and, which exhibits negative linear
   compressibility at elevated pressured in its {[}001] direction. This
   work presents and discusses the results of extensive density functional
   theory (DFT) based simulations aimed at studying deformations that such
   crystals undergo when subjected to shear loading in an attempt to obtain
   a better insight into the manner in which this material responds to
   mechanical loads. The deformations for shearing in the (001) plane are
   described in terms of the `rotating squares' model, which was used to
   explain the auxeticity in the same plane where it was shown that shear
   loading results primarily in deformations which make the `squares'
   become `parallelogram-like' rather than rotate. This lack of rigidity in
   projected `squares' was discussed by looking at changes in bond lengths
   and bond angles.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{As one of the most popular 3D printed metamaterials, the auxetic
   structure with its tunable Poisson's ratio has attracted huge amount of
   attention recently. In this study, we designed an auxetic shape-memory
   metamaterial, which showed designable buckling responses by using the
   thermomechanically coupled in-plane instability. The influence of
   viscoelasticity on in-plane moduli and Poisson's ratios of shape-memory
   auxetic metamaterial was experimentally investigated. Based on the
   generalized Maxwell model and finite-element method, the buckling
   behaviors and their main influence factors were studied. The analytical
   results and experimental ones showed a good agreement. Thermomechanical
   properties of the printed metamaterials govern the temperature and
   strain rate-dependent buckling, and a controllable transition from the
   negative to positive Poisson's ratio in the metamaterials can be
   achieved. Based on the shape memory effect, the buckled state and the
   Poisson's ratio of the metamaterials can be tuned by programmed
   thermomechanical processes. This study provides a simple and efficient
   way to generate morphing structures using the designable buckling
   effect.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a shape memory polymer (SMP) based syntactic foam was
   prepared and programmed by a two-dimensional (2-D) stress condition
   (tension in one direction and compression in a transverse direction).
   Thermomechanical properties and microstructures of the foam were
   characterized. The results show that the 2-D programming method leads
   the foam towards anisotropy from original isotropy. It is found that,
   depending on the strain levels in the post-programming uniaxial
   compression or uniaxial tension tests, the programmed foam exhibits
   negative Poisson's ratio in the two programmed directions, regardless of
   the loading direction during the uniaxial testing of the programmed
   foam. The negative Poisson's ratio may be beneficial for some
   applications such as sealant in expansion joint, car bumper, seat

Abstract = {{A study of the mechanical properties of poly(ferrocenyldimethylsilane)
   {[}Fe(eta-C5H4)(2)SiMe2](n), 3, a novel organometallic polymer, has been
   performed on thin films of this material. The Young's modulus and
   Poisson's ratio of film samples (15 x I x 1 mm) of 3 were measured in
   quasi-static tension using a video extensometer. For 3, the values of
   the Young's moduli (E) and Poisson's ratios W were similar between axes
   in the plane and independent of the splicing direction used during
   sample preparation. The mean and standard deviation of the Young's
   modulus and Poisson's ratio were 0.78 +/- 0.08 GPa and 0.37 +/- 0.06
   GPa, respectively. Thermomechanical analysis of 3 revealed a steady
   decrease of E from a room temperature value of approximately 0.70 GPa.
   Additionally, it was found that at 150 degrees C, 3 was unable to
   support even small stresses, consistent with the onset of a melt
   transition (ca. 135 degrees C). A mathematical model based on molecular
   geometry is developed to describe the results. (c) 2005 Wiley

Abstract = {{In this paper, a 3D augmented re-entrant cellular structure (ARCS) is
   proposed and its Poisson's ratios and elastic properties can bemodulated
   in a wide range. Based on the classical beam theory, the elastic
   properties on the principle directions are obtained as functions of the
   structural parameters and then are verified by finite element method
   (FEM) simulations. Compared with the classical 3D re-entrant cellular
   structure (RCS), the Young's moduli of the new 3D structure on the
   principal directions show a significant increase, and the Poisson's
   ratio can be tunable with the control of the internal parameters of
   cellular structure. In addition, the elastic properties on off-axis
   directions are obtained by analytical solutions, which show that the
   Young's moduli on the off-axis directions are much lower than the
   principle ones. In addition, the shear moduli also show strong
   dependence on the loading directions. Moreover, by stretching in the
   principal directions, the ARCS expands in all vertical directions when
   the moduli ratio is below 0.5. However, stretching in the off-axis
   directions, the Poisson's ratios are no longer negative in its vertical
   directions. The results suggest a possible approach to design new
   auxetic materials with tunable Poisson's ratios for engineering
   applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We experimentally determined the uniaxial compressive stress-strain
   responses of an auxetic polyurethane (PU) foam at quasi-static (0.01/s),
   intermediate (1/s, 10/s and 745/s) and high (1430/s, 1870/s and 2290/s)
   strain rates. A hydraulically driven materials testing system (MTS) was
   used to perform the experiments at the strain rate of 0.1/s, 1/s and
   10/s, while higher intermediate (745/s) and high strain-rate compressive
   loadings were introduced using long and regular Kolsky bars,
   respectively. The Poisson effect of the auxetic PU foam was also
   investigated during the experiments using a precision LED optical
   micrometer system (OMS) (0.01/s-10/s) or an ultra-high speed camera
   (745/s-2290/s). Our results show that the compressive stress-strain
   curves of the auxetic PU foam are non-linear and strain-rate sensitive.
   In all the experiments, the Poisson's ratio, with an initial negative
   value at small strains, progressively increased toward 0 as the specimen
   was further compressed. The strain-rate effect on the material's
   Poisson's ratio is also evident in our study, as the specimens subjected
   to high strain-rate loadings exhibited smaller negative Poisson's ratios
   (NPR) in absolute sense at small strains in comparing with those at
   quasi-static and intermediate strain rates.}},

Abstract = {{As high-temperature structural materials, L1(2) intermetallic compounds
   have attracted the strong interest from both fundamental and industrial
   aspects. Understanding of elastic property is a basis for the complete
   investigations of mechanical behavior of L1(2) alloys. In an effort to
   explore the electronic origin of elastic properties of L1(2)
   intermetallics, we have performed a systematic study on elastic
   constants for single crystals, and Young's modulus, shear modulus, bulk
   modulus and Poisson's ratio for poly-crystals of 22 known Al3X and
   X3Al-type (X= transition or main group metal) intermetallics using the
   ab initio calculations. Based on the calculations of elastic constants
   and extreme (both positive and negative) Poisson's ratios, we found a
   pronounced correlation between the extreme Poisson's ratio and the
   elastic anisotropy, i.e., approximate 40\% of the investigated L1(2)
   intermetallics exhibit intrinsic auxetic behavior. Furthermore, based on
   the distribution of bonding charge densities, we revealed that the
   ductility and extreme Poisson's ratios were attributable to the
   directionality of bonds of these alloys. Our findings provide a new
   method to predict mechanical behavior of intermetallics. (C) 2012

Title = {{Ab initio elastic properties of talc from 0 to 12 GPa: Interpretation of
   seismic velocities at mantle pressures and prediction of auxetic
   behaviour at low pressure}},
Journal = {{EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{274}},
Number = {{3-4}},
Pages = {{327-338}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{Talc is a hydrous magnesium rich layered silicate that is widely
   disseminated in the Earth from the seafloor to over 100 kin depth, in
   ultra-high pressure metamorphism of oceanic crust. In this paper we
   determine the single crystal elastic constants at pressures from 0 to 12
   GPa of talc triclinic(C (1) over bar) and monoclinic(C2/c) polytypes
   using ab initio methods. We find that talc has an extraordinarily high
   elastic anisotropy at zero pressure that reduces with increasing
   pressure. The exceptional anisotropy is complemented by a negative
   Poisson's ratio for many directions in crystal space. Calculations show
   that talc is not only one of very few common minerals to exhibit auxetic
   behaviour, but the magnitude of this effect may be the largest reported
   so far for a mineral. The compression (Vp) and shear (Vs) wave velocity
   anisotropy is 80\% and 85\% for the triclinic polytype. At pressures
   where talc is known be stable in the Earth (up to 5 GPa) the Vp and Vs
   anisotropy is reduced to about 40\% for both velocities, which is still
   a very high value. Vp is slow parallel to the c-axis and fast
   perpendicular to it. This remains unchanged with increasing pressure and
   is observed in both polytypes. The shear wave splitting (difference
   between fast and slow S-wave velocities) at low pressure has high values
   in the plane normal to the c-axis, with a maximum near the a{*}-axis in
   the triclinic and the b-axis in the monoclinic polytype. The c-axis is
   the direction of minimum splitting. The pattern of shear wave splitting
   does not change significantly with pressure. The volume fraction of talc
   varies between 11 and 41\% for hydrated mantle rocks, but the lack of
   data on the crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO) precludes a
   detailed analysis of the impact of talc on seismic anisotropy in
   subduction zones. However, it is highly likely that CPO can easily
   develop in zones of deformation due to the platy habit of talc crystals.
   For random aggregates of talc, the isotropic Vp, Vs and Vp/Vs ratio have
   significantly lower values than those of antigorite and may explain
   low-velocity regions in the mantle wedge. Vp/Vs ratios are more complex
   in anisatropic media because there are fast and slow S-waves, resulting
   in Vp/Vs1 and Vp/Vs2 ratios for every propagation direction, making
   interpretation difficult in deformed polycrystalline talc with a CPO.
   Talc on the subduction plate boundary can strongly influence guided wave
   velocity as CPO would develop in this region of intense shearing. The
   very low coefficient of friction (<0.1) of talc above 100 degrees C
   could also explain silent earthquakes at shallow depths (ca 30 km) along
   the subduction plate boundaries, frequently responsible for tsunami. (C)

Abstract = {{A novel mechanism for slithering locomotion of a snake-like soft robot
   is presented. A rectangular beam with an isotropic coefficient of
   friction of its contact surface with the flat ground can move forward or
   backward when actuated by a periodic traveling sinusoidal wave. The
   Poisson's ratio of the beam plays an important role in the slithering
   locomotion speed and direction, particularly when it is negative. A
   theoretical model is proposed to elucidate the slithering locomotion
   mechanism, which is analogous to the rolling of a wheel on ground. There
   are two key factors of slithering locomotion: a rotational velocity
   field and a corresponding local contact region between the beam and
   ground. During wriggling motion of the rectangular beam, a rotational
   velocity field is observed near the maximum curvature point of the beam.
   If the beam has a negative Poisson's ratio, the axial tension will cause
   a lateral expansion so that the contact region between the beam and
   ground is located at the outer edge of the maximum curvature (the
   largest lateral expansion point). The direction of the beam's velocity
   at this outer edge is usually opposite to the traveling wave direction,
   so the friction force propels the beam in the direction of the traveling
   wave. A similar scenario is found for the relatively large amplitude of
   wriggling motion when the beam's Poisson's ratio is positive. Finite
   element method (FEM) simulation was conducted to verify the slithering
   locomotion mechanism, and good agreement was found between the FEM
   simulation results and theoretical predictions. The insights obtained
   here present a simple, novel and straightforward mechanism for
   slithering locomotion and are helpful for future designs of snake-like
   soft robots.}},

Abstract = {{Mechanical properties of a thin magnetic film subjected to an external,
   rotating magnetic field have been studied by computer simulations. The
   film is modeled by a two-dimensional bead-spring model of a nonmagnetic
   polymer matrix with inclusions of magnetic nanoparticles (nanograins) of
   uniaxial anisotropy, The isotropic polymer matrix is represented as a
   hexagonal structure with sites decorated with small hexagonal particles
   containing magnetic nanograins. The beads correspond to polymer segments
   and the springs between them imitate chemical bonds, approximated by
   harmonic interactions. The beads also interact by the Lennalcl-Jones
   potential whose role is to mimic the core of non-bonded polymer
   segments.
   The Poisson ratio of the constructed polymer matrix is negative, i.e.
   the system expands laterally under longitudinal stretching force. It is
   shown that the magneto-elastic coupling can be used to control the
   expansion and contraction of the polymer matrix. Depending on the
   applied magnetic field, the Poisson ratio of the magnetic film may
   assume positive or negative Values. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Sandwich panels with auxetic lattice cores confined between metallic
   facets are proposed for localised impact resistance applications. Their
   performance under localised impact is numerically studied, considering
   the rate-dependent effects. The behaviour of the composite structure
   material at high strain rates is modelled with the Johnson-Cook model.
   Parametric analyses are conducted to assess the performance of different
   designs of the hybrid composite structures. The results are compared
   with monolithic panels of equivalent areal mass and material in terms of
   deformations and plastic energy dissipation. Design parameters
   considered for the parametric analyses include the auxetic unit cell
   effective Poisson's ratio, thickness of the facet, material properties
   and radius of the unit cell's struts. Significant reduction in
   computational time is achieved by modelling a quarter of the panel, with
   shell elements for facets and beam elements for the auxetic core. With
   projectile impacts up to 200m/s, the auxetic composite panels are found
   to be able to absorb a similar amount of energy through plastic
   deformation, while the maximum back facet displacements are reduced up
   to 56\% due to localised densification and plastic deformation of the
   auxetic core.}},

Abstract = {{Graphene-based materials with a negative Poisson's ratio have numerous
   potential applications in various fields. However, the modification of
   graphene is cumbersome and may worsen the mechanical properties. The
   scale limitation and structural instabilities of suspended graphene are
   also unfavorable for practical applications. In the present study, we
   design several nanolayered graphene/Cu composites and investigate their
   tensile behavior using molecular dynamics simulations. The nanolayered
   composites exhibit an apparent auxetic behavior without any modification
   of graphene, as the graphene/Cu interface can significantly enhance the
   surface effect and lead to an earlier phase transformation of the Cu
   component. A simultaneous occurrence of a positive and negative
   Poisson's ratio can be achieved in an asymmetric composite due to the
   good blocking effect of graphene on two separated Cu films. Materials
   with simultaneous negative/positive Poisson's ratio have potential
   applications in scaffold design, where it is necessary to tune the
   magnitude and polarity of the Poisson's ratio in tissue engineering.
   Furthermore, we propose a composite consisting of alternating multilayer
   graphene and thin Cu films to overcome the scale limitation, whose
   negative Poisson's ratio persists when the total thickness exceeds 100
   nm. It is found that the change in the absolute value of Poisson's ratio
   becomes smaller with an increase in total thickness. Graphene/Cu
   composites with only a slight deformation under external loading may be
   suitable for the fabrication of telecommunication cables, whose
   dimensions should remain unchanged when subjected to high hydrostatic
   pressure in the deep ocean.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials have a negative Poisson's ratio, which can enhance
   other properties. Greater indentation resistance and energy absorption,
   as well as synclastic curvature, could lend auxetic materials well to
   protective sports equipment and clothing. Sheets of foam often form
   padding within protective equipment, but producing large homogenous
   auxetic foam samples is challenging. The aim of this work was to
   investigate techniques to fabricate large thin sheets of auxetic foam,
   to facilitate future production and testing of prototype sports
   equipment utilizing this material. A mold was developed to fabricate
   sheets of auxetic foam - with planar dimensions measuring 350x350mm -
   using the thermo-mechanical process. The mold utilized through-thickness
   rods to control lateral compression of foam. Sheets of auxetic foam
   measuring 10x350x350mmd were fabricated and characterized. Each sheet
   was cut into nine segments, with density measurements used to determine
   how evenly the foam had been compressed during fabrication. Specimens
   cut from corner and centre segments were subject to quasi-static
   extension up to 30\% to obtain stress versus strain relationships, with
   Digital Image Correlation used to determine Poisson's ratio. Specimens
   cut from the corner tended to have a marginally higher density, lower
   stiffness and more consistent negative Poisson's ratio compared to those
   from the centre, indicating some inconsistency in the conversion
   process. Future work could look to improve fabrication techniques for
   large thin homogenous sheets of auxetic foam.}},

Abstract = {{Sandwich structures have superior mechanical properties to be applied in
   civil, marine, mechanical and aerospace engineering fields. Auxetic
   structures with negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) can contract laterally

   cylindrical sandwich filled with double arrowed auxetic structure is
   proposed. An analytical model is established to predict the dynamic
   responses of the sandwich structure under axial impact loading. The
   theoretical model is composed of three parts: energy dissipated due to
   the auxetic filler, the thin walled tubes, and their interaction.
   Numerical simulations are performed to validate the theoretical model
   and the results indicate that the theoretical model proposed is accurate

Abstract = {{Mechanical behaviors of a new foam filled 2D re-entrant hexagonal
   honeycomb with negative Poisson's ratio under planar compression have
   been investigated in this paper. Re-entrant hexagonal unit cell
   specimens were fabricated by aluminum alloy and polyurethane foam. The
   deformation modes and force-displacement curves of the unit cell
   specimens under compression were carried out experimentally and
   numerically, and a good agreement was observed between experimental
   results and numerical simulation results. Subsequently, mechanical
   behaviors of foam filled and void re-entrant hexagonal honeycomb under
   planar compression were observed by numerical simulation. Compared to
   the void honeycomb, the foam filled honeycomb has a higher specific
   energy absorption capability due to a higher plateau stress. According
   to the mechanism of auxetic effect, the re-entrant honeycomb would move
   inward when subjected to compression along the orthogonal direction,
   which cause a biaxial compression of the foam and an increasing of
   stiffness/strength/energy absorption capability. The present
   investigations provide thorough insight into the strengthened re-entrant
   hexagonal cellular honeycomb, and could be used in the development of
   novel light weight smart functional structures.}},

Abstract = {{Analytical model derivations for predictions of the on-axis Poisson's
   ratios of the -cristobalite' framework of corner-sharing tetrahedra are
   presented in full, for the first time, for a previously reported second
   tetrahedral rotation mechanism. Parametric analyses are performed for
   each of the three concurrent models (two 2-mode models where dilation
   acts with each rotation mechanism (the CTM1 and CTM2 models), and the
   model where all three mechanisms operate (CTM3)) to explore the
   Poisson's ratio dependency on the key model geometrical and deformation
   strength parameters. Predictions in good agreement with all experimental
   on-axis Poisson's ratios specifically for silica -cristobalite are
   possible for the new CTM3 model comprising two tetrahedral rotation
   mechanisms acting concurrently with tetrahedral dilation when
   direction-dependent strength parameters are employed. This is a
   significant improvement over the previous analytical model incorporating
   the tetrahedral dilation and first tetrahedral rotation mechanisms and
   which only achieved good agreement for loading along the longitudinal
   x(3) axis. (C) 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA, Weinheim}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports a development of bi-stretch auxetic woven fabrics by
   using non-auxetic yarns and weaving technology. The fabric structure is
   first designed based on a re-entrant hexagonal geometry by combination
   of loose weave and tight weave in a woven fabric structure, and then
   fabricated on a rapier weaving machine by using both non-elastic and
   elastic yarns. Two variations of the fabric are produced by using
   different elastic yarn arrangement in weft direction. The designed
   auxetic geometry is finally achieved after a washing process due to
   creation of non-uniform contraction or shrinkage profiles within the
   fabric structural unit cell. The testing results showed that the
   developed fabrics exhibit negative Poisson ratio effect in both weft and
   warp directions in a large range of tensile strain.}},

Title = {{Femur Auxetic Meta-Implants with Tuned Micromotion Distribution}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Stress shielding and micromotions are the most significant problems
   occurring at the bone-implants interface due to a mismatch of their
   mechanical properties. Mechanical 3D metamaterials, with their
   exceptional behaviour and characteristics, can provide an opportunity to
   solve the mismatch of mechanical properties between the bone and
   implant. In this study, a new porous femoral hip meta-implant with
   graded Poisson's ratio distribution was introduced and its results were
   compared to three other femoral hip implants (one solid implant, and two
   porous meta-implants, one with positive and the other with a negative
   distribution of Poisson's ratio) in terms of stress and micromotion
   distributions. For this aim, first, a well-known auxetic 3D re-entrant
   structure was studied analytically, and precise closed-form analytical
   relationships for its elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio were derived.
   The results of the analytical solution for mechanical properties of the
   3D re-entrant structure presented great improvements in comparison to
   previous analytical studies on the structure. Moreover, the
   implementation of the re-entrant structure in the hip implant provided
   very smooth results for stress and strain distributions in the lattice
   meta-implants and could solve the stress shielding problem which
   occurred in the solid implant. The lattice meta-implant based on the
   graded unit cell distribution presented smoother stress-strain
   distribution in comparison with the other lattice meta-implants.
   Moreover, the graded lattice meta-implant gave minimum areas of local
   stress and local strain concentration at the contact region of the
   implants with the internal bone surfaces. Among all the cases, the
   graded meta-implant also gave micromotion levels which are the closest
   to values reported to be desirable for bone growth (40 mu m).}},

Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel three-dimensional (3D) lattice honeycomb is
   developed based on a twodimensional (2D) accordion-like honeycomb. A
   combination of theoretical and numerical analysis is carried out to gain
   a deeper understanding of the elastic behavior of the new honeycomb and
   its dependence on the geometric parameters. The results show that the
   proposed new honeycomb can simultaneously achieve an in-plane negative
   Poisson's ratio (NPR) effect and an out-of-plane zero Poisson's ratio
   (ZPR) effect. This unique property may be very promising in some
   important fields, like aerospace, piezoelectric sensors and biomedicine
   engineering. The results also show that the geometric parameters, such
   as the slant angle, the strut thickness and the relative density, have a
   significant effect on the mechanical properties. Additionally, different
   dominant deformation models of the new honeycomb when compressed along
   the x (or y) and z directions are identified. This work provides a new
   concept for the design of honeycombs with a doubly unusual performance.}},

Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic materials and structures exhibit a negative Poisson's ratio
   while thick plates encounter shear deformation, which is not accounted
   for in classical plate theory. This paper investigates the effect of a
   negative Poisson's ratio on thick plates that are subjected to buckling
   loads, taking into consideration the shear deformation using Mindlin
   plate theory. Using a highly accurate shear correction factor that
   allows for the effect of Poisson's ratio, the elastic stability of
   circular and square plates are evaluated in terms of dimensionless
   parameters, namely the Mindlin-to-Kirchhoff critical buckling load ratio
   and Mindlin critical buckling load factors. Results for thick square
   plates reveal that both parameters increase as the Poisson's ratio
   becomes more negative. In the case of thick circular plates, the
   Mindlin-to-Kirchhoff critical buckling load ratios and the Mindlin
   critical buckling load factors increase and decrease, respectively, as
   the Poisson's ratio becomes more negative. The results obtained herein
   show that thick auxetic plates behave as thin conventional plates, and
   therefore suggest that the classical plate theory can be used to
   evaluate the elastic stability of thick plates if the Poisson's ratio of
   the plate material is sufficiently negative. The results also suggest
   that materials with highly negative Poisson's ratios are recommended for
   square plates, but not circular plates, that are subjected to buckling
   loads.}},

Abstract = {{Low coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) lattices occupy a unique area
   of property space. With such a system, it is possible to achieve
   relatively high stiffness, with opportunities to combine low thermal
   expansion and with a range of advantageous properties. Possibilities
   include combinations that are not rivaled by any bulk material, e.g.,
   low CTE and high melting temperature, and low CTE with low conductivity.
   One design in particular, the UCSB Lattice, has biaxial stiffness very
   near theoretical upper bounds when the joints are pinned. Bonded
   lattices are found to inherit the near optimal performance of the parent
   pin-jointed design. Despite near optimal performance, however,
   stiffnesses and strengths are limited to a few percent of the relative
   property of the constituents. The local deformations necessary to
   accommodate low net CTE are similar to those of auxetic lattices, with
   similar behavior, having a low, zero, or negative tunable Poisson's
   ratio. An investigative framework, including experiments, finite
   element, and analytical formulas, is used to construct these
   assessments.}},

Abstract = {{The bumper system always directly causes the injury of the pedestrian
   leg in the car-pedestrian accidents. Therefore, it is of practical
   significance to optimize the bumper structure to enhance the protective
   effect of the pedestrian leg. Based on the original bumper system, this
   work proposes a novel negative Poisson's ratio energy-absorbing forepart
   with inner hexagonal cellular structure, which is designed at the lower
   leg impact zone between the bumper beam and the cover. The parametric
   model of the negative Poisson's ratio forepart, the lower legform
   impactor model, and the car-pedestrian collision model are firstly
   established. Then, through integrating the response surface method,
   second-order reliability method, and archive-based micro genetic
   algorithm, a reliability optimization design is further conducted for
   the negative Poisson's ratio forepart based on the deterministic
   optimization results. Simulation results show that the optimized
   negative Poisson's ratio forepart not only can significantly enhance the
   reliability and robustness, but also improve the protective effect of

Abstract = {{Using experimental data, it is shown that the Poisson's ratios of
   standard (untreated) open cell polyurethane foam vary when loading in
   different loading directions, since foam is inherently asymmetric and
   anisotropic. The loading direction which is in plane orthogonal to the
   rise direction of the foam constantly exhibited the most negative
   Poisson's ratio across foam samples of different types, even at moderate
   compressive strains. It was also shown that although the foam may become
   auxetic at very high values of compressive strain, it shows an
   incremental negative Poisson's ratio at moderate compressive strains.
   The results obtained are discussed in light of the deformation
   mechanisms, which have been proposed in literature to explain negative
   Poisson's ratios in foams. The effects of changing loading direction on
   the mechanical response of the foam are highlighted. (C) 2014 WILEY-VCH

   microstructural duality}},
Journal = {{SN APPLIED SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{1}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Neither positive nor negative Poisson's ratio materials are fully
   advantageous across a wide range of load bearing applications. In some
   cases, it is advantageous for structures to possess duality in material
   properties so as to take advantage of auxetic behavior under one loading
   condition as well as conventional behavior when the loading condition
   changes. This paper proposes two metamaterials-the hybrid
   rhombic-re-entrant metamaterial and the hybrid kite-arrowhead
   metamaterial-in which the prescription of either compressive or tensile
   load always leads to lateral expansion. Specifically, the Poisson's
   ratio of these metamaterials range from negative infinity to zero upon
   tensile load, and from zero to positive infinity upon compressive load.
   This duality of auxetic and conventional behavior for each of these
   metamaterial is achieved by employing a simultaneous lock and slide
   mechanism that is interchangeable upon load reversal. When loaded in one
   direction, the locked part takes effect while the sliding part becomes
   redundant. Upon load direction reversal, the previously locked and
   sliding parts convert to sliding and locked parts, respectively, thereby
   activating the redundant part while deactivating the functional part.
   The change in effective microstructural components, therefore,
   facilitates Poisson's ratio sign toggling with load reversal. Due to the
   indiscriminate lateral expansion regardless of the axial loading
   direction, such behavior in a fiber is useful to resist both fiber
   pull-out as well as fiber push-out from the matrix material.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the suitability of auxetic materials for
   load-bearing circular plates. This herein shown that the optimal
   Poisson's ratio for minimizing the bending stresses is strongly
   dependent on the final deformed shape, load distribution, and the type
   of edge supports. Specifically, the use of auxetic material for circular
   plates is recommended when (a) the plate is bent into a spherical or
   spherical-like cap, (b) a point load is applied to the center of the
   plate regardless of the edge conditions, and (c) a uniform load is
   applied on a simply-supported plate. However, auxetic materials are
   disadvantaged when a flat plate is to be bent into a saddle-like shell.
   The optimal Poisson's ratios concept recommended in this paper is useful
   for providing an added design consideration. In most cases, the use of
   auxetic materials for laterally loaded circular plates is more
   advantageous compared to the use of materials with conventional
   Poisson's ratio, with other factors fixed. This is achieved through
   materials-based stress redistribution in addition to the common
   practices of dimensioning-based stress redistribution and materials
   strengthening.}},

Abstract = {{The in-plane dynamic crushing behaviors and energy-absorbed
   characteristics of honeycombs with negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) have
   been studied by means of explicit dynamic finite element analysis (DFEA)
   using ANSYS/LS-DYNA. First, the honeycomb models filled with different
   reentrant cells by the variation of micro-cell configuration parameters
   (cell-wall angle and shape ratio) are established. The respective
   influences of micro-structure and impact velocities on the deformation
   behaviors, the dynamic plateau stresses and the absorbed energy of
   reentrant honeycombs are explored in detail. It is shown that owing to
   the variation of cell micro-structure, reentrant honeycombs display
   different macro-/micro- deformation properties during the crushing. For
   the given impact velocity, the dynamic plateau stresses are related to
   the shape ratio by a power law and to the cell-wall angle by
   least-square curves. And they are also proportional to the square of
   impact velocities for a high impact velocity. Based on the finite
   element simulated results and one-dimensional shock wave theory, an
   empirical formula for auxetic honeycomb to predict the dynamic plateau
   stress is derived in terms of relative density and impact velocity.}},

Abstract = {{The comprehensive elastic properties of Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks
   (ZIF-1 to ZIF-4) have been computed using density functional theory
   (DFT). We employed the periodic CRYSTAL14 code to calculate the
   single-crystal elastic coefficients (C-ij) at the B3LYP level of theory.
   While the chemical compositions of ZIFs-1 to -4 are the same, each
   structure features a distinct network topology, crystal symmetry and
   porosity configuration, which translate into differential
   structure-function mechanical correlations. We elucidate the anisotropic
   mechanical response with respect to the directionally dependent Young's
   and shear moduli properties. Our theoretical results suggest that ZIF-3
   adopting a dft topology has an extremely low shear resistance (G(min) =
   0.1 GPa), which is also underpinning the flexible mechanism responsible
   for its negative Poisson's ratio (auxetic v(min) = -0.43).
   Interestingly, we identified that ZIF-1, ZIF-2, and ZIF-4 could exhibit
   a nearly zero Poisson's ratio for certain crystal orientations, which is
   reminescent of a rare ``cork-like{''} phenomenon where there is
   practically no lateral deformation corresponding to an applied axial
   strain. Furthermore, we determined the bulk moduli and linear
   compressibilities, alongside the averaged elastic properties of the ZIF
   polycrystals.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of the paper is to study the effect of negative Poisson's

   framework of steady-state uncoupled linear thermoelasticity. Numerical
   results are presented graphically to demonstrate the effect of negative

Abstract = {{The experimentally verified negative Poisson's ratio of black phosphorus
   allows the extension of the medical and defense applications to the

   W-phase antimonene does not by using first-principles calculations. By
   putting these systems into a collective perspective with other puckered

Abstract = {{Auxetic textiles have been the focus of much attention due to their
   great promise for advanced protective clothing, flexible energy harvest
   devices, and functional textiles. Herein, plain fabric, basket fabric,
   and a derivative weave with the warp and weft yarns arrangement in a
   series of zigzags were prepared by incorporating different initial wrap
   density helical auxetic yarns in the weft direction using a commercial
   semi-automatic loom. The derivative weave using HAYs with a 150 m(-1)
   initial wrap density as the weft yarn not only possesses superior
   auxetic behavior but also has good performance in strength and
   elasticity-essential properties useful for textile daily application.
   This fabric exhibits a high auxetic effect (nu = -0.585), low elastic
   deformation (total deformation of 8.4\% at 20\% strain), excellent
   flexibility, and high break load. Moreover, by taking account of the key
   geometric parameters, a systematic discussion of the fabrics has been
   completed to evaluate the effect on the auxetic behavior; this clarified
   that changing the fabric structure and initial wrap density of a HAY is
   an effective strategy to tailor auxetic behavior without compromising
   the intrinsic properties of components. On the basis of our research,
   auxetic textiles can be considered a promising candidate for
   next-generation smart textiles and advanced functional textiles.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials are a class of materials possessing a negative
   Poisson's ratio. Here, we established a novel method for preparing
   auxetic foam from closed-cell polymer foam based on the steam
   penetration and condensation (SPC) process. Using polyethylene (PE)
   closed-cell foam as an example, the foams treated by the SPC process
   presented a negative Poisson's ratio during stretching and compression
   testing. The effect of steam-treated temperature and time on the
   conversion efficiency of negativePoisson's ratio foam was investigated,
   and the mechanism of the SPC method for forming a reentrant structure
   was discussed. The results indicated that the presence of enough steam
   within the cells was a critical factor for the negative Poisson's ratio
   conversion in the SPC process. The pressure difference caused by steam
   condensation was the driving force for the conversion from conventional
   closed-cell foam to the negative-Poisson's ratio foam. Furthermore, the
   applicability of the SPC process for fabricating auxetic foam was
   studied by replacing PE foam by polyvinyl chloride foam with a
   closed-cell structure or replacing water steam by ethanol steam. The
   results verified the universality of the SPC process for fabricating
   auxetic foams from conventional foams with a closed-cell structure. In
   addition, we explored the potential application of the obtained auxetic
   foams by the SPC process in the fabrication of shape-memory polymer
   materials.}},

Abstract = {{A new 2D microstructure is proposed herein in the form of rigid unit
   cells, each taking the form of a cross with two opposing crossbars
   forming slots and the other two opposing crossbars forming sliders. The
   unit cells in the microstructure are arranged in a rectangular array in
   which the nearest four neighboring cells are rotated by 90 degrees such
   that a slider in each unit cell is connected to a slot from its nearest
   neighbor. Using a kinematics approach, the Poisson's ratio along the
   axes of symmetry can be obtained, while the off-axis Poisson's ratio is
   obtained using Mohr's circle. In the special case of a square array, the
   results show that the Poisson's ratio varies between 0 (for loading
   parallel to the axes) and -1 (for loading at 45 degrees from the axes).
   For a rectangular array, the Poisson's ratio varies from 0 (for loading
   along the axes) to a value more negative than -1. The obtained results
   suggest the proposed microstructure is useful for designing materials
   that permit rapid change in Poisson's ratio for angular change.}},

Abstract = {{A cylindrical negative Poisson's ratio (CNPR) structure based on
   two-dimensional double-arrow negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) structure
   was introduced in this paper. The CNPR structure has excellent
   stiffness, damping and energy absorption performances, and can be
   applied as spring, damper and energy absorbing components. In this
   study, the CNPR structure was used as a jounce bumper in vehicle
   suspension, and the load-displacement curve of NPR jounce bumper was
   discussed. Moreover, the influences of structural parameters and
   materials on the load-displacement curve of NPR jounce bumper were
   specifically researched. It came to the conclusion that only the numbers
   of cells and layers impact the hardening displacement of NPR jounce
   bumper. And all parameters significantly affect the structure stiffness
   at different displacement periods. On the other hand, the
   load-displacement curve of NPR jounce bumper should be in an ideal
   region which is difficult to be achieved applying mathematical
   optimization method. Therefore, a parametric design strategy of NPR
   jounce bumper was proposed according to the parametric analysis results.
   The design strategy had two main steps: design of hardening displacement
   and design of stiffness. The analysis results proved that the proposed
   method is reliable and is also meaningful for relevant structure design
   problem.}},

Volume = {{137}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{This short brief develops a model for the velocity of longitudinal wave
   propagation in auxetic rods. Due to the large density change in auxetic
   solids and significant lateral deformation for Poisson's ratio between
   -1 and -0.5, this note takes into consideration density correction and
   lateral inertia. Results show that deviation from the elementary wave
   propagation model becomes more significant the more the Poisson's ratio
   of the rod material deviates from 1/4, in which the deviation of wave
   velocity is insignificant for Poisson's ratio in the positive range, but
   significant in the negative range. Specifically, the tensile and
   compressive wave velocity increases and decreases, respectively, for
   Poisson's ratio less than 1/4, but this trend reverses for Poisson's
   ratio greater than 1/4. In addition to showing that the elementary wave
   propagation model is invalid for describing the longitudinal wave
   velocity in auxetic rods, the results also suggest that auxetic
   materials are useful for applications that require slowing down and
   speeding up of compressive and tensile wave propagations, respectively.}},

   stretching and bond rotating modes determines the in-plane Poisson's
   ratio behavior. While the bond stretching mode always tends to increase
   the in-plane auxeticity, the bond rotating mode might increase or
   decrease the in-plane auxeticity. Furthermore, we show that graphite
   also exhibits an in-plane negative Poisson's ratio at finite strains due

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials, which have negative Poisson's ratio, show potential
   to be used in many interesting applications. Finite element analysis
   (FEA) is an important phase in implementing auxetic materials, but may
   become computationally expensive because simulation often needs
   microscale details and a fine mesh. It is also necessary to check that
   topological aspects of the microscale reflects not only micro but
   macromechanical behavior. This work presents a phenomenological approach
   to the problem using data-driven spline-based techniques to properly
   characterize orthotropic auxetic material requiring neither analytical
   constraints nor micromechanics, expanding on previous methods for
   isotropic materials. Hyperelastic energies of auxetic orthotropic
   material are determined from experimental data by solving the
   equilibrium differential functional equations directly, so no fitting or
   analytical estimation is necessary. This offers two advantages; (i) it
   allows the FEA study of orthotropic auxetic materials without requiring
   micromechanics considerations, reducing modeling and computational time
   costs by two to three orders of magnitude; (ii) it adapts the
   hyperelastic energies to the nature of the material with precision,
   which could be critical in scenarios where accuracy is essential (e.g.
   robotic surgery). (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   Density change of auxetic foams after manufacturing is a common feature

   combination of polyurethane-polyethylene) foams with NPR are produced
   from two similar native materials using both the classical and the novel
   custom manufacturing methods. In the classical manufacturing route the
   cooling process is typically carried out with the foam in a confined
   state. Conversely, in the new manufacturing process it was substituted
   with a release process. Samples were subjected to both tensile and
   compressive loading, as well as density measurements. A thorough
   mechanical characterisation of the foams is described, linking the
   mechanical properties with their change in density after conversion into

Abstract = {{Large auxetic properties of iron-gallium and iron-aluminum alloys have
   been investigated with both theoretical and experimental approaches.
   Tensile tests of single-crystal iron-gallium alloys with compositions of
   12\%-25\% gallium were conducted to determine the composition dependent
   values of the Poisson's ratio. Systematic density functional
   calculations revealed a simple correlation between the Poisson's ratio
   and tetragonal shear modulus. We attribute the auxetic properties of
   these intermetallic alloys to the drastic reduction in C' with the
   presence of metalloid atoms in the DO(3)-type structures. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{In the current work we analyze the bulk and normal to shear properties
   of a wide range of two-dimensional artificial materials under small
   deformations. To that scope, we employ reentrant, chiral, triangular and
   rectangular-shaped based unit-cell arrangements. We characterize their
   mechanical response, using a homogenization analysis method. We identify
   inner material architectures of high and low relative resistance to
   pressure and to shear loads. We classify the metastructures' mechanical
   behavior with respect to the one expected for common isotropic
   engineering materials. We observe considerable differences for most of
   the analyzed structures for which we provide insights making use of
   symmetry analysis notions. What is more, we identify lightweight inner
   material designs for certain bulk and normal to shear behaviors to be
   obtained, while we unravel the role of the Poisson's ratio value on the
   retrieved effective attributes. We quantify the impact of alterations in
   the metamaterials' inner design parameters, such as in the slenderness
   ratio of its inner elements, reporting unit-cell designs that yield
   macroscopic relative mechanical properties (bulk and normal to shear
   attributes) that are insensitive to inner element slenderness changes.}},

Abstract = {{Fully generalised analytical expressions for longitudinal Poisson's
   ratio are developed for armchair and zigzag Single-Walled Nanotubes
   (SWNTs) using an energy equivalent approach. Deformation is assumed due
   to simultaneous bond stretching and bond angle variation in response to
   an applied axial load. A parametric study is then performed to explore
   under what circumstances SWNTs may exhibit auxetic (negative Poisson's
   ratio) response. In principle, auxetic behaviour can be achieved by
   modifying the hexagonal cell shape to adopt a re-entrant geometry for
   the case of bond angle variation being the dominant deformation
   mechanism. Alternatively, altering the length of the characteristic bond
   oriented in an off-axis direction to below a critical. value or
   modifying the force constants governing the deformation modes so that
   bond stretching dominates for the conventional hexagonal cell shape can
   also lead to auxetic behaviour. (C) 2008 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co.

   of a layered re-entrant honeycomb (( 2,8)-reflexyne) were studied in
   detail for a uniaxial load applied along the x(2) direction. The

   honeycomb theory. Transformation from negative to positive Poisson's
   ratio behaviour is predicted at an applied stress of sigma(2) = 2 GPa.
   Simulations of the loading of C-60 and C-70 guest molecules into the

Abstract = {{The term ``mechanical metamaterials{''} encompasses a wide range of
   systems whose anomalous mechanical properties arise primarily from their
   structure rather than composition. This unique characteristic gives the
   man edge over many conventional natural or readily available materials
   and makes them well-suited for a variety of applications where
   tailor-made mechanical properties are required. In this study, we
   present a new class of mechanical metamaterials featuring various
   star-shaped perforations, which have the potential to exhibit auxetic or
   zero Poisson's ratio (nu) properties. Using finite element modelling in
   conjunction with experimental measurements on 3D printed prototypes, we
   demonstrate that these star-shaped porous systems possess the potential
   to retain their unusual mechanical properties up to tensile strains
   exceeding 15\%. By virtue of these exceptional properties, the proposed
   concept could be applied for engineering numerous potential applications
   in a wide range of fields. (c) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{MAY 25}},
Abstract = {{Materials with a negative Poisson's ratio, also known as auxetic
   materials, exhibit unusual and counterintuitive mechanical
   behaviour-becoming fatter in cross-section when stretched. Such
   behaviour is mostly attributed to some special re-entrant or hinged
   geometric structures regardless of the chemical composition and
   electronic structure of a material. Here, using first-principles
   calculations, we report a class of auxetic single-layer two-dimensional
   materials, namely, the 1T-type monolayer crystals of groups 6-7
   transition-metal dichalcogenides, MX2 (M = Mo, W, Tc, Re; X = S, Se,
   Te). These materials have a crystal structure distinct from all other
   known auxetic materials. They exhibit an intrinsic in-plane negative
   Poisson's ratio, which is dominated by electronic effects. We attribute
   the occurrence of such auxetic behaviour to the strong coupling between
   the chalcogen p orbitals and the intermetal t(2g)-bonding orbitals
   within the basic triangular pyramid structure unit. The unusual auxetic
   behaviour in combination with other remarkable properties of monolayer
   two-dimensional materials could lead to novel multi-functionalities.}},

   lightweight and rigid auxetic structures}},
Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In the past decades, auxetic structures have received great attention
   because of their unique properties and outstanding performance over the
   traditional materials. However, the inherent porosity significantly
   reduce the moduli of the structures, making auxetic structures
   inappropriate for load-bearing components. This paper introduces a
   rounded re-entrant honeycomb (RH) pattern, in which the rounded corners
   stiffen the traditional RH pattern by suppressing the hinging mechanism.
   Four design parameters were identified to define a rounded RH unit cell,
   and the effect of each of them on structure properties was numerically
   studied. The results demonstrated the extended tunable range of
   mechanical properties and the possibility of building lightweight and
   stiffer structures, as well as significantly improved tensile and shear
   moduli. It is also noticed that the Poisson's ratio shifts towards
   positive as the radius of the rounded corner increases. Several design
   strategies were proposed for achieving different design goals. The
   proposed rounded RH pattern could be an alternative for the existing RH
   pattern design, especially in the applications requesting for the
   lightweight and rigid auxetic structure.}},

Abstract = {{Finite Element (FE) modelling is used to investigate the effect of
   varying the rib thickness on the mechanical properties of conventional
   and re-entrant periodic honeycombs. The calculations confirm that the
   re-entrant honeycomb has a negative Poisson's ratio. The data show that
   the mechanical properties vary not only with honeycomb relative density,
   but also on how the relative density variation is achieved. Reducing the
   thickness of `vertical' ribs, whilst maintaining constant `diagonal' rib
   thickness, does not alter the Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio in the
   x direction (E-x and V-xv), but does lead to a decrease in the magnitude
   of the y-directed properties (E-v and V-vx). Reducing the diagonal rib
   thickness at constant vertical rib thickness leads to a more marked
   decrease in E-v as well as in E-x, whereas V-xv and V-vx both increase
   in magnitude. An analytical model is also developed to account for
   different vertical and diagonal rib thicknesses, and good agreement with
   the FE model data is achieved. The results have implications for
   applications in which maximising or maintaining mechanical properties
   with respect to relative density is important.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials offer potential to be applied to sports safety
   equipment. This work reports quasi-static and impact testing of auxetic
   open-cell polyurethane foam - fabricated with a compression and heat
   treatment process - in comparison to its conventional counterpart. The
   foam was compressed to 70\% of its original dimension along each
   dimension during the conversion process. Quasi-static compression
   testing confirmed the converted foam to be auxetic, with a Poisson's
   ratio of -0.08. Impact testing was performed for energies up to 5.6 J
   with an instrumented drop rig and high-speed video. Peak accelerations
   were similar to 3 times lower for the auxetic foams, because they
   prevented bottoming. This work has shown further potential for auxetic
   foam to be applied to sports safety devices. Future work should look to
   optimise foam selection and the conversion process, while comparing
   auxetic foam with existing materials and products. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Abstract = {{Auxetic fabrics with traditional filaments and auxetic structures have
   been provided by knitting method; however, the auxetic behavior and
   applicability of woven fabric with auxetic yarns remain to be studied.
   Thus, the paper aims to present the special characters of woven fabrics
   with heliacal auxetic yarns. Auxetic yarns with the maximum value of
   Poisson's ratio -0.88 were used as weft yarns to do the weaving by the
   semi-automatic loom. Then the properties of the fabrics have been tested
   and analyzed under tensions of different directions (warp, weft, and
   diagonal). The results indicated that the fabric presented auxetic
   effect with the maximum value of Poisson's ratio -0.3 under diagonal
   tension and also showed self-curling and self-folding behavior in
   natural state. Moreover, the relationship between properties and fabric
   weaves was also discussed and analyzed. It is expected that the study of
   fabrics with helical auxetic yarns could promote the practical
   applications of auxetic textiles such as the self-folding property for

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials are characterized by getting thiner/larger in
   tension/compression. This counterintuitive behavior is advantageous in
   specific applications such as self-expandable stents. There are
   currently some stents that make use of this behavior, nevertheless there
   are still auxetic geometries that are not explored in this field.
   Additionally, Pure Magnesium is a promising material to manufacture
   bioabsorbable stents. This study presents the modelation of novel
   auxetic self-expanding stents based in Reentrant and Chiral geometries.
   They are simulated using Finite Element analysis to determine the
   presence of negative Poisson's ratios and if they are a possible
   solution for further stent development. It is concluded that such
   modelations show low values of Poisson's ratio and may be a viable
   possibility to obtain a new generation of self-expanding stents.}},

Abstract = {{The present work reports the first attempt of developing auxetic
   structures using high performance fibres through knitting technology.
   Polyamide (PA) and para-aramid (p-AR) fibres and their combination were
   knitted in to purl structures using flatbed knitting machine, varying
   different structural (such as loop length, cover factor and yarn
   density) and machine parameters (such as take-down load). The influence
   of different parameters on negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) was thoroughly
   investigated. It was observed that NPR improved strongly with the
   increase in loop length of knitted structures. NPR also increased with
   the decrease in cover factor and increase in course density of knitted
   fabrics. An increase in take-down load also improved NPR for tightly
   knitted samples, but led to initial decrease and subsequent increase in
   NPR for medium and higher loop lengths; except for p-AR fabrics, which
   showed a decrease in NPR with take-down load for higher loop lengths.
   Tensile properties of the developed auxetic structures were also found
   to depend strongly on fibre type and loop length, and the highest
   tensile performance was achieved with lower loop lengths and p-AR yarns.
   The p-AR fabrics produced using lower loop length and lower take-down
   load resulted in the highest NPR of -0.713. Therefore, the developed
   knitted structures produced using high performance yarns and showing
   strong auxetic effects can have huge potential for industrial
   applications, especially in personal protection materials, such as cut
   resistance fabrics, bullet proof vest, helmets, and so on. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Jounce bumpers in automotive suspension are key components that can
   improve the noise, vibration, and harshness performance of entire
   vehicle. Traditional jounce bumper made of polyurethane usually cannot
   satisfy the mechanical performances required by noise, vibration, and
   harshness optimization. In addition, the application of hyperelastic
   material influenced the efficiency and reliability of numerical
   calculations of polyurethane jounce bumper. In this paper, an
   engineering negative Poisson's ratio structure was introduced and
   applied on the jounce bumper. The negative Poisson's ratio jounce bumper
   can be mainly defined by few structure parameters. The finite element
   analysis of the negative Poisson's ratio jounce bumper was conducted
   applied explicit method. The influences of loading velocity and material
   densities on computational time and numerical results were researched.
   The results indicated that enlargements of material densities and
   loading velocity can improve the computational efficiency and have
   limited influence on reliability. Furthermore, a negative Poisson's
   ratio jounce bumper prototype was manufactured and tested to verify the
   numerical results. It was proved that the finite element analysis of the
   negative Poisson's ratio jounce bumper was reliable both in
   load-displacement curve and deformation shapes. Compared to the
   traditional jounce bumper, the negative Poisson's ratio jounce bumper
   can achieve similar mechanical behavior but with a smoother
   load-displacement curve, which is beneficial to the vehicle's noise,
   vibration, and harshness performance.}},

Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2016}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{We present a novel design of a honeycomb lattice geometry that uses a
   seamless combination of conventional and auxetic cores, i.e. elements
   showing positive and negative Poisson's ratio. The design is aimed at
   tuning and improving the band structure of periodic cellular structures.
   The proposed cellular configurations show a significantly wide band gap
   at much lower frequencies compared to their pure counterparts, while
   still retaining their major dynamic features. Different topologies
   involving both auxetic inclusions in a conventional lattice and
   conversely hexagonal cellular inclusions in auxetic butterfly lattices
   are presented. For all these cases the impact of the varying degree of
   auxeticity on the band structure is evaluated. The proposed cellular
   designs may offer significant advantages in tuning high-frequency
   bandgap behaviour, which is relevant to phononics applications. The
   configurations shown in this paper may be made iso-volumetric and
   iso-weight to a given regular hexagonal topology, making possible to
   adapt the hybrid lattices to existing sandwich structures with fixed
   dimensions and weights. This work also features a comparative study of
   the wave speeds corresponding to different configurations vis-a vis
   those of a regular honeycomb to highlight the superior behaviour of the
   combined hybrid lattice.}},

Abstract = {{The vibration and damping performances of carbon fiber-reinforced
   polymer (CFRP) three-dimensional double-arrow-head (3D DAH) auxetic
   metamaterials are investigated in this paper. The negative Poisson's
   ratio effects of the CFRP 3D DAH auxetic metamaterials are analytically
   studied by the energy method. 3D finite element models based on Modal
   Strain Energy approach are developed to analyze their vibration and
   damping characteristics. To validate the numerical models in the present
   study, the CFRP 3D DAH auxetic metamaterials are designed and
   manufactured. The sine-sweep response tests are conducted to investigate
   their vibration performances. The influence of different inclined
   corrugated angles, and fiber orientations on the natural frequencies,
   loss factors and the nominal Young's modulus are plotted and discussed
   using validated numerical models. Meanwhile, the effect of Poisson's
   ratio on the nominal Young's modulus, natural frequencies and loss
   factors is also revealed explicitly. Furthermore, the comprehensive
   evaluation parameter that simultaneously characterizes the structural
   bearing capacity and vibration damping performance is further improved
   through parameter optimization.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic woven fabrics made of non-auxetic yarns have gained the interest
   of textile scientists in recent times. Such fabrics have already been
   produced and investigated for their negative Poisson's ratio (NPR)
   effect in two principle directions. However, the NPR effect of these
   fabrics in different biased tensile directions has not been studied. In
   particular, the influence of repeated tensile loading on the NPR effect
   retention ability of fabric has not been explored yet. Therefore, this
   paper aims to report the NPR effect of auxetic woven fabric in different
   tensile directions and the influence of repeating tensile cycle tests on
   its NPR effect retention ability. The auxetic woven fabric is firstly
   fabricated based on a re-entrant hexagonal geometrical structure by
   using elastic and non-elastic yarns, and then subjected to single and
   repeating tensile tests in five different tensile directions, which
   include two principle directions and three biased directions. It is
   found that the NPR effect is largely dependent upon the tensile
   direction and the number of repeating tensile cycles.}},

   found that the Poisson ratio exhibits a negative dip near the transition
   temperature for both neutral and ionic NIPA gels. The dip becomes deeper
   and shifts to a higher temperature as the ionic strength increases. The
   negative Poisson ratio of NIPA gels suggests that the bulk modulus is
   much smaller than the shear modulus as gels undergo the phase
   transition. The Poisson ratio of acrylamide gel, however, was found to

Abstract = {{This paper reports a geometrical analysis of auxetic woven fabrics based
   on foldable geometry. Two fabrics having different geometrical
   parameters were first designed and fabricated and then subjected to
   tensile tests in two principal directions. Based on the experimental
   observations of the geometry of one fabric structural unit cell at
   different tensile strains, a geometrical model was first proposed and a
   relationship between the Poisson's ratio and tensile strain was then
   established for each principal direction. Two semi-empirical equations
   are subsequently obtained for both principal directions by fitting the
   established relationships with experimental results. After validation by
   the experimental results of the other fabric, the obtained
   semi-empirical equations were finally used to predict the auxetic

   calculated and experimental results are found to be in excellent

Abstract = {{Auxetic perforated mechanical metamaterials (APMMs) with artificially
   designed architectures have attracted growing attention in recent years
   due to the relatively simple fabrication process and their unusual
   physical properties for broad ranges of potential applications. We
   present a new topological configuration of APMMs with low porosity that
   simultaneously exhibits the properties of negative Poisson's ratio and
   band gaps. The finite element method is employed to investigate the
   effects of the parameters of void porosity, aspect ratio and chord
   length on the Poisson's ratio and the range of band gaps. Our results
   demonstrate that a large range of Poisson's ratio can be achieved with
   low porosity, and interestingly, the Poisson's ratio and the frequency
   of lower band gap edge are decreased monotonically as the chord length
   increases. Furthermore, the comparison of stress-strain behaviors,
   tensile strength, and acoustic transmission characteristics between the
   proposed and the classical configurations of low porosity APMMs is
   given. The results show that the new configuration owns special
   underlying tensile deformation pattern and long ligament, which
   effectively alleviates the stress concentration caused by cusp and
   enhances the tensile strength of the structure. Moreover, compared to
   previous structural configurations, the proposed configuration shows
   lower bandwidth and better vibration control property.}},

Abstract = {{Materials with negative Poisson's ratio are characterized as auxetic
   materials. They arise quite rarely in nature, so that our engineering
   intuition can not help us understand their mechanical behaviour or,
   further, use them effectively for innovative products and processes.
   From a literature review and from analytical calculations confirmed with
   the use of numerical homogenization, it seems that some nonconvex-shaped
   (re-entrant) microstructure is the most understandable origin of the
   auxetic behaviour. The picture is quite clear in elastostatics, for
   which a quite large number of potential applications have been discussed
   in the engineering literature. Analogous problems in elastodynamics and

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials with negative Poisson's ratios have important
   applications across a broad range of engineering areas, such as
   biomedical devices, aerospace engineering and automotive engineering. A
   variety of design strategies have been developed to achieve artificial
   auxetic materials with controllable responses in the Poisson's ratio.
   The development of designs that can offer isotropic negative Poisson's
   ratios over large strains can open up new opportunities in emerging
   biomedical applications, which, however, remains a challenge. Here, we
   introduce deterministic routes to soft architected materials that can be
   tailored precisely to yield the values of Poisson's ratio in the range
   from -1 to 1, in an isotropic manner, with a tunable strain range from
   0\% to similar to 90\%. The designs rely on a network construction in a
   periodic lattice topology, which incorporates zigzag microstructures as
   building blocks to connect lattice nodes. Combined experimental and
   theoretical studies on broad classes of network topologies illustrate
   the wide-ranging utility of these concepts. Quantitative mechanics
   modeling under both infinitesimal and finite deformations allows the
   development of a rigorous design algorithm that determines the necessary
   network geometries to yield target Poisson ratios over desired strain
   ranges. Demonstrative examples in artificial skin with both the negative
   Poisson's ratio and the nonlinear stress-strain curve precisely matching
   those of the cat's skin and in unusual cylindrical structures with
   engineered Poisson effect and shape memory effect suggest potential
   applications of these network materials.}},

Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{Irregular honeycomb structures occur abundantly in nature and in
   man-made products, and are an active area of research. In this paper,
   according to the optimization of regular honeycomb structures, two types
   of irregular honeycomb structures with both positive and negative
   Poisson's ratios are presented. The elastic properties of irregular
   honeycombs with varying structure angles were investigated through a
   combination of material mechanics and structural mechanics methods, in
   which the axial deformation of the rods was considered. The numerical
   results show that axial deformation has a significant influence on the
   elastic properties of irregular honeycomb structures. The elastic
   properties of the structure can be considered by the enclosed area of
   the unit structure, the shape of the unit structure, and the elastic
   properties of the original materials. The elastic properties considering
   the axial deformation of rods studied in this study can provide a
   reference for other scholars.}},

Year = {{2019}},

Abstract = {{The results of studies on the influence of periodically stacked
   nanolayer inclusions, introduced into the face-centered cubic (f.c.c.)
   hard sphere crystal, on Poisson's ratio of the obtained nanocomposite
   system are presented. The monolayers are orthogonal to the
   {[}001]-direction. They are formed by hard spheres with diameter
   different from the spheres forming the matrix of the system. The Monte
   Carlo computer simulations show that in such a case the symmetry of the
   system changes from the cubic to tetragonal one. When the diameter of
   the inclusion spheres increases at certain range, a decrease of the
   negative Poisson's ratio in the {[}101]{[}101]-directions is observed,
   i.e., the system enhances its partial auxeticity. The dependence of the
   maximal, average, and negative parts of the minimal Poisson's ratio on
   the direction of the applied load are shown in a form of surfaces in
   spherical coordinates, plotted for selected values of nanolayer particle
   diameters. The most negative value of the Poisson's ratio found among
   all studied systems was -0.11 (at pressure p{*}100, which is about ten
   times higher than the melting pressure) what is almost twice more
   negative than in the f.c.c. crystal of identical hard spheres. The
   observed effect weakens along with the decrease of pressure and becomes
   hardly noticeable near melting. This study indicates that modifying only
   the size of the inclusion particles one can change Poisson's ratio of
   nanocomposites at high pressures.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetics (i.e. systems with negative Poisson's ratios) exhibit the
   unexpected feature of becoming fatter when stretched and narrower when
   compressed. A particular class of materials which has attracted
   significant attention in recent years in view of its potential for
   auxeticity is that of zeolites, in particular, the zeolite NAT where
   auxeticity has now been experimentally measured. Here we use molecular
   modelling to accurately reproduce through force-field based simulations
   the experimentally measured negative Poisson's ratios in NAT. We also
   simulate and measure the atomic level deformations that result when NAT
   is mechanically deformed and use these to evaluate whether existing
   models can be used to explain the negative Poisson's ratios in
   natrolite. In particular we show that existing 2D models involving
   `rotating semirigid quadrilaterals' can explain some aspects of the
   behaviour of NAT and make, suggestions how such models can be improved
   so as to provide a better description of NAT in the auxetic (001) plane.}},

Journal = {{COMPOSITES PART B-ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{201}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Different from conventional materials, materials with negative Poisson's
   ratios expand laterally when stretched longitudinally. Known as
   `auxetic' materials, the effect means they possess particularly
   fascinating properties, which have recently attracted considerable
   attention in the literature. A range of auxetic materials has been
   discovered, theoretically designed and fabricated. Developments in
   additive manufacturing (AM) techniques enable fabrication of materials
   with intricate cellular architectures. This paper outlines recent
   progress in the development of auxetic materials and structures, and
   their mechanical properties under quasi-static and dynamic loading are
   analysed and summarised. Limited experimental studies on 3D printed
   auxetic materials and structures are given more attention, ahead of
   extensively finite element (FE) simulations. A special focus is
   dedicated to their large, plastic deformation behaviour and energy
   absorption performance, which should be stressed in their engineering
   applications; no review paper has yet been found regarding this.
   Finally, this paper provides an overview of current study limitations,
   and some future research is envisaged in terms of auxetic materials and
   structures, nano-auxetics and additive manufacturing.}},

Title = {{Hierarchical Auxetic Mechanical Metamaterials}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{FEB 11}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic mechanical metamaterials are engineered systems that exhibit the
   unusual macroscopic property of a negative Poisson's ratio due to
   sub-unit structure rather than chemical composition. Although their
   unique behaviour makes them superior to conventional materials in many
   practical applications, they are limited in availability. Here, we
   propose a new class of hierarchical auxetics based on the rotating rigid
   units mechanism. These systems retain the enhanced properties from
   having a negative Poisson's ratio with the added benefits of being a
   hierarchical system. Using simulations on typical hierarchical
   multi-level rotating squares, we show that, through design, one can
   control the extent of auxeticity, degree of aperture and size of the
   different pores in the system. This makes the system more versatile than
   similar non-hierarchical ones, making them promising candidates for
   industrial and biomedical applications, such as stents and skin grafts.}},

   attractive properties that are suitable for numerous and diverse
   applications. A most recent experimental advance could provide a path
   toward the successful synthesis of large-area and high-quality ultrathin
   Mo2C membranes with superconducting properties. In the present study, we
   used first-principles density functional theory calculations to explore
   the mechanical and optical response of singlelayer and free-standing
   Mo2C. Uniaxial tensile simulations along the armchair and zigzag
   directions were conducted and we found that while the elastic properties
   are close along various loading directions, the nonlinear regimes in
   stress-strain curves are considerably different. We found that Mo2C
   sheets present negative Poisson's ratio and thus can be categorized as
   an auxetic material. Our simulations also reveal that Mo2C films retain
   their metallic electronic characteristic upon uniaxial loading. We found
   that for Mo2C nanomembranes the dielectric function becomes anisotropic
   along in-plane and out-of-plane directions. Our findings can be useful

Abstract = {{Mechanical metamaterials have attracted significant attention due to
   their programmable internal structure and extraordinary mechanical
   properties. However, most of them are still in their prototype stage
   without direct applications. This research developed an easy-to-use
   mechanical metamaterial with tailorable large negative Poisson's ratios.
   This metamaterial was microstructural, with cylindrical-shell-based
   units and was manufactured by the 3D-printing technique. It was found
   numerically that the present metamaterial could achieve large negative
   Poisson's ratios up to -1.618 under uniaxial tension and -1.657 under
   uniaxial compression, and the results of the following verification
   tests agreed with simulation findings. Moreover, stress concentration in
   this new metamaterial is much smaller than that in most of existing
   re-entrance metamaterials.}},

Abstract = {{Helical Auxetic Yarns (HAYs) can be used in a variety of applications

   effect of the use of different core materials (e.g. rubber,
   polyurethane, polytetrafluoroethylene/teflon, polypropylene,

   component on the maximum Negative Poisson Ratio (NPR) produced and thus
   the auxetic performance of Helical Auxetic Yarns (HAYs). From the
   analytical model, it was found that an acetal core produced the largest
   NPR when compared to the other six materials. The trend obtained from
   the experimental tensile tests (validation) correlated closely with the
   theoretical predictions of the NPR as axial strain was increased. The
   experimental method presented a maximum NPR at an average axial strain
   of 0.148 which was close to the strain of 0.155 predicted by theory.
   However, the maximum experimental NPR was significantly lower than that

Title = {{Mechanics of disordered auxetic metamaterials}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL B}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{91}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 5}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic materials are of great engineering interest not only because of
   their fascinating negative Poisson's ratio, but also due to the
   possibility to increase by design the toughness and indentation
   resistance. The general understanding of auxetic materials comes often
   from ordered or periodic structures, while auxetic materials used in
   applications are typically strongly disordered. Yet, the effect of
   disorder in auxetics has rarely been investigated. Here, we provide a
   systematic theoretical and experimental study of the effect of disorder
   on the mechanical properties of a paradigmatic two-dimensional auxetic
   lattice with a re-entrant hexagonal geometry. We show that disorder has
   a marginal effect on the Poisson's ratio until the point when the
   lattice topology becomes altered, and in all cases examined disorder
   preserves the auxetic characteristics. Depending on the direction of
   loading applied to these disordered auxetic lattices, either brittle or
   ductile failure is observed. It is found that brittle failure is
   associated with a disorder-dependent tensile strength, whereas in
   ductile failure disorder does not affect strength. Our work thus
   provides general guidelines to design and optimize elasticity and
   strength of disordered auxetic metamaterials.}},

   microscopy images show the nanomechanical deformation processes that
   occur upon stretching a thin film of elastomeric polypropylene. Upon
   uniaxial stretching, the angle between epitaxially grown lamella
   branches remains constant and the lamellae elongate, resulting in
   locally auxetic behavior (negative Poisson's ratio) on the 100-nanometer

Abstract = {{This work describes the in-plane uniaxial tensile mechanical properties
   of two-dimensional graded rectangular perforations metamaterials using
   numerical homogenization finite element approaches benchmarked by
   experimental results. The metamaterial configuration is based on graded
   patterns of centre-symmetric perforated cells that can exhibit an
   auxetic (negative Poisson's ratio) behavior. Global and local equivalent
   mechanical properties of the metamaterial are measured using digital
   image correlation techniques mapped over Finite Element models to
   identify strain patterns and related stress distributions at different
   scales. The samples and their numerical counterpart are parametrized
   against the spacing and aspect ratios of the cells. The overall
   stiffness behavior of the graded perforated metamaterial plates features
   a higher degree of compliance that depends both on the geometries of the
   cells of the graded areas, but also on the graded pattern used. Local
   Poisson's ratio effects show a general constraint of the auxetic
   behavior compared to the case of uniform plates, but also interesting
   and controllable shape changes due to the uniaxial tensile loading
   applied.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetics exhibit the unusual property of expanding when uniaxially
   stretched (negative Poisson's ratio), a property that is usually linked
   to particular geometric features and deformation mechanisms. One of the
   mechanisms which results in auxetic behavious is the one involving
   rotating rigid units, for which, systems made from triangles, squares or
   rectangles have already been considered. In this work we extend this
   study by considering systems which can be constructed from either
   connected rhombi or connected parallelograms. We show that various types
   of such systems can exist and we discuss in detail the properties of one
   type of `rotating rhombi' and one type of `rotating parallelograms'. We
   also show that the Poisson's ratio of these systems, while can be
   positive or negative, is anisotropic and dependent on the shape of the
   parallelograms/rhombi and the degree of openness of the system. (c) 2008

Abstract = {{In this paper, the dynamic behavior of a three-layered sandwich beam
   with a metal foam core is investigated. Outer layers of the sandwich
   beam are made of AlSi12 alloy and the core is metal porous foam made of
   AlSi12. Numerical analysis is made for different parameters of the core
   - average damping loss factor, densities, Young modulus, and Poisson's
   ratio of core foam. The simulations are used to determine the mechanical
   impedance for a sandwich beam with the applied harmonic load. Numerical
   calculations are made with the use of finite element method. The results
   imply that the auxetic core of the composite beam can have a great
   impact on the dynamic behavior (mobility) of the system. Furthermore, it
   appears that there are ranges of frequencies in which the mobility of
   the system can be minimized by using the auxetic foam core.}},

Journal = {{THIN-WALLED STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{154}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Honeycombs based composites are applied in a wide spectrum of
   applications. In the present study, the performance of novel foam
   concrete filled auxetic aluminium honeycombs subjected to quasi-static
   and low velocity compression is experimentally and numerically
   investigated. The response mode, crushing resistance and energy
   absorption capacity of hollow and foam concrete filled auxetic
   honeycombs are experimentally studied under quasi-static and low
   velocity loading. Numerical models, validated with the test results, are
   employed in parametric study to further examine the performance. If
   properly designed, the interaction between the auxetic honeycomb and
   foam concrete reinforces each other, making the two components to work
   in synergy. It is found that the response modes of the composites change
   from compression failure with low peak stress and stable plateau stress
   to shear failure with high peak stress and severely fluctuated plateau
   stress with increasing foam concrete density. The response of foam
   concrete filled honeycombs gradually transforms from the quasi-static
   mode with global deformation to dynamic mode with localized crushing
   near loading end, and the effective Poisson's ratio of the composites
   decreases, both with increasing compression speed.}},

Title = {{Computer simulations of auxetic foams in two dimensions}},
Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Two simple models of two-dimensional auxetic (i.e. negative Poisson's
   ratio) foams are studied by computer simulations. In the first one,
   further referred to as a Y-model, the ribs forming the cells of the foam
   are connected at points corresponding to sites of a disordered honeycomb
   lattice. In the second one, coined a Delta-model, the connections of the
   ribs are not point-like but spatial. For simplicity, they are
   represented by triangles centered at the honeycomb lattice points. Three
   kinds of joints are considered for each model, soft, normal and hard,
   respectively corresponding to materials with Young's modulus ten times
   smaller than, equal to and ten times larger than that of the ribs. The
   initial lattices are uniformly compressed, which decreases their linear
   dimensions by about 15\%. The resulting structures are then used as
   reference structures with no internal stress. The Poisson's ratios of
   these reference structures are determined by stretching them, in either
   the x or the y direction. The results obtained for finite meshes and
   finite samples are extrapolated to infinitely fine mesh and to the
   thermodynamic limit, respectively. The extrapolations indicate that
   meshes with as few as 13 nodes across a rib and samples as small as
   containing 16 x 16 cells approximate the Poisson's ratios of systems of
   infinite size and infinite mesh resolution within the statistical
   accuracy of the experiments, i.e. a few per cent. The simulations show
   that by applying harder joints one can reach lower Poisson's ratios,
   i.e. foams with more auxetic properties. It also follows from the
   simulations performed that the Delta-model gives lower Poisson's ratios
   than the Y-model. Finally, the simulations using fine meshes for the
   samples are compared with the ones in which the ribs are approximated by
   Timoshenko beams. Taking into account simplifications in the latter
   model, the agreement is surprisingly good.}},

Abstract = {{Equivalent sandwich panels composed of auxetic and conventional
   honeycomb cores and metal facets are analysed and compared for their
   resistance performances against impulsive loadings. The dynamic
   behaviours of these structures are numerically investigated, taking into
   account the rate-dependent effects. The Johnson-Cook model is employed
   to describe the dynamic responses of the composite sandwiches subjected
   to high strain-rate loadings. Analytical models are derived correlating
   unit cell geometrical parameters and crushing strengths of the
   representative panels at different impact velocities. Parametric studies
   are conducted to evaluate the performances of different sandwich panel
   designs under impulsive loadings. In particular, transmitted reaction
   forces and maximum stresses on the protected structure are quantified
   for various design parameters including the geometrical factors and the
   effective Poisson's ratios. A quarter of the panel is symmetrically
   modelled with shell elements and the CONWEP model is used to simulate
   the blast loading. Auxetic panels demonstrate interesting crushing
   behaviour, effectively adapting to the dynamic loading by progressively
   drawing material into the locally loaded zone to thereby enhance the
   impact resistance. Meanwhile, conventional honeycomb panels deform
   plastically without localised stiffness enhancement. (C) 2017 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This study presents the finite element-based micromechanical modeling
   approach to obtain the electromechanical properties of the piezoelectric
   metamaterial based on honeycomb (HC) cellular networks. The symmetry of
   the periodic structure was employed to derive mixed boundary conditions
   (MBCs) analogous to periodic boundary conditions (PBCs). Three classes
   of hexagonal HC cellular networks, namely, a conventional HC (CHC), a
   re-entrant HC (RE), and a semi-re-entrant HC (SRE) were considered. The
   representative volume elements (RVEs) of these three classes of cellular
   materials were created, and finite element analyses were carried out to
   analyze the effect of orientation of the ligament on their effective
   electromechanical properties and their suitability in specific
   engineering applications. The longitudinally poled piezoelectric HC
   cellular networks showed an enhanced behavior as compared to the
   monolithic piezoelectric materials. Moreover, longitudinally poled HC
   cellular networks demonstrated that, as compared to the bulk
   constituent, their hydrostatic figure of merit increased and their
   acoustic impedance decreased by one order of magnitude, respectively,
   indicating their applicability for the design on hydrophones. Moreover,
   results showed that cellular metamaterial with tunable electromechanical
   characteristics and a variety of auxetic behaviors such as negative,
   positive, or zero Poisson's ratios could be developed. Such novel HC
   network-based functional cellular materials are likely to facilitate the
   design of light-weight devices for various next-generation sensors and
   actuators. (C) 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{198}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{An auxetic metamaterial is a type of mechanical metamaterial that has a
   negative Poisson's ratio. Most auxetic metamaterials are truss-based or
   originate from Boolean operations of simple geometries. Herein, we
   introduce a new 3D auxetic metamaterial that is mathematically generated
   from an implicit expression. Further, this metamaterial is fabricated by
   3D printing using a flexible material, which allows it to recover from
   large deformations. The buckling-induced auxetic behavior of the
   metamaterial was first evaluated via compression tests and finite
   element analyses. A nickel layer was then plated onto the surface to
   enhance its stiffness, strength, and conductivity without loss of
   auxeticity and resilience. The integration of 3D printing and
   electroless plating enabled accurate control over the mechanical and
   conduction properties of the auxetic metamaterial; these properties are
   presented as contour maps for guidance in functional applications. (C)

   tensile loading. The results of finite element analysis (FEA) were
   validated experimentally and show good agreement. Poisson's ratio of the

Abstract = {{The article discusses the 2D problem of manufacturability of the minimum
   compliance designs of the structural elements made of inhomogeneous
   materials of local isotropic or square symmetry properties. The
   available isotropic material design (IMD) and cubic material design
   (CMD) methods deliver the optimal distribution of the elastic moduli
   within the design domain. Within the 2D setting, the cubic symmetry
   reduces to the symmetry of a square. The varying underlying
   microstructures corresponding to the optimal designs are recovered by
   matching the values of the optimal moduli with the values of the
   effective moduli of the representative volume elements (RVEs) computed
   by the asymptotic homogenization method for periodic media. The shape of
   the RVE and its internal symmetries are properly selected providing
   assumed isotropy or symmetry of a square of the homogenized constitutive
   tensor. The microstructure topology is described by parametric
   description of single (or several) fibers in RVE. The periodicity of the
   structure and the final topology of the material within RVE is ensured
   by multiplication of a single fiber in accordance with the symmetries
   adopted for RVE. The ability to model an auxetic behavior within the
   subdomains where the optimal Poisson's ratio assumes negative values is
   shown.}},

Abstract = {{Following high profile, life changing long term mental illnesses and
   fatalities in sports such as skiing, cricket and American
   football-sports injuries feature regularly in national and international
   news. A mismatch between equipment certification tests, user
   expectations and infield falls and collisions is thought to affect risk
   perception, increasing the prevalence and severity of injuries. Auxetic
   foams, structures and textiles have been suggested for application to
   sporting goods, particularly protective equipment, due to their unique
   form-fitting deformation and curvature, high energy absorption and high
   indentation resistance. The purpose of this critical review is to
   communicate how auxetics could be useful to sports equipment (with a
   focus on injury prevention), and clearly lay out the steps required to
   realise their expected benefits. Initial overviews of auxetic materials
   and sporting protective equipment are followed by a description of
   common auxetic materials and structures, and how to produce them in
   foams, textiles and Additively Manufactured structures. Beneficial
   characteristics, limitations and commercial prospects are discussed,
   leading to a consideration of possible further work required to realise
   potential uses (such as in personal protective equipment and highly
   conformable garments).}},

Abstract = {{Auxeticity (i.e. negative Poisson's ratios) is associated with
   particular geometrical features and deformation mechanisms of a system.
   Among the potential systems that may exhibit such behaviour are rotating
   rigid units. Here we discuss how rigid rhombi of the same shape and size
   can be connected in two different ways to give rise to two distinct
   systems: the Type alpha and Type beta rotating rhombi. We derive the
   mechanical properties, for the Type beta system and compare it to those
   of the Type alpha to highlight the differences between the two systems
   namely that Type alpha systems are highly anisotropic and can exhibit
   both negative and positive Poisson's ratios which depend on the shape of
   the rhombi and the angle between them whereas Type beta systems are
   isotropic with a constant in-plane Poisson's ratio of -1. Furthermore we
   show that by constructing the rhombi from five truss-type elements,
   where the one forming the diagonal has a different thermal expansion
   than the other four identical trusses, the Poisson's ratios for the Type
   alpha systems can also be made temperature dependent, in contrast with
   Type beta systems which remain unaffected by temperature changes. (C)

   structure. In this work, we use ab initio calculation and evolutionary
   algorithm to unveil three new two-dimensional (2D) silica structures
   whose thermal, dynamical, and mechanical stabilities are compared with
   many typical bulk silica. In particular, we find that all three of these
   2D silica structures have large in-plane negative Poisson's ratios with
   the largest one being double of penta graphene and three times of
   borophenes. The negative Poisson's ratio originates from the interplay
   of lattice symmetry and Si-O tetrahedron symmetry. Slab silica is also
   an insulating 2D material with the highest electronic band gap (>7 eV)
   among reported 2D structures. These exotic 2D silica with in-plane
   negative Poisson's ratios and widest band gaps are expected to have
   great potential applications in nanomechanics and nanoelectronics.}},

Title = {{An analytical investigation of elastic-plastic behaviors of 3D warp and
   woof auxetic structures}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICS AND MATERIALS IN DESIGN}},
Abstract = {{The present paper was conducted to calculate Young's modulus and
   Negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) of a warp and woof (WAW) 3D auxetic
   structure in three perpendicular directions using an analytical method
   under uniaxial loading and considering the elastic-plastic behavior of
   materials. Due to the periodic pattern of the auxetic structure, a unit
   cell was chosen as a representative volume element (RVE) and its
   mechanical properties were assessed by developing analytical
   formulations in the elastic region. To this end, the principle of
   virtual work along with the concept of lumped plasticity (plastic
   hinges) were utilized. For validating the proposed analytical model, the
   3D finite element (FE) simulations were used. Fairly good correlations
   were found between the present analytical results and the results of FE
   simulations. Subsequently, the effects of parameters, such as the
   initial re-entrant (IRE) angle, the cell thickness, and the auxetic cell
   aspect ratio on the mechanical properties were investigated. The
   obtained results revealed that with the increase in the IRE angle, NPR
   increases in the vertical direction and decreases in two other
   horizontal directions; it also increases the cell stiffness in three
   perpendicular directions. The thickness of cell walls does not alter
   NPR, yet relatively increases the cell stiffness. Furthermore, it was
   found that the cell aspect ratio has an important role in the mechanical
   properties of WAW auxetic structures.}},

Abstract = {{Preliminary results on the influence of periodically distributed
   cylindrical nanoinclusions introduced into the f.c.c. hard sphere
   crystal on its elastic properties and the Poisson's ratio are presented.
   The nanoinclusions are oriented along the {[}001]-direction and filled
   with hard spheres of diameter different from the spheres forming the
   matrix crystal. The Monte Carlo simulations show that symmetry of the
   crystal changes from the cubic to tetragonal one. In the case when
   spheres inside the inclusion are smaller than spheres forming the
   crystal, the changes of Poisson's ratio are qualitatively similar to the
   changes observed earlier in the Yukawa sphere crystal, that is, the
   introduction of nanochannels causes simultaneous decrease of the
   Poisson's ratio in the {[}110]{[}11 over bar 0]-direction, and its
   increase in {[}110]{[}001]-direction. Filling the nanochannel with
   spheres having diameters greater than that of the spheres in the
   crystalline matrix, causes a decrease of the Poisson's ratio value from
   0.065 down to -0.365 in {[}111]{[}112 over bar ]-direction. The
   dependence of the minimal Poisson's ratio on the direction of the
   applied load is shown in a form of surfaces in spherical coordinates,
   for selected values of nanochannel particle diameters. The most negative
   value of the Poisson's ratio found amongst all systems studied was as
   low as -0.873.}},

Abstract = {{In our previous study, a novel class of auxetic warp knitted fabrics
   were developed and their auxetic behaviors were studied under a single
   tensile test. However, during daily use, the fabrics are usually
   subjected to repeating tension rather than single tension. Therefore,
   the durability of the fabrics' auxetic performance is of great
   importance. So far, the auxetic behavior of fabrics under repeating
   tension has not systematically been investigated. In this paper, we
   report a study on the auxetic behavior of warp knitted fabrics under
   repeating tension. All the fabric samples were subjected to a repeating
   tensile test within a tensile strain of 25\% until 100 tensile cycles.
   The results show that the fabrics can keep their auxetic effect in both
   course and wale testing directions after 100 tensile cycles, and the
   auxetic effect in the wale direction is retained longer under higher
   tensile strains than that under lower tensile strains with the increase
   of tensile cycles. The results also indicate that auxetic stability in
   the course direction is much better than that in the wale direction. We
   hope that this study can offer useful information to improve the auxetic
   stability of auxetic fabrics for practical use.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SANDWICH STRUCTURES \& MATERIALS}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic warp-knitted spacer fabric composite is famous for its excellent
   mechanical properties and has been applied in many potential fields,
   such as automobile industry, aerospace field, and so on. Four kinds of
   composites with different negative Poisson's ratios were used for
   low-velocity impact tests. The influence of different negative Poisson's
   ratio effect and initial impact energy on the impact resistance and
   energy absorption ability of composites are studied. Result shows that
   the peak impact load, energy absorption, and impact resistance of
   composites increase with an increase in the auxetic effect of
   reinforcement. The composite with better auxetic effect shows lower
   damage level after low-velocity impact. And the higher initial impact
   energy can easily weaken the impact resistance ability of composites.}},

Title = {{A novel impact hardening polymer with negative Poisson's ratio for
   impact protection}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS TODAY COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Pages = {{50-59}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Although lots of impact protective materials reported exhibited better
   impact protective performance thanking to their excellent mechanical
   performance, their applications were still seriously impeded due to
   absence of soft-stiffness switch smartness. Herein, a novel impact
   hardening polymer (IHP) with negative Poisson's ratio was synthesized
   via a condensation polymerization, followed by a simple thermal
   annealing to achieve a perfect soft-stiffness switch characteristic and
   self-healing capacity. Its soft-stiffness switch ability sigma, defined
   as G'(max)/G'(min) in rheological analysis, can reach 9000, which is
   never reported so far. The result of laser speckle scatter measurement
   elucidates that IHP has negative Poisson's ratio, which is the root
   cause why IHP exhibits soft-stiffness switch capacity. Finally, 3D
   composite anti-impact fabrics were prepared by dip-coating IHP
   dispersion onto a 3D porous polyester fabric. Not only the impact
   protective performance of anti-impact fabrics finished with the IHP is
   significantly improved, but also the flexibility and hand feeling of
   anti-impact fabrics finished with the IHP are obviously very good
   because the IHP is flexible without impact. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{On the design of three-dimensional mechanical metamaterials using load
   flow visualization}},
Journal = {{MECHANICS BASED DESIGN OF STRUCTURES AND MACHINES}},
Abstract = {{Mechanical metamaterials have generated considerable interest due to
   their unique attributes such as light weight, high strength, enhanced
   energy absorption, high impact, and fracture resistance. However, most
   of the design methodologies in literature are predominantly
   computational and provide limited user-insight (especially for
   three-dimensional designs). This paper presents an alternative two-phase
   design methodology for the conceptual synthesis of three-dimensional
   tunable mechanical metamaterials. In the first phase, we obtain a
   kinematically feasible conceptual topology using a building block-based
   design approach. In the second phase, the conceptual topology is refined
   using shape/size optimization to meet specific elastic properties and
   conform to manufacturing requirements. The building block-based approach
   uses a unique visualization formulation that represents the deformation
   behavior as `load flow' in the constituent members. An immersive virtual
   reality tool is developed to mitigate the visual difficulty in the
   design of three-dimensional microstructures. Furthermore, the load flow
   formulation is used to propose a qualitative classification scheme for
   negative Poisson's ratio elastic metamaterials based on relative values
   of shear moduli and bi-axial elastic stiffnesses. The efficacy of the
   framework is illustrated through the design of microstructures with
   negative Poisson's ratios in spatial directions and the ability to
   achieve isotropic microstructures from a qualitative understanding of
   the conceptual designs. Such a framework can lead to the design of
   synthetic materials that have potential applications in multifunctional
   structures, shape morphing structures, and soft robotics.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},

Month = {{AUG 9}},
Abstract = {{Two dimensional (2D) auxetic materials with large negative Poisson's
   ratio (NPR) are highly desirable for applications in medicine, tougher
   composites, defense, and so on. In this paper, by using first-principles
   calculations, we identify that the CaAs3 monolayer is an excellent
   auxetic material with large NPR value up to -0.36 along the hinges
   direction. The relatively small Young's modulus ranging from 23.61 to
   40.50 N/m and the moderate critical strain ranging from 0.06 to 0.16
   guarantee its extraordinary flexibility and moderate ductility. Owing to
   its unique crystal structure, the anisotropy of basic mechanical
   parameters, electrical conductance, and optical absorption are
   concentrated on the CaAs3 monolayer. Moreover, the electric
   field-induced tunability of optical absorption also emerged in the CaAs3
   monolayer. All of these extraordinary properties allow 2D CaAs3 to have
   great potential applications in designing electromechanical devices and
   photoelectric devices as well.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of impulse load applied for different duration on the
   distribution of normalised dynamic radial stresses in positive and
   negative Poisson's ratio medium was investigated in this study. For
   solving the non-stationary problem in the case of plane deformation for
   structurally inhomogeneous materials, the model of Cosserat continuum
   was applied. This model enables accounting for the influence of
   shear-rotation deformation of micro-particles of the medium. In the
   framework of Cosserat elasticity, on applying the Fourier transforms for
   time variable and developing the boundary integral equation method,
   solving of the non-stationary problem reduces to the system of singular
   integral equations, where the components that determine the influence of
   shear-rotation deformations are selected. The numerical calculations
   were performed for the foam medium with positive and negative Poisson's
   ratio for different values of time duration of impulse. Developed
   approach can be used to predict the mechanical behaviour of foam auxetic
   materials obtained at different values of a volumetric compression ratio
   under the action of time variable load based on analysis of the
   distribution of radial stresses in foam medium.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a quantitative optimization of a modified re-entrant
   negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) structure whose overhanging struts were
   replaced with inclined ones to avoid the support structures which were
   generally required in the selective laser melting (SLM) process was
   carried out using finite element analysis (FEA) method. Poisson's ratios
   of models with inclined links of different strut inclination angles were
   calculated. The optimal simulated inclination angle of struts was 9
   degrees and the corresponding optimum re-entrant angle was 79 degrees
   while the thickness of the strut was 0.9 mm. The influence of fillet
   radii on Poisson's ratio and stress concentration was also discussed and
   the Poisson's ratio decreased and the stress concentration phenomenon
   remitted to some extent with increased fillet radii. In order to verify
   the improvement of the manufacturability of structures with inclined
   links, AlSi10Mg specimens were fabricated by SLM process using different
   scanning speeds and compression tests were also developed.
   Experimentally obtained results and simulation predicted ones were in
   good agreement. Therefore, the custom-tailor service could be
   accomplished in this way and the modified NPR structure with better
   surface quality could be obtained. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials, characterised by a negative Poisson's ratio, have
   properties that are different from most conventional materials. These
   are a result of the constraints on the kinematics of the material's
   basic structural components, and have important technological
   implications. Models of these materials have been studied extensively,
   but theoretical descriptions have remained largely limited to materials
   with an ordered microstructure. Here we investigate whether negative
   Poisson's ratios can arise spontaneously in disordered systems. To this
   end, we develop a quantitative description of the structure in systems
   of connected basic elements, which enables us to analyse the local and
   global responses to small external tensile forces. We find that the
   Poisson's ratios in these disordered systems are equally likely to be
   positive or negative on both the element and system scales. Separating
   the strain into translational, rotational and expansive components, we
   find that the translational strains of neighbouring basic structural
   elements are positively correlated, while their rotations are negatively
   correlated. There is no correlation in this type of system between the
   local auxeticity and local structural characteristics. Our results
   suggest that auxeticity is more common in disordered structures than the
   ubiquity of positive Poisson's ratios in macroscopic materials would
   suggest.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a new way to design and fabricate compliant
   micromechanisms and material structures with negative Poisson's ratio
   (NPR). The design of compliant mechanisms and material structures is
   accomplished in an automated way using a numerical topology optimization
   method. The procedure allows the user to specify the elastic properties
   of materials or the mechanical advantages (MA's) or geometrical
   advantages (GA's) of compliant mechanisms and returns the optimal
   structures. The topologies obtained by the numerical procedure require
   practically no interaction by the engineer before they can be
   transferred to the fabrication unit. Fabrication is carried out by
   patterning a sputtered silicon on a plasma-enhanced chemical vapor
   deposition (PECVD) glass with a laser micromachining setup.
   Subsequently, the structures are etched into the underlying PECVD glass,
   and the glass is underetched, an in one two-step reactive ion etching
   (RIE) process. The components are tested using a probe placed on an x-y
   stage. This fast prototyping allows newly developed topologies to be
   fabricated and tested within the same day. {[}188]}},

Abstract = {{Honeycomb structures are increasingly being used in many important
   fields. A novel combined embedded enhanced honeycomb (CEEH) in developed
   in this paper based on the two existing embedded enhanced honeycombs,
   the single rib embedded enhanced honeycomb (SREEH) and the rhombic grid
   embedded enhanced honeycomb (RGEEH). Analytical model related to the
   in-plane Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio is built and validated by
   using two different finite element (FE) models (3D beam model and 3D
   solid model). The in-plane elastic behavior of the honeycomb is also
   investigated against the geometrical parameters by using the numerically
   validated analytical solutions. The results show that the new CEEH can
   achieve a wide range value of Poisson's ratio and Young's modulus by
   tailoring geometric parameters. The results also show that the new CEEH
   exhibits higher x- directional specific stiffness than SREEH while
   higher y- directional specific stiffness than RGEEH. Moreover, the new
   CEEH can weaken even eliminate the difference between the two principal
   directions which can be hardly achieved by the SREEH and RGEEH. Given
   these advantages, this new design may be promising in some applications.
   This work provides a new insight into the designs of embedded enhanced
   honeycombs.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we report a novel periodic material with negative
   Poisson's ratio (also called auxetic materials) fabricated by denting
   spherical dimples in an elastic flat sheet. While previously reported
   auxetic materials are either porous or comprise at least two phases, the
   material proposed here is nonporous and made of a homogeneous elastic
   sheet. Importantly, the auxetic behavior is induced by a novel mechanism
   which exploits the out-of-plane deformation of the spherical dimples.
   Through a combination of experiments and numerical analyses, we
   demonstrate the robustness of the proposed concept, paving the way for
   developing a new class of auxetic materials that significantly expand
   their design space and possible applications.}},

Abstract = {{A novel set of auxetic (negative Poisson's ratio) open cell polyurethane
   foam has been developed and tested under dynamic loading conditions to
   assess the viscoelastic response under white noise random excitation and
   compressive cycling. Foam pads normalized to standard ISO 13753 have
   been tested at room temperature and frequency bandwidth 10-500 Hz to
   assess transmissibility characteristics for possible antivibration glove
   applications. The results show that the ISO 13753 normalized
   transmissibility for these foams falls below 0.6 above 100 Hz, with
   lower peak maximum stresses under indentation compared to conventional
   open cell solids. These results suggest possible use of the auxetic foam
   for pads or linens against << white fingers >> vibration applications.
   Further tests have been conducted on cyclic compressive loading up to 3
   Hz and loading ratios of 0.95 for loading histories up to 100000 cycles.
   The damping capacity of the auxetic foams showed and increase by a
   factor 10 compared to the conventional foams used to manufacture the
   negative Poisson's ratio ones, and stiffness degradation stabilized

Abstract = {{Auxetic warp-knitted spacer fabrics have gained increasing interest due
   to their excellent properties, such as shear resistance, indentation
   resistance, synclastic curvature and so on. Soft composites made from
   auxetic warp-knitted spacer fabrics and A/B two-component silicone
   rubbers were studied in this paper. The stabbing resistance of
   composites made by different auxetic fabrics (Fabrics 1-4\#) and at
   different filling rates (0\%, 20\%, 40\%, 70\%, 100\%), respectively,
   were tested using a universal Material Testing System. The results show
   that the peak load, energy absorption and deformation displacement of
   the composites increase with an increase of auxetic performance and
   filling rate. In addition, a better auxetic effect and larger filling
   rate can result in less damage. The composites with a higher filling
   rate are more like an elastomer. The auxetic effect also has an
   important role in stabbing resistance, which is due to fabrics with a
   larger negative Poisson's ratio value having a denser face layer
   structure and more deformable units, which can lead to better stabbing
   resistance for the composites.}},

Abstract = {{Porous materials are efficient structures in respect to optimizing
   strength and stiffness for a given weight. A new means of improving the
   characteristics of the samples may be realized using abnormal
   deformation properties of auxetic porous materials having a negative
   Poisson's ratio v. Auxetic porous materials are suitable for creating
   adaptive contact joints and for replacing damaged biotissue. It is known
   that the inverted or re-entrant cell structure of porous auxetics may be
   obtained by isotropic permanent volumetric compression of conven(t)ional
   foam, resulting in microbuckling of the cell walls. There is interest in
   compression-driven self-assembly as a means to create auxetic porous
   structures on a nanoscale. To predict the deformation behaviour of
   porous materials under various types of loading, corresponding
   mathematical models should be developed. The possibility of
   compression-driven self-assembly of the auxetic nanostructures has been
   predicted. (C) 2008 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA, Weinheim}},

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional (2D) auxetic materials with exceptional negative
   Poisson's ratios (NPR) are drawing increasing interest due to their
   potential use in medicine, fasteners, tougher composites and many other
   applications. Improving the auxetic performance of 2D materials is
   currently crucial. Here, using first-principles calculations, we
   demonstrated giant in-plane NPRs in MX monolayers (M = Al, Ga, In, Zn,
   Cd; X = P, As, Sb, S, Se, Te) with a unique V-shaped configuration. Our
   calculations showed that GaP, GaAs, GaSb, ZnS and ZnTe monolayers
   exhibit exceptional all-angle in-plane NPRs. Remarkably, the AlP
   monolayer possesses a giant NPR of -1.779, by far the largest NPR in 2D
   materials. The NPRs of these MX monolayers are correlated to the highly
   anisotropic features of the V-shaped geometry. The exotic mechanical
   properties of the V-shaped MX monolayers provide a new family of 2D
   auxetic materials, as well as a useful guidance for tuning the NPR of 2D
   materials.}},

Abstract = {{A new auxetic structure, re-entrant chiral auxetic (RCA) structure, is
   proposed for the first time in this paper. The RCA structure combines
   the topological features of hexagonal re-entrant and anti-tetrachiral
   honeycombs. Additive manufacturing technique, stereolithography (SLA),
   and traditional waterjet machining (WJM) were employed to fabricate six
   samples made from photopolymer (VisiJet SL Flex) and aluminum alloy
   (6061), respectively. Quasi-static uniaxial tensile tests were conducted
   in the X and Y directions, respectively. Numerical models were developed
   using ANSYS/LS-DYNA and verified by experimental data. Deformation
   modes, stress-strain curves, and Poisson's ratios were considered to
   examine the effects of loading directions and material types. A
   comparative study was conducted experimentally and numerically between
   the well-known hexagonal re-entrant honeycomb, and this newly developed
   RCA structure. The proposed RCA structure presented here was found to
   display lower density compared with re-entrant honeycomb. Moreover, it
   shows higher tensile properties and auxetic effect compared with
   re-entrant honeycomb when loaded in the X direction. The validated FEA
   models were employed to investigate the effect of friction on the
   deformation pattern and mechanical properties of the RCA structure when
   it is loaded in both directions.}},

Volume = {{136}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{This paper evaluates the elastic stability and vibration characteristics
   of circular plates made from auxetic materials. By solving the general
   solutions for buckling and vibration of circular plates under various
   boundary conditions, the critical buckling load factors and fundamental
   frequencies of circular plates, within the scope of the first
   axisymmetric modes, were obtained for the entire range of Poisson's
   ratio for isotropic solids, i.e., from -1 to 0.5. Results for elastic
   stability reveal that as the Poisson's ratio of the plate becomes more
   negative, the critical bucking load gradually reduces. In the case of
   vibration, the decrease in Poisson's ratio not only decreases the
   fundamental frequency, but the decrease becomes very rapid as the
   Poisson's ratio approaches its lower limit. For both buckling and
   vibration, the plate's Poisson's ratio has no effect if the edge is
   fully clamped. The results obtained herein suggest that auxetic
   materials can be employed for attaining static and dynamic properties
   which are not common in plates made from conventional materials. Based
   on the exact results, empirical models were generated for design
   purposes so that both the critical buckling load factors and the
   frequency parameters can be conveniently obtained without calculating
   the Bessel functions.}},

Abstract = {{To improve vehicle side crashworthiness, this paper first introduces the
   negative Poisson's ratio structure to the traditional B-pillar and
   proposes a negative Poisson's ratio B-pillar. Then, the performance of
   the negative Poisson's ratio B-pillar is studied in detail by comparison
   with a traditional B-pillar and honeycomb B-pillar. Aiming at the
   problem that the side crashworthiness is also significantly affected by
   the side structure parameters of vehicle body, the factorial analysis
   theory is adopted to screen out the side structure parameters with
   significant effect. Based on this, by combining the optimal Latin
   hypercube design and response surface model, a multi-objective
   optimization design is conducted for those structure parameters based on
   non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II. Finally, the normal boundary
   intersection method is adopted to seek the Pareto optimal solution, and
   the simulation results show that compared with the traditional B-pillar,
   the negative Poisson's ratio B-pillar optimized by non-dominated sorting
   genetic algorithm II has better comprehensive crashworthiness. The
   results of this paper can provide some basis for the design and

Abstract = {{Mechanical metamaterial composed of chiral honeycomb structure is high

   in-plane deformation and out-of-plane load-bearing, but also has
   excellent engineering application performance such as vibration
   isolation and sound absorption and noise reduction and control of
   elastic wave propagation. It has great potential in the fields of
   intelligent structure, vehicle, ship, aerospace and so on. Two
   mechanical aspects of its elastic properties and impact resistance were
   reviewed. First, the progress of theoretical analysis and research on
   the elastic properties such as the surface poplar modulus, negative
   Poisson's ratio, and elastic properties of external shear modulus of
   mechanical metamaterials were reviewed and commented. Further, in the
   aspect of impact resistance, the overall deformation and impact

Abstract = {{Materials with specific microstructural characteristics and composite
   structures are able to exhibit negative Poisson's ratio. This result has
   been proved for continuum materials by analytical methods in previous
   works of the first author, among others {[}1]. Furthermore, it also has
   been shown to be valid for certain mechanisms involving beams or rigid
   levers, springs or sliding collars frameworks and, in general,
   composites with voids having a nonconvex microstructure. Recently
   microstructures optimally designed by the homogenization approach have
   been verified. For microstructures composed of beams, it has been
   postulated that nonconvex shapes with re-entrant corners are responsible
   for this effect {[}2]. In this paper, it is numerically shown that
   mainly the shape of the re-entrant corner of a non-convex, star-shaped
   microstructure influences the apparent (phenomenological) Poisson's
   ratio. The same is valid for continua with voids or for composities with
   irregular shapes of inclusions, even if the individual constituents are
   quite usual materials. Elements of the numerical homogenization theory
   are reviewed and used for the numerical investigation.}},

   proposed by Evans in 1991 {[}Nature (London) 353, 124 (1991)], and is
   used to explain the negative Poisson's ratio of auxetic materials.
   Auxetics are materials with a negative Poisson elastic parameter,
   meaning that they have a lateral extension, instead of shrinking, when
   they are stretched. The phonon dispersions obtained in the case of the
   auxetic model are compared with those of a conventional honeycomb
   network, where rigid rodlike particles are inserted. The behavior of the
   rotational dispersions can explain some experimental observations on the
   properties of sound propagation in the auxetic materials.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic foams have been widely studied in view of their superior
   properties and many useful applications and various models have been
   developed to help explain the auxetic behavior in such foams. One such
   model involves the description of auxetic foams in terms of rotating
   units (e.g. the joints where different cell walls meet), a mechanism,
   which has also been observed experimentally. In the models, the rotating
   units are taken, to a first approximation, to be representable through
   rotating rigid triangles, which correspond to the 2D projection of these
   rotating units and although this model has been improved significantly
   since it was first proposed, current models still do not fully capture
   all the deformations that may occur in real foams. In this work, we
   propose an extended model which not only allows for relative rotation of
   the units (joints), represented by non-equilateral triangular units, but
   also for differing amount of material at the joints as well as
   deformation of the joints themselves, a scenario that is more
   representative of real auxetic foams. This model shows that, by
   permitting deformation mechanisms other than rotation of the triangles,
   the predicted extent of auxeticity decreases when compared to the
   equivalent idealized rotating rigid triangles model, thus resulting in
   more plausible predictions of the Poisson's ratios. Furthermore, it is
   shown that in the manufacturing process, a minimum compression factor,
   which is dependent on the amount of materials at the joints, is required
   to obtain an auxetic foam from a conventional foam, as one normally
   observed in experimental work on foams. (C) 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH

   based on the homogenization theory for nonlinear time-dependent

   method is used to enhance computational efficiency. The method proposed
   is then applied for the analysis of the elastic-viscoplastic Poisson's
   ratios of angle-ply carbon fiber/epoxy laminates subjected to
   macroscopic uniaxial tension. The analysis results obtained are used to

Abstract = {{A novel design for the geometric configuration of honeycombs using a
   seamless combination of auxetic and conventional cores- elements with
   negative and positive Possion ratios respectively, has been presented.
   The proposed design has been shown to generate a superior band gap
   property while retaining all major advantages of a purely conventional
   or purely auxetic honeycomb structure. Seamless combination ensures that
   joint cardinality is also retained. Several configurations involving
   different degree of auxeticity and different proportions auxetic and
   conventional elements have been analyzed. It has been shown that the
   preferred configurations open up wide and clean band gap at a
   significantly lower frequency ranges compared to their pure
   counterparts. In view of existence of band gaps being desired feature
   for the phononic applications, reported results might be appealing. Use
   of such design may enable superior vibration control as well. Proposed
   configurations can be made isovolumic and iso-weight giving designers a
   fairer ground of applying such configurations without significantly
   changing size and weight criteria.}},

Abstract = {{Cellular materials have two important properties: structures and
   mechanisms. These properties have important applications in materials
   design; in particular, they are used to determine the modulus and yield
   strain. The objective of this study is to gain a better understanding of
   these two properties and to explore the synthesis of compliant cellular
   materials (CCMs) with compliant porous structures (CPSes) generated from
   modified hexagonal honeycombs. An in-plane constitutive CCM model is
   constructed using the strain energy method, which uses the deformation
   of hinges around holes and the rotation of links. A finite element (FE)
   based simulation is conducted to validate the analytical model. The
   moduli and yield strains of the CCMs with an aluminum alloy are about
   5.8 GPa and 0.57\% in one direction and about 2.9 MPa and 20\% in the
   other direction. CCMs have extremely high positive and negative
   Poisson's ratios (v(xy){*}similar to +/- 40) due to the large rotation
   of the link member in the transverse direction caused by an input
   displacement in the longitudinal direction. CCMs also show higher moduli
   after contact of slit edges at the center region of the CPSes. The
   synthesized CPSes can also be used to design a new CCM with a Poisson's
   ratio of zero using a puzzle-piece CPS assembly. This paper demonstrates
   that compliant mesostructures can be used for next generation materials
   design in tailoring mechanical properties such as moduli, strength,
   strain, and Poisson's ratios. The proposed mesostructures can also be
   easily manufactured using a conventional cutting method. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{This article contains an analytic study of Poisson's ratio of re-entrant
   foam materials with negative Poisson's ratio.  These materials get
   fatter when stretched and thinner when compressed.  The Poisson effect
   is so fundamentally important to the properties of a material that a
   large change in the value of the ratio will have significant effects on
   the material's mechanical performance.  Isotropic foam structures with
   negative Poisson's ratio have been fabricated through a permanent
   volumetric transformation.  The cells were converted from the convex
   polyhedral shape of conventional foam cells to a concave or
   `'re-entrant'' shape.  Mechanical behavior of a re-entrant open cell
   foam material will differ from that of a conventional foam in ways not
   addressed by existing theoretical treatment.  Poisson's ratio as a
   function of strain is obtained by modeling the three-dimensional unit
   cell as an idealized polyhedron unit cell.  Poisson's ratio is predicted
   to approach the isotropic limit of -1 with increasing permanent
   volumetric compression ratio of idealized cells, in comparison with
   experimental values as small as -0.8.}},

Abstract = {{Cellular plastics have been widely used in transportation, aerospace,
   and personal safety applications owing to their excellent mechanical,
   thermal, and acoustic properties. It is highly desirable to impart them
   with a complex porous structure and composition distribution to obtain
   specific functionality for various engineering applications, which is
   challenging with conventional foaming technologies. Herein, it is
   demonstrated that this can be achieved through the controlled freezing
   process of a monomer/water emulsion, followed by cryopolymerization and
   room temperature thawing. As ice is used as a template, this method is
   environmentally friendly and capable of producing cellular plastics with
   various microstructures by harnessing the numerous morphologies of ice
   crystals. In particular, a cellular plastic with a radially aligned
   structure shows a negative Poisson's ratio under compression. The rigid
   plastic shows a much higher energy dissipation capability compared to
   other materials with similar negative Poisson's ratios. Additionally,
   the simplicity and scalability of this approach provides new
   possibilities for fabricating high-performance cellular plastics with
   well-defined porous structures and composition distributions.}},

Abstract = {{A re-entrant chiral auxetic (RCA) structure is a new structure, which
   comprises three topologies: re-entrant, trichiral and anti-trichiral.
   The aim of this study is to numerically investigate the influences of
   geometrical parameters of a RCA unit cell on the in-plane tensile
   properties. Finite element (FE) models were developed using commercial
   software, ABAQUS 6.11-2, and verified by experimental results. Based on
   the verified FE models, a parametric study was performed to examine the
   effects of geometrical parameters on the stress-strain curve and
   Poisson's ratio of a RCA structure. In order to reduce the variables
   studied, three dimensionless groups of geometrical parameters were
   proposed. Results showed that the RCA structure predominantly deformed
   by bending and stretching of walls as well as rotation of cylinders. The
   RCA structure displayed high stress, low strain and large negative
   Poisson's ratio when it was loaded in the X direction. On the other
   hand, the RCA structure exhibited low stress, high strain and a
   transition from negative to positive Poisson's ratio when it was loaded
   in the Y direction. The geometrical parameters of the RCA structure had
   significant effects on its stress-strain curves and Poisson's ratios.
   The findings of this study provide an insight into the mechanical
   response of the RCA structure under uniaixal tensile loading.}},

Pages = {{231-292}},
Abstract = {{This chapter opens with a discussion on flexural rigidity of auxetic
   plates vis-a-vis conventional ones, followed by an analysis of circular
   auxetic plates. Bending moment result from uniform loading of circular
   plates suggests that the optimal Poisson's ratio is 1/3 if the plate is
   simply-supported at the edge. Based on bending and twisting moment
   minimization on a rectangular plate under sinusoidal load, the optimal
   Poisson's ratio for a square plate is 0, and this value reduces until 1
   for a rectangular plate with aspect ratio 1 + root 2. Auxetic materials
   are not suitable for uniformly loaded and simply supported square
   plates, as moment minimization study suggests an optimal Poisson's ratio
   of 0.115, but are highly suitable for central point loaded and simply
   supported square plates, as moment minimization study suggests an
   optimal Poisson's ratio of -1. In the study of auxetic plates on auxetic
   foundation, the plotted results suggest that, in addition to selecting
   materials of sufficient strength and mechanical designing of plate for
   reduced stressed concentration, the use of plate and/or foundation
   materials with negative Poisson's ratio is useful for designing against
   failure. The investigations on width-constrained plates under uniaxial
   in-plane pressure by Strek et al. (J Non-Cryst Solids
   354(35-39):4475-4480, 2008) and Pozniak et al. (Rev Adv Mat Sci
   23(2):169-174, 2010) exhibit a remarkable and surprising result at
   extreme negative Poisson's ratios the displacement vector has components
   which are anti-parallel to the direction of loading. In the study of
   spherical shells under uniform load, the use of auxetic material reduces
   the ratio of maximum bending stress to the membrane stress, thereby
   implying that if the shell material possesses a Poisson's ratio that is
   sufficiently negative, such as 1, and the boundary condition permits
   free rotation and lateral displacement, then the use of membrane theory
   of shell is sufficient even though the shell thickness is significant.
   Results also recommend the use of auxetic material for spherical shells
   with simple supports because the bending stress is significantly
   reduced. However the use of auxetic material as spherical shells, with
   built-in edge, is not recommended due to the sharp increase in the
   bending stress as the Poisson's ratio of the shell material becomes more
   negative.}},

   chiral auxetic structure}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},

Volume = {{267}},
Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents an experimental study on impact behaviour and
   plastic evolution of chiral structure subjected to in-plane impact
   loading using a Split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB). The finite element
   (FE) model developed in ABAQUS/Explicit was validated and utilized for
   parametric study, and further developed as an extension of experimental
   work. The impact scenarios from both structure itself and external input
   are considered, including relative density, topology parameter r/R and
   initial impact energy. Results indicate that chiral structure exhibits
   three critical failure modes corresponding to various impact velocities
   ranging from 5 m/s to 50 m/s. Interestingly, chiral structure occurs
   with two densification stages induced by ligaments-dominated and
   nodes-dominated crushing deformation, respectively, proving the
   capability of independent energy management mechanism. Increasing the
   value of relative density from 0.19 to 0.39 contributes to a maximum of
   250\% increase in the specific energy absorption (SEA). Although
   increasing the value of r/R from 0.04 to 0.2 can dramatically decrease
   Poisson's ratio (PR) from 0.07 to - 0.63 (significant negative PR), high
   strainrate dependence of PR is also observed. In addition, the impact
   displacement is mostly influenced by initial impact energy but not by
   impact velocity and mass. The obtained results of this study provide a
   new insight into the impact performance of chiral structure, which
   contributes to the optimal design of auxetic crashworthiness system.}},

   topology not exhibiting an auxetic behaviour. We investigate the wave
   propagation characteristics of these particular hierarchical lattices by
   using a Bloch wave approach applied to detailed Finite Element
   geometries of the unit cell configurations. We show that the level of
   hierarchy creates new band gaps with large relative widths, and it also
   shifts the same bandgaps towards lower frequencies. We correlate the
   mechanical properties, fractal order and the dispersion characteristics
   of the multiscale auxetic perforated metamaterial with the parameters
   defining the geometry of the lattice and the hierarchy levels, and
   discuss the results in a nondimensional form to provide a performance
   map of the mechanical and dynamic properties. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The negative binomial (NB) is frequently used to model overdispersed
   Poisson count data. To study the effect of a continuous covariate of
   interest in an NB model, a flexible procedure is used to model the
   covariate effect by fixed-knot cubic basis-splines or B-splines with a
   second-order difference penalty on the adjacent B-spline coefficients to
   avoid undersmoothing. A penalized likelihood is used to estimate
   parameters of the model. A penalized likelihood ratio test statistic is
   constructed for the null hypothesis of the linearity of the continuous
   covariate effect. When the number of knots is fixed, its limiting null
   distribution is the distribution of a linear combination of independent
   chi-squared random variables, each with one degree of freedom. The
   smoothing parameter value is determined by setting a specified value
   equal to the asymptotic expectation of the test statistic under the null
   hypothesis. The power performance of the proposed test is studied with
   simulation experiments.}},

Abstract = {{We perform molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the effect of
   hydrogenation on the Poisson's ratio of graphene. It is found that the
   value of the Poisson's ratio of graphene can be effectively tuned from
   positive to negative by varying the percentage of hydrogenation.
   Specifically, the Poisson's ratio decreases with an increase in the
   percentage of hydrogenation, and reaches a minimum value of -0.04 when
   the percentage of hydrogenation is about 50\%. The Poisson's ratio
   starts to increase upon a further increase of the percentage of
   hydrogenation. The appearance of a minimum negative Poisson's ratio in
   the hydrogenated graphene is attributed to the suppression of the
   hydrogenation-induced ripples during the stretching of graphene. Our
   results demonstrate that hydrogenation is a valuable approach for tuning
   the Poisson's ratio from positive to negative in graphene.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICA STATUS SOLIDI B-BASIC SOLID STATE PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{254}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Although high heels are known to affect the biomechanics of human
   movement, most notably by increasing forefoot plantar pressure, it is
   commonly worn due to the influence of fashion. To deal with the
   resulting clinical issues, some prescriptions include the use of
   cushioning pads to redistribute the plantar loads and increase comfort.
   This preliminary study has sought to investigate whether auxetic foam
   would be a good candidate for the redistribution of plantar loafing in
   the forefoot when compared to a more traditional material. From the
   results obtained, it was shown that auxetic foam demonstrated a decrease
   in forefoot peak plantar pressure while a commercial product, a material
   traditionally used for plantar cover paddings, increased pressure in the
   region of the second-fourth Metatarsophalangeal Joint. This demonstrates
   the potential for auxetic materials to become the material of choice for
   such applications, especially since it can be further remodeled until
   its properties can produce a significant forefoot pressure reduction.}},

Abstract = {{A new method is presented for evaluating the performance of 1-3
   polymer/piezoelectric ceramic composites for hydrophone applications.
   The Poisson's ratio effect, i.e., the enhancement of the hydrostatic
   performance which can be achieved by mixing piezoelectric ceramics with
   polymers, is studied in detail. Using an ``effective medium{''}
   approach, algebraic expressions are derived for the composite
   hydrostatic charge coefficient d(h), the hydrostatic figure of merit
   d(h)g(h), and the hydrostatic electromechanical coupling coefficient
   k(h) in terms of the properties of the constituent materials, the
   ceramic volume fraction, and a microstructural parameter p. The high
   contrast in stiffness and dielectric constants existing between the two
   phases can be exploited to derive simple, geometry-independent
   approximations which explain quantitatively the Poisson's ratio effect.
   It is demonstrated that the stiffness and the Poisson's ratio of the
   polymer matrix play a crucial role in enhancing hydrophone performance.
   Using a differential scheme to model the parameter p, we evaluate d(h),
   d(h)g(h), and k(h) for polymer/piezoelectric ceramic systems at varying
   compositions. Several examples involving Pb (Zr, Ti)O-3 and (Pb, Ca)TiO3
   piezoelectric ceramics are given to illustrate the theory. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{Diffusion-induced stress is one of the critical challenges in developing
   lithium ion battery technologies, which may lead to the huge volume
   expansion, nucleation of cracks, electrode mechanical degradation and
   even pulverization. It has been testified nanostructured electrodes with
   the consideration of surface effect and property of negative Poisson's
   ratio can restrain volumetric expansion generation and relieve the
   hazard of stress-induced crack nucleation. In this paper, an analytical
   model of diffusion-induced stress for nanowire electrode under different
   operations is established and a relationship between stress and the
   nanowire radius is formed. Through changing the morphology of nanowire
   electrode, the stress equations for negative Poisson's ratio electrode
   can be obtained. By comparing surface effect influence on
   diffusion-induced stress between the nanowire and negative Poisson's
   ratio electrodes under different operations, it is found
   diffusion-induced stress, especially the tensile stress, can be
   decreased greatly and even converted to compressive one by the
   nanostructured electrode and the mechanism of negative Poisson's ratio,
   which may improve the mechanical property of battery and be in good
   agreement with experimental observations. Our work provides reference
   conditions for the improvement of battery to mitigate the mechanical
   degradation and prolong the cycle life as well as avoid failure.}},

Abstract = {{`Negative mechanical materials / metamaterials' refer to materials
   and/or engineered systems that exhibit anomalous macroscopic
   thermo-mechanical properties that emerge due to the structure of their
   subunits, rather than the specific chemical composition. As a result of

   properties such as zero or negative Poisson's ratios (auxetic), moduli
   and/or indices. Such zero/negative properties are not normally
   manifested by their conventional counterparts and may thus potentially
   be used in applications where typical materials cannot. This work will
   look into some of the more recent developments made in this field,
   focusing on how existing materials (e.g. crystals) are providing the
   blueprint for the design and manufacture of novel `negative materials'.
   In particular, this work looks at how wine-rack like crystalline
   materials which are typically studied for their negative thermal
   expansion and/or negative compressibility properties can be modified so
   as to generate negative Poisson's ratio through a novel mechanism
   involving forcing elements to move out-of-plane to generate giant

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials are solids that exhibit negative Poisson's ratio. The
   effect of material auxeticity (i.e., negativity of Poisson's ratio) is
   investigated herein on the maximum deflection of sectorial plates with
   Simply-Supported straight edges and Free curve edge (SSF). To aid the
   designer, an accurate and conveniently executable semi-empirical model
   has been developed herein, which is valid for the entire range of
   Poisson's ratio of isotropic solids and for the plate's sectorial angle
   from 30 to 90 degrees. Results from exact solution reveal that the
   maximum deflection reduces sharply with the reduction of Poisson's ratio
   from positive to mildly negative, but deflection reduction is marginal
   when the sectorial plate's Poisson's ratio changes from moderately
   negative to highly negative value. It is therefore suggested that (a)
   the use of auxetic materials is useful to limit the extent of SSF
   sectorial plate deflection, and that (b) the use of the developed
   semi-empirical model herein as a design equation gives greatly
   simplified but highly accurate maximum deflection prediction for SSF
   plates made from both conventional (positive Poisson's ratio) and
   auxetic (negative Poisson's ratio) materials.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is categorized into two parts. (1) A frame work to design the
   aircraft wing structure and (2) analysis of a morphing airfoil with
   auxetic structure. The developed design frame work in the first part is
   used to arrive at the sizes of the various components of an aircraft
   wing structure. The strength based design is adopted, where the design
   loads are extracted from the aerodynamic loads. The aerodynamic loads
   acting on a wing structure are converted to equivalent distributed
   loads, which are further converted point loads to arrive at the shear
   forces, bending and twisting moments along the wing span. Based on the
   estimated shear forces, bending and twisting moments, the strength based
   design is employed to estimate the sizes of various sections of a
   composite wing structure. A three dimensional numerical model of the
   composite wing structure has been developed and analyzed for the extreme
   load conditions. Glass fiber reinforced plastic material is used in the
   numerical analysis. The estimated natural frequencies are observed to be
   in the acceptable limits. Furthermore, the discussed design principles
   in the first part are extended to the design of a morphing airfoil with
   auxetic structure. The advantages of the morphing airfoil with auxetic
   structure are (i) larger displacement with limited straining of the
   components and (ii) unique deformation characteristics, which produce a
   theoretical in-plane Poisson's ratio of-1. Aluminum Alloy AL6061-T651 is
   considered in the design of all the structural elements. The compliance
   characteristics of the airfoil are investigated through a numerical
   model. The numerical results are observed to be in close agreement with
   the experimental results in the literature.}},

Abstract = {{Using Finite Element computer simulations, Poisson's ratio (PR) is
   determined for anti-chiral structures built on rectangular lattices with
   disorder introduced by stochastic distributions of circular node sizes.
   The investigated models are parameterized by the lattice anisotropy, the
   rib thickness, and the radii distribution of circular nodes. Three
   approaches are developed. The first approach, exact in the limit of
   infinitely large system and infinitely dense mesh, uses only planar
   elements (CPS3). Two other approaches are approximate and exploit
   one-dimensional elements utilizing the Timoshenko beam theory. It is
   shown that in the case of sufficiently large anisotropy of the studied
   structures PR can be highly negative, reaching any negative value,
   including those lower than -1. Thin ribs and thin-walled circular nodes
   favor low values of PR. In the case of thick ribs and thick-walled
   circular nodes PR is higher. In both cases the dispersion of the values
   of circular nodes radii has a minor effect on the lowest values of PR. A
   comparison of the results obtained with three different approaches shows
   that the Timoshenko beam based approximations are valid only in the thin
   rib limit. The difference between them grows with increasing thickness.

   determined. The characteristics of current pulses with voltages varying
   from -24 kV to -27 kV were compared and it has been found that the
   characteristics of the current magnitude and frequency are similar to
   those in air. The effects of the model coefficients-the ionization
   coefficient, the attachment coefficient, the mobility of charged species
   and the secondary emission coefficient-on the characteristics of current
   pulses have also been studied to investigate the sensitivities of the
   pulse parameters to these coefficients.}},

   negative in the viscoplastic region. The negative through-the-thickness
   Poisson's ratios of the {[}+/- 30 degrees] woven laminates were caused
   by the compressive stress with respect to the in-plane direction and the

Abstract = {{In this note it is shown that the combination of conventional laminas
   (possessing positive Poisson's ratio) and auxetic laminas (possessing
   negative Poisson's ratio) gives rise to effective in-plane composite
   laminate Young's modulus that surpasses the rule-of-mixture formula. To
   enable comparison between the developed model with the rule-of-mixture,
   the former is presented in such a way that two correction functions
   exist distinctively for multiplication into the two terms of the
   rule-of-mixture formula. Each of the two correction functions reduces to
   a minimum of 1 when all laminas possess equal Poisson's ratio, and the
   correction functions are greater than one when there exists mismatch in
   the Poisson's ratios among the laminas in the laminate. Plotted results
   show that the overshooting of the laminate's effective in-plane modulus
   is significant for semiauxetic laminates but not for conventional and
   fully auxetic materials.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic woven fabrics made with special geometrical structures have
   gained the interest of textile scientists in recent years. This paper
   reports a study on auxetic woven fabric based on a double-directional
   parallel in-phase zig-zag foldable geometrical structure. Such a fabric
   has been already produced and investigated for its negative Poisson's
   ratio effect in two principal directions (weft and warp directions).
   However, its negative Poisson's ratio effect in biased tensile
   directions as well as under repeated tensile loading conditions has not
   been studied yet. Therefore, in this paper, these two limitations are
   addressed. The auxetic woven fabric was firstly fabricated, and then
   subjected not only to tensile tests in different tensile directions,
   including two principle directions and three biased directions, but also
   to repeated tensile loading. It was found that both the negative
   Poisson's ratio effect and the resistance to tensile deformation are
   dependent upon the tensile direction, and the highest negative Poisson's
   ratio effect and higher resistance to tensile deformation are obtained
   in two principal directions.}},

Abstract = {{Hyperelastic auxetic cellular materials are negative Poisson's ratio
   (NPR) and show transverse expansion when stretched and lateral
   contraction when compressed. The influence of the direction of force on
   the auxetic property, effect of cell angle on Poisson's ratio, buckling
   property of RH structures has been discussed in this article. The
   results show that: re-entrant hexagon (RH) structure never shows
   non-auxetic behaivour when it is subjected to load vertical force while
   it shows non-auxetic performance when the force reach a certain value
   when it is subjected to load transverse force. When stretched in the
   vertical direction and within a certain displacement, RH structures with
   smaller angle requires smaller force. Meanwhile, RH structure with
   smaller angle has more obvious auxetic property. When the RH model was
   stretched, its Poisson's ratio first decreases and then increases.
   Buckling occurs when RH is subjected to load longitudinally, and as the
   total width of the simple increases, the number of buckling curves
   increases.}},

Abstract = {{The tensile behaviour of standard and auxetic polyurethane foams are
   contrasted by digital volume correlation of 3D images collected by in
   situ X-ray computed tomography (CT). It was found that subset sizes of
   32 and 64 voxels for the auxetic and standard foams were optimal for
   strain resolutions in the order of 0.1\%. For the standard foam, good
   uniformity of strain was observed at low strains giving a tangent
   Poisson's ratio of 0.5. Some heterogeneity of strain was observed at
   higher strains, which may be related to the fixtures. The behaviour of
   the auxetic foam was totally different, with strain being spatially
   heterogeneous with transverse strains both positive and negative but
   giving a negative Poisson's ratio on average. This suggests that the
   unfolding tendency of some groups of cells was higher than others
   because of the complex frozen starting microstructure. Further different
   methods of deriving Poisson's ratio gave different results. Besides
   revealing interesting microstuctural mechanisms of transverse straining,
   the study also shows digital volume correlation of tomography sequences
   to be the perfect tool to study complex mechanical behaviour of cellular
   materials.}},

   graphene kirigami}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{OCT 12}},
Abstract = {{Graphene is an active element used in the design of
   nano-electro-mechanical systems (NEMS) owing to its excellent in-plane
   physical properties on mechanical, electric and thermal aspects.
   Considering a component requiring negative Poisson's ratio in NEMS, a
   graphene kirigami (GK) containing periodic re-entrant honeycombs is a
   natural option. This study demonstrates that a GK with specific auxetic
   property can be obtained by adjusting the sizes of its honeycombs. Using
   molecular dynamics experiments, the size effects on the auxetic
   behaviour of GK are investigated. In some cases, the auxetic difference
   between the hydrogenated GK and continuum kirigami (CK) is negligible,
   in which the results from macro CK can be used to predict auxetic
   behaviour of nano kirigami. Surface effect of GK is demonstrated from
   two aspects. One is to identify the difference of mechanical responses
   between the pure carbon GK and the hydrogenated GK at same geometry and
   loading condition. Another is from the difference of mechanical
   responses between the GK model and the CK model under same loading
   condition and geometric configuration. Generally, surface energy makes
   the GK possess higher variation of auxetic behaviour. It also results in
   higher modulus for the GK as comparing with that of the CK.}},

   isolation}},
Journal = {{FRATTURA ED INTEGRITA STRUTTURALE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Number = {{51}},
Pages = {{52-70}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Base isolation is a widely-used method used to minimise the harmful
   effects of earthquakes on buildings. Unlike a fixed base building, a
   building with a base isolation system essentially decouples the
   superstructure from the substructure resting on the ground. Then, during
   earthquakes, the superstructure's relative displacement is significantly
   reduced, minimising the structural damage. Auxetics, which are materials
   with a negative Poisson's ratio, are known for possessing properties
   such as high energy absorption. Based on the energy absorbing
   capabilities of auxetic materials, it is proposed that incorporating
   them into base isolation structures would positively impact on the
   performance of the system. Therefore, the article aims to investigate
   the response of structures under seismic loading incorporating
   re-entrant hexagon layers into the base isolation system. This is
   assessed by defining and numerically testing the system using finite
   element analysis. The models developed for this study represent
   multi-story structural steel frames combined with fixed base,
   conventional lead-rubber bearing and auxetic composite base isolation.
   Differences in the response obtained from the mentioned systems are
   highlighted. Results indicate that the auxetic base isolation may

Abstract = {{Recent theoretical work suggests that systematic pruning of disordered
   networks consisting of nodes connected by springs can lead to materials
   that exhibit a host of unusual mechanical properties. In particular,
   global properties such as Poisson's ratio or local responses related to
   deformation can be precisely altered. Tunable mechanical responses would
   be useful in areas ranging from impact mitigation to robotics and, more
   generally, for creation of metamaterials with engineered properties.
   However, experimental attempts to create auxetic materials based on
   pruningbased theoretical ideas have not been successful. Here we
   introduce a more realistic model of the networks, which incorporates
   angle-bending forces and the appropriate experimental boundary
   conditions. A sequential pruning strategy of select bonds in this model
   is then devised and implemented that enables engineering of specific
   mechanical behaviors upon deformation, both in the linear and in the
   nonlinear regimes. In particular, it is shown that Poisson's ratio can
   be tuned to arbitrary values. The model and concepts discussed here are
   validated by preparing physical realizations of the networks designed in
   this manner, which are produced by laser cutting 2D sheets and are found
   to behave as predicted. Furthermore, by relying on optimization
   algorithms, we exploit the networks' susceptibility to tuning to design
   networks that possess a distribution of stiffer and more compliant bonds
   and whose auxetic behavior is even greater than that of homogeneous
   networks. Taken together, the findings reported here serve to establish
   that pruned networks represent a promising platform for the creation of
   unique mechanical metamaterials.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials are characterized by a negative Poisson's ratio, nu.
   As the Poisson's ratio approaches the lower isotropic mechanical limit
   of nu = -1, materials show enhanced resistance to impact and shear,
   making them suitable for applications ranging from robotics to impact
   mitigation. Past experimental efforts aimed at reaching the nu = -1
   limit have resulted in highly anisotropic materials, which show a
   negative Poisson's ratio only when subjected to deformations along
   specific directions. Isotropic designs have only attained moderately
   auxetic behavior or have led to solutions that cannot be manufactured in
   3D. Here, we present a design strategy to create isotropic structures
   from disordered networks, which result in Poisson's ratios as low as nu
   = -0.98. The materials conceived through this approach are successfully
   fabricated in the laboratory and behave as predicted. nu depends on
   network structure and bond strengths; this sheds light on the motifs
   which lead to auxetic behavior. The ideas introduced here can be
   generalized to 3D, a wide range of materials, and a spectrum of length
   scales, thereby providing a general platform that could impact
   technology.}},

Journal = {{THIN-WALLED STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{148}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{This paper reports a study on the large amplitude nonlinear vibration of
   carbon nanotube-reinforced composite (CNTRC) laminated plates with
   negative Poisson's ratios in thermal environments. The constituent
   materials of CNTRCs are temperature-dependent and the plate is
   functionally graded (FG) in a piece-wise pattern in the thickness
   direction of plate. An extended Voigt (rule of mixture) model is adopted
   to quantify the CNTRC material properties of the laminated plate. The
   governing motion equations for the large amplitude vibration of FG-CNTRC
   laminated plates are based on the Reddy's third order shear deformation
   theory and the von Karman-type kinematic nonlinearity framework, and the
   thermal effects and the reaction from elastic foundation are taken into
   account. The nonlinear solution of the motion equation can be obtained
   by applying a two-step perturbation approach. The effects of material
   property gradient, the temperature variation, stacking sequence as well
   as the foundation stiffness on the vibration characteristics of CNTRC
   laminated plates are examined and discussed in depth through a
   parametric study. The results show that negative Poisson's ratio has a
   significant effect on the linear and nonlinear vibration characteristics
   of CNTRC laminated plates.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel auxetic weft-knitted fabric was firstly designed,
   which was based on the rhombus-shaped grid re-entrant structure. Then
   the fabric was fabricated using Kevlar filament yarn with 200D fineness
   on a computerized flat knitting machine. And the Poisson's ratio values
   in weft, warp, and diagonal directions of this weft-knitted fabric were
   measured. The results showed that it exhibits the negative Poisson's
   ratio effect in all three directions. Then the quasi-static stab
   resistance tests at five different puncture speeds were carried out on
   this auxetic weft-knitted fabric and the plain weft-knitted fabric with
   same raw material and similar loop length. The experimental results show
   that the auxetic weft-knitted fabric has higher peak load and energy
   absorption capacity at quasi-static loading. The results also show that
   the quasi-static stab resistance of the auxetic weft-knitted fabric
   strengthens with the increase of the puncture speed, but changes little
   after the puncture speed reaches a certain value (50 mm/min).}},

Abstract = {{The influence of the Poisson's ratio of the foam on the energy
   absorption of the foam-filled tube is investigated in this paper.
   Firstly, the relationship between the mechanical properties and the
   structural parameters of the 3D lattice structure is calculated by using
   the theory of material mechanics. The finite element analysis software
   ABAQUS is used to simulate the axial dynamic response of cylindrical
   tubes filled with conventional and negative Poisson's ratio foams. Based
   on this, the interaction between the tube wall and foam is analyzed in
   detail. Combining the structural properties of both the positive and
   negative Poisson's ratio foams, a new foam model with mixed Poisson's
   ratio (MPR) is proposed, and the crashworthiness of three different
   types of tubes, namely the sandwich double tubes filled with positive,
   negative and mixed Poisson's ratio foams, is analyzed. The results show
   that the interaction between the foam and the tube wall has a
   significant effect on the energy absorption performance. The sandwich
   double tube filled with MPR foam has better specific energy absorption
   (SEA) and stronger interaction than those filled with pure positive or
   negative Poisson's ratio foam. This study provides a new insight into
   crashworthiness design of foam-filled structures.}},

Abstract = {{To investigate the performance of gypsum rock softened by water in the
   tunneling, gypsum rocks from Lower Triassic Jialing River Group were
   immersed by fresh water within different times for softening tests. The
   variations of uniaxial compressive strength, shear strength, elastic
   modulus and Poisson's ratio of gypsum rocks with increasing immersion
   time were analyzed. The study indicated that, with the increase of the
   immersion time, the uniaxial compressive strength, shear strength and
   elastic modulus of gypsum rock exhibited a decline trend as a negative
   exponent, while Poisson's ratio presented a linear increase trend under
   certain conditions. On the basis of damage mechanics, a softening damage
   evolution equation was deduced by considering time effect of gypsum
   rock. The relationship between the brittleness coefficient and
   softening-damage variable was revealed, and the softening-depth model at
   different immersion time was established. This study can be used to
   identify the softening area of surrounding rock caused by groundwater in
   the tunneling through gypsum layer.}},

Abstract = {{A FAMILY of two-dimensional, two-phase, composite materials with
   hexagonal symmetry is found with Poisson's ratios arbitrarily close to
   -1. Letting kappa{*}, kappa-1, kappa-2 and mu{*}, mu-1, mu-2 denote the
   bulk and shear moduli of one such composite, stiff inclusion phase and
   compliant matrix phase, respectively, it is rigorously established that
   when kappa-1 = kappa-2/r and mu-1 = mu-2/r there exists a constant c
   depending only on kappa-2, mu-2 and the geometry such that
   kappa{*}/mu{*} < c square-root s for all sufficiently small stiffness
   ratios r (specifically for r < 1/9). This implies that the Poisson's
   ratio approaches -1 as r --> 0 and in this limit it is conjectured that
   the material deforms conformally on a macroscopic scale. By introducing
   additional microstructure on a smaller length scale a second family of
   composites is obtained with substantially lower Poisson's ratios, each
   satisfying kappa{*}/mu{*} < c'r. These two families provide conclusive
   proof that isotropic materials with negative Poisson's ratio exist
   within the framework of continuum elasticity. It is also shown that
   elastically isotropic two- and three-dimensional composites with
   Poisson's ratio approaching -1 as r --> 0 can be generated simply by
   layering the component materials together in different directions on
   widely separated length scales.}},

   with graded auxetic mechanical metamaterials}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{466}},
Month = {{FEB 3}},
Abstract = {{An exciting paradigm in the ongoing development of materials is the
   development of auxetic mechanical metamaterials, which can be flexibly
   designed to exhibit a unique range of physical and mechanical
   properties. Inspired by nonuniform or nonhomogeneous metamaterials and
   structures, annular cellular structures composed of auxetic
   metamaterials with graded negative Poisson's ratios (NPRs) are studied,
   and the considered models are divided into two types of configurations:
   models with graded decreasing NPRs and models with graded increasing
   NPRs along the radial direction. The spectral element method (SEM) is
   applied to accurately predict the structural dynamic responses with a
   limited number of elements and the system scale for arbitrary
   frequencies. The static stiffness and vibro-acoustic performance of the
   proposed structures are investigated and compared. The computational
   results show that the bending stiffness, vibrating mode shapes and
   deformations, and sound transmission loss (STL) of the considered
   cellular structures are strongly affected by the arbitrarily patterned
   graded auxetic metamaterials. Within the studied STL frequency range
   from 1 to 1500 Hz, optimal designs of the conventional and graded
   configurations for the maximum STL are obtained for specified tonal and
   frequency band cases under cylindrical incident sound waves. The results
   show that the graded configurations have more potential than the
   conventional ones for optimal acoustic performance and that compared
   with the graded decreasing NPR models, the graded increasing NPR models
   exhibit STL increases of 6.73 dB, 1.22 dB, and 2.06 dB for the studied
   cases. Both the STL and optimal design results indicate the advantages
   of the graded increasing NPR models for use in acoustic attenuation
   applications. Thus, graded auxetic metamaterials offer a great
   opportunity for achieving unusual vibro-acoustic performance and
   extending the route to obtain an optimized set of physical properties
   for cellular metamaterials and structures. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All

Journal = {{COMPUTER METHODS IN APPLIED MECHANICS AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{360}},
Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents an investigation on the nonlinear flexural
   vibrations of carbon nanotube-reinforced composite (CNTRC) laminated
   cylindrical shells with negative Poisson's ratios in thermal
   environments. The material properties of the CNTRCs are
   temperature-dependent and the functionally graded (FG) in a piece-wise
   pattern in the thickness direction of the shell. An extended Voigt (rule
   of mixture) model is employed to estimate the CNTRC material properties.
   The motion equations for the nonlinear flexural vibration of FG-CNTRC
   laminated cylindrical shells are based on the Reddy's third order shear
   deformation theory and the von Karman-type kinematic nonlinearity, and
   the effects of thermal environmental conditions are included. The
   nonlinear vibration solutions for the FG-CNTRC laminated cylindrical
   shells can be obtained by applying a singular perturbation technique
   along with a two-step perturbation approach. The effects of material
   property gradient, the temperature variation, shell geometric parameter,
   stacking sequence as well as the end conditions on the vibration
   characteristics of CNTRC laminated cylindrical shells are discussed in
   detail through a parametric study. The results show that negative
   Poisson's ratio has a significant effect on the linear and nonlinear
   vibration characteristics of CNTRC laminated cylindrical shells. (C)

Abstract = {{In modern technologies searching materials of peculiar features is of a
   fundamental interest for many researchers and engineers. Negative
   Poisson's ratio materials and structures expand transversely when
   stretching axially. Nowadays, there is an increasing interest in the
   development of these novel materials called auxetics. We are interested
   not only in their mechanical properties, but also in their interaction
   with external physical fields, e. g. electromagnetic field. It is
   expected that magnetoelastic surface waves propagation has essential
   meaning in many other physical and biomechanical applications. The paper
   aims at investigating propagation of magnetoelastic surface waves along
   an auxetic elastic halfspace in the presence of an external magnetic
   field of various orientations related to the limiting plane. Dispersion
   and existence conditions of those waves have been calculated and
   analyzed in order to present new features of described interactions. It
   has occurred that the dispersion properties in the case of the
   Rayleigh-like magnetoelastic surface waves are significantly different
   for the auxetic material compared to materials of positive Poisson's
   ratio.}},

Title = {{Phase contrast mediated switch of auxetic mechanism in composites of
   infilled re-entrant honeycomb microstructures}},
Journal = {{EXTREME MECHANICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{35}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Metamaterials are man-made, usually periodically microstructured
   materials with at least one uncommon property, e.g., auxeticity. Often,
   their properties are due to their specific microstructural layouts in
   addition to their constituent materials. In this work, we explore the
   influence of constituent materials on the effective elasticity of a
   two-phase composite consisting of a infilled re-entrant honeycomb
   microstructure. We show that the composite with non-auxetic constituent
   materials becomes auxetic if the Young's modulus contrast between the
   two phases exceeds a certain critical value. We reveal the existence of
   a phase contrast mediated switch of auxetic mechanism - a finding
   reported for the first time in this paper. If the re-entrant honeycomb
   phase is stiffer than the filling phase, the auxeticity stems from the
   conventional re-entrant mechanism, similar to re-entrant honeycomb
   structures. However, if the re-entrant honeycomb phase is softer than
   the filling phase, the auxeticity originates from the relative
   microscopic sliding between adjacent fillings under macroscopic axial
   loading. Our results provide guidelines on tuning the effective
   elasticity and the auxeticity of such composites by educated choices of
   the constituent materials and the underlying microstructural geometry.

Abstract = {{A rectangular-cells with triangular array and a triangular-cells with
   rectangular array composite microstructures are introduced herein, which
   can exhibit Poisson's ratio sign switching upon reversal of applied
   stress direction. Each of these microstructures consists of short rigid
   rods and long flexible rods held together by pin joints. The choice of
   microstructures permits them to be converted into either conventional or
   auxetic microstructural geometries depending on the collective
   deflection patterns of the long flexible rods. Specifically, the
   micro-structures convert into conventional and auxetic ones when loading
   causes the long flexible rods to deflect outward and inward,
   respectively. The same consideration applies in the case of thermal
   expansion analysis, which leads to positive and negative thermal
   expansivities under constraint condition. Generated results were made on
   the basis of moderately large deflection analysis and buckling analysis.
   A greater range of applications can be made on a single structure when
   it can exhibit greatly differing, or even opposing, properties under
   loadings of opposite directions.}},

Title = {{Predicting an ideal 2D carbon nanostructure with negative Poisson's
   ratio from first principles: implications for nanomechanical devices}},
Journal = {{CARBON LETTERS}},
Abstract = {{The intrinsic negative Poisson's ratio effect at the level of molecule
   in two-dimensional nanomaterials, especially in the perfect planar
   nanostructures with a single atom thickness, is really rare and has
   attracted a lot of research interests because of its unique mechanical
   properties in the nanoscale and extensive applications in mechanical
   nanodevices. In this work, a novel ideal planar carbon nanostructure
   (PCNS) framework with a single atom thickness composed by carbon and
   hydrogen atoms is proposed and studied by means of first-principles
   density functional calculation. The results showed that the PCNS is,
   simultaneously, of excellent thermodynamic, molecular dynamic and
   mechanical stabilities. In addition, the electronic structure,
   mechanical characters, and optical-electronic characteristics of PCNS
   are also explored. Excitedly, it is found that the PCNS has a
   significant negative Poisson's ratio effect in plane, and the maximum
   value of Poisson's ratio is as high as - 2.094. Meanwhile, the material
   has a wide range of elastic mechanics. Moreover, the PCNS presents an
   ideal UV absorption performance. It is hoped that this work could be a
   useful structural design strategy for the development of the ideal 2D
   carbon-based nanomechanical devices with the intrinsic negative
   Poisson's ratio effect and other electronic functions.

Abstract = {{This research presents an investigation of the compressive behavior of
   auxetic cementitious cellular composites (CCCs) using a combination of
   experiments and finite element (FE) simulations. Typical auxetic
   centrosymmetric geometry was used as unit cells for the cellular
   structure and fiber reinforced cementitious mortar were used as
   constituent material. By varying the cellular geometry, three CCCs (P0,
   P25 and P50) were prepared then experimentally and numerically tested
   under uniaxial compression with different boundary conditions. Good
   agreement can be found between experimental and FE simulated results:
   Only CCCs with chiral section (P25 and P50) exhibited auxetic behavior
   and a typical compressive stress-strain response with two peaks was
   found; Under restrained boundary condition, different from the cone
   confinement zone observed in bulk cementitious materials, re-entrant
   confinement zone was found in the auxetic CCCs. More importantly, a
   cracking initiated section rotation mechanism is identified for the
   CCCs' auxetic behavior which is distinct from the elastic instability
   mechanism of polymeric auxetic materials with the same cellular
   structure. In terms of density, energy dissipation ability and Poisson's
   ratio, the auxetic CCCs shows excellent properties making them promising
   in various civil engineering applications. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

Volume = {{61}},
Pages = {{60-66}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{This short communication investigates the effect of negative Poisson's
   ratio on the natural frequency of thick plates of arbitrary shape. Using
   the Mindlin plate theory, it was generally found that as the plate's
   Poisson's ratio becomes more negative, the Mindlin-to-Kirchhoff natural
   frequency ratio increases with decreasing rate. Upon comparing (a) the
   use of the simplified constant shear correction factor and the more
   accurate variable shear correction factor, (b) with and without rotary
   inertia, it was found that all the four combinations stated in (a) and
   (b) do not give appreciable difference when the Poisson's ratio of the
   plate is positive. However in the case of plates with negative Poisson's
   ratio, results reveal that when at least one of the simplifying
   assumptions is used, the Mindlin-to-Kirchhoff natural frequency ratio is
   overestimated, and that the overestimation further increases when both
   the simplifying assumptions are used. When benchmarked against Reddy
   plate theory, the use of variable shear correction factor has almost the
   same effect as the inclusion of rotary inertia. Hence the use of either
   variable shear correction factor or rotary inertia is proposed for
   modeling the vibrational frequencies of conventional and auxetic
   isotropic plates. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{MAY 8}},
Abstract = {{Negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) in auxetic materials is of great interest
   due to the typically enhanced mechanical properties, which enables
   plenty of novel applications. In this paper, by employing
   first-principles calculations, we report the emergence of NPR in a class
   of two-dimensional honeycomb structures (graphene, silicene, h-BN,
   h-GaN, h-SiC, and h-BAs), which are distinct from all other known
   auxetic materials. They share the same mechanism for the emerged NPR
   despite the different chemical composition, which lies in the increased
   bond angle (theta). However, the increase of theta is quite intriguing
   and anomalous, which cannot be explained in the traditional point of
   view of the geometry structure and mechanical response, for example, in
   the framework of classical molecular dynamics simulations based on
   empirical potential. We attribute the counterintuitive increase of theta
   and the emerged NPR fundamentally to the strain-modulated electronic
   orbital coupling and hybridization. It is proposed that the NPR
   phenomenon can also emerge in other nanostructures or nanomaterials with
   similar honeycomb structure. The physical origin as revealed in our
   study deepens the understanding on the NPR and would shed light on
   future design of modern nanoscale electromechanical devices with special
   functions based on auxetic nanomaterials and nanostructures.}},

Title = {{A Novel Strategy for Constructing 3D Dislocated Chiral Metamaterial with
   Negative Poisson's Ratio}},
Journal = {{ADVANCED ENGINEERING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Metamaterials with negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) have a broad range of
   application background, such as aerospace engineering, automotive
   engineering, medical instrument engineering, and wearable engineering.
   Herein, a novel strategy for constructing 3D dislocated chiral
   metamaterial is proposed that can achieve NPR effect in three
   directions. According to this strategy, a new dislocated chiral
   metamaterial composed of dislocated tetrachiral honeycombs and inclined
   rods is designed and selected as an example to investigate the
   effectiveness of the strategy. Experiments and numerical simulations are
   carried out to study the mechanical properties of the new metamaterial,
   confirming that this metamaterial exhibits NPR effect. The influence of
   geometric parameters on the elastic constants of the metamaterial is
   discussed based on experimental and numerical results. Meanwhile, the
   local loading performances of this dislocated chiral metamaterial and
   the previous aligned chiral metamaterial are studied and compared.
   Results show that this dislocated metamaterial possesses a stronger
   damage resistance capacity than the aligned one. By adjusting the
   rotational direction of ligaments in honeycombs and the arrangement of
   inclined rods, more special 3D dislocated chiral metamaterials with
   advanced properties are available, such as metamaterial with both
   positive and NPRs, metamaterial with compression-torsion effect.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines a novel approach to designing auxetic textiles. Knit
   design techniques are used to create auxetic weft-knitted textiles.
   Development of the appropriate fabrics addresses aesthetic, tactile and
   subjective design qualities alongside questions of auxetic functionality
   and testing considerations. The auxetic fabrics produced exhibit
   expansion in the X- or Y-axis (aligning axes to direction of knitting).
   The results range from neutral Poisson's ratio to those with a marked
   expansion in relation to their extension. The fabric discussed uses
   relief stitch structures and transferred stitches. Variant auxetic
   knitted fabrics have been produced including related stitch structures
   and spacer fabrics using the same design processes. The auxetic effects
   are inspired by common auxetic geometries from the literature. This
   research aims to combine the methodologies used in knit design and knit
   engineering to create functional auxetic textiles by using the methods
   innate to a more traditionally aesthetic design subject. Using
   quantitative methods to measure the auxetic effect in the samples and
   qualitative personal reflections on samples, results are kept simple in
   order to promote dissemination amongst practitioners in different
   fields. Utilising focus groups with practitioners from various design
   fields it is also possible to assess the visual, tactile and commercial
   appeal of the auxetic fabrics whilst they are still in the developmental
   stage. Using these different methods of feedback into the design stage
   the theoretical outcome remains simple in terms of language and results
   stated. The importance of knowledge transfer between disciplines of
   design and engineering is key to this study. Data capture is imperative
   encompassing qualitative and quantitative perspectives in conjunction
   with the use of generically specified terminology. The knowledge
   transfer afforded by these collaborations is a key output to support the
   methods chosen for fabric development, those which cross disciplines and
   appeal to a wide market. Along with an open and experimental approach to
   conceiving product applications, this will help to place auxetic
   materials in public view in areas that are novel to the field of auxetic
   research. (C) 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA, Weinheim}},

Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{Nanocomposite materials, such as carbon nanotube-reinforced composites
   (CNTRCs), have emerged as a novel engineering material. They have
   received growing attentions in various engineering sectors. The
   fabrication process has also offered the possibility to design and make
   this type of material to have desired features, such as being
   functionally graded (FG) or/and having negative Poison's ratio. This
   paper reports an investigation on the nonlinear flexural behavior of
   auxetic laminated beams with each layer is made of CNTRC. Each layer may
   have different CNT volume fractions and the functional grading occurs in
   the thickness direction of the beam in the piece-wise pattern. The
   extended rule of mixture model is used to evaluate the
   temperature-dependent material properties of CNTRCs. The governing
   equations for the nonlinear bending of FG-CNTRC laminated beams are
   derived based on the high order shear deformation beam theory. These
   equations include the geometrical nonlinearity in the von Karman sense
   and take into account the thermal effect and the beam-foundation
   interaction. The nonlinear bending solutions can be obtained by
   employing a two-step perturbation approach. The nonlinear flexural
   responses of FG-CNTRC laminated beams under a uniform pressure in
   thermal environments are revealed and examined in details through a
   parametric study. Results showed that the negative Poisson's ratio has a
   significant impact on the nonlinear flexural behavior of CNTRC laminated
   beams.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports a finite element (FE) analysis of three-dimensional
   (3D) auxetic textile composite by using commercial software ANSYS 15
   under compression. The two-dimensional (2D) FE model was first developed
   and validated by experiment. Then, the validated model was used to
   evaluate effects of structural parameters and constituent material
   properties. For the comparison, 3D non-auxetic composite that was made
   with the same constituent materials and structural parameters, but with
   different yarn arrangement in the textile structure was also analyzed at
   the same time. The analysis results showed that the auxetic and
   non-auxetic composites have different compression behaviors and the
   auxetic composite has better the energy absorption capacity than the
   non-auxetic composite under the same compression stress. The study has
   provided us a guidance to design and fabricate auxetic composites with
   the required mechanical behavior by appropriately selecting structural
   parameters and constituent materials.}},

Abstract = {{Herein, the effect of symmetric carbon fiber composites laminates with
   angle-ply stacking sequences ({[}+/-beta/+/-theta](S)) in the design of
   composite piezoelectric energy harvesters (PEHs) is evaluated. Some of
   those specific stacking sequences also feature negative Poisson's ratio
   (NPR) or near zero Poisson's ratio (NZPR) through the thickness for ply
   angles theta < 45 degrees. Six different architectures with similar
   in-plane elastic modulusE(1)and different positive Poisson's ratio and
   NPRv(13)values are considered here. Finite element models are developed
   to understand the distribution of the voltage density of the laminates
   with the different stacking sequences and their bending properties.
   Experimental tests (three-point bending and vibration) are also
   performed. Both the simulations and the experimental results show that
   the PEH with the stacking sequences of near zerov(13)generate the
   highest power compared with the other composite energy harvesters. The
   maximum voltage frequency response function (FRF) happens at the
   fundamental resonance, and the PEH with near zerov(13)has also the
   lowest resonance frequency compared with the other stacking sequences.}},

Abstract = {{An innovative three-dimensional (3D) auxetic structure based on 2D
   re-entrant honeycombs was developed in this article. A sample of the
   proposed structure made of acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) was
   fabricated through 3D printing technology, and a compression test was
   performed on it. Meanwhile, the unit cell required for the
   finite-element (FE) analysis was determined to simulate the auxetic
   behavior of the proposed structure. Both experimental and numerical
   results showed that the 3D structure can achieve a negative Poisson's
   ratio (NPR) in two principal orthogonal coordinate directions when it
   was compressed along the other principal axis. A systematic numerical
   simulation was performed through the experimentally validated finite
   element models to analyze the effects of structural parameters (i.e.,
   top-view reentrant angle and lateral-view re-entrant angle) and
   deformation on the auxetic behavior. Numerical results revealed that
   this structure can achieve a negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) under large
   deformation and the structural parameters and compression strain have
   significant effects on the auxetic behavior. Our structure, with large
   flexibility in design, is based on very simple initial geometric shapes.
   This analysis can provide useful information for the design, fabrication
   of this kind of 3D auxetic structure, which is promising in some
   technical applications. (C) 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA,

Title = {{Experimental and numerical study of auxetic sandwich panels on 160 grams
   of PE4 blast loading}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SANDWICH STRUCTURES \& MATERIALS}},
Abstract = {{Mines, specifically as Anti-Tank (AT) mines are a significant threat for
   defence vehicles. While approaches such as v-shaped hulls are currently
   used to deflect the blast products from such threats, such a solution is
   not always usable when hull standoff is limited. As such the development
   of a low profile, energy absorbing solution is desirable. One approach
   that has potential to achieve these requirements are sandwich panels.
   While sandwich panel cores can be constructed from various materials,
   one material of particular interest are auxetics. Auxetic are materials
   that exhibit a negative Poisson's ratio. This material has potential to
   be an efficient an impact energy absorber by increasing stiffness at
   local deformation by gathering mass at the impact location. This study
   investigates the effectiveness of novel auxetic core infills alongside
   three other panel types (monolithic, air gap, polymer foam sandwich)
   against buried charges. 160 grams of PE4 were buried in 100 mm depth and
   500 mm stand off the target. Laser and High Speed Video (HSV) system
   were used to capture the deflection-time profile and load cell sensors
   were used to record the loading profile received by the panels.
   Experimental works were compared with numerical model. Explicit model
   were generated in LSDYNA software as `initial impulse mine' keyword. The
   result found that the auxetic and foam core panels were effective in
   reducing peak structural loading and impulse by up to 33\% and 34\%
   respectively. Air-filled panels were the most effective to reduce the
   deflection of the rear of the plate, however variation between capture
   methods (HSV and Laser system) were reported, while numerical modelling
   provided comparable plate deflections responses. When normalised against
   panel weight, the air filled panels were experimentally the most
   efficient per unit mass system with the auxetics being the least
   effective.}},

Abstract = {{A novel 3D re-entrant chiral auxetic (RCA) structure has been proposed
   for the first time in this study. The unit cell has been developed with
   solid cubes and struts based on the topological features of both
   re-entrant honeycomb and chiral honeycomb. A recently developed powerful
   3D printing process, Multi Jet Fusion (MJF), has been employed to print
   six samples from polyamide 12 (PA 12). Uniaxial quasi-static compressive
   tests have been performed in the X, Y and Z directions to investigate
   the deformation, Poisson's ratio and energy absorption of the proposed
   structure. Finite element (FE) models have been developed using
   ANSYS/LS-DYNA and verified by the respective experimental data. The
   experimental microscopic measurements reveal high accuracy of MJF
   process to produce robust parts with smooth internal morphology. The
   designed cubes are found to demonstrate a similar rotation function to
   that of cylinders of the corresponding 2D RCA structure. The plastic
   bending and buckling are found to be the dominated deformation
   mechanisms for the samples compressed in the Y direction, while plastic
   bending is the dominated deformation mechanism for the samples
   compressed in the X and Z directions. The proposed structure displays
   auxetic feature under uniaxial compression in all three directions,
   which facilitates a more severe compaction of the structure and results
   in an improved load carrying capacity. It is also found that the
   compressed RCA structure when loaded in the X direction outperforms in
   terms of auxeticity and energy absorption compared with the other (Y and
   Z) directions. The proposed 3D RCA structure has anisotropic properties.}},

Abstract = {{Cellular core structures with a negative Poisson's ratio, also known as
   auxetic core structures, are gaining attention due to their unique
   performance in sandwich panel systems for protecting critical
   infrastructures and military vehicles that are at high risk of blast and
   impact loads due to accidental and deliberate events. To help develop a
   high-performance protective system, this article outlines the
   performance evaluation of five different auxetic cell configurations
   based on a quantitative/qualitative review of an experimental
   load-deformation relationship of three-dimensional-printed auxetic
   panels from nylon plastics and the overall performance evaluation of
   metallic re-entrant honeycomb core sandwich panels as one type of
   lightweight protective system under static and dynamic loads via
   experimental testing and numerical simulations. The re-entrant honeycomb
   design displayed the most consistent auxetic behaviour. Quasi-static
   compression and drop hammer impact tests were performed using the
   proposed full-scale sandwich panel design with two different
   configurations as a protective system for concrete wall structures in
   combination with plastic face plates. The effect of the internal angle
   of the re-entrant honeycomb design and the effect of the core material
   under static and dynamic loads were evaluated using full-scale sandwich
   panels. Furthermore, two separate materials - acrylonitrile butadiene
   styrene and low-density polyethylene - were used as face plates, and the
   low-density polyethylene was effective for lightweight and smooth load
   transferring and distribution into the auxetic core. Auxetic panel
   deformation under static and dynamic load was examined using a normal
   speed camera and high-speed video recording data and all auxetic panels
   indicated excellent systematic crushing behaviour with drawing materials
   into the load path to effectively resist the impact load. Numerical
   simulations were performed using LS-DYNA and indicated good agreement
   with the experimental results. Finally, protective systems utilising
   sandwich panels with a re-entrant honeycomb core indicated strong
   potential for the development of high-performance lightweight
   impact-resistant protective systems.}},

Abstract = {{Composites with auxetic effect have been drawing more attention in
   recent years due to their unique features and wide applications. In this
   study, a kind of novel multilayer orthogonal structural composite with
   auxetic effect was fabricated for energy absorption and impact
   resistance. Non-auxetic composite with the same raw materials but with
   different reinforcement structure was also fabricated for comparison in
   order to better understand the effect of reinforced structure on the
   deformation mechanism and mechanical responses of the composites. Since
   the quasi-static compressive properties and Poisson's ratio effect of
   composites had been investigated previously, this paper only focused on
   the study of the low velocity drop-weight impact tests of composites
   under impact energies from 7.25 J to 65.25 J. It was shown that both
   auxetic and non-auxetic composites were strain rate sensitive from 34.23
   s(-1) to 111.48 s(-1), but they exhibited totally different mechanical
   responses due to different deformation and damage mechanism. Pull out
   tests demonstrated that strong interfacial bonding between the
   reinforcements and matrix could ensure the desired deformation of
   structural reinforcements and auxetic effect of the composite. It was
   also concluded that the auxetic composite had better energy absorption
   performance in medium strain range. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The conventional magnetostrictive strain sensor suffers from low
   detection sensitivity. In this study, a wireless and passive
   magnetostrictive strain sensor with improved sensitivity was proposed,
   modelled, analyzed, and tested. A hollow plate with a negative Poisson's
   ratio structure was taken as the substrate, substituting this for the
   conventional positive Poisson's ratio material. An analysis model was
   established for the negative Poisson's ratio substrate. Finite element
   method (FEM) analysis was conducted to verify the negative Poisson's
   ratio model. Experiments were carried out to prove the sensitivity
   enhancement principle. Parametric studies were conducted to investigate
   the influence of the geometry dimension on the output of the electric
   signal. We show that the proposed sensor has an improved strain test
   sensitivity of up to 176.3\%. The experimental results further indicate
   that different geometry dimensions of the negative Poisson's ratio have
   different influences on the sensitivity of the magnetostrictive strain
   sensor. The proposed magnetostrictive strain sensor shows the advantages
   of high sensitivity, easy implementation, convenient fabrication, and
   low cost.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials have a negative Poisson's ratio, that is, they expand
   laterally when stretched longitudinally. Negative Poisson's ratio is an
   unusual property that affects many of the mechanical properties of the
   material, such as indentation resistance, compression, shear stiffness,
   and certain aspects of the dynamic performance. The unusual mechanical
   properties of auxetic foams are attributed to the deformation
   characteristics of re-entrant microstructures. One way of obtaining
   negative Poisson's ratio is by using a re-entrant cell structure.
   Auxetic foam was fabricated from a conventional polymeric foam. The
   fabrication method for making both small and large auxetic foam
   specimens is described.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB 26}},
Abstract = {{We propose that wave propagation through a class of mechanical
   metamaterials opens unprecedented avenues in seismic wave protection
   based on spectral properties of auxetic-like metamaterials. The elastic
   parameters of these metamaterials like the bulk and shear moduli, the
   mass density, and even the Poisson ratio, can exhibit negative values in
   elastic stop bands. We show here that the propagation of seismic waves
   with frequencies ranging from 1 Hz to 40 Hz can be influenced by a
   decameter scale version of auxetic-like metamaterials buried in the
   soil, with the combined effects of impedance mismatch, local resonances
   and Bragg stop bands. More precisely, we numerically examine and
   illustrate the markedly different behaviors between the propagation of
   seismic waves through a homogeneous isotropic elastic medium (concrete)
   and an auxetic-like metamaterial plate consisting of 4(3) cells (40 m x
   40 m x 40 m), utilized here as a foundation of a building one would like
   to protect from seismic site effects. This novel class of seismic
   metamaterials opens band gaps at frequencies compatible with seismic
   waves when they are designed appropriately, what makes them interesting
   candidates for seismic isolation structures.}},

Abstract = {{A numerical analysis using the finite element (FE) method was conducted
   to investigate the deformation behavior of a novel three-dimensional
   (3D) textile structure made by a special arrangement of the weft and
   warp yarns in a 3D orthogonal structure to achieve negative Poisson's
   ratio (NPR). The minimum number of unit cells required for the FE
   analysis was first determined by comparing the calculating results of
   Poisson's ratio values based on the FE models built with fixed
   structural parameters and yarn properties. Then Poisson's ratio values
   of the 3D textile structure with different structural parameters and
   yarn properties under compression were calculated using the FE models
   built with the determined unit cells. The calculating results show that
   the 3D structure can achieve NPR in one direction if the weft and warp
   yarns used have different bending stiffness and radii. This numerical
   analysis can provide useful information for the design and fabrication
   of this kind of 3D textile structure, which has high potential

Abstract = {{The unique physical properties of auxetic compounds make them very
   attractive materials. Nevertheless, no synthesised materials known to
   exhibit negative Poisson's ratio at the molecular level have been made.
   One way to explore such compounds is to predict potential candidates
   prior to their synthesis. To achieve it, multi-atom simulation is a
   powerful predicting tool. However, the lack of existing systems means
   that the crucial step of validation cannot be carried out. This paper
   aims to provide a procedure to predict the auxeticity of proposed
   molecular systems. The strategy is based on first revealing the
   determinant step in reaching the mechanical equilibrium of existing
   isotropic compounds such as polymers, or organic glasses, to compute
   efficiently mechanical properties. The Poisson's ratio is found in good
   agreement with experimental data. The procedure is thus modified to be
   applied to anisotropic compounds, liquid crystals. The agreement with
   experimental behaviour allowed us to extrapolate the procedure to
   potentially auxetic compounds, thus offering great opportunities to
   reveal auxetic properties prior to the synthesis of the molecules.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, beta-Te {[}atomically two-dimensional (2D) tellurium] with
   rectangular crystal structure has been synthesized successfully on
   highly oriented pyrolytic graphite substrates by using molecular beam
   epitaxy {[}Z. Zhu et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 119, 106101 (2017); Chen et
   al., Nanoscale 9, 15945 (2017)]. It has been found to possess remarkable
   properties such as ultralow lattice thermal conductivity and high
   thermoelectric efficiency. Based on first-principles calculations, we
   study the thermal expansion and thermodynamic properties of the
   experimental phase monolayer beta-Te, using the quasiharmonic approach.
   It is found that beta-Te shows large positive thermal expansion at
   elevated temperature, while the linear thermal expansion coefficient is
   negative along the a direction at very low temperature. The linear
   thermal expansion coefficient along the b direction is 4.9 x 10(-5) K-1
   at 500 K, which is considerably large in 2D materials. beta-Te exhibits
   strong in-plane anisotropy, including thermal expansion, 2D elastic
   moduli, and Poisson's ratios. However, the elastic moduli, Poisson's
   ratios and the in-plane anisotropy are weakened with increasing
   temperature, and the variations are dominated by the generalized mode
   Gruneisen parameters.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the nonlinear flexural vibration of sandwich

   variation of effective Poisson's ratio (EPR) of the sandwich beams in
   the large deflection region. Numerical simulations are carried out for
   the sandwich beam with FG-NPR honeycomb core in different thermal
   environmental conditions, from which results for the same sandwich beam
   with uniform distributed NPR honeycomb core are obtained as a basis for
   comparison. The effects of FG configurations, temperature changes,

Abstract = {{Natrolite (NAT) is a zeolite which exhibits negative Poisson's ratios
   (auxetic) in its (001) plane (i.e. expands laterally when uniaxially
   stretched and becomes narrower when compressed), a property which has
   now been verified experimentally. It was recently shown that the empty
   SiO2 equivalent of the NAT framework is more auxetic if it is tested in
   conditions of positive external hydrostatic pressures. Here, we report
   results of additional simulations which show that the extent of auxetic
   behaviour of NAT having the standard composition (i.e.
   Na-2(Al2Si3O10)center dot 2H(2)O) is also highly dependent on the
   magnitude of external pressure where it is tested. However, in contrast
   with the behaviour of its empty silica equivalent, NAT exhibits maximum
   auxetic behaviour at negative external hydrostatic pressures (i.e.
   partial vacuum conditions). This is very significant as it highlights
   the fact that auxetic behaviour may be more prominent in materials if
   they are tested at non-ambient pressure conditions. An attempt is made
   to explain this behaviour. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{A novel negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) foam-filled corrugated tube, made

   the finite element method. The 3D NPR isotropic foam core is achieved by
   using the triaxial compression method on a cubic Voronoi model, which is
   created based on the Voronoi tessellation technique. The triaxial
   compression ratio is defined as eta. The Poisson's ratio of Voronoi foam
   decreases sharply and then increases gradually with an increasing eta. A
   minimum Poisson's ratio, -0.076, is obtained when eta = 0.2. Moreover,
   the Voronoi foam-filled corrugated tube with minimum Poisson's ratio
   foam core exhibits the highest energy absorption capacity, which is
   10.8\% higher than that of the Voronoi foam-filled corrugated tubes with

Abstract = {{Recent frontiers in material development are represented by a class of
   so-called auxetic metamaterials that, thanks to their structure rather
   than composition, are characterized by a negative Poisson's ratio. In
   the present paper a two-dimensional auxetic plate, made by structural
   straight elements forming a lattice periodic structure with re-entrant
   cells, is considered. A thorough discussion on the linear and
   geometrically nonlinear deformability of the auxetic plate is presented.
   The key geometric parameters governing the deformability of the plate
   are identified, and some analytical expressions for calculating the
   Poisson's ratio, as a function of the applied strain, are given.
   Numerical (finite element) analyses and experimental tests on 3D printed
   specimens are carried out to verify the theoretical findings. For the
   latter ones, full field strain maps are obtained by means of a suitable
   interpolation of the sampled displacement field measured by digital
   image techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Although a negative Poisson's ratio ( that is, a lateral extension in
   response to stretching) is not forbidden by thermodynamics, for almost
   all common materials the Poisson's ratio is positive. In 1987, Lakes
   first discovered negative Poisson's ratio effect in polyurethane (PU)
   foam with re-entrant structures, which was named anti-rubber, auxetic,
   and dilatational by later researchers. In this paper, the term `auxetic'
   will be used. Since then, investigation on the auxetic materials has
   held major interest, focusing on finding more materials with negative
   Poisson's ratio, and on examining the mechanisms, properties and
   applications. Therefore, more materials were found to have the
   counter-intuitive effect of auxeticity due to different structural or
   microstructrual mechanisms. The present article reviews the latest
   advances in auxetic materials, their structural mechanisms, performance
   and applications. (C) 2004 Kluwer Academic Publishers.}},

Title = {{Rayleigh and Love Surface Waves in Isotropic Media with Negative
   Poisson's Ratio}},

Abstract = {{The behavior of Rayleigh surface waves and the first mode of the Love
   waves in isotropic media with positive and negative Poisson's ratio is
   compared. It is shown that the Rayleigh wave velocity increases with
   decreasing Poisson's ratio, and it increases especially rapidly for
   negative Poisson's ratios less than -0.75. It is demonstrated that, for
   positive Poisson's ratios, the vertical component of the Rayleigh wave
   displacements decays with depth after some initial increase, while for
   negative Poisson's ratios, there is a monotone decrease. The Rayleigh
   waves are characterized by elliptic trajectories of the particle motion
   with the change of the rotation direction at critical depths and by the
   linear vertical polarization at these depths. It is found that the
   elliptic orbits are less elongated and the critical depths are greater
   for negative Poisson's ratios. It is shown that the stress distribution
   in the Rayleigh waves varies nonmonotonically with the dimensionless
   depth as (positive or negative) Poisson's ratio varies. The stresses
   increase strongly only as Poisson's ratio tends to -1. It is shown that,
   in the case of an incompressible thin covering layer, the velocity of
   the first mode of the Love waves strongly increases for negative
   Poisson's ratios of the half-space material. If the thickness of the
   incompressible layer is large, then the wave very weakly penetrates into
   the half-space for any value of its Poisson's ratio. For negative
   Poisson's ratios, the Love wave in a layer and a half-space is mainly
   localized in the covering layer for any values of its thickness and
   weakly penetrates into the half-space. For the first mode of the Love
   waves, it was discovered that there is a strong increase in the maximum
   of one of the shear stresses on the interface between the covering layer
   and the half-space as Poisson's ratios of both materials decrease. For
   the other shear stress, there is a stress jump on the interface and a
   more complicated dependence of the stress on Poisson's ratio on both
   sides of the interface.}},

Abstract = {{A novel two-dimensional (2D) semiconducting carbon allotrope is proposed
   by inserting alkyne into tetrahexcarbon. This new carbon allotrope
   consists of tetra-rings and acetylenic linkages and is called
   TAL-carbon. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first 2D carbon
   allotrope composed of sp-sp(2)-sp(3) hybridized carbon atoms. Due to its
   unique puckered structure, TAL-carbon is the fourth 2D carbon material
   with an intrinsic in-plane negative Poisson ratio (NPR) reported after
   graphene, penta-graphene, and tetrahexcarbon. Materials with NPR exhibit
   a wide range of potential applications in biomedicine, aerospace
   industries, and precision instruments. TAL-carbon has an indirect band
   gap of 1.614 eV. At room temperature, it exhibits high in-plane electron
   mobility of up to similar to 3.5 x 10(4) cm(2)V(-1)s(-1), which is 30
   times higher than monolayer black phosphorus and two orders of magnitude
   higher than monolayer MoS2. The phonon dispersion curves and in-plane
   elastic constants indicate that TAL-carbon is dynamically and
   mechanically stable. Its equibiaxial strain limit reaches 13.7\%,
   similar to that of graphene. An ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD)
   simulation demonstrates that TAL-carbon is thermally stable at 300 K and
   1000 K. The results show that TAL-carbon is a promising 2D auxetic
   material for applications in nanomechanics and nanoelectronics.}},

Abstract = {{In the current work, the concept of auxetic structures design is
   introduced into carbon nanotube-reinforced composite (CNTRC) laminate.
   Larger values of negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) of CNTRC laminate are
   obtained by setting the optimal orientation. Meanwhile, a theoretical
   model is presented for the nonlinear dynamic response of functionally
   graded (FG) CNTRC beam with NPR. Using Reddy's higher order shear
   deformation plate theory with von Karman's strain-displacement
   relations, the motion equations are obtained A two-perturbation approach
   and the fourth-order Runge Kutta method are then used to obtain the
   time-deflection curve of the auxetic FG-CNTRC beam. The effects of
   factors such as the CNT distribution, thermal field and foundation
   stiffness on the dynamic characteristic of the auxetic FG-CNTRC beam are
   studied in details. Numerical results indicate that the
   thermal-mechanical behavior of FG-CNTRC beams might be significantly
   improved by determining a proper distribution of CNTs. Furthermore, the
   results show that the change of temperature and foundation stiffness
   have a significant effect on the dynamic characteristic of FG-CNTRC

Abstract = {{This paper discusses a helical auxetic structure which has a diverse
   range of practical applications. The mechanical properties of the system
   can be determined by particular combinations of geometry and component
   material properties; finite element analysis is used to investigate the
   static behavior of these structures under tension. Modeling criteria are
   determined and design issues are discussed. A description of the
   different strain-dependent mechanical phases is provided. It is shown
   that the stiffnesses of the component fibers and the initial helical
   wrap angle are critical design parameters, and that strain-dependent
   changes in cross-section must be taken into consideration: we observe
   that the structures exhibit nonlinear behavior due to nonzero component
   Poisson's ratios. Negative Poisson's ratios for the helical structures
   as low as -5 are shown. While we focus here on the structure as a yarn
   our findings are, in principle, scaleable. (C) 2010 American Institute

Abstract = {{Jounce bumpers are indispensable components in vehicle suspension
   systems. It can attenuate impact energy and improve the ride comfort
   performances during transient pulse impacts from roads. However, the
   traditional jounce bumpers cannot achieve ideal mechanical performance
   and are difficult for parametric optimization due to its various shapes
   which are hard for parameterization. In this paper, a cylinder auxetic
   structure was introduced and applied as the suspension jounce bumper.
   Auxetic jounce bumper can be primarily defined by several variables.
   With tunable structure parameters, a large region of mechanical
   performances can be realized. In order to evaluate and optimize the
   performance of auxetic jounce bumpers, they were assembled into vehicle
   models to conduct virtual ride comfort tests under bump road. The
   maximum vertical acceleration of vehicle was defined as the objective
   function of the optimization problem of auxetic jounce bumper. On the
   purpose of improving optimization efficiency, Gaussian process
   regression method was employed to establish the metamodel of auxetic
   jounce bumper based on the sample set created by orthogonal design of
   experiments method. A series hybrid GA-SQP (Genetic algorithm-Sequential
   quadratic programming) algorithm, provided with both global and fast
   local searching abilities, was used for the optimization of auxetic
   jounce bumper. For comparison, GA algorithm was also applied for auxetic
   jounce bumper optimization alone. It is proved that the proposed
   optimization process is accurate and can improve optimization
   efficiency. Then the optimized design through hybrid algorithm was
   compared with original design. The maximum vertical acceleration of
   vehicle when travelling through bump was reduced with optimized design,
   and the vehicle ride comfort performance was improved.}},

   composite renders - A numerical study}},

Abstract = {{Masonry buildings constructed along busy roads are vulnerable to
   vehicular impacts resulting in damage to property and harm to occupants.
   This paper presents two strategies that use either carbon fibre or
   auxetic composite render for mitigating the adverse effects of such
   impacts and compares the merits of the two strategies. As masonry is a
   relatively low strength brittle material, the rendering material should
   possess high energy absorption characteristics (as in auxetic composite)
   or high strength (as in carbon fibre composite) properties for impact
   damage mitigation. Towards this end, finite element models incorporating
   material and contact nonlinearities and (recently developed) carbon
   fabric and auxetic fabric composite renders possessing positive and
   negative Poisson's ratios respectively are developed and applied. These
   models are validated using experimental datasets and then applied to
   masonry walls impacted laterally at velocities ranging from 6 km/h to
   100 km/h. Results show that the failure mechanism of masonry walls
   varies from global to local with the increase in the impact velocity and
   that the auxetic composite render significantly minimises debonding
   risks, enhances energy dissipation characteristics, reduces the impact
   force and the impact damage on the masonry walls, compared to carbon
   fibre composite render.}},

Abstract = {{Using a continuum-based design sensitivity analysis (DSA) method, a
   configuration design optimization method is developed for curved
   Kirchhoff beams with shape memory polymers (SMP), from which we
   systematically synthesize lattice structures achieving target negative
   Poisson's ratio. A SMP phenomenological constitutive model for small
   strains is utilized. A Jaumann strain, based on the geometrically exact
   beam theory, is additively decomposed into elastic, stored, and thermal
   parts. Non-homogeneous displacement boundary conditions are employed to
   impose mechanical loadings. At each equilibrium configuration, an
   additional nonlinear analysis is performed to calculate the Poisson's
   ratio and its design sensitivity of the SMP material. The design
   objectives are twofold: for purely elastic materials, lattice structures
   are designed to achieve prescribed Poisson's ratios under finite
   compressive deformations. Also, SMP-based lattice structures are
   synthesized to possess target Poisson's ratios in specified temperature
   ranges. The analytical design sensitivity of the Poisson's ratio is
   verified through comparison with finite difference sensitivity. Several
   configuration design optimization examples are demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic cellular materials are modern materials which have some unique

   many applications to enhance certain physical properties such like the
   density, stiffness, fracture toughness, energy absorption and damping.
   These properties can be further tailored by using variable cell geometry
   and density distribution, which can be achieved with functionally graded

Abstract = {{Materials with negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) effects have been studied
   for decades. However, the studies have mainly focused on 2D periodic
   structures which only have NPR effects in certain in-plane directions.
   In this paper, a novel concept is proposed to develop composite
   structures with isotropic NPR effects using NPR random inclusions. The
   study starts from a finite element analysis of deformation mechanisms of
   two 2D representative cells which are embedded with a re-entrant square
   and a re-entrant triangle. respectively. Based on the analysis results,
   the re-entrant triangles are selected as random inclusions into a matrix
   to form 2D composite structures. Four such composite structures are
   built with different numbers of inclusions through a parametric model,
   and their NPR effects and mechanical behaviors are analyzed using the
   finite element method. The results show that the isotropic NPR effects
   of composites can be obtained with high random re-entrant inclusions.
   Thus, the novel concept proposed is numerically proved by this study.

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the nonlinear bending behavior of sandwich beams
   with functionally graded (FG) negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) honeycomb

   with three FG configurations of re-entrant honeycomb cores through the

   temperature-dependent material properties of both face sheets and core
   of the sandwich beam are considered. 3D full scale finite element
   analyses are conducted to investigate the nonlinear bending behavior and
   the variation of effective Poisson's ratio (EPR) of the sandwich beam in
   the large deflection region. The numerical simulations are carried out
   for the sandwich beams with FG-NPR honeycomb core, from which results
   for the same sandwich beam with uniform distributed NPR honeycomb core
   are obtained as a comparator. Finite element results showed that the
   thickness change of sandwich beams with NPR honeycomb cores are
   distinctly out of ordinary, and the NPR sandwich beams have
   significantly lower load-bending moment curves compared with those with
   positive Poisson's ratio cores. The effects of functionally graded
   configurations, load distribution types, boundary conditions,

Abstract = {{There is a growing interest in using additive manufacturing to produce
   smart structures, which have the capability to respond to thermal and
   mechanical stimuli. In this report, Selective Laser Melting (SLM) is
   used to build a Negative Poisson's Ratio (NPR) TiNi-based Shape Memory
   Alloy (SMA) structure, creating a multi-functional structure that could
   be used as reusable armour. The study assesses the influence of SLM
   process parameters (laser power, scan speed, and track spacing) on the
   microstructural and structural integrity development in a Ti-rich TiNi
   alloy, as well as the impact of the post-process homogenisation
   treatment on the microstructure and phase transformations. The builds
   generally shows stress-induced cracks and residual porosity, which could
   be minimised through process optimisation. Nonetheless, the
   homogenisation treatment is essential to reduce the fraction of Ti2Ni
   intermetallics, which are known to disturb the B19'-chemistry, and hence
   the required phase transformation temperatures. The optimum process
   parameters are finally used to fabricate NPR structures, which were
   mechanically tested to validate the Poisson's ratio predictions. A
   higher ductility was observed in the structures that have undergone the
   homogenisation treatment. (C) 2016 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by

   thickness, ligament length, the circular node center dispersion range,
   and missing ligament percentages. Effects of random node distribution
   range and cell wall missing percentage on the elastic modulus and
   Poisson's ratio of chiral metastructures are investigated through
   experimental tests and finite element (FE) simulation systematically.
   Through dimensionless analysis, it is found that ligament thickness has
   remarkable influence on the negative Poisson's ratio. Effect of missing
   ligament on the mechanical properties of the structure is greater than
   effect of random node center dispersion. With the increase of ligament
   missing percentage, the resultant modulus of chiral metastructures
   decreases, and the corresponding NPR increases.}},

Abstract = {{X-ray microtomography has been used to study in situ the uniaxial
   tensile response of low-density polyurethane foam. Two variants have
   been examined, one before and one after treatment to generate auxetic
   behaviour. For both variants, microstructurally faithful finite element
   (FE) models have been constructed from the initial tomographs. For each
   variant a series of tomographs have been collected during progressive
   straining. Poisson's ratios of 0.30 (conventional, non-auxetic) and
   -0.22 (auxetic) have been measured for the two variants by digital image
   correlation (DIC) between successive images. By comparison, the FE
   models exhibited Poisson's ratio's of 0.5 and -0.3, respectively. Key
   micromechanical mechanisms responsible for the auxetic effect have been
   observed during straining, such as the straightening of bent ribs and
   rotation of nodes (joints), compared to changes in the angles between
   essentially straight struts for the non-auxetic variant. The
   microstructurally faithful FE models confirm the mechanisms observed in
   the experiments and enable characteristic rib and node behaviour to be
   followed in greater detail. (C) 2010 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA,

Abstract = {{Currently, available results for the large deflection of circular
   isotropic membranes are valid for Poisson's ratio of 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4
   only. This paper explores the deflection of circular membranes when the
   membrane material is auxetic, i.e., when they possess negative Poisson's
   ratio and compared against conventional ones. Due to the multistage
   calculations involved in the exact method, a generic semi-empirical
   model is proposed to facilitate convenient and direct computation of the
   membrane deflection as a function of the radial distance; additionally,
   a specific semi-empirical model is given to provide a more accurate
   maximum deflection. Comparison of deflection distributions verifies the
   validity of the semi-empirical model vis-a-vis the exact model. The
   deflection of circular membrane increases with the diminishing effect as
   the Poisson's ratio of the membrane material becomes more negative.}},

Abstract = {{A novel molecular network structure that has the unusual property of a
   negative Poisson's ratio has been modelled. This network is a
   combination of acetylene bonds and benzene rings that can be designed to
   have a range of different elastic constants and anisotropy. Molecular
   modelling techniques have been used to predict the elastic constants.
   The Young's moduli range between 20 and 117 GPa and Poisson's ratios
   between - 0.94 and 1.4 are predicted, depending on the exact details of
   the network geometry, These values are within die limits for an
   orthotropic elastic material.    Alternative analytical and
   finite-element models have also been used to try to simplify the
   calculations needed to predict the properties of the network. It is
   shown that considerable reductions in computational complexity, without
   an undue loss of accuracy, can be achieved. This method represents a new

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{87}},
Number = {{16}},
Pages = {{1925-1937}},

Abstract = {{Poisson's ratio (PR) is defined as the negative ratio between the
   lateral strain and the longitudinal strain of a material under tensile
   or compressive loading condition. Auxetic fabrics are those having a
   negative PR, which means that when their longitudinal strain is
   positive, their lateral strain is also positive, and vice versa. In this
   work, tensile and forming properties of auxetic warp-knitted spacer
   fabrics were investigated and compared with those of the conventional
   warp-knitted spacer fabrics. Both uniaxial tensile tests and
   hemispherical compression experiments were conducted, and the
   relationships of the tensile and forming properties with the auxetic
   effect were discussed in terms of different fabric structural
   parameters. The results show that the auxetic warp-knitted spacer
   fabrics have a prolonged low stress stage in the wale direction,
   indicating that they are more prone to undergo deformation along the
   wale direction, and fabric with a longer low stress stage has a better
   auxetic effect. The results also show that the formability of auxetic
   warp-knitted spacer fabrics is much better than that of conventional
   warp-knitted spacer fabrics, due to the much low forming energies
   required under hemispherical compression, which can be affected by many
   factors such as auxetic effect, fabric thickness and stiffness, yarn
   materials and the structure of the spacer layer. When all other
   parameters are similar, auxetic fabric with a better auxetic effect will
   have better formability. The study has provided useful information for
   the design and application of this type of nonconventional spacer
   fabrics.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic metamaterials have unique structural designs exhibiting zero or
   negative Poisson' ratios during stretch/compression processes, which
   enable many critical applications such as sensing technology, wearable
   devices, and weight reduction parts. However, it is difficult to achieve
   ideal performance of various structural designs through geometry
   manipulation due to the beam/wall buckling under large strain. One way
   to minimize the occurrence of buckling is by introducing the high
   elasticity on the joints, but trade-offs exist among different
   mechanical behaviors. To this end, this study proposes to use a
   multi-material combining with the structure optimization to design an
   auxetic structure. The basic re-entrant structure is employed due to its
   simplicity, and finite element method (FEM) is adopted to demonstrate
   the effectiveness of this newly proposed strategy regarding the auxetic
   behaviors. For this multi-material structure, a different Young's
   modulus is designed to apply on the additional arch structure. A series
   of simulations, which consider the influence of the mechanical
   properties, are conducted to investigate the change of auxetic behaviors
   such as stress distribution, Poisson's ratio, and equivalent Young's
   modulus against the applied material properties. The results indicate
   that the mechanical properties are strongly affected by the geometry
   design and the applied materials properties. Meanwhile, the buckling
   effect of the beam/wall could be eliminated if the hinge strength is
   small enough. The trade-off between equivalent mechanical properties and
   Poisson's ratio could also be tuned through this newly material-based
   design.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{80}},
Pages = {{15-26}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Carbon-based nanomaterials have attracted significant attention due to
   their unique physical properties. In this study, various
   multi-dimensional graphitic architectures are constructed by spanning
   fullerenes with carbon nanotube (CNT) super-bonds. The mechanical
   properties of these novel architectures are systematically investigated
   by full atomistic simulations. The stress and strain of 1D nano-bamboo
   structures upon the onset of instability are almost constant, about 1/5
   and 1/2, respectively, of those of a perfect CNT. The deformation and
   fracture behavior of 2D and 3D periodic graphitic nanostructures are
   largely dictated by the inter-fullerene distance and loading
   orientation. Surprising negative Poisson's ratio observed in 2D and 3D
   networks is revealed to originate as a result of curvature-flattening or
   rigid mechanical model. The magnitude of Poisson's ratio is strongly
   dependent on the level of strain, CNT length as well as temperature. The
   insight on the deformation mechanism of these periodic graphitic
   nanostructures will facilitate the integration of low-dimensional
   materials towards high-dimensional organized structures to realize
   targeted multi-functional properties. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{With the generalized gradient approximation, our work presents a
   comparative research for elastic properties, carrier mobility and
   thermodynamic properties of InX (X = O, S, Se, Te) monolayers using
   first principles computational density functional theory (DFT). Among
   the four indium compounds of the same main group, they all show
   isotropic Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio. Among them, the Young's
   modulus and Poisson's ratio of InO are the largest, reaching 79.1 Nm(-1)
   and 0.44, respectively. At the same time, we also calculated the
   cohesive energy of each primitive cell to explain their relationship.
   For the sake of studying the thermodynamic properties, the Helmholtz
   free energy in various area, area change, two-dimension bulk moduli,
   heat capacity of constant pressure and constant volume in different
   temperature are analyzing in detail. The heat capacity of both constant
   pressure and constant volume and thermal expansion coefficient adhere to
   the trend of InTe > InSe > InS > InO in the same temperature. Moreover,
   InO, InS and InSe have the negative thermal expansion coefficient at the
   low temperature. Furthermore, we used the deformation potential theory
   to calculate the carrier mobility, analyzing their elastic constants,
   deformation potential constants, and the effective mass of electrons and
   holes, and found that the effective mass of electrons is isotropic.}},

Abstract = {{Negative through-the-thickness Poisson's ratios are investigated
   macroscopically and microscopically in the elastic-viscoplastic behavior
   of angle-ply carbon fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP) laminates. For this
   purpose, an analysis method is proposed based on a homogenization theory
   for nonlinear time-dependent composites with point-symmetric internal
   structures. This method is able to efficiently analyze both the
   macroscopic and microscopic elastic-viscoplastic properties of angle-ply
   CFRP laminates fully modeled with microstructures consisting of fibers
   and a matrix. Using the proposed method, the elastic-viscoplastic
   analysis of angle-ply carbon fiber/epoxy laminates with various laminate
   configurations is performed to investigate their Poisson's ratios in the
   viscoplastic region. It is revealed that, for a range of laminate
   configurations, the through-the-thickness Poisson's ratios exhibit
   negative values which become increasingly negative as the viscoplastic
   deformation progresses in the laminates. The effect of strain rate on
   this increasing negativity is also demonstrated, and microscopic
   mechanisms are investigated to explain this trend. It is further shown
   that the increasing negativity significantly affects microscopic
   interlaminar stress distributions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In this study we present an improved approach for the development of
   auxetics based on the use of deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) after a
   high-precision mask fabrication procedure. The whole process stands out
   for its precision (reaching nanometric detail), for the high aspect
   ratio (AR) attainable and for the possibility of promoting mass
   production. The quality of the proposed strategy is verified by the
   manufacture of an auxetic cantilever and bridged structures using two
   common planar auxetic geometries. The present process significantly
   increases the precision and AR of the micro-auxetics obtained when
   compared to state-of-the-art micromachining procedures and solves common
   challenges linked to structure adhesion to the substrate. The potential
   of the manufactured structures for the development of resonant
   structures is analyzed by means of finite-element-method-(FEM) based
   simulations, showing resonances in the megahertz range. A final
   application example, linked to monitoring cell culture processes upon
   auxetic scaffolds, is also proposed and analyzed by computational
   procedures. The initial cell culture results are also included and help
   to validate the scaffolds obtained and the materials used for future
   tissue engineering studies.}},

Abstract = {{We perform molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the Poisson's
   ratio of graphene oxide. We find that the Poisson's ratio can be
   effectively tuned by increasing the degree of oxidation of graphene
   oxide. More specifically, the Poisson's ratio decreases linearly from
   positive to negative with increasing oxidation, turning negative at room
   temperature for a degree of oxidation of 0.27, and reaching a value of
   -0.567 for fully oxidized graphene. The oxidation dependence of the
   Poisson's ratio is attributed to the tension-induced suppression of the
   ripples resulting from the oxidation, whose amplitude increases with
   increasing oxidation. Finally, we also demonstrate the temperature
   dependence of the Poisson's ratio in the graphene oxide.}},

Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Auxetic materials and structures are increasingly used in various fields
   because of their unusual properties. Auxetic tubular structures have
   been fabricated and studied due to their potential to be adopted as
   oesophageal stents where only tensile auxetic performance is required.
   However, studies on compressive mechanical properties of auxetic tubular
   structures are limited in the current literature. In this paper, we
   developed a simple tubular structure which exhibits auxetic behaviour in
   both compression and tension. This was achieved by extending a design
   concept recently proposed by the authors for generating 3D metallic
   auxetic metamaterials. Both compressive and tensile mechanical
   properties of the auxetic tubular structure were investigated. It was
   found that the methodology for generating 3D auxetic metamaterials could
   be effectively used to create auxetic tubular structures as well. By
   properly adjusting certain parameters, the mechanical properties of the
   designed auxetic tubular structure could be easily tuned.}},

Abstract = {{In the presented paper, three types of auxetic structures were produced
   with direct 3D printing and their compressive mechanical properties were
   tested. Samples were prepared from acrylic material suitable for
   high-resolution direct printing. Three different structures exhibiting
   in-plane and volumetric negative strain-dependent Poisson's ratio were
   selected for the analysis: two-dimensional missing-rib cut,
   two-dimensional inverted (re-entrant) honeycomb and three-dimensional
   inverted (re-entrant) honeycomb. The samples were subjected to
   quasi-static compression, from which stress-strain relationships were
   established. For a proper strain evaluation, digital-image correlation
   was applied to measure full-field displacements on the sample surfaces.
   From the displacement fields, true strain/true stress curves were
   derived for each sample. Furthermore, for each structure a
   three-dimensional FE model was developed using beam elements and
   subjected to identical loading conditions. Then, experimentally obtained
   stress-strain relationships were compared with numerically obtained
   results. For all the tested auxetic structures, the compressive
   behaviour was predicted well by the FE models. This demonstrates that
   parametric FE models can be used to tune the design parameters of the
   structures with a negative Poisson's ratio to optimize their overall
   properties.}},

Abstract = {{A novel composite structure with isotropic negative Poisson's ratio has
   been presented in our previous paper {[}1]. However, the previous study
   has only focused on the effects of random inclusions. In this work, an
   extended numerical study on the effects of materials properties and
   geometry features of inclusions is conducted in order to better
   understand the deformation mechanism and mechanical properties of this
   kind of composites. Using finite element method, the overall negative
   Poisson's ratio effects and mechanical properties of the composites are
   analyzed in terms of different factors including thickness and stiffness
   of inclusions with uniform and non-uniform struts. The structure
   optimization of the composites with better negative Poisson's ratio
   effect and mechanical performance are discussed based on the numerical
   calculated results. The study shows that the Poisson's ratio effects and
   mechanical properties of the composites are significantly affected by
   geometrical features, stiffness and boundary conditions of inclusions.

Abstract = {{The linear thermal expansion coefficients (LTEC) and thermomechanics of
   single-layer black and blue phosphorus are systematically studied using
   first-principles based on quasiharmonic approximation. We find the
   thermal expansion of black phosphorus is very anisotropic. The LTEC
   along zigzag direction has a turning from negative to positive at around
   138 K, while the LTEC along armchair direction is positive (except below
   8 K) and about 2.5 times larger than that along zigzag direction at 300
   K. For blue phosphorus, the LTEC is negative in the temperature range
   from 0 to 350 K. In addition, we find that the Young's modulus and
   Poisson's ratio of black phosphorus along zigzag direction are 4 to 5
   times larger than those along armchair direction within considered
   temperature range, showing a remarkable anisotropic in-plane
   thermomechanics property. The mechanisms of these peculiar thermal
   properties are also explored. This work provides a theoretical
   understanding of the thermal expansion and thermomechanics of this
   single layer phosphorus family, which will be useful in nanodevices. (C)

   foam core with negative Poisson's ratio}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{191}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, a sandwich panel composed of two metal face sheets and a
   three-dimensional (3D) isotropic foam core with negative Poisson's ratio
   (NPR) was established via FEM. The 3D NPR isotropic foam core was
   achieved by using triaxial compression method on a cubic Voronoi model,
   which was created based on Voronoi tessellation technique to achieve
   different randomness for the core (beta). The Poisson's ratio of the
   Voronoi core dropped rapidly at first, and then increased with an
   increasing triaxial pre-compression ratio eta. A minimum Poisson's
   ratio, -0.12, was obtained when the randomness of the Voronoi core beta
   = 0.29 and the triaxial pre-compression ratio eta = 0.4. The blast
   resistance of the proposed composite sandwich panel (CSP) with cores
   that have different beta and eta under 300 g equivalent TNT explosion
   was analyzed. Results show that with an increase of eta, the maximum
   stress on the foundation surface of CSP5 gradually decreased, and then
   slightly increased. The maximum stress on the foundation surface of CSP5
   can reach a minimum value when beta = 0.29 and eta = 0.4. The proposed
   CSP with the minimum Poisson's ratio core exhibited the highest blast
   resistance performance, which was approximately 1.5 times higher than
   CSP with traditional re-entrant NPR structure core.}},

Journal = {{MECHANICS OF ADVANCED MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Abstract = {{Honeycomb structure containing curved reentrant sides with negative
   Poisson's ratio (NPR) was designed and the impact dynamics behaviors
   were studied by finite element method. The Poisson's ratio and the
   energy absorption capacity of the honeycomb structure with different arc
   angle were studied under different compression velocities. The results
   show that the Poisson's ratio of the honeycomb structure can reach
   -0.373 with arc angle of 180 degrees. The energy absorption capacity of
   the honeycomb structure increased with an increasing compression
   velocity, and the deformation mode changed from X type to V type and I
   type. When the compression velocity is low, the dynamic response curve
   of the honeycomb structure with arc angle of 180 degrees has the
   characteristics of two-stage plateau region. When the compression
   velocity is high, the energy absorption capacity of the honeycomb
   structure increased with an increasing arc angle. When the arc angle is
   higher than 120 degrees, the honeycomb structure has NPR effect, and the
   energy absorption capacity of the honeycomb structure is better than the
   honeycomb structure with other arc angles.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICA STATUS SOLIDI B-BASIC SOLID STATE PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{257}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic fabrics made of nonauxetic yarns have gained increasing interest
   of textile scientists. Most recently, single-layered bistretch auxetic
   woven fabrics made of nonauxetic yarns based on parallel in-phase zigzag
   foldable geometry have been reported to have auxetic behavior when
   stretched along both principal directions. It is also reported that this
   geometry can possibly be realized into double-layered woven fabrics. In
   addition, it is suggested that the phenomenon of differential shrinkage
   can be exploited to realize another variation of foldable geometry such
   as out-of-phase zigzag foldable structures into woven fabrics.
   Therefore, herein, two possibilities aimed to be explored are
   double-layered auxetic woven fabric based on parallel in-phase zigzag
   foldable geometry and single-layered fabrics based on out-of-phase
   zigzag foldable geometry that are developed using the phenomenon of
   differential shrinkage to realize these geometries into the woven fabric
   structures. Five different auxetic woven fabric samples are fabricated
   using elastic and nonelastic yarns on a conventional weaving machine and
   tested along two principal directions. The testing results show that all
   the developed fabrics have auxetic behavior in both principal
   directions, and the placement of weaves and weft yarn arrangements has
   an obvious effect.}},

Abstract = {{Auxetic materials have unique properties which still require further
   evaluation. One of the least researched topics in terms of auxetics is
   their fatigue strength. In this article, high-cycle fatigue life of
   auxetic re-entrant structure unit cell was calculated using Finite
   Element Analysis. A fully reversed cycle consisting of alternating
   compressive and tensile loads was applied. Also, stress-life data had to
   be defined as approximated Wohler's curve. Result in form of cycles to
   failure contour plot was compared with corresponding contour plot
   obtained for regular hexagonal honeycomb lattice unit cell. It was
   observed that re-entrant cell has significantly higher fatigue strength
   than non-auxetic honeycomb cell. The test was also carried out for the
   models of the structure made of array of unit cells. Their results
   confirmed the previous observations which bring the conclusion that
   auxetic materials exhibit superior fatigue life properties compared with
   regular microstructures.}},
