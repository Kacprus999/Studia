AB The paper systemizes numerous cubic crystals which can have both positive and negative Poisson's ratios (the so-called partial auxetics) depending on the specimen orientation in tension. Several complete cubic auxetics whose Poisson's ratio is always negative are indicated. The partial cubic auxetics are classified with the use of two dimensionless elastic parameters. For one of the parameters, a critical value is found at which the orientation behavior of the crystals changes qualitatively. The behavior of mesotubes obtained by rolling up plates of cubic crystals (crystals with rectilinear anisotropy) is considered in detail. Such mesotubes with curvilinear cubic anisotropy can have micron and nanometer lateral dimensions. It is shown that uniform tension of nano/microtubes of cubic crystals is possible only in the particular case of zero chirality angle (the angle between the crystallographic axis and the axis of a stretched tube). It is demonstrated by the semi-inverse Saint-Venant method that solution of the axial tension problem for cylindrically anisotropic nano/microtubes of cubic crystals with a non-zero chirality angle is possible with radially inhomogeneous fields of three normal stresses and one shear stress. In the examples considered, the cylindrically anisotropic nano/microtubes of cubic crystals are auxetics even if they are initially non-auxetics with rectilinear anisotropy.

AB In this paper a novel class of core material for sandwich structures is analyzed from an analytical and numerical point of view. Honeycombs with re-entrant cell geometry present negative in-plane Poisson's ratio coefficients, with an increase of bending stiffness compared to the one of hexagonal honeycomb cores. Due to the orthotropic mechanical properties of this kind of core material it is possible to employ the formulations of laminated orthotropic plates in order to describe the vibroacoustic behavior of simply supported sandwich plates. The natural frequencies of these laminates are sensitive to the geometrical parameters of the core cells. As an example application, an infinite cylindrical sandwich shell in contact with exterior and interior fluid flow is examined. An improvement of transmission loss factors is observed, suggesting a possible use of these cores in acoustic insulation. Damping properties are modeled taking into account the complex modulus of the core material. Two models are examined, one with full viscoelastic core and the other with a free-layer symmetrical beam geometry in order to describe the walls of the core cells. Both cases show a significant increase of the storage moduli of the cores compared to the ones of a regular honeycomb.

AB Four metallic metamaterials with tailorable mechanical properties are designed using bi-material star shaped re-entrant planar lattice structures, which do not involve pins, adhesive, welding or pressure fit joints and can be fabricated through laser-based additive manufacturing. Three length parameters, one angle parameter and three material combinations are used as adjustable design parameters to explore structure-property relations. For each of the four designed metamaterials, the effects of the design parameters on the Poisson's ratio (PR), coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), Young's modulus and relative density are systematically investigated using unit cell-based finite element simulations that incorporate periodic boundary conditions. It is found that the bi-material lattice structures can be tailored to obtain 3-D printable metallic metamaterials with positive, near-zero or negative PR and CTE together with an uncompromised Young's modulus. In particular, it is shown that metamaterial # 1 can exhibit both a negative PR and a non-positive CTE simultaneously. These metallic metamaterials can find applications in structures or devices such as antennas and precision instruments to reduce thermomechanical stresses and extend service lives.

AB Graphyne (GY) and graphdiyne (GDY) are two-dimensional one-atom-thick carbon allotropes highly considered to substitute graphene in electronic applications because of the prediction of non-null band-gap. There are multiple configurations of GY structures not yet fully investigated in literature. In this work, by means of classical molecular dynamics simulations, the Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio and linear thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) of all originally proposed seven types of GYs and corresponding GDYs are calculated. The dependence of these properties with the density of the structure is investigated for the first time. Quadratic increasing of the TEC of GY and GDY structures with density was found. The elastic modulus of GYs and GDYs were shown to be more sensitive to their density than general porous materials. In particular, non-symmetric structures are much softer along the armchair direction than along zigzag direction, implying that the elasticity along armchair direction of GY and GDY structures are similar to that of porous gels materials. Values larger than unity were found for the Poisson's ratio of some non-symmetric GYs and GDYs. A simple honeycomb mechanical model is shown to capture the observed values of Poisson's ratio of GYs and GDYs.

AB Four types of three-dimensional (3-D) metallic metamaterials with tailorable thermo-mechanical properties are designed. For the first three types, the structure-property relations are studied by adjusting design parameters including two length parameters, one angle parameter and two material combinations. For the fourth type, one additional angle parameter is involved. It is shown that each of the four types of metamaterials designed exhibits the cubic symmetry and thus needs three independent elastic constants to characterize its elastic behavior and one coefficient of thermal expansion to describe its isotropic thermal expansion. The effects of the design parameters on the effective Poisson's ratio (PR), coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), Young's modulus, shear modulus and the relative density are systematically investigated for each of the four types of designed metamaterials by using unit cell-based finite element simulations that incorporate periodic boundary conditions. It is found that 3-D metallic metamaterials with positive, near-zero or negative PR and CTE can be obtained by tailoring the bi-material lattice structures and material combinations. Also, it is revealed that metamaterial # 1 can achieve both a negative PR and a non-positive CTE while maintaining a high stiffness and a low relative density (and thus a lightweight). The good tunability of thermo-mechanical properties of the four types of metamaterials provides an avenue of enabling the expansion of Ashby's material chart to produce more material options for engineering applications.

AB This paper evaluates the effect of auxeticity on the extent of shear deformation in isotropic beams. It is herein shown that the ratio of maximum deflection by Timoshenko theory to the maximum deflection by the Euler-Bernoulli theory reduces as the Poisson's ratio of the beam material becomes more negative. The obtained results suggest that the ratio of shear deformation to bending deformation is lower in auxetic beams than in conventional beams, and that the use of Euler-Bernoulli beam theory for quantifying the deflection in auxetic beams gives lesser deviation from the Timoshenko beam theory than in conventional beams. Specifically, the shear deformation becomes insignificant for square beams with Poisson's ratio of -1. A set of design equations that allows the use of simpler Euler-Bernoulli beam theory instead of the Timoshenko beam theory for the considered cases are proposed herein to justify the use of the former theory on beam analysis on the basis of reduced shear deformation as the beam's Poisson's ratio becomes more negative. The findings obtained herein also suggest that in comparison with conventional beams (of equal Young's modulus, load distributions, and boundary conditions) the lower shear deformation in auxetic beams translates into smaller transverse deflections and hence better dimensional stability.

AB A new analytical model is developed for three types of 2-D periodic star-shaped re-entrant lattice structures that possess the orthotropic symmetry and exhibit negative Poisson's ratios. Contributions from both the re-entrant and connection struts are considered using an energy method based on Castigliano's second theorem. Each re-entrant strut is treated as a Timoshenko beam, and stretching, transverse shearing and bending deformations are all incorporated in the formulation. Unlike existing studies, the overlapping of struts at joints is included in determining the relative density, which is analytically expressed for each lattice type. Closed-form formulas are derived for the effective Young's moduli and Poisson's ratios of each type of lattice structure, which contain three non-dimensional length ratios, two re-entrant angles, one shear correction factor, and Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of the strut material. The new analytical model is validated against finite element simulations conducted in the current study and two existing analytical models for simpler square lattice structures without re-entrant struts. To illustrate the newly developed analytical model, a parametric study is conducted to quantitatively show the effects of the five geometrical parameters on the effective properties of each type of lattice structure. It is found that for the effective Poisson's ratios the key controlling parameters are the two re-entrant angles, while for the effective Young's moduli all of the geometrical parameters can have significant effects except for the external connection length ratio. It is demonstrated that through a proper selection of the geometrical parameters, vertex connections and strut material, it is possible to tailor the effective Poisson's ratios and Young's moduli of each type of lattice structure over wide ranges to satisfy different needs in various applications.

Pt is found that the number of crystals with negative Poisson's ratio is the least for rectilinear anisotropy and is much larger for curvilinear anisotropy. With a nonzero chiral angle, all nano/microtubes can have negative Poisson's ratio. The elastic problem on axial tension of cylindrical nano/microtubes is solved for radially inhomogeneous stresses: three normal stresses and one shear stress.

AB Current reported cellular metastructures can either achieve only tailorable thermal expansion or obtain only tunable Poisson's ratio. By contrast, here, we develop a kind of lightweight cellular metastructure which incorporates coupled tailorable thermal expansion and tunable Poisson's ratio. That is a wide range of positive, zero and especially negative values of both thermal expansion and Poisson's ratio can be simultaneously obtained. The ranges and constraints of the geometrical parameters are revealed, and the relative densities are only about 2%, indicating excellent lightweight character. Besides, analytical expressions for coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) and Poisson's ratio (PR) are theoretically established and numerically simulated. Parameter analysis confirms that the range of tailorable CTE can be enhanced through rationally selecting large values of CTE ratio, first geometrical angle and height ratio. By adjusting the second and third geometrical angles, Poisson's ratio also can be tuned to be large negative, near zero and positive values. Particularly, the metastructure can give paired negative CTE and negative PR. Different combinations of paired characteristics including positive CTE + negative PR, positive CTE + positive PR and negative CTE + positive PR are also flexibly available. Moreover, CTE and PR are found to be highly coupled. To simultaneously obtain specific CTE and PR, design parameters should be selected with consideration of the coupling effect. The results here are expected to contribute feasibility to structures with both temperature and mechanical sensitivities. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Based on the bi-material triangle lattice material, a new cellular structure: bi-material re-entrant triangle (BRT) is devised to incorporate tailorable coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) and tunable Poisson's ratio (PR) properties by replacing the straight base of a triangle with two hypotenuse members. An equation to systematically build the relationship among the external force, the temperature increment and the deformation for the planar lattice material with boundedjoints is derived and then embedded into a theoretical model for devised BRT structure. Using master stiffness equation, effective PR, effective Young's modulus as well as effective CTE are computed. In order to guide designers to construct an initial concept quickly, the design domain for coupling negative CTE and negative PR properties is proposed. Nine available paired characteristics for coupling effect are extracted and demonstrated with ABAQUS simulation.

AB Lattices of controlled thermal expansion are presented based on planar chiral lattice structure with Poisson's ratio approaching -1. Thermal expansion values can be arbitrarily large positive or negative. A lattice was fabricated from bimetallic strips and the properties analyzed and studied experimentally. The effective thermal expansion coefficient of the lattice is about =-3.5x10-4K-1. This is much larger in magnitude than that of constituent metals. Nodes were observed to rotate as temperature was changed corresponding to a Cosserat thermoelastic solid. (C) 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB Auxetic foams possess negative Poisson's ratio, exhibiting unique mechanical properties. A modified model based on the quasi-three-dimensional model of Choi and Lakes is developed for auxetic foams and the formula of the volumetric compression ratio is also corrected in this study. Three deformation mechanisms of all cell ribs (i.e. stretching, shearing and bending) are incorporated. By applying the newly modified model, the theoretical results of Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio depend on the folded angle of the bent ribs, the relative density, the shape of the rib cross section and the Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of the virgin material. The predicted values of the effective Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of auxetic foams compare favourably with experimental data. In addition, a finite element analysis model is proposed to predict the value of Poisson's ratio in this study. The two models can be reduced to predict the mechanical properties of conventional foams, and exhibit the process of the conversion of conventional foams into auxetic foams.

AB Poisson's ratio had long been considered to be an intrinsic material property, confined within a narrow domain and governed solely by the geometry of interatomic bonds. Materials with designed heterogeneity allow for control over the Poisson's ratio. Poisson's ratios of any value within the thermodynamically admissible domain may be attained, including negative Poisson's ratio (termed auxetic). In this article, we discuss the role of Poisson's ratio in elasticity, two-dimensional and three-dimensional materials, phase transformations, underlying causes in the microstructure, and other negative physical properties.

AB This work investigates the effects of cracking on the overall properties of brittle auxetic/non-auxetic honeycombs. The micro numerical model and macro theoretical model are established simultaneously. The analytical expressions of crack opening displacement (COD) are derived and the results agree well with numerical simulations. The fracture toughness of honeycombs is calculated by combining the stress in the numerical model and the stress intensity factor (SIF) in the theoretical model. The reductions in the equivalent stiffness and equivalent thermal stress coefficient (TSC) of the cracked honeycombs are predicted. The negative Poisson?s ratio (NPR) effects on those fracture mechanics parameters and equivalent thermomechanical properties are studied. And considering the orthogonal anisotropic properties of honeycombs, the cracking along two orthogonal directions is examined. It reveals that the significant NPR effects can only be detected in a single direction and the effects in another direction are inconspicuous. In addition, the effects of crack length, medium dimensions, and cell-wall angle of honeycomb cells on the overall performance of the cracked medium are also evaluated by parametric studies and the results are displayed graphically.

AB A temperature-dependent intrinsic property of monolayer graphene, the negative Poisson's ratio (NPR), is investigated in the present study. The classical molecular dynamics (MD) method is employed and the Erhart-Albe hybrid potential, i.e. the combination of the reactive empirical bond order (REBO) and the Tersoff potentials, is used for the graphene sheet in the numerical simulation. In the simulation process, the graphene sheet is assumed to be free standing with in-plane periodical boundary condition and under an ambient temperature up to 1000 K. Our study shows that the graphene NPR is decreased with the increase of temperature. Besides, we also perform the simulation of the graphene negative temperature expansion coefficient (NTEC) as an indirect validation of the present MD model. The characteristics of the nonlinear variations for both the NPR and the NTEC of a pristine graphene sheet are investigated. Our MD results at low temperature (0.1 K) further prove the intrinsic and anisotropic property of NPR for graphene.

AB By strengthening the pore with material different from that of matrix, a new type of negative thermal expansion materials with the re-entrant hexagonal honeycomb is designed in this paper. The equivalent Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio and the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) are studied by using Timoshenko beam theory and the analytical formulas of these equivalent parameters are derived. The results of analytical formulas and numerical simulation indicate that the CTE of the material can be controlled from positive to negative by changing the geometry features and material properties of the structure. Meanwhile, the negative Poisson's ratio effect of the original re-entrant honeycomb can be preserved. Moreover, this method for designing new metamaterials has also been generalized to three-dimensional materials.

AB A linear relation between the Poisson's ratio averaged along the transverse directions and Young's modulus of the tensed cubic crystal is established. It is found that the coefficients of the linear relation in the dimensionless form depend on two dimensionless elastic parameters combined from three compliance coefficients. By virtue of this fact, the form of angular regions of the crystal orientation with negative Poisson's ratio on average varies as the magnitude of one dimensionless coefficient and the sign of the other one. We find the critical value of the dimensionless parameter at which there is the topological change in the structure of the angular regions occurs is established.

AB Effective Young's modulus and Poisson's ratios of two-layered cylindrical hollow tubes made of cubic crystals (auxetics and nonauxetics) are considered. An analysis of longitudinal tension of stretching tubes is performed within the framework of curvilinear-anisotropic elasticity and Saint-Venant's approximation. Analytical dependences of effective Young's modulus on the compliance coefficients of the initial crystals and layer thickness as ratio of composites auxetics-nonauxetics are obtained. Deviations from the rule of mixtures predictions which increase with increasing Young's modulus of initial nonauxetics are demonstrated. It is found that effective Poisson's ratios of two-layered tubes depend on the ratio of their thicknesses, the dimensionless combinations of compliance coefficients and a dimensionless radial distance. An effect of tube components on negativeness of effective Poisson's ratio of the composite auxetics-nonauxetics proved to be strongly dependent on the value of Young's modulus for nonauxetic component. It is shown that effective Poisson's ratios for some characteristics of the initial crystals and ratios of layer thicknesses may fall outside the limits on Poisson's ratios of isotropic materials. It is shown that many two-layered tubes composed of pairs of nonauxetics can have large negative effective Poisson's ratios.

AB Analytical and numerical features of the elastic properties of the stretched rectilinearly anisotropic 6-constant tetragonal crystals are considered. Analytical formulas for Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio are obtained. They are expressed in terms of the elastic compliance coefficients in Voight notation and the parameters of crystal orientation. Numerical calculations are performed using these formulas and data on the elastic constants from the Landolt-Bornstein Handbook. Possible types of Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio are analyzed. More than eighty tetragonal crystals were studied. About 60% of them are characterized by negative Poisson's ratio for certain particular orientations of the crystals. Such auxetics are listed in the Tables. Ten crystals can have Poisson's ratio greater than unity, and Poisson's ratio for six crystals is less than -0.5. The same six crystals are characterized by high variability of Young's modulus. Young's modulus for more than ten crystals exceeds 300 GPa.

AB A type of mechanical metamaterial is proposed, whereby the effective coefficients of thermal and moisture expansions (CTE and CME, respectively) can be tuned from positive to negative values while maintaining a consistently auxetic (negative Poisson's ratio) behavior for the overall structure. Each unit consists of a pair of equal-armed crosses pin jointed at their centers, whereas their ends are connected via bridging beams using pin joints to facilitate free rotation. The bridging beams are of lower modulus and higher hygrothermal expansivity to permit negativity in metamaterial's overall Poisson's ratio and hygrothermal expansion. Two sets of effective Young's modulus, CME and CTE models are developed-one set for large deformation and the other for infinitesimal deformation. Results indicate that the effective Young's modulus is reduced while the expansion coefficients become more negative as the inclination angle of the equal-armed crosses increases, and that the application of tensile and compressive loads increases and decreases the effective Young's modulus, respectively. The establishment of effective zero thermal and moisture expansion conditions facilitates the application of the metamaterial structure that requires auxetic property within highly fluctuating environmental condition.

AB The effect of a negative bulk modulus phase in elastic composites is studied. Negative bulk modulus K < 0 is shown to be possible in selected unit cells. In isotropic solids, K < 0 can be attained whim negative Poisson's ratio v is sufficiently small, below the stability limit (for stress control) v = -1. Such materials, if used as inclusions, are predicted to be stable with respect to the band formation, even if they are large. Composites with spherical inclusions of negative bulk moduli are shown to exhibit negative Poisson's ratio and anomalies in composite bulk modulus and Young's modulus (and in the corresponding mechanical damping) but not in the shear modulus.

AB Analytical expressions for the in-plane and out-of-plane coefficients of thermal expansion for laminates with isotropic laminas are presented herein based on (i) zero net force on the laminate edges, (ii) equal displacement of the lamina edges, and (iii) Hooke's law in three dimensions. Results show that a laminate consisting of alternating auxetic (with positive coefficient of thermal expansion, CTE) and negative thermal expansion (NTE) (with positive Poisson's ratio) laminas exhibit a more negative effective CTE than a laminate of alternating conventional laminas (positive Poisson's ratio and positive CTE) with unconventional laminas (auxetic and NTE). Finally, temperature-dependent CTE for such laminates are developed and plotted for special cases. It is herein shown that under certain circumstances. the magnitude of temperature-dependent effective CTE tends to infinity. (C) 2010 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB Bi-material strips constructed from components having different mechanical properties, in particular different Young's moduli and/or Poisson's ratio, are shown to curve when subjected to changes in the external hydrostatic pressure in a similar manner that such strips curve when subjected to a change in temperature when the component materials have different coefficients of thermal expansion. This behaviour will be particularly pronounced if the material having the lower Young's modulus also exhibits a negative Poisson's ratio (auxetic). (C) 2008 Acta Materialia Inc.

AB This paper reports the application of additive manufacturing technology to fabricate bi-dimensional lightweight composite meshes capable of demonstrating auxetic properties (negative Poisson's ratio (NPR)) in combination with negative thermal expansion (NTE) behaviour, using as constituent materials polymers that do not exhibit NTE behaviour. To describe the combination of NPR and NTE characteristics, the designation of 'anepectic' is being proposed. Each mesh, obtained from varying either the material combination or the design parameters, was tested on a heated silicone bath to study the effects of the different combinations on the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE). It was found that all meshes studied demonstrated a successful combination of NPR and NTE behaviours, and it was revealed that there is a possibility to tailor the meshes to activate the NTE behaviour within a chosen range of temperatures. For an extreme case, a Poisson's ratio of -0.056, along with a CTE of -1568 x 10(-6) K-1 has been achieved.

AB The manufacture of negative Poisson's ratio (auxetic) composites, containing inherently auxetic phases is rare and has been confined to relatively low modulus composite systems with stiffnesses several orders of magnitude below those of structural composites. This paper presents the use of an auxetic double helix yarn that is used to produce a unidirectional fibre composite with both relatively high stiffness (4 GPa) and negative Poisson's ratio (-6.8), at 30% fibre volume fraction, compared to other auxetic composites. This is the first structural auxetic composite to be produced using carbon fibre and importantly it was produced using standard manufacturing techniques and therefore is potentially applicable in a variety of engineering applications.

AB There have been many studies on smart mechanical materials that sensibly deform in response to external stimuli. However, most of the previous studies have focused on structure changes but largely neglected stimuli-responsive and programmable mechanical properties. Here, we present a novel strategy of mechanical metamaterials, engineered materials with mechanical properties defined by their structure rather than their composition, to design smart materials that change their mechanical properties in response to external stimuli. The present work demonstrates mechanical metamaterials with thermoresponsive and reversible switching between positive and negative Poisson's ratios. In order to realize the thermoresponsive and reversible switching, a thermoresponsive rod with an extremely large thermal expansion coefficient is developed utilizing two-way shape memory effects. As an application of our metamaterials, we propose soundproofing materials that selectively block sound waves in a specific frequency range depending on temperature.

We analyse the effective characteristics (the Young's and shear moduli and the Poisson's ratio) computed using either the differential scheme for the effective moduli of composites or the direct finite element simulations. The results are verified through Hashin-Shtrikrnan bounds. We demonstrate that by creating hybrids from auxetic and non-auxetic phases one can obtain considerable increase in stiffness over the stiffnesses of the phases. The stiffening effect is controlled by the value of the Poisson's ratios of the phases, shape of the auxetic inclusions and their concentration. Depending upon the concentration, the hybrid can be made both auxetic and non-auxetic. Even when the inclusions are cubic the hybrid is still nearly isotropic; it becomes truly orthotropic only when the Poisson's ratio of the auxetic phase is very close to the thermodynamic limit of -1. These findings can be applied directly in designing a new class of hybrid materials with enhanced stiffness. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The main content dealt with in the paper is to make a theoretical analysis of the contour diameter of auxetic yarn under tension, which expands transversely under axial tension. The auxetic yarn is designed by two components, that is, a core filament and a wrap filament. Compared with the wrap filament, the core filament is thicker, softer and much more extensible. In the initial status, the core filament is straight in the center of the auxetic yarn and the wrap filament wraps the core filament helically in a certain helical angle. Based on theoretical analysis, the formula of negative Poisson's ratio of stretched auxetic yarn is obtained. It is found that the value of Poisson's ratio is related to axial strain, helical angle and the diameter ratio of the core filament to the wrap filament. An applied example is presented to verify the Poisson's ratio value-strain curve of auxetic yarn. In order to better investigate effects on negative Poisson's ratio, the effect of different parameters of yarn, including mesh size, diameter ratio, tensile modulus and helical angle of the wrap filament, is investigated using finite element analysis based on ABAQUS software to analyze the negative Poisson's ratio of auxetic yarn when stretched. It verified that yarn spun by two different components produced a negative Poisson's ratio effect under tension and structure parameters of auxetic yarn significantly affected negative Poisson's ratio values. It is expected that this study could help us understanding the deformation mechanism of auxetic yarn under axial tension load.

AB Auxetic yarn was successfully produced by a wrap filament and a core filament based on a ring-spinning system, which showed an auxetic effect when stretched, that is, expanding transversely under tension. Yarns were spun by different structural parameters of the core filament and the wrap filament, including diameter ratio, helical angle and tensile modulus of the wrap filament. Corresponding tensile tests were utilized to analyze the effects of structural parameters and performance on outer contour deformation of auxetic yarn. Experimental results showed that the outer contour of auxetic yarn expanded transversely under tension and there existed significant negative Poisson's ratio values in the Poisson's ratio-strain curve, and it was found that the auxetic effect became more observable with a higher diameter ratio of the core filament to the wrap filament, and lower helical angle and larger tensile modulus of the wrap filament. Moreover, compared with theoretical results by theoretical modeling in Part I, good relations of Poisson's ratio-strain curves were obtained between experimental and theoretical results. This proves the effectiveness of spinning auxetic yarn by selecting reasonable components of yarn and it is feasible to design yarn with a negative Poisson's ratio effect.

AB A novel 3D anti-tetrachiral structure with negative Poisson's ratio, based on a 2D anti-tetrachiral structure, was proposed in this paper. The 3D structure consists of two different perpendicular 2D anti-tetrachiral honeycomb cells connected by ligaments. The deformation mechanism of the structure was investigated, and analytical solutions for the Poisson's ratio of the cellular structure were obtained, which indicates a wide range of mechanical property via adjusting its geometric parameters. It was found that one of the Poisson's ratios is always -1 and is independent of the geometric parameters. Based on the energy method, the equivalent elastic moduli of the proposed structure along the three primary directions were also obtained. The analytical results were agree well with finite element analysis results. It was verified that the present analytical model can provide a relatively accurate solution in the prediction of the performance of auxetic structures.

AB Recently, ferroelectric materials have attracted considerable research attention. In particular, two dimensional (2D) strain ferroelectric materials have been considered as most crucial for next- generation circuit designs because of their application as novel electric memory devices. However, a 2D ferroelectric material is very rare. The ferroelectric materials with the form ABP(2)X(6) (A = Ag, Cu; B = Bi, In; X = S, Se) are of interest because of their ferroelectric property maintained in their ultrathin structures. Within the ABP(2)X(6) monolayer, the P-P bonds form the pillars that hold the top and bottom X planes, while the off-center A-B atoms between the X layers induce a spontaneous ferroelectric polarization. If the two off-center A-B sites are equally aligned, this would lead to the appearance of the paraelectric state. Such intriguing structures must impart novel mechanical properties to the materials. Until now, there has been no report on the mechanical properties of monolayerABP(2)X(6). Based on first-principles calculations, we studied the structural, electronic, mechanical as well as the electromechanical coupling properties of monolayer ABP(2)X(6) (A = Ag, Cu; B = Bi, In; X = S, Se). We found that they are all semiconductors with wide bandgaps of 2.73, 2.17, 3.00, and 2.31 eV for CulnP(2)Se(6), CuBiP2Se6, AgBiP2S6, and AgBiP2Se6, respectively, which are calculated based on the Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE) exchange correlation functional model. The conduction band minimum is mainly from p orbitals of X and B atoms, whereas the valence band maximum is due to the hybridization of the p orbital of X atoms and the d orbital of A atoms. Moreover, there are three short and three long NB -X bonds due to the A-B off center displacement. Together with the d-p orbital hybridization, the main reason for the distorted ferroelectric structure in ABP(2)X(6) monolayers is the Jahn-Teller effect. ABP(2)X(6) monolayers are predicted to be a new class of auxetic materials with an out-of-plane negative Poisson's ratio, i.e., the values of the negative Poisson's ratio are in the order AgBiP2S6 (-0.805) < AgBiP2Se6 (-0.778) < CuBiP2Se6 (-0.670) < CulnP(2)S(6) (-0.060). This is mainly due to the tensile strain applied in the x/y direction enlarging the angle( )between P-P bonds and top layer X atoms, thereby enhancing the bucking height of monolayer ABP(2)X(6). Moreover, external strain has a significant impact on the A-B off-center displacement, rendering an out-of-plane piezoelectric polarization. The values of e(13) for CulnP(2)S(6), CuBiP2Se6, AgBiP2S6, AgBiP2Se6 monolayers are calculated to be -3.95 x 10(-12), -5.68 x 10(-12), - 3.94 x 10(-12), -2.71 x 10(-12) C.m(-1) , respectively, which are comparable to the only experimentally confirmed 2D out-of-plane piezoelectric Janus system (piezoelectric coefficient = -3.8 x 10(-12 )C.m(-1)).
   This unusual auxetic behavior, ferroelectric polarization, and the electromechanical coupling in monolayerABP(2)X(6) could potentially lead to enormous technologically important applications in nanoelectronics, nanomechanics, and piezoelectrics.

AB A review and analysis of studies concerning the nature of Poisson's ratio mu of glassy systems are presented. The value of mu is a more pronounced structure-sensitive property than are elasticity moduli. The unique relation of mu to the Gruneisen parameter is substantiated. In this connection, the interrelation of harmonic (linear) and anharmonic (nonlinear) characteristics is discussed. Poisson's ratio is a single-valued function of parameters characterizing dynamic properties and critical processes and is sensitive to the lattice dynamics and the atomic-molecular structure of glasses. The structural features of isotropic solids with the negative Poisson's ratio (transverse deformation coefficient) are discussed.

DE Granular; Mechanics; Auxetic; Poisson's ratio
AB An auxetic material is one with a negative Poisson's ratio and has the property of widening when stretched or narrowing when compressed in contrast to conventional materials. Typical auxetic materials include modified polymeric foams (Lakes, 1987), regular honeycombs, polypropylene fibres and certain crystal structures. Auxetic materials benefit from enhanced mechanical properties. These benefits include improved indentation resistance, enhanced shear moduli and fracture toughness Evans and Alderson (2000).
   While modelling granular materials, Bathurst and Rothenburg (1988a,b) noted the theoretical possibility of a negative Poisson's ratio if the constitutive grains had unconventional interactive properties. These unconventional interactive properties are that the tangential interaction should be stiffer than the normal interaction. In this work, a 2D unit cell has been designed with just such an unconventional interaction so that a 2D granular material can be constructed with negative Poisson's ratio. Theoretical calculations of such a granular assembly are made using mean strain assumptions and first order heterogeneity calculations. These are compared to 2D discrete element simulations, finite element simulations and Bathurst and Rothenburg's original result. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Negative Poisson's ratio polymer foams derived from reticulated open cell foams exhibit large size effects in torsion and bending. Effective moduli increase as diameter decreases in contrast to the prediction of classical elasticity. Size effects of this sort are predicted by Cosserat (micropolar) elasticity in which points can rotate as well as translate and distributed moments are incorporated. The Cosserat coupling number N was about twice as large as that of as-received foam, leading to strong effects. The torsion characteristic length l(t) was similar. Cosserat effects are known to enhance toughness and immunity from stress concentration.

AB Auxetic materials have negative Poisson ratio which has a multiple ranges of functional applications. The helical auxetic yarn was successfully developed through direct twist system by using core and wrap yarn or filament, which shows Auxeticity when the HAY is stretched in longitudinal direction in response it expand in transverse direction, Helical Auxetic Yarns were developed using various parameters of the core and warp filament, these parameters are wrapping angle (Twist per meter), diameter ratio, and modulus ratio. The strength of Helical yarn was characterized using single yarn strength and Image J software was used for the calculation of poisson's ratio. According to test results, it is concluded that the core filament of helical auxetic yarn increased its thickness in transverse direction under stress, and a considerable negative poisson's ratio was calculated. The values of negative poisson's ratio described that the auxeticity had a direct relation with core filament thickness or diameter and inversely proportional to the linear density of wrap filament, in case of the wrap angle the auxeticity of HAY yarn had an inverse effect with wrap angle. Kevlar/polypropylene combination sample showed maximum auxeticity at a 15-degree angle while Kevlar/nylon combination sample showed minimum auxeticity at a 25-degree wrap angle.

AB In this paper, analytical and finite element (FE) simulations are carried out to calculate the in-plane Poisson's ratio and Young's modulus of a novel concept of structure with honeycomb-like configuration under uniaxial loading. Opposite to similar re-entrant honeycomb structures, the new unit cell topology adding a narrow rib in the well-known re-entrant cellular structure. The results obtained through the analytical and FE analysis show that adding a narrow rib in the unit cell of re-entrant honeycomb configuration gives rise to a cellular structure with significant enhanced Young's modulus compared to the classical re-entrant configurations exhibited in literature. The results also show an obvious linear relationship between Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of the proposed design with the adding ribs' thickness changing. For its significant Young's modulus enhancement and convenient to predictions of in-plane mechanical properties (Young's modulus and Poisson's ratios), this layout can be considered as a possible basis to design new concepts of auxetic structures with special functions.

AB This paper presents a study on the auxetic behaviour of the materials composed of hollow spheres. Although, as a newly developed material, the hollow sphere structures have gained a great deal of scientific attention, few studies have acknowledged its auxetic performance. Auxetic materials or materials with a negative Poisson's ratio have been a subject of intensive research due to their unusual and, in many extents, superior mechanical properties. A number of different auxetic systems that have been developed commonly based on designing special geometry of the material microstructure. However, in the hollow sphere structures, this mechanism is essentially different and the auxetic effect is attributed to the peculiarities of deformation of a thin-wall hollow sphere and to the interaction between the spheres in the assembly. In this study it is shown that the negative Poisson's ratio in this material is due to the high ratio between tangential to normal stiffnesses of a thin-wall hollow sphere. To evaluate the mechanical properties of these materials a homogenisation procedure based on the Cosserat 3D continuum theory is adopted. In this procedure, an assembly of the flexible thin-wall spheres is modelled as a stack of rigid spheres connected by a set of linear springs. The developed continuum model is validated against the direct finite element analysis of a regular assembly of the hollow spheres. Influence of the various design parameters on the macroscopic mechanical behaviour of the hollow sphere materials is investigated. The numerical study is focused on the auxetic behaviour of various kinds of packing arrangements of the hollow spheres. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The two-component complex yarn with helical wrapping structure has been reported with auxetic behavior and unique performance, however, the residual torque could lead to the slippage of the wrap component from the core in the natural state and poor stability and applicability. Therefore, this paper aims to introduce a novel interlaced-helical wrapping yarn with negative Poisson's ratio, stable structure, practicability and continuous preparation. The differences in geometry and auxetic behavior between helical structure and interlaced-helical structure were presented and analyzed. Both the structure stability and auxetic effect of the interlaced-helical complex yarn have advantages over the helical wrap yarn with same materials and initial wrap angle. It can be shown that the interlaced-helical wrap yarns with lower initial wrap angle and bigger tensile modulus of the stiff yarns will produce better auxetic effect. Besides, the deformation mechanism and the manufacturing process were described in detail. Several kinds of yarns have been fabricated to discuss the effect of initial wrap angle and tensile modulus on the Poisson's ratio of the structure. The maximum value of Poisson's ratio for the yarns manufactured was -2.8. It is also expected that auxetic yarns with novel braided structure can prompt the applications of auxetic textiles.

AB Materials with negative Poisson's ratio attract considerable attention due to their underlying intriguing physical properties and numerous promising applications, particularly in stringent environments such as aerospace and defense areas, because of their unconventional mechanical enhancements. Recent progress in materials with a negative Poisson's ratio are reviewed here, with the current state of research regarding both theory and experiment. The inter-relationship between the underlying structure and a negative Poisson's ratio is discussed in functional materials, including macroscopic bulk, low-dimensional nanoscale particles, films, sheets, or tubes. The coexistence and correlations with other negative indexes (such as negative compressibility and negative thermal expansion) are also addressed. Finally, open questions and future research opportunities are proposed for functional materials with negative Poisson's ratios.

AB This study deals with the in-plane Young's moduli of two-dimensional auxetic cellular materials with negative Poisson's ratios. The in-plane Young's moduli of these cellular materials are theoretically analyzed, and calculated from the cell member bending with large deflection. Expressions for the in-plane Young's moduli of the above-mentioned cellular materials are given by incomplete elliptic integrals. It is found that the in-plane Young's moduli of two-dimensional cellular materials with negative Poisson's ratios depend both on the geometry of the cell, and on the induced strain of these cellular materials. The in-plane Young's moduli are no longer constants at large deformation. But at the limit of small strain, they converge to the results predicted by the small deformation model of flexure.

AB Double-V microstructure (DVM) is a type of auxetic cellular material with negative Poisson's ratio (NPR). Accurate predictions of the mechanical properties of these microstructures at large strains are critical for many engineering applications. In this paper, nonlinear theoretical models of two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) DVM based on a large beam deflection model are established to predict the normalized Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio in the principal directions. The theoretical solutions are compared to solutions obtained from numerical finite element analyses and quasi-static compression experiments of a 2D prototype manufactured using additive printing technique. It is found that there is good agreement between these results, validating the accuracy of the proposed theoretical model. Effects of geometry parameters on the mechanical properties of the DVM are also investigated to understand the mechanical behavior at large strains. This study provides validated models for predicting the behavior of these microstructures at large strains, useful for engineering designs.

AB Negative Poisson's ratio, while thermodynamically permitted is only observed in some natural crystals in certain directions. All other known cases of negative Poisson's ratio are the man-made structures exhibiting this property macroscopically. One class of these structures includes re-entrant foams and specially engineered structures with springs and hinges. Another class is constituted by materials consisting of a matrix with positive Poisson's ratio with embedded microstructural elements producing macroscopic negative Poisson's ratio. In the first class, we propose structures made of balls bonded by links with high shear to normal stiffness ratio. In the second class, we introduce materials filled with cracks with suppressed relative shearing of the faces. In the case of multiscale crack distributions the minimum value of Poisson's ratio achievable is -1/3. Materials with positive and negative Poisson's ratio can be combined into hybrid materials. We show that multiscale distribution of spherical inclusions whose Poisson's ratio has different sign to that of the elastic isotropic matrix can considerably (up to two orders of magnitude) increase the effective Young's modulus even when the Young's moduli of the matrix and inclusions are the same. Generic mechanical properties of auxetics such as fracture toughness, wave propagation and damping are discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This chapter begins by establishing the effect of constituents with opposite Poisson's ratio signs on the effective moduli of composite properties. Results show that the effective Young's modulus of continuous unidirectional fiber composites in the fiber direction and that for laminates of isotropic laminas in the in-plane direction exceeds the rule of mixture prediction, especially when the difference between Young's moduli and Poisson's ratios between the constituents are small and large, respectively. For laminates of isotropic laminas with opposing Poisson's ratio signs, the effective Young's modulus in the out-of-plane direction not only exceeds the inverse rule of mixture but also the direct rule of mixture, and this is especially so when the difference between the Young's modulus of individual laminas is insignificant. The conditions that lead to further counter-intuitive properties whereby the in-plane laminate modulus exceeds the modulus of the stiffer phase is established, followed by an example in which the maximum point of the laminate modulus takes place when the volume fraction of the stiffer phase is lower than the volume fraction of the more compliant phase. Thereafter, investigation on laminates of isotropic laminas with alternating signs of Poisson's ratio and alternating signs of coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) gives results of extreme overall CTE. Finally, a review is done for investigation on conventional composites that lead to auxetic properties.

AB In this research, the Poisson's ratio of three different types of almost isotropic interpenetrating composites are designed to be either positive, or negative, or zero. As they are strengthened by a self-connected fibre-network and do not contain any pore in their structure, they all are stiffer than the conventional particle composites. In addition, structural hierarchy is also demonstrated to be able to significantly enhance the auxetic behaviour for the three types of interpenetrating composites. Thus, these composites could be used not only as functional materials, but also as structural materials in engineering applications.

The hexagonal periodic distribution of the pores makes the effective behavior isotropic. Both experimental tests and numerical simulations have been performed to determine the effective properties of the porous solid. A parametric study on the effect of the geometrical microstructural parameters is also presented. This auxetic structure is easy to fabricate and can be very useful in several engineering applications. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Combined heat treatment and applied mechanical strains have been employed to modify the structure and properties of polyurethane (PU) foams. Consequently, foams with a range of pore sizes, shapes and orientations have been produced, including those possessing auxetic (negative Poisson's ratio) behaviour. Four conversion conditions were employed: triaxial, biaxial and uniaxial compression (to linear compression ratios of 0.9, 0.8 and 0.7) and uniaxial tension to (linear extension ratios of 1.1 and 1.2). The converted foams were then observed by either SEM or optical microscopy, as appropriate, to determine the pore structure. Mechanical properties were measured using tensile testing in conjunction with videoextensometry, allowing the values of Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio to be ascertained. Increased anisotropy in the pore structure and elastic properties was observed. The biaxial as well as the triaxial conversion routes led to auxetic behaviour for the PU foams.

AB Negative Poisson's ratio, while thermodynamically permitted, is only observed in some natural crystals in certain directions. All other known cases of negative Poisson's ratio are the man-made structures which exhibit this property macroscopically. One class of these structures includes re-entrant foams and special structures with springs and hinges. Another class is constituted by materials consisting of a matrix with positive Poisson's ratio with embedded microstructural elements producing macroscopic negative Poisson's ratio. In the first class, we propose structures made of balls bonded by links with high shear to normal stiffness ratio. In the second class, we introduce materials filled with cracks with suppressed relative shearing of the faces. In the latter case we determine the effective moduli for multiscale crack distributions using the differential self-consistent method and show that the minimum value of Poisson's ratio achievable in this way is -1/3. Materials with positive and negative Poisson's ratio can be combined into hybrid materials. For multiscale distribution of inclusions (wide distribution of sizes with the same concentration at each scale) we show that negative Poisson's ratio spherical inclusions in a positive Poisson's ratio elastic isotropic matrix considerably increase the effective Young's modulus even when the Young's moduli of the matrix and inclusions are the same.

AB As an effective candidate for enhancing energy absorption, a range of foam materials have gained considerable popularity, in which the density, Young's modulus and plasticity of foam materials are considered critical to crashworthiness. Relatively speaking, less attention has been paid to the roles played by the Poisson's ratio of foam or cellular materials. More importantly, the interaction between different Poisson's ratios and thin-walled structures has been a critical yet under-studied issue. This paper aims to explore the effects of negative, zero and positive Poisson's ratio of auxetic foams, ranging from -1 to 0.5, on structural crashworthiness and seek optimal design for different foam-filled square, circular and conic tubes. In this study the specific energy absorption (SEA) and mean crushing force (MCF) are taken as the objective functions by using mathematical regression analysis. The sequential quadratic programming (SQP) and the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) are employed for single and multiobjective design of foam-filled tubes with different Poisson's ratios, respectively. The optimal Poisson's ratio is obtained for these three different types of foam-filled tubes. By comparison we found that the crashworthiness of foam filled conic tube is the best, followed by circular and then squared tubes. The study provides new insights into material selection and design with a more favorable Poisson's ratio for crashworthiness. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Materials exhibiting auxetic behaviour get fatter when stretched (i.e. possess a negative Poisson's ratio). This property has been closely related to particular geometrical features of a system and how it deforms. One of the mechanisms which is known to have a potential to generate such behaviour is that of rotating rigid units. Several models based on this concept have been developed, including two-dimensional as well as three-dimensional (3D) models. In this work, we propose a new 3D structure constructed from rigid cuboids which also deform through relative rotation of the units. In particular, analytical models for the mechanical properties, namely the Poisson's ratio and the Young's moduli, are derived and it is shown that for loading on-axis, these systems have the potential to exhibit negative values for all the six on-axis Poisson's ratios.

AB This study investigates the compressive responses and mechanisms of perforated structures made of pure nylon polymer (NP) and short carbon fibre reinforced nylon polymer (SCF/NP) with negative Poisson's ratio (NPR), and proposes an improved lightweight auxetic structure. A theoretical analysis is performed for predicting the Poisson's ratios of perforated auxetic structures, and validated experimentally. A comparison between conventional and auxetic perforated structures under compression shows that the SCF/NP specimens have higher stiffness than the NP structures and the auxetic structure can reach a NPR of about -1. The effects of perforation geometry and material type on the mechanical properties are investigated. Results depict a decrease in nominal stress with an increase in the perforation gap, but the perforation gap increase leads to enhancement of relative density, effective strain and average Poisson's ratio. Further, SCF/NP structures have advantages over NP structures due to their higher effective strain, effective specific energy absorption (SEA) and relative Young's modulus. Subsequently, an improved auxetic structure is designed, and a comparative study between the designed structure and two common auxetic structures (with the same relative density of 0.32) shows that the designed auxetic structures have the highest SEA and relative Young's modulus with the strongest auxetic effect (smallest average Poisson's ratio).

AB This article presents an experimental and geometrical study of a novel kind of plied yarn structure with negative Poisson's ratio (NPR). The deformation mechanism of the yarn structure formed with two stiff yarns and two soft yarns to achieve NPR behavior was firstly introduced. Based on the proposed yarn structure, four kinds of yarn samples were then fabricated with two kinds of stiff yarns and two types of soft yarns and tested under the axial extension to verify their auxetic or NPR effect. A geometric analysis was finally conducted to theoretically calculate the Poisson's ratio of the yarn structure and compared with the experimental results. The study shows that the proposed yarn structure has obvious NPR effect and the geometrical analysis can well predict its Poisson's ratio in the higher axial strain range. It is expected that this study could promote further development of auxetic textiles with unusual behavior.

AB Auxetic yarn is designed by ourselves by wrap-core structure, which has special physical properties and geometrical structure different from traditional yarn. The wrap-core auxetic yarn will expand transversely under tension. Therefore, the tensile tests were conducted to analyze effects of structural parameters and performance on lateral deformation of yarn. The experimental results show that yarn with negative Poisson's ratio as low as -4.31 is produced successfully. Moreover, effects of structure and performance, including the wrap angle, the diameter ratio, the tension modulus of the wrap yarn and the twist of the core yarn, on poisson's ratio of yarn are analyzed. It is found that the negative Poisson's ratio effect becomes more observable with the higher diameter ratio or lower wrap angle, and it becomes much more observable when the twist degree of the core yarn is higher or the wrap yarn's modulus is lower.

AB Relatively few negative Poisson's ratio (auxetic) composites have been manufactured and characterised and none with inherently auxetic phases [Milton G. J. Mech. Phys. Solids 1992;40:1105-37]. This paper presents the use of a novel double-helix yarn that is shown to be auxetic, and an auxetic composite made from this yarn in a woven textile structure. This is the first reported composite to exhibit auxetic behaviour using inherently auxetic yarns. Importantly, both the yarn and the composite are produced using standard manufacturing techniques and are therefore potentially useful in a wide range of engineering applications.

AB Most metamaterials with negative Poisson's ratio and/or negative thermal expansion coefficient possess relatively low stiffness. In this work, a novel hybrid-honeycomb structure with enhanced stiffness is proposed. It consists of two merged hexagonal honeycombs. Analytical and computational homogenization methods are used to evaluate the effective thermoelastic properties. Analytical expressions of the effective Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, and thermal expansion coefficient are given. We show that the effective thermoelastic properties of the structure are widely tunable by tailoring the microstructural geometry and the constituent materials. In particular, the inplane effective Poisson's ratio and thermal expansion coefficient are adjustable over a wide range, from negative to positive. By properly choosing the geometrical and material parameters, the structure can be designed to concurrently possess an enhanced stiffness and a high degree of auxeticity and negative thermal expansion.

AB Auxetic materials and negative thermal expansion materials show great application potential in many important fields. In this paper, a novel three-dimensional truss structure with a tunable Poisson's ratio and tailorable coefficient of thermal expansion was developed. Since the deformation of each rod was dominated by axial tension or compression, the structure showed high stiffness. Equations regarding equivalent elasticity parameters and coefficients of thermal expansion of the structure were obtained by displacement and unit force methods. A numerical simulation verification was performed by ANSYS 16.0 software. The verification results indicated that the formulas have high precision and wide application scope. Through parametric analysis, we obtained the conditions for achieving a negative Poisson's ratio and negative thermal expansion coefficient. We also concluded that this material could realize a three-dimensional negative Poisson's ratio and bidirectional negative thermal expansion simultaneously by choosing reasonable geometric parameters and material combinations.

AB Existent rigid unit mode (RUM) models based on rotating squares, which may explain the phenomenon of negative thermal expansion (NTE), are generalized so as to assess the NTE potential for novel systems made from rectangular or rhombic rigid units. Analytical models for the area coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE) of these innovative networks are derived in an attempt to determine the optimal geometrical parameters and connectivity for maximum NTE. It was found that all systems exhibit NTE, the extent of which is determined by the shape and connectivity of the elemental rigid units (side lengths ratio or internal angle). It was also found that some of the networks proposed here should exhibit significantly superior NTE properties when compared with the well-known network of squares, and that for optimal NTE characteristics, pencil-like rigid units should be used rather than square-shaped ones, as these permit larger pore sizes that are more conducive to NTE. All this compliments earlier work on the negative Poisson's ratio (auxetic) potential of such systems and may provide a route for the design of new materials exhibiting superior thermo-mechanical characteristics including specifically tailored CTEs or giant NTE characteristics.

AB Based on the known solutions of the problems of extension and torsion of cylindrically anisotropic chiral tubes, the analysis of variability of the Young's modulus, Poisson's ratios and torsional stiffness of monoclinic crystalline tubes was carried out using known experimental values of the compliance coefficients of the crystals. The extreme values of Young's modulus and torsional stiffness were determined and their variability was studied. It was shown that chirality had a significant effect on the values of the elastic characteristics of tubes made from monoclinic crystals. Thin-walled tubes (the ratio of the external and internal radii of about one), which had a negative Poisson's ratio, were identified. The largest negative values of Poisson's ratio among all the analysed tubes were achieved for tubes from LaNbO4 and CsH2PO4 crystals. Due to the change in the ratio of the radii and the chirality, the Young's modulus and the torsional stiffness of such tubes were changed in several times, and their Poisson's ratios could change by several units. Angular Poisson's ratio could reach the value of - 6.5 on the inner surface of a tube from CsH2PO4 crystal. The LaNbO4 and CsH2PO4 crystals also had large negative values of Poisson's ratios in the case of rectilinear anisotropy, which were significantly different from the Poisson's ratio for isotropic materials.

AB In this paper, the elastic band structures of two-dimensional solid phononic crystals (PCs) with both negative and positive Poisson's ratios are investigated based on the finite difference domain method. Systems with different combinations of mass density ratio and shear modulus ratio, filling fractions and lattices are considered. The numerical results show that for the PCs with both large mass density ratio and shear modulus ratio, the first bandgap becomes narrower with its upper edge becoming lower as Poisson's ratio of the scatterers decreases from -0.1 to -0.9. Generally, introducing the material with a negative Poisson's ratio for scatterers will make this bandgap lower and narrower. For the PCs with large mass density ratio and small shear modulus ratio, the first bandgap becomes wider with Poisson's ratio of the scatterers decreasing and that of the host increasing. It is easy to obtain a wide low-frequency bandgap by embedding scatterers with a negative Poisson's ratio into the host with a positive Poisson's ratio. The PCs with large filling fractions are more sensitive to the variations of Poisson's ratios. Use of negative Poisson's ratio provides us a way of tuning bandgaps. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB Two dimensional (2D) chalcogenide monolayers have diversified applications in optoelectronics, piezotronics, sensors and energy harvesting. The group-IV tellurene monolayer is one such emerging material in the 2D family owing to its piezoelectric, thermoelectric and optoelectronic properties. In this paper, the mechanical and piezoelectric properties of 2D tellurene in centrosymmetric beta and non-centrosymmetric beta ' phases are investigated using density functional theory. beta '-Te has shown a negative Poisson's ratio of -0.024 along the zigzag direction. Giant in-plane piezoelectric coefficients of -83.89 x 10(-10) C m(-1) and -42.58 x 10(-10) C m(-1) are observed for beta '-Te under biaxial and uniaxial strains, respectively. The predicted values are remarkably higher, that is 23 and 12 times the piezoelectric coefficient of a MoS2 monolayer with biaxial and uniaxial strain in the zigzag direction, respectively. A large thermal expansion coefficient of tellurene is also estimated using quasi harmonic approximation. High piezoelectricity combined with exotic mechanical and thermal properties makes tellurene a very promising candidate in nanoelectronics.

ID CORES
AB The transverse shear modulus of in-plane negative Poisson's ratio honeycombs is determined using numerical simulations. General honeycombs have theoretical upper and lower bounds of transverse shear moduli. The actual transverse shear modulus is an intermediate value, depending on the relative density and the gauge thickness ratio. The difference between upper and lower bounds is particularly significant for negative Poisson's ratio honeycombs. Finite element simulations confirm the theoretical trend, and show gauge ratio dependence different from that envisaged in the literature for conventional honeycombs. A modified approximate formula is thus proposed to predict the actual transverse shear modulus for honeycombs having in-plane negative Poisson's ratio values.

   Poisson's ratio; Auxetic
AB Currently reported cylindrical metastructures mainly act as the load-bearing components, or only present the single function of programming either Poisson's ratio (PR) or coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE). Here, by curling the planar metamaterials, a series of multi-functional cylindrical metastructures is originally devised to simultaneously incorporate programmable CTE and PR. The deformation characteristics are systematically analyzed. It is identified that the number of circumfer-ential cells N remarkably affects the deformation characteristics. When N is small, the warp effect induced by the curved members is remarkable. The quantitative analysis figures out that when N is larger than specific critical values, the PR and CTE of the cylindrical metastructures approach to those of the planar metamaterials. Thus, a design strategy is identified, namely, with adequate circumferential cells, both the PR and CTE of the cylindrical metastructures are independent on the variable N, and are equal to those of the corresponding planar metamaterials. Most importantly, by modulating the geometric parameters, the PR and CTE of the devised cylindrical metastructures can be simultaneously programmed to be wide ranges. The excellent programmability in both PR and CTE enables the cylindrical metastructures to be potentially used in engineering applications where precise control of deformation induced both by mechanical and thermal loads is in urgent need.

AB Analytical and numerical features of the elastic properties of curvilinearly anisotropic six-constant tetragonal nano/microtubes are considered. The analytical formulas for Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio are obtained in the case of axial extension. Numerical calculations are performed using these formulas and data on the elastic constants from the Landolt-Bornstein Handbook. The parametric dependences of Young's modulus and Poisson's ratios for nano/microtubes are analyzed in detail. The basic parameters are elastic compliances, chiral angles, and ratios of the radii of hollow cylindrical tubes. (C) 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB In an effort to tailor functional materials with customized anisotropic properties - stiffness and yield strain, we propose porous materials consisting of flexible mesostructures designed from the deformation of a re-entrant auxetic honeycomb and compliant mechanisms. Using an analogy between compliant mechanisms and a cellular material's deformation, we can tailor in-plane properties of mesostructures; low stiffness and high strain in one direction and high stiffness and low strain in the other direction. Two mesostructures based on hexagonal honeycombs with positive and negative cell angles are generated. An analytical model is developed to obtain effective moduli and yield strains of the porous materials by combining the kinematics of a rigid link mechanism and deformation of flexure hinges. A numerical technique is implemented to the analytical model for nonlinear constitutive relations of the mesostructures and their strain dependent Poisson's ratios. A Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is used to validate the analytical and numerical model. The moduli and yield strain of a porous aluminum alloy are about 6.3GPa and 0.26% in one direction and about 2.8MPa and 12% in the other direction. The mesostructures have extremely high positive and negative Poisson's ratios, v(xy)* (similar to +/- 40) due to the large rotation of the link member in the transverse direction caused by the input displacement in the longitudinal direction. The mesostructures also show higher moduli for compressive loading due to the contact of slit edges at the center region. This paper demonstrates that compliant mesostructures can be used for a next generation material design in terms of tailoring mechanical properties; moduli, strength, strain, and Poisson's ratios. The proposed mesostructures can also be easily manufactured using a conventional cutting method.

AB Purpose
   Negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) material has huge potential applications in various industrial fields. However, lower Young's modulus due to the porous form limits its further applications. Based on the topology optimization technique, this paper aims to optimize the structure consisting two isotropic porous materials with positive Poisson's ratio (PPR) and NPR and void.
   Design/methodology/approach
   Under prescribed dual-volume fraction constraints, the structural compliance is taken as the objective. Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio are, respectively, interpolated and expressed with Lame's parameters for easier programming. Accordingly, the sensitivities can be derived through the chain rule. Several two- and three-dimensional illustrative examples are presented to demonstrate the capability and effectiveness of the proposed approach. The influences of Poisson's ratios, volume fractions and Young's moduli on the optimized results are investigated.
   Findings
   For NPR materials having unique load responses, the resulting topologies of PPR and NPR materials have distinct material distributions in comparison of the results from two PPR materials. Furthermore, it is observed that higher structural stiffness can be achieved from the hybrid of PPR and NPR materials than that obtained from the structures made of individual constituent materials.
   Originality/value
   A topology optimization methodology is proposed to design structures composed of PPR and NPR materials.

AB In this paper, we propose a class of lattice structures with macroscopic Poisson's ratio arbitrarily close to the stability limit -1. We tested experimentally the effective Poisson's ratio of the microstructured medium; the uniaxial test was performed on a thermoplastic lattice produced with a three-dimensional printing technology. A theoretical analysis of the effective properties was performed, and the expression of the macroscopic constitutive properties is given in full analytical form as a function of the constitutive properties of the elements of the lattice and on the geometry of the microstructure. The analysis was performed on three microgeometries leading to an isotropic behaviour for the cases of three- and sixfold symmetries and to a cubic behaviour for the case of fourfold symmetry.

AB Elastic properties of the hexagonal crystals under pressure were analyzed. Seven crystals with negative Poisson's ratio (auxetics) were revealed at zero pressure. These are crystals of MoS2, Zn, Be, BeCu (alloy with 2.4 at.% Cu), TiB2, C7H12, and MnAs. Analytical expressions of extreme values of Poisson's ratio and Young's modulus were obtained. For these materials, the variability of Poisson's ratio and Young's modulus was analyzed at pressure change. It was shown that all seven hexagonal auxetics may become completely auxetic under certain pressure values. The variability of the elastic properties of graphite and SiC, being non-auxetics at zero pressure, was considered. These crystals become partially auxetic at negative pressure (-15 GPa for graphite and -56 GPa for silicon carbide) and completely auxetic at -114 and -122 GPa, respectively.

AB The present compilation of P - and S wave velocities (V-p and V-s) for 395 dry and 664 wet basalt, 231 dry and 63 wet rhyolite samples provide a new database for evaluating the porosity (phi) dependence of V-p, V-s and Poisson's ratio (nu) and the potential auxetic behavior (i.e., negative Poisson's ratio) of volcanic rocks. The nu-phi correlation is always positive for the water-saturated rocks but can be either positive (rhyolite) or negative (basalt) for dry rocks, depending on the Poisson's ratio of the non-porous solid matrix (nu(0)). Auxetic behavior cannot occur in wet volcanic rocks but may appear in dry basalts with extremely high porosity (>= 70% for basalt), such that a reentrant foam structure forms. The auxeticity of highly porous volcanic rocks such as pumice and reticulite will be suppressed by infiltration of water into the rocks. Hence, volcanic rocks cannot be auxetic in nature if their vesicles are filled with water. Under the laboratory conditions, however, a transition from conventional to auxetic behaviors in pumice and reticulite is expected to occur by changing the degree of water saturation. These results provide a set of basic parameters for the modeling of ground deformation and temporal and spatial variations in V-p, V-s, V-p/V-s ratio as precursors of volcanic eruption or volcanic edifice collapse.

AB In the present paper, three kinds of novel two-dimensional enhanced star-shaped honeycombs (2D-ESSH) are proposed, which are consisted of the two-dimensional star-shaped honeycomb (2D-SSH) and reinforcing rods. Relative densities of the 2D-SSH and three kinds of 2D-ESSH are deduced. Mechanical properties of the proposed novel 2D-ESSH are investigated via finite-element simulations and compression experiments. The effects of the effective length, the angle of the outer cell walls, the thickness of the outer cell walls, the angle of the inner cell walls, and the thickness of the inner cell walls on the effective Poisson's ratio and effective Young's modulus of the structures are explored in detail. The results show that the novel 2D-ESSH can effectively regulate the effect of negative Poisson's ratio and two kinds of the 2D-ESSH also improve the effective Young's modulus with the appropriate parameters while ensuring the lightweight.

AB Auxetic textiles are defined as textiles with negative Poisson's ratio. These textiles possess unique properties that render them suitable for special applications. This work aims to investigate the effect of fabric structural parameters such as thread densities, weave design and warp yarn count. Thus, 30 fabric samples were woven at 3 weft and 2 warp densities, respectively. Two warp counts and three weave designs of plain, basket 3/3 and weft-backed satin 6 were used. The samples were uniaxially loaded in weft direction and dimensional changes at various strains levels were evaluated. The evaluation was carried out using the image processing technique based on MATLAB software. The weft yarns used were found to exhibit auxetic behavior at the whole spectrum of the strain level used. The least weft yarn Poisson's ratio was found to be -0.9. It was established that in general the fabric samples exhibit auxetic effect within the stated range of strain. Additionally, it was concluded that while fabric thread densities together with warp count influence the minimum fabric Poisson's ratio, auxetic behavior of the samples is not dependent on weave design alone. Rather, it was illustrated that the combined effect of weave design in association with stated structural parameters on auxetic feature cannot be ignored.

AB Materials with negative Poisson's ratios (auxetic materials) have several advantages compared to conventional materials, including increased plane strain fracture resistance and increased shear modulus. A method for the manufacture of honeycomb ceramics with a structure, which yields negative Poisson's ratio is described. Ceramics with cellular or honeycomb structures have applications as substrates in catalytic converters for the emissions from internal combustion engines. In such devices due to the extreme temperature variations, the structure has to provide high thermal shock resistance. It is possible to increase the thermal shock resistance by incorporating specific web geometries, Such structures can absorb or compensate for compressive and tensile stresses generated in the body during thermal expansion and contraction. It is shown that such structures can be produced by the extrusion of ceramic pastes through polymer dies produced by rapid prototyping (selective laser sintering), CAD technology was used to design the die. A ceramic paste based on a zirconia powder was used to make the cellular extruded tube. The negative Poisson's ratio behaviour was confirmed by employing a simple test.

AB The weak stiffness and strength of materials with negative Poisson's ratio limits their application. In this paper, three types of novel lattices with negative Poisson's ratio are proposed to improve not only stiffness and strength but also energy absorption capacity by embedding different ribs into a classic re-entrant structure. Unit cell analyses show these novel lattices have significantly increased Young's modulus along the loading direction, and Type C can maintain sufficient negative Poisson's ratio performance compared with the base lattice. In addition, the novel lattices exhibit higher yield stress, plateau stress and densification strain extracted from quasi-static compressive simulation. The lattices are prototyped by laser-based additive manufacturing and tested in quasi-static experiments, which show the experimental data match the numerical results within an error of margin. The work signifies the prospect of lattices with negative Poisson's ratio in enhancing engineering-applicable structures, and indicates the potential of structural topology optimization in more sophisticated designs.

AB Auxetic foams, i.e. those possessing a negative Poisson's ratio, nu, are known to possess improved sound absorption properties when compared with conventional foams. In this study, the ultrasonic attenuation of another class of auxetic materials, microporous polymers, and in particular ultra-high-molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE), was examined experimentally, in comparison with a microporous positive nu form of UHMWPE and conventionally processed UHMWPE. It was found that the microporous polymers, whether auxetic or nor, showed very large enhancements in attenuation coefficient, alpha(mn), over the conventionally processed UHMWPE, with the highest measurable value being alpha(mn) = 47 dB/cm for the auxetic material, which is 1.5 times the highest value for the microporous positive nu UHMWPE and more than three times that for the conventionally processed material. In addition, the samples with the largest negative Poisson's ratio absorbed the signal so completely that no value of a was obtainable. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Cellular solids are attractive materials due to their high specific static and dynamic mechanical properties. Even though these mechanical domains are interdependent, they are generally studied separately. This study uses a combination of additive manufacturing and vacuum assisted investment casting to manufacture low specific density (0.042-0.098) non-stochastic metallic cellular solids. An in-situ unitary cell geometric control is used to produce samples with positive, zero and negative Poisson's ratios. The different values of this elastic constant allow the analysis of the distinct deformation in auxetic and non-auxetic behaviors. Deformation models are used to describe the static and dynamic behavior of the referred samples. It is shown that auxetic samples display higher values of apparent modulus and plastic collapse stress due to their densification effect. In terms of dynamic properties, samples with slightly negative and zero rib angles show higher values of damping. This is attributed to the more favorable flexure component of deformation and variations in material volume that influence the hysteretic damping. Overall, it is suggested that the most beneficial combination of specific density, static and dynamic mechanical properties is observed in samples with a rib angle of -10 degrees and a Poisson's ratio of - 0.34.

AB Mechanical properties of phosphorene oxides are investigated by using density functional theory calculations. Intriguingly, as the oxygen coverage approaches 50%, negative Poisson's ratios are found in the in-plane principal directions, originating from the asymmetric atomic structure upon oxygen adsorption. It is demonstrated that the structure of phosphorene oxide is largely weakened compared with that of pristine phosphorene. Our work indicates that certain unconventional mechanical properties, such as the negative Poisson's ratio, can be achieved by tuning the atomic structure through simple processes, which offers a new avenue to design specific properties at the nanoscale.

AB Much research related to negative Poisson's ratio (NPR), or auxetic, structures is emerging these days. Several types of 3D NPR structure have been proposed and studied, but almost all of them had cuboid shapes, which were not suitable for certain engineering applications. In this paper, a cylindrical NPR structure was developed and researched. It was expected to be utilized in springs, bumpers, dampers and other similar applications. For the purpose of parametric analysis, a method of parametric modeling of cylindrical NPR structures was developed using MATLAB scripts. The scripts can automatically establish finite element models, invoke ABAQUS, read results etc. Subsequently the influences of structural parameters, including number of cells, number of layers and layer heights, on the uniaxial compression behavior of cylinder NPR structures were researched. This led to the conclusion that the stiffness of the cylindrical NPR structure was enhanced on increasing the number of cells and reducing the effective layer height. Moreover, small numbers of layers resulted in a late transition area of the load-displacement curve from low stiffness to high stiffness. Moreover, the middle contraction regions were more apparent with larger numbers of cells, smaller numbers of layers and smaller effective layer heights. The results indicate that the structural parameters had significant effects on the load-displacement curves and deformed shapes of cylindrical NPR structures. This paper is conducive to the further engineering applications of cylindrical NPR structures.

AB The use of negative thermal expansivity (NTE) particles as composite fillers is relatively new and the particle-matrix interface is not well studied. This lack of understanding of the particle-matrix interface is further complicated as in many engineering applications, such as microchip packaging, the composite is constrained by its surroundings and is not free to expand upon heating; an important consideration that is often not taken into account. This paper presents a systematic theoretical study of the behaviour at the particle-matrix interface under varying particle coefficient of thermal expansivity (CTE), Poisson's ratios (including negative Poisson's ratios), Young's moduli, boundary conditions and particle separation distances via finite element modelling, and describes how to optimise composite formulation for problems of thermal mismatch through tailoring of particle-matrix interaction. The effects of reduced CTE are explored via models of electronic chip package assembly. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Microstructured plates, consisting of various conventional and re-entrant cells, are numerically constructed and analyzed for their effective elastic properties under in-plane deformation. The finite element numerical method is adopted. The calculated effective Poisson's ratios of the plates are found to be in the range between -1 and 1, in consistency with the theory of two-dimensional elasticity. Auxetic angles need to be greater than about 20 degrees in order to obtain negative Poisson's ratio. Increasing the auxetic angles reduces the effective pure shear modulus. Elastically anisotropic characteristics of the homogenized plate are analyzed with the calculated effective Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, and pure shear modulus.

AB In the present paper, we analyze uniaxial deformation of crystals of different systems with negative Poisson's ratios, known as auxetics. The behavior of auxetic crystals is studied on the basis of extensive knowledge on the experimental values of elastic constants of different crystals, gathered in the well-known Landolt-Bornstein tables. The competition between the anisotropy of crystal structures and the orientation of deformable samples results in the dependence of the elastic characteristics of deformation, such as Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio, on the orientation angles. In the special case of a single angle, a large number of auxetics were found among crystals of cubic, hexagonal, rhombohedral, tetragonal, and orthorhombic systems and the character of variations in their response due to changes in orientation was determined.

AB The concept of reducing the thermal expansion of composites by exploiting the thinning that is observed when a conventional material is mechanically stretched (the Poisson's effect) is explored through finite elements (FE) simulations with the scope of assessing the potential of such systems to exhibit negative thermal expansion (NTE). It is shown that systems made from hard highly expanding needle, cylindrical or coin shaped inclusions embedded within a soft matrix with a high positive Poisson's ratio having low coefficients of thermal expansion may exhibit NTE under certain conditions. In the case of the coin-shaped inclusions, the NTE is maximum in the direction orthogonal to the surface of the coins and in the case of systems with needle-shaped inclusions, the NTE is maximum in the direction orthogonal to the length of the needles.

AB In the area of biomaterials, the structures with negative Poisson's ratio are able to be applied to the polymer component of prosthesis, artificial blood-vessel and catheter. To induce its characteristic, previous studies postulated many structural shapes such as non-convex shape with re-entrant corners and re-entrant honeycomb. In this study, we proposed the rotational particle structures and investigated the Poisson's ratio and the ratio (E-e/E) of the elastic modulus of these structures based on structural design variables using finite element method.
   The auto-meshing preprocessor was coded using MATLAB in order to construct numerical models as design variables and perform finite element analysis (FEA) effectively. Three selected design variables were the ratio of fibril's length to particle's diameter (0.2-2.0), the ratio of fibril's length to its width (0.02 similar to 0.2) and the angle of fibril about horizontal axis (0 degree similar to tangential angle). Finite element model has 2D plain stress quadratic element and composed of 515 particles and 6-linked fibrils per each particle. For all of 213 cases, one side of each model is applied a tension, 0.1% strain and analyze Poisson's ratio and the ratio (E-e/E) of the elastic modulus.
   As the ratio of fibril's length to particle's diameter increased and the ratio of fibril's diameter to fibril's length decreased fixing the fibril's angle with 45 degree, the negative Poisson effect of rotational particle structures increased. The ratio of elastic modulus of these structures decreased with Poisson's ratio. The results show the reasonable values as compared with the previous analytical results.

AB In this paper, a novel three-dimensional (3D) cellular structure with negative Poisson's ratio was designed by alternating cuboid surface indents on the vertical ribs of the unit cells. The Poisson's ratio and Young's modulus of structures with different geometric parameters were determined using the finite element method (FEM) as a function of these parameters. Samples with identical geometric variables were fabricated via 3D printing, and their through-thickness direction Poisson's ratios were measured and compared with simulation results. Results showed that the Poisson's ratio of the 3D cellular structures can be tuned from positive to negative and can reach a minimal value of -0.958. Good agreement was found between the experimental results and the simulation. This lattice structure is considerably stiffer than re-entrant negative Poisson's ratio foam with the same solid phase. The design concept developed here can be optimized for specific applications via geometric parameters manipulation.

AB Auxetic materials exhibit a negative Poisson's ratio. Herein, the performance of rectangular auxetic membranes, under uniform load, is evaluated in terms of the maximum stress encountered. To facilitate convenient calculation, empirical modeling is conducted on the exact solution to reproduce displacement coefficients that are sufficiently accurate. A dimensionless maximum stress is then introduced to allow the effect from the membrane's Poisson's ratio and aspect ratio to be directly observed. Results reveal that 1) the dimensionless maximum stress reduces monotonically and nonmonotonically for conventional and auxetic membranes, respectively, 2) for the same Poisson's ratio magnitude the stresses in auxetic membranes are lower than those from conventional ones, 3) the optimal Poisson's ratio, on the basis of dimensionless maximum stress minimization, falls within the negative range, and 4) the dimensionless maximum stress minimization is especially effective for square membranes as well as very long and narrow membranes. It is therefore recommended that material auxeticity be taken into account-alongside geometrical and other material properties-in designing membranes and highly compliant very thin plates.

AB Auxetic materials have previously been shown to enhance various performances due to its unusual property of becoming fatter when uniaxially stretched and thinner when uniaxially compressed (i.e., the materials exhibit a negative Poisson's ratio). The current study focuses on assessing the potential of an auxetic material to enhance the buckling capacity of a rectangular plate under uniaxial compression. The in-plane translational restraint along the unloaded edges that was often neglected in open literature is taken into consideration in our buckling model proposed in this study. The closed-form expressions for the critical buckling coefficient of the rectangle are provided and the predicted results agree well with those determined by the finite element method. Furthermore, the results indicate that the buckling performance of a rectangular plate under uniaxial compression can be significantly improved by replacing the traditional material that has a positive Poisson's ratio with an auxetic material when there is in-plane translation restraint along the unloaded edges.

AB Here, we demonstrate that the Young's modulus (E) and Poisson's ratio (nu) are not only material-dependent but also size-dependent. The interplay between the size dependence of E and nu and the dispersion characteristics of the material is revealed. An experimental approach is developed to capture the size-dependence of E and nu based on material's dispersion characteristics. This experimental approach is supported by a theoretical approach, which implements a nonlocal model with two independent nonlocal fields. A unique material dispersion parameter (R) that measures the contrast between the material dispersions in longitudinal and transverse directions is developed. This parameter is used to scale the size-dependence of E and nu of various monocrystals and define the conditions of the material stability. It is revealed that the material is stable with positive stiffnesses when 0 < R < 0.865. When R > 0.865, the material possesses a negative bulk modulus, and it is yet stable if it is constrained. The material is unstable when R is imaginary. The material is auxetic (with a negative Poisson's ratio) only when 0.7 < R < 1. The implementations of the two approaches to Ag, Au, Cu, Pt, and Si monocrystals highlight that values of E and nu strongly depend on the material's size and the contrast between its longitudinal and transverse dispersions.

ID ELASTIC-CONSTANTS
AB In the present work, a novel design is presented for producing auxetic laminated faceplates for structures that contain auxetic cores in order to produce fully auxetic sandwich structures. The design is based on the use of periodic cellular networks that are embedded in a fibre-reinforced polymer matrix. These networks have a high in-plane negative Poisson's ratio and a high in-plane stiffness. Two auxetic networks were chosen for this purpose: a classical re-entrant hexagonal network and an anti-tetra chiral auxetic network. The finite elements method was used to model the auxetic network and the faceplate. For the auxetic network, the relative modulus (E-s/E-m) was investigated to determine its effect on the behaviour of the faceplate. The auxetic behaviour of the faceplate occurs when the auxetic network has a high relative modulus. For example, for a classical re-entrant hexagonal network faceplate, the auxetic behaviour starts to appear when E-s/E-m>33, while for an anti-tetra chiral auxetic network faceplate, the auxetic behaviour starts to appear when E-s/E-m>24. Analytical expressions for the elastic constants of the faceplates were developed using the representative volume element model (RVE) and a semi-empirical formula of the rule of mixtures (ROMs). The results of the analytical expressions were compared with the finite elements results for various values of the relative density parameter rho(*). The relative density had a significant effect on the elastic constants of the faceplate. The model produced with the representative volume element method had higher values for the elastic constants than did that created with the finite elements model, but the semi-empirical rule of mixtures gave more accurate results for both types of faceplates. A modified design for the classical re-entrant hexagonal network that increases the in-plane stiffness of the auxetic network is presented since it has been found that it plays a major role in producing a high negative Poisson's ratio. The modified networks are an oval re-entered and a stiffened re-entered network. Experiments were carried out on the oval re-entered faceplates to obtain the in-plane moduli and the Poisson's ratios. The tested faceplate samples clearly showed auxetic behaviour. A good agreement between the finite elements results and the experimental data was obtained.

AB A new cellular vehicle body structure (Negative Poisson's Ratio vehicle body structure) with negative Poisson's ratio and enhanced strength is presented in this study. Due to high shear strength and Young's modulus increment rate, the vehicle body made of this structure shows lower mass and higher performance. By developing a theoretical analytical model and a finite element analysis (FEA) model of Negative Poisson's Ratio (NPR) structure cell, the effect of relative density and topological structure on the linear and nonlinear properties is studied. A compressive experiment using a 3*3 NPR structure sample made of ABS material was developed. The experimental results concluded that NPR structure possesses the negative Poisson's (between 0 and -1) and enhanced strength under in-plane compression, which provide theoretical significance on developing lightweight vehicle body.

AB Auxetic materials, known with negative Poisson's ratio, are highly desirable for many advanced applications, but the candidates are rather scarce, especially at low dimension. Motivated by the re-entrant structure that often exposes negative Poisson's ratio, we predict a two-dimensional (2D) planar B4N monolayer as a promising auxetic material with unusual in-plane negative Poisson's ratio within the framework of density functional theory calculations. B4N monolayer also exhibits a highly emerged mechanical anisotropy, characterized by Young's modulus and Poissons ratio. In addition, this monolayer shows superior mechanical flexibility in ideal tensile strength and critical strain values. The phonon dispersion calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations further demonstrate that this monolayer also owns excellent dynamical and thermal stabilities. The fantastic mechanical properties coupled with robust structural stability render the auxetic B4N monolayer promising for future nanomechanical devices.

AB Developing two-dimensional multifunctional materials is highly desirable for nanoscale device applications. Herein, by means of first-principles calculations, we demonstrate a promising two-dimensional multifunctional semiconductor with ferroelectricity, ultrahigh carrier mobility, and negative Poisson's ratio in single-layer BI. We show that single-layer BI exhibits intrinsic ferroelectricity, derived from its asymmetric structure, and the ferroelectricity features an in-plane electric polarization as large as 3.3 x 10(-10)C(m-1), which is beneficial for nonvolatile memories. Owing to its large band dispersion, single-layer BI is also found to harbor an extremely high carrier mobility (1.17 x 10(5) cm(2)V(-1)s(-1)), even comparable to that of graphene, suggesting its potential for high-performance electronics and bulk photo-voltaic effect. This, combined with the moderate band gap, renders single-layer BI with a high absorption coefficient (10(5)cm(m-1)) from near-infrared to ultraviolet light. In addition, we unveil that single-layer BI is a long-sought-after auxetic material with a negative Poisson's ratio of -0.31. All of these findings make single-layer BI a compelling multifunctional material, offering a versatile platform for diverse nanoscale devices applications.

AB We proposed a strategy to transform a cell shape from convex to concave via viscoelastic compression in order to reverse the Poisson's ratio of biomass foam to be negative and improve its properties in compression and shockproof. The poly(butylene succinate) (PBS) foam with a negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) was prepared; the Poisson's ratio reached -0.7, and the compressive modulus increased by 359%. In the shockproof field, the storage and loss modulus could increase by ca. 270% and 350%, respectively. Such a method of viscoelastic compression can be universal for the reinforcement of biomass foam materials.

AB A physically nonlinear constitutive equation with four arbitrary material functions for isotropic rheonomic materials is studied to determine the rheological effects simulated by it and the spheres of influence of the material functions. The properties of the volumetric, axial, and lateral creep curves generated by this equation and the dependence of the lateral strain coefficient (Poisson's ratio) on the material functions, time, and stress during creep are analytically investigated. A general exact estimate of the upper and lower bounds of the Poisson's ratio and criteria of its negativeness, increase, decrease, and constancy are obtained. The Poisson's ratio of the model is proved not to be a nonmonotonic function of time.

AB The theory of elasticity predicts a variety of phenomena associated with solids that possess a negative Poisson's ratio. The fabrication of metamaterials with a 'designed' microstructure that exhibit a Poisson's ratio approaching the thermodynamic limits of 1/2 and -1 increases the likelihood of realising these phenomena for applications. In this work, we investigate the properties of a layered composite, with alternating layers of materials with negative and positive Poisson's ratio approaching the thermodynamic limits. Using the finite element method to simulate uniaxial loading and indentation of a free standing composite, we observed an increase in the resistance to mechanical deformation above the average value of the two materials. Even though the greatest increase in stiffness is gained as the thermodynamic limits are approached, a significant amount of added stiffness can be attained, provided that the Young's modulus of the negative Poisson's ratio material is not less than that of the positive Poisson's ratio material.

AB Systematic and deep understanding of mechanical properties of the negative Poisson's ratio convex-concave foams plays a very important role for their practical engineering applications. However, in the open literature, only a negative Poisson's ratio effect of the metamaterials convex-concave foams is simply mentioned. In this paper, through the experimental and finite element methods, effects of geometrical morphology on elastic moduli, energy absorption, and damage properties of the convex-concave foams are systematically studied. Results show that negative Poisson's ratio, energy absorption, and damage properties of the convex-concave foams could be tuned simultaneously through adjusting the chord height to span ratio of the sine-shaped cell edges. By the rational design of the negative Poisson's ratio, when compared to the conventional open-cell foams of equal mass, convex-concave foams could have the combined advantages of relative high stiffness and strength, enhanced energy absorption and damage resistance. The research of this paper provides theoretical foundations for optimization design of the mechanical properties of the convex-concave foams and thus could facilitate their practical applications in the engineering fields.

AB A chiral structure with a negative Poisson's ratio containing a hollow circle with varying diameters was designed, and the finite element method was used to investigate the variation in the Poisson's ratio when the hollow circle diameter was varied (d = 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 mm). The simulation results showed that the Poisson's ratio was sensitive to the hollow circle diameter, and the minimum Poisson's ratio was -0.43. Three specimens with different hollow circle diameters (d ' = 0, 1, and 3 mm) were 3D-printed from thermoplastic polyurethane, and the Poisson's ratio and equivalent elastic modulus were measured. In the elastic range, the Poisson's ratio increased and the equivalent elastic modulus decreased as the hollow circle diameter increased. The simulation and experimental results showed good agreement. The proposed structure is expected to be applicable to protective sports gear owing to its high energy absorption and the fact that its properties can be modified as required by adjusting the geometric parameters of the unit cell.

AB Based on the butterfly pattern structure and the star-shaped honeycomb structure, a novel auxetic butterfly-shaped honeycomb structure (BSH) was constructed, which realized the coupling improvement of negative Poisson's ratio and in-plane stiffness. Under uniaxial tension, the equivalent elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio of the BSH structure were derived by the energy method. The relationship between Poisson's ratio and structural parameters of the BSH structure was discussed to optimize the structural parameters by numerical analysis. Poisson's ratio and relative elastic modulus were taken as the objective function groups. The Pareto solution set was obtained by the Gamultiobj multi-objective genetic algorithm method. The Pareto solution set was sorted based on the entropy-weight TOPSIS method, and the optimal solution was selected as the solution of the novel structure optimization design. The correctness of the theoretical results was verified by the finite element analysis and experiment results. Furthermore, compared with the traditional re-entrant hexagonal honeycomb structure and the star-shaped honeycomb structure, the relative elastic modulus and auxetic effect of the BSH structure were greatly improved, and the stiffness of the novel structure was improved while maintaining a high auxetic effect.

AB Solids that possess negative Poisson's ratio are termed auxetic materials. This article considers the effect of auxeticity, i.e., the negative extent of Poisson's ratio on thermal stresses in plates, shells, and other solids. Results show that in cases where temperature gradient is in the through-thickness of a fully-clamped plate or when the temperature gradient is in the radial direction of fully-clamped shells, the thermal stresses can be significantly reduced by using auxetic materials. The same result applies to spheres and cylinders with radial temperature gradient. The maximum thermal stress is minimized if the selected material possesses Poisson's ratio of -1. However, the use of auxetic material is not always advantageous, nor does the use of materials with Poisson's ratio of -1 always minimize the maximum thermal stresses. It is herein suggested that, in addition to the use of materials with lower modulus and lower coefficient of thermal expansion, the use of auxetic materials offers an alternative route for lowering thermal stresses in some cases.

TI Expanded polytetrafluoroethylene as an auxetic material: effect of

AB The effect of extension ratio on the structure and property of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) has been decisively studied. ePTFE is unique with its porous fibrillar network structure connected by nodes and also with its degree of orientation which increases with increases in extension ratio. It is found that the Poisson's ratio of ePTFE is negative, and it is reduced dramatically with increased extension ratio. At the extension ratio of 30, the Poisson's ratio reaches - 10.00. By changes of extension ratio from 1 to 10, the segmental mobility of polymer chains becomes harder, and the dynamic glass transition temperature (T-g) is increased. Broad glass transition regions are revealed in tan delta versus temperature curves in polytetrafluoroethylene specimens stretched 20-(S20) and 30-fold (S30). As the extension ratio is increased, the thermal conductivity of the specimens is decreased. The thermal conductivity coefficient is dropped to 0.051 W m(-1) K owing to the appearance of more pores and low degree of crystallinity at higher extension ratio. The properties of ePTFE modified by carbonyl iron powder (CIP) have been investigated. CIP has affected the structure and properties of modified ePTFE. CIP-modified ePTFE also exhibits a negative Poisson's ratio which is larger than ePTFE at the same extension ratio. The modified ePTFE reveals higher thermal conductivity coefficient than ePTFE itself.

AB The engineering materials and structures, which usually suffer both temperature variation and mechanical loading, motivate the urgent need of the multifunctional metamaterials with simultaneously programmable coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) and Poisson's ratio (PR). Whereas, the current 3D metamaterials can not continuously program the CTE and PR. Herein, a class of 3D metamaterial is originally devised by an exclusive geometrical methodology. The explicit expressions of the CTE and PR are theoretically established and are also verified by the numerical modeling. The analysis confirms that the CTE can be widely tailored by varying the geometrical parameters and selection of the constituents. Besides, the controllable PR can be also easily obtained by adjusting the geometrical parameters. Moreover, the devised 3D metamaterial gives paired tailorable CTE and controllable PR, including especially negative CTE + negative PR. An arrangement rule is developed to construct a series of hierarchical cells which can program CTE and PR in multi principle axes and can be periodically arrayed for obtaining the 3D cellular metamaterials. The devised 3D metamaterials are capable of realizing the widely coupled programmability of both CTE and PR and provide a strategy of shape morphing stimulated both by temperature variation and mechanical loading.

AB An exploration by analytical method has been made herein for a mechanism-based structure that involves a two-dimensional array of rings and a three-dimensional array of double-rings, with short fixed rods and long sliding rods attached at the outer and inner surfaces of the rings, respectively. Based on the theory of thin rings, effective Poisson's ratio and effective coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) models have been obtained for single-ring structures, pole-loaded double-ring structures, and equator-loaded double-ring structures. Results establish a very strong correlation between these effective properties with the ring radius and rod lengths. In addition, the analysis of four of the double-ring structures reveals that the sign of Poisson's ratio is dependent on the direction of loading. An example application is demonstrated herein in which positive thermal expansion rings, used in conjunction with rigid rods, enable the design of an overall zero thermal expansion structure (i.e., minimal thermal stress) with tunable negative thermal expansion internal microstructure for use as sieve. Finally, it is herein shown that, by judicious positioning of the short fixed rods and/or long sliding rods, one may possibly obtain various combinations of positive and negative CTEs with positive and negative Poisson's ratio.

AB Biophysical properties of the scaffolds such as the elastic modulus, have been recently shown to impact stem cell lineage commitment. On the other hand, the contribution of the Poisson's ratio, another important biophysical property, to the stem cell fate decision, has not been studied. Scaffolds with tunable Poisson's ratio (v) (termed as auxetic scaffolds when Poisson's ratio is zero or negative) are anticipated to provide a spectrum of unique biophysical 3-D microenvironments to influence stem cell fate. To test this hypothesis, in the present work we fabricated auxetic polyurethane scaffolds (v = 0 to -0.45) and evaluated their effects on neural differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). Compared to the regular scaffolds (v = +0.30) before auxetic conversion, the auxetic scaffolds supported smaller aggregate formation and higher expression of beta-tubulin III upon neural differentiation. The influences of pore structure, Poisson's ratio, and elastic modulus on neural lineage commitment were further evaluated using a series of auxetic scaffolds. The results indicate that Poisson's ratio may confound the effects of elastic modulus, and auxetic scaffolds with proper pore structure and Poisson's ratio enhance neural differentiation. This study demonstrates that tuning the Poisson's ratio of the scaffolds together with elastic modulus and microstructure would enhance the capability to generate broader, more diversified ranges of biophysical 3-D microenvironments for the modulation of cellular differentiation.
   Statement of Significance
   Biophysical signaling from the substrates and scaffolds plays a critical role in neural lineage commitment of pluripotent stem cells. While the contribution of elastic modulus has been well studied, the influence of Poisson's ratio along with microstructure of the scaffolds remains unknown largely due to the lack of technology to produce materials with tailorable Poisson's ratio. This study fabricated auxetic polyurethane scaffolds with different elastic modulus, Poisson's ratio and microstructure and evaluated neural differentiation of pluripotent stem cells. The findings add a novel angle to understand the impact of biophysical microenvironment on stem cell fate decisions. (C) 2016 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Traditional three dimensional (3D) block auxetics exhibit anisotropic cross-section changes even they exist in isotropic forms due to finite size and boundary effect. Herein, a systematic design strategy of axisymmetric aux-etic metamaterials is proposed with rotationally symmetric transverse deformation mode. The axisymmetric auxetics are obtained by the revolution of two-dimensional curved auxetic configurations along the axis of rota-tion and composed with shell elements. Finite element simulations and mechanical experiments reveal that the axisymmetric deformation mechanism cause transversely isotropic negative Poisson's ratio and enhance the specific Young's modulus compared to corresponding 2D and 3D cellular structures. The influence of geometric parameters on elastic constants is investigated numerically. Three kinds of 3D printing technologies are adopted to fabricate the axisymmetric auxetics which shows the relative Young's modulus and equivalent Poisson's ratio are independent of constitute materials. This study systematically characterizes the mechanical responses of axisymmetric auxetic metamaterials and expounds the potential multifunctional applications, such as reusable energy absorption.

AB The study of physical and mechanical properties can shed light on the picture of martensitic transitions in materials that control the unique effects of shape memory and superelasticity. Martensitic transformations in metals and alloys are based on shear-type deformation processes, so the study of their elastic behavior contains important information about the nature and mechanisms of these phase transitions. In this report, we analyze the value and relationship between the degree of elastic anisotropy and the Poisson's ratio of Ti-Ni alloy crystals based on our own and literature data obtained experimentally and computationally from the first principles. A significant variability of the elastic anisotropy coefficient A of Ti-Ni crystals was established, which is due to the apparently elastic "softening" of the alloy lattice on the eve of martensitic transformations (especially the constant c44). The minimum Poisson's ratio of Ti-Ni crystals is -0.25. The maximum value of mu was 1.10, which is higher than the theoretical limit for polycrystals. Extreme values of mu were achieved for directions when the stretch is oriented along the direction < 110 >, i. e. diagonals of the cube face. The mean <mu > was found to be 0.41. Ti-Ni based alloys can be considered as partial auxetic - materials with negative Poisson's ratio in some directions, that is, have mu < 0 when choosing some directions and be an ordinary material with positive mu for other directions. The elastic anisotropy of Ti-Ni crystals can be determined based on the numerical differences in the extreme values of mu as A(mu) = |mu(ma)x-mu(min)|/<mu >. A strong correlation was established between the elastic anisotropy coefficient A and the factor A(mu) (the correlation coefficient 0.9871). The parameters of the linear dependence of the reduced anisotropy factor A(mu)(*) =1.33779A(mu) + 0.18542, for which A(mu)(*) = A.

AB The Poisson's ratios of re-entrant Cu foams with different initial relative densities were studied by resonant ultrasound spectroscopy (RUS). Slight anisotropy in foam was detected by RUS and removed by a small unidirectional compression. The transformation into the re-entrant foam was accomplished by applying a sequence of permanent triaxial compression deformations. The Poisson's ratio first decreases and then increases with increasing compression strain. A minimum in Poisson's ratio of approximately -0.7 for all initial densities was achieved with an appropriate permanent compression strain, compared with -0.6 at similar density determined earlier via optical methods. Foams with higher values of initial density attained minima in Poisson's ratio at lower permanent volumetric compression. The shear modulus increased with increasing volumetric compression ratio, and showed a small hump near the point corresponding to Poisson's ratio minimum.

AB A simple two-dimensional model for the deformation of auxetic microporous polymers (those with a negative Poisson's ratio) has been developed. This model network of rectangular nodules interconnected by fibrils has been further developed to include the possibilities of fibril hinging, flexure and stretching. Expressions for strain-dependent Poisson's ratio and Young's modulus have been derived and compared with experimental results on microporous PTFE and UHMWPE. A combination of the hinging mode followed by the stretching mode of deformation can be used to explain the general features of the experimental data for these auxetic polymers. The force coefficients governing the different modes of deformation are dependent on fibril dimensions and intrinsic material properties. By varying the geometry of the network, the model can be used to predict different combinations of Poisson's ratio with modulus, from large positive through to large negative values.

ID DESIGN; MANUFACTURE; BEHAVIOR
AB Two sets of carbon fibre laminate configurations have been designed manufactured and examined. The first consisted of one in plane auxetic (i.e. having a negative Poisson's ratio) and one with matched elastic moduli, but a positive in-plane Poisson's ratio. The second consisted of three laminate again with matched elastic moduli but with negative, near zero and positive thru-thickness Poisson's ratio. Fracture toughness is predicted to be enhanced if a negative thru-thickness Poisson's ratio is present. This study also shows that more energy is required to propagate a crack in the auxetic laminate and that is less notch sensitive than its conventional counterpart for the negative in-plane Poisson's ratio.

AB Conventional honeycomb structures show positive Poisson's ratio under in-plane loading while Auxetic honeycombs show negative Poisson's ratio. Accordion, Hybrid and Semi re-entrant honeycomb structures show zero Poisson's ratio, i.e. they show zero or negligible deformation in lateral direction under longitudinal loadings. In this paper an PEA analysis of these three types of structures is made using commercial software ANSYS(R) 14 using 8 node 281 shell elements. Cell wall thickness and cell angle is varied to analyze their effect on elastic modulus E-x and global strains along X direction under X-direction loadings. E-y is also analyzed to measure lateral stiffness and deformation behavior of structure for its potential application as flexures.

AB A stiff tubular cellular structure topology is designed by alternatively indenting rectangular contour patterns on the cell ribs. Modified topologies can be obtained by tailoring the geometric parameters. The Poisson's ratios and elastic moduli of the proposed tubular structures with various geometric parameters are determined using finite element method (FEM). Results show that the minimum Poisson's ratio of the proposed structures can reach -0.28. The unit cell topology and orientation can significantly affect the structures deformation behaviors. The structures exhibit mixed mode of bending- and stretching-dominated deformation responses, and show improved specific elastic moduli compared with traditional open-cell stochastic foams with positive Poisson's ratios. 3D-printed samples with identical geometric variables to those of the FE models are fabricated, and their Poisson's ratios and stress-strain relationships are determined experimentally, and compared with simulation results. Excellent agreement is achieved between measurements and simulations. The design concept proposed here can be optimized for specific applications via geometric parameters manipulation.

AB The article provides a brief overview of studies on crystalline materials with negative Poisson's ratio (crystalline auxetics) with cubic anisotropy. It has been demonstrated that 1/4 part of all cubic crystals has auxetic properties. Even more auxetics are found among chiral nano/microtubes with cubic cylindrical anisotropy. It has been established that chiral nano/microtubes made of cubic crystals exhibit linear Poynting's effect under torsion, in contrast to the known nonlinear effect for isotropic materials. In the case of longitudinal tension of two-layered composites, it is shown that Voigt's rule of mixtures is violated in the presence of a layer of auxetic materials.

AB 3D random Vonoroi structures with negative Poisson's ratio have been proposed and created numerically via finite element method using Voronoi tessellation technique. Negative Poisson's ratio is achieved via triaxial compression treatment on the Voronoi models generated using Matlab. The Poisson's ratio and energy absorption capacity of the triaxially compressed structures have been studied as a function of the geometrical irregularity beta and the triaxial compression ratio eta in a uniaxial compression setup. Results show that the Poisson's ratio of the structures rapidly decreases from positive to negative and achieved a minimum with an increasing triaxial compression ratio eta. The Poisson's ratio exhibited slight increase and quickly saturated with further increase of the triaxial compression ratio eta. A minimum nu(yz) of -0.366 is achieved when beta = 0.3 and eta = 20%; whereas, a minimum nu(xz) of -0.347 is achieved when beta = 0.1 and eta = 10%. The energy absorption capacity of the structure with a specific initial irregularity factor beta decreases with an increasing eta. For a specific eta, structures with the maximum initial irregularity factor beta exhibited the highest energy absorption capacity. A maximum energy absorption capacity is achieved in the model with an initial irregularity factor beta of 0.7 and a triaxial compression ratio eta of 10%.

AB Based on the bi-material triangle lattice cell, a new cellular structure, bi-material re-entrant triangle (BRT) cellular structure, is devised to incorporate tailorable coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) and tunable Poisson's ratio (PR) properties by replacing the straight base of a triangle with two hypotenuse members. A general thermoelasticity equation to systematically build the relationship among the external force, the temperature load, and the deformation for planar lattice structures with bounded joints is derived and then embedded into a theoretical model for the devised BRT structure. Using assembled thermoelasticity equation, effective PR, Young's modulus, as well as CTE are computed. In order to guide designers to construct initial concepts, the design domain for coupling negative CTE and negative PR properties is plotted. The material-property-combination region that can be achieved by this cellular structure is determined within an Ashby material selection chart of CTE versus PR. Nine available combinations of CTE and PR properties are extracted and demonstrated with ABAQUS simulation.

ID MICROPOROUS MATERIALS; AUXETIC POLYETHYLENE
AB The Poisson's ratio of a material is strictly defined only for small strain linear elastic behavior. In practice, engineering strains are often used to calculate Poisson's ratio in place of the mathematically correct true strains with only very small differences resulting in the case of many engineering materials. The engineering strain definition is often used even in the inelastic region, for example, in metals during plastic yielding. However, for highly nonlinear elastic materials, such as many biomaterials, smart materials and microstructured materials, this convenient extension may be misleading, and it becomes advantageous to define a strain-varying Poisson's function. This is analogous to the use of a tangent modulus for stiffness. An important recent application of such a Poisson's function is that of auxetic materials that demonstrate a negative Poisson's ratio and are often highly strain dependent. In this paper, the importance of the use of a Poisson's function in appropriate circumstances is demonstrated. Interpretation methods for coping with error-sensitive data or small strains are also described.

AB Open-cell auxetic foams have shown potential for use in sporting and other protective equipment. Previous conversion methods for auxetic closed-cell foam used a bespoke pressure vessel. This work expands upon a recent method, using steam absorption followed by cooling and condensation, to change the cell shape of closed-cell foam to impart a negative Poisson's ratio. Aiming to present a simple, repeatable conversion method, foam samples (20 x 10 x 100 mm) floating in water-filled (similar to 20 degrees C), covered ceramic containers (300 x 200 x 100 mm) were heated in an oven at 105 degrees C for between 1 and 6.5 hrs. Based on the results for these smaller samples, a larger sample of foam (30 x 100 x 100 mm) was also converted, with a steaming time of 8 hrs. The final volume ratio (original/final volume) increased with heating time, up to a maximum of 4.6. The amount and angle of re-entrant (inward-folding) cell walls increased with the final volume ratio as cells contracted further, as evidenced by micro-computed tomography. Poisson's ratios, measured using digital image correlation, were as low as -0.3 in tension and -1.1 in compression. The tensile Young's modulus increased from similar to 2 up to similar to 6 MPa with the final volume ratio and the compressive Young's modulus reduced from similar to 1.5 MPa for low values of the final volume ratio between one and three and then remained close to 1.5 MPa.

AB This study presents the electromechanical properties of the 3-3 piezoelectric metamaterial based on variants of honeycomb (HC) structure. Three kinds of three-dimensional (3D) elastically anisotropic and piezoelectrically active HC structures were introduced, namely, conventional HC (3D-CHC), a re-entrant HC (3D-RE) and a semi re-entrant HC (3D-SRE). Highly porous 3D finite element models of the mentioned three kinds of metamaterials were developed and the role of ligament orientation on their effective elastic, piezoelectric and dielectric properties was completely characterized. The intrinsic symmetry of HC structure was utilized and simplified mixed boundary conditions equivalent to periodic boundary conditions were recognized. In comparison to their bulk constituent, all the 3-3 type piezoelectric HC networks exhibited an enhanced response, especially for the longitudinal poling. The normalized figures of merit show a mild dependence on the angle theta and the underlying deformation mechanisms associated with the zero, positive and negative Poisson's ratios. Figures of merit such as hydrostatic strain coefficient (d(h)), the hydrostatic figure of merit (d(h).g(h)) and the acoustic impedance (Z) reached their best values at small angles, i.e., theta = 30 degrees. Longitudinally poled networks exhibited four order of magnitude increase in their hydrostatic figure of merit (foam to solid ratio > 10,000) and one order of magnitude decrease in the acoustic impedance indicating their applicability for the design of hydrophones.

In certain biological applications, scaffolds with a tunable Poisson's ratio may be more suitable for emulating the behavior of native tissue mechanics. Here, we design and fabricate a scaffold, which exhibits simultaneous negative and positive Poisson's ratio behavior. Custom-made digital micro-mirror device stereolithography was used to fabricate single- and multiple-layer scaffolds using polyethylene glycol-based biomaterial. These scaffolds are composed of pore structures having special geometries, and deformation mechanisms, which can be tuned to exhibit both negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) and positive Poisson's ratio (PPR) behavior in a side-to-side or top-to-bottom configuration. Strain measurement results demonstrate that analytical deformation models and simulations accurately predict the Poisson's ratios of both the NPR and PPR regions. This hybrid Poisson's ratio property can be imparted to any photocurable material, and potentially be applicable in a variety of biomedical applications. (C) 2012 Acta Materialia Inc.

AB In this paper, we report a new multi-scale NPR composite based on auxetic fabric/elastomer matrix (AF/EM) composite structure. The multi-scale AF was obtained via using helical auxetic yarn (HAY) as weft yarns and constructing re-entrant hexagonal (REH) geometry structure on the macro scale, then the AF was combined with EM to fabricate the auxetic composite (AC). The AF and AC exhibit the NPR of - 1.492 and - 0.379. Simultaneously, high tensile strain over 108% (AF) and 82% (AC) can be subjected, indicating good mechanical performance. The superior performance of the AC is its ability to maintain NPR and resilience, with elastic recovery ratio over 94% and work recovery coefficient with a stable value over 80% after 10 cycles. Also, the damping properties results further evidence the good elasticity of our AC. The paper shows that our AF and AC are promising candidates in protective composites.

AB This work analyses shear moduli of conventional and auxetic open-cell polymer foams. Shear moduli are i) measured directly and ii) calculated by applying elasticity theory for isotropic solid materials, using Young's moduli and Poisson's ratios from compression tests. Zero and negative Poisson's ratio foams are fabricated from conventional foams using a thermo-mechanical process. Fabricated and conventional foams are compression tested in three orthogonal directions, up to densification at similar to 60% compression, with full-field strain measurements obtained using Digital Image Correlation. Compression testing is followed by shear testing. The measured shear moduli vary from 16 +/- 7 kPa for negative Poisson's ratio foams to 38 +/- 2 kPa for zero Poisson?s ratio foams, with conventional foams in between with a mean value of 32 +/- 8 kPa. The calculated shear moduli are typically lower than the measured values. The results suggest that the application of elasticity theory to calculate the low strain shear modulus of open-cell foam from Young's modulus and Poisson?s ratio measured in compression tests is appropriate if the foam is isotropic.

AB In this paper, we study the effective thermo-elastic properties of hybrid materials containing layered auxetic microstructures. We consider three types of arrangements: (1) hybrids with randomly distributed plate-like inclusions possessing the negative Poisson's ratio and negative thermal expansion coefficient, (2) sandwich structures with auxetic cores and (3) laminates with randomly arranged and ordered auxetic and negative thermal expansion layers. We evaluate the effective characteristics of these hybrids by analysing representative volume elements using the finite element method. We observe that the plate-like auxetic inclusions increase the effective stiffness of the hybrid. This stiffening effect was previously reported for spherical and cubic auxetic inclusions and is further investigated in this study. We demonstrate that the aspect ratio of the plate-like shapes has strong influence on this stiffening effect the decrease in the aspect ratio reduces stiffening in the direction parallel to the layers and enhances it in the direction perpendicular to them. In the auxetic laminates, the stiffening effect strengths with the increase in the number of auxetic layers. We also show that thinner inclusions provide lower effective linear coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) in the direction parallel to the layering and higher effective CTE in the direction perpendicular to it.

AB Materials presenting a negative Poisson's ratio (auxetics) have drawn attention for the past two decades, especially in the field of lightweight composite structures and cellular media. Studies have shown that auxeticity may result in higher shear modulus, indentation toughness and acoustic damping. In this work, three auxetic periodic microstructures based on 2D geometries are considered for being used as sandwich-core materials. Elastic moduli are computed for each microstructure by using finite elements combined with periodic homogenization technique. Anisotropy of elastic properties is investigated in and out-of-plane. Comparison is made between auxetics and the classical honeycomb cell. A new 3D auxetic lattice is proposed for volumic applications. Cylindrical and spherical elastic indentation tests are simulated in order to conclude on the applicability of such materials to structures. Proof is made that under certain conditions, auxetics can be competitive with honeycomb cells in terms of indentation strength. Their relatively soft response in tension can be compensated, in some situations, by high shear moduli.

AB In this paper, a novel three-dimensional (3D) unit cell structure with butterfly-like perforations was designed, and negative Poisson's ratio and tunable stiffness were achieved in such a geometry. The Poisson's ratio and strain-stress relationship of structures with different geometric parameters were determined using the finite element method (FEM). Samples with identical geometric variables to those of finite element models were fabricated via 3D printing technique, and their Poisson's ratios and stress-strain relationships were experimentally determined and compared with the FEM results. Results showed that the proposed 3D cellular structures exhibit negative Poisson's ratios, and a minimal value of -0.7091 could be reached. The stress-strain curve of each structure exhibited three distinct stages (elastic response, rib buckling and self-contact), with different elastic moduli being observed at each stage, and demonstrated a tunable range of the compressive stiffness ratio between stages varying from 0.1866 to 1.4006(tunable stiffness), as determined by FEM analysis. Good agreement was found between the experimental results and FEM predictions. The design concept can be implemented and optimized for specific applications via geometric parameters manipulation.

AB Composite materials containing negative-stiffness inclusions embedded in positive-stiffness matrix may exhibit unconventional (anomalous) effective coupled-field properties through interactions of the two phases. Effective coupled-field properties are calculated with the finite element methods under the quasi-static assumption. Stability boundaries are determined by applying 10Hz sinusoidal loading on boundary surfaces, and the system is unstable if its energy becomes divergent for a chosen inclusion Young's modulus ratio ((E)) or bulk modulus ratio ((K)). Effective viscoelastic properties and their stability are studied for negative (E) at 10Hz, while the Poisson's ratio of the purely elastic inclusion is kept constant. For small inclusion volume fractions, their stability boundary is at (E)approximate to-0.3, and extreme large effective damping and viscoelastic modulus are in the unstable regime. Furthermore, in the viscoelastic case, inclusion shapes have no effects on stability. As for the effective coupled-field properties, all anomalous peaks are in the unstable regime for negative (E) or (K), except for an anomalous peak in effective thermal expansion coefficient with electrically insulated inclusions. Insulated inclusions may cause charge accumulation at the inclusion-matrix interface and boundary surface effects may serve as stabilizing agents to the composite system.

AB Examples of auxetic fused fibrous assemblies can be found among both natural and synthetic materials. In theory, fibrous network materials can exhibit negative Poisson's ratios, yet the deformation mechanisms and parameters which give rise to a negative Poisson's ratio in disordered fibrous materials are not well understood, and this class of auxetic materials remains largely under-explored. The potential applications of auxetic fibre networks include their use as reinforcement in composites. The process of embedding auxetic random fibrous networks in a polymer matrix is an attractive alternate route to the manufacture of auxetic composites; however, before such an approach can be developed, a methodology for designing fibrous networks with the desired negative Poisson's ratios must first be established. This requires an understanding of the factors which bring about negative Poisson's ratios in these materials. In this work, we present a modelling approach to study the auxetic behaviour of compressed fused fibrous networks, Finite element analyses of three-dimensional stochastic fibre networks were performed to gain insight into the effects of parameters such as network anisotropy, network density and degree of network compression on the out-of-plane Poisson's ratio. The simulation results suggest that compression and anisotropy are the critical parameters that give rise to auxetic behaviour in these materials. We comment on the use of this model to inform the design of fibrous auxetic materials across different length scales, and on the feasibility of developing auxetic composites by using auxetic fibrous networks as the reinforcing phase. Preliminary experimental results indicate that this approach is a promising route in the pursuit of negative Poisson's ratio composites. (C) 2009 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB We propose a class of auxetic three-dimensional lattice structures. The elastic microstructure can be designed to have an omnidirectional Poisson's ratio arbitrarily close to the stability limit of -1. The cubic behaviour of the periodic system has been fully characterized; the minimum and maximum Poisson's ratio and the associated principal directions are given as a function of the microstructural parameters.

AB Cellular materials' two important properties-structure and mechanism-can be selectively used for materials design; in particular, they are used to determine the modulus and yield strain. The objective of this study is to gain a better understanding of these two properties and to explore the synthesis of compliant cellular materials (CCMs) with compliant porous structures (CPSs) generated from modified hexagonal honeycombs. An in-plane constitutive CCM model with CPSs of elliptical holes is constructed using the strain energy method, which uses the deformation of hinges around holes and the rotation of links. A finite element (FE) based simulation is conducted to validate the analytical model. The moduli and yield strains of the CCMs with an aluminum alloy are about 4.42 GPa and 0.57% in one direction and about 2.14 MPa and 20.9% in the other direction. CCMs have extremely high positive and negative Poisson's ratios (NPRs) (nu(xy)* similar to +/- 40) due to the large rotation of the link member in the transverse direction caused by an input displacement in the longitudinal direction. A parametric study of CCMs with varying flexure hinge geometries using different porous shapes shows that the hinge shape can control the yield strength and strain but does not affect Poisson's ratio which is mainly influenced by rotation of the link members. The synthesized CPSs can also be used to design a new CCM with a Poisson's ratio of zero using a puzzle-piece CPS assembly. This paper demonstrates that compliant mesostructures can be used for next generation materials design in tailoring mechanical properties such as moduli, strength, strain, and Poisson's ratios.

AB Negative Poisson's ratio (NPR), also known as "auxetic", is a highly desired property in a wide range of future industry applications. By employing molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, metal matrix nanocomposites reinforced by graphene sheets are studied in this paper. In the simulation, single crystal copper with crystal orientation [1 1 0] is selected as the matrix and an embeddedatom method (EAM) potential is used to describe the interaction of copper atoms. An aligned graphene sheet is selected as reinforcement, and a hybrid potential, namely, the Erhart-Albe potential, is used for the interaction between a pair of carbon atoms. The interaction between the carbon atom and copper atom is approximated by the Lennard-Jones (L-J) potential. The simulation results showed that both graphene and copper matrix possess in-plane NPRs. The temperature-dependent mechanical properties of graphene/copper nanocomposites with in-plane NPRs are obtained for the first time.

AB Materials presenting a negative Poisson's ratio (auxetics) have drawn attention for the past two decades, especially in the field of lightweight composite structures and cellular materials. Studies have shown that auxeticity may result in higher shear modulus, fracture toughness and acoustic damping. In this work, three auxetic periodic lattices are considered. Elastic moduli are computed and anisotropy is investigated by the use of finite element method combined with numerical homogenization technique. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB This work presents a novel negative Poisson's ratio honeycomb design composed by two parts (a reentrant hexagonal component and a thin plate part) that provide separate contributions to the in plane and out-of-plane mechanical properties. The re-entrant hexagons provide the in-plane negative Poisson's ratio, the in-plane compliance and the out-of-plane compressive strength, while the thin plate part connecting the re-entrant hexagonal section bears the large out-of-plane flexibility. This "paper focuses on the in-plane mechanical properties of the auxetic cellular structure. Theoretical models related to the in-plane uniaxial tensile modulus, the shear modulus, and the Poisson's ratios have been built and validated using the finite element techniques. The in-plane behavior of the honeycomb has also been investigated against the geometrical parameters of the unit cell using a parametrical analysis. The theoretical and numerical models illustrate good agreement and show the potential of its application in morphing structures. We also provide a benchmark of the auxetic configuration proposed in this work against negative Poisson's ratio topologies from open literature. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB New kinds of entangled materials with an auxetic effect were investigated in terms of fabrication, structural characterization, the measurement of their negative Poisson's ratio and the auxetic mechanism. The maximum negative Poisson's ratio of -1.5 was obtained at about 5% of the engineering strain for the entangled materials with 45% porosity. The auxetic behavior originated from the rotation of the 'slanted coil-springs' structure. A model to formulate the negative Poisson's ratio was proposed based on the slanted coil-spring structure. The initial slanted angle affected the auxetic behavior significantly. As the slanted angle decreased, the negative Poisson's ratio increased. Entangled materials with such an auxetic effect have potential for engineering applications.

TI Unusual anisotropic thermal expansion in multilayer SnSe leads to

SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS

ID PHASE-TRANSITION; CRYSTAL
AB Monolayer SnSe has been predicted to exhibit an unusual anisotropic thermal expansion-when heated, the long lattice parameter contracts, while the short one expands, resulting in a rectangular-to-square-lattice phase transformation at a critical temperature (T-c). Here, we employ density-functional-theory calculations to demonstrate an even more notable thermal-expansion behavior of SnSe from monolayer to bulk. We find that the unusual thermal expansion persists in multilayers, while the coefficients of thermal expansion of different numbers of layers are almost identical. This behavior results from a delicate interplay between the elastic stiffness coefficient and Gruneisen parameters. Finally, we find that the Poisson's ratio of multilayer SnSe, which is positive at T=0 K, gets smaller with increasing temperature and even turns negative, signaling a zero Poisson's ratio at a particular temperature. Overall, the present results provide another perspective in understanding the unusual thermal properties of monochalcogenides.

AB The negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) structures exhibit some unusual but highly useful mechanical properties. In comparison to two-dimensional (2D) NPR structures, less attention has been paid to the studies on threedimensional structures due to the complex manufacturing process. In this paper, based on the twodimensional nonconvex hexagonal cell, a novel three-dimensional (3D) NPR energy-absorbing structure is proposed. According to the beam theory, the equivalent Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio are deduced. Subsequently, numerous finite element (FE) simulations and compression tests were performed and a good agreement was observed among the theoretical results, the numerical simulations, and the experimental results. Moreover, a typical fuselage section of aircraft during a crash landing was considered and the fuselage section with the 3D NPR structure presented in this work showed better energy absorption capacity than the one without the 3D NPR structure.

AB Auxetic means that the material or structure possesses negative Poisson's ratio. Auxetic materials own many fascinating properties due to the negative Poisson's ratio character, such as increased shear modulus, indentation resistance, fracture toughness, energy absorption, porosity/permeability variation with strain, synclastic curvature and so on. Recent years, 3D non-random auxetic cellular structures have attracted considerable interest and become a focus of auxetic material research. Though, due to the complexity of their configuration, to our knowledge, most 3D ordered auxetic cellular structures can only be manufactured by additive manufacturing method. However, additive manufacturing method will introduce some defects to the structures such as rough surface, irregular cross sections, and defects caused by stair stepping effect. Additionally, mass production and cost are also problems for additive manufacturing method, and the materials can be used are also limited by the additive manufacturing equipment.
   In this paper, a novel manufacturing method of one type of 3D auxetic structure will be briefly introduced. For this method, the structure was divided into 2D parts which can be easily manufactured by traditional fabricating methods with high-accuracy. The present manufacturing method will overcome the shortcomings introduced by additive manufacturing methods; in other words, the quality of the structures will be improved compared with additive manufacturing methods. At the same time, it will expand the range of materials that can be used to manufacture 3D auxetic structures. Additionally, this manufacturing method has the potential for mass production and automatic manufacturing while keeps the manufacturing costs at low level. Also, numerical simulation was conducted to simulate the structure's Poisson's ratio, and the negative Poisson's ratio character was successfully demonstrated.

AB Bayoacuten [(2005). J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 117, 3469-3477] described a method for the determination of Young's modulus by measuring the Rayleigh-wave velocity and the ellipticity of Rayleigh waves, and found a peculiar almost linear relation between a non-dimensional quantity connecting Young's modulus, Rayleigh-wave velocity and density, and Poisson's ratio. The analytical reason for this special behavior remained unclear. It is demonstrated here that this behavior is a simple consequence of the mathematical form of the Rayleigh-wave velocity as a function of Poisson's ratio. The consequences for auxetic materials (those materials for which Poisson's ratio is negative) are discussed, as well as the determination of the shear and bulk moduli.

AB In this paper, a two-dimensional quadrilateral cellular structure made from bi-material strips was designed and its thermal, deformation behaviors were studied via experimental, analytical and numerical approaches. It has been shown that the cell shape of the structure can be tuned from convex to concave (or vice versa) and hence the Poisson's ratio from positive to negative (or vice versa) with a change in temperature. At any specific temperature with a non-zero Delta T, the absolute value of the structure's Poisson's ratio decreased rapidly at first with an increasing compression strain epsilon(y) and then more slowly as it approached a constant of approximately 1 when epsilon(y) > 0.1. A maximum absolute value of the Poisson's ratio of approximately 12 was found at epsilon(y) = 0.001 at a 10 degrees C temperature change. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Materials and microstructures with specific configurations are able to have negative Poisson's ratio. This paper proposes a topology optimization methodology of frame structures to design a planar periodic structure that exhibits negative Poisson's ratio. Provided that beam section of each existing member is chosen from a set of some given candidates, we can reduce the topology optimization problem to a mixed-integer linear programming problem. Since the proposed approach treats frame structures and stress constraints are rigorously addressed, the optimal solution contains no hinge region. A heuristic method with local search is used to solve large-scale problems. Numerical examples and fabrication test demonstrate that planar periodic frame structures exhibiting negative Poisson's ratio can be successfully obtained by the proposed method.

AB Materials exhibiting a negative Poisson's ratio (auxetics) have drawn attention for the past two decades, especially in the field of lightweight composite structures and cellular media. Studies have shown that auxeticity may result in higher shear modulus, indentation toughness and acoustic damping. Although elastic properties of such materials have been extensively investigated, the effect of plasticity on auxetic behavior has not been discussed. In particular, does the auxetic character of the material remain while entering the plastic domain? The present work aims at modeling the nonlinear mechanical response of auxetics. Full-field simulations are performed using the finite element method with periodic boundary conditions. Macroscopic modeling of auxetics is attempted using an anisotropic compressible plasticity framework. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB Elastic longitudinal tension of thin two-layered plate composed of materials having positive and negative Poisson's ratios (auxetics and nonauxetics) is considered. Isotropic materials and crystals with cubic fourfold symmetry axis coinciding with the direction of tension are analyzed. The analytical dependences for effective Poisson's ratios of the plates on the ratio of layer thicknesses, Poisson's ratios and Young's moduli ratios of initial joined materials are derived. It was found that effective Poisson's ratio do not follow the rule of mixtures. Violation is particularly essential for the strong initial isotropic auxetics and incompressible isotropic nonauxetics. Derivation of general formulas for effective Poisson's ratios and effective Young's modulus of two -layered plates from cubic crystals is given. The derived formula for effective Young's modulus in the limit of initial isotropic materials coincides with formulas obtained previously in the literature. We show several examples of cubic crystals, auxetics-nonauxetics such that effective Poisson's ratios of two-layered plates may substantially exceed Poisson's ratios of the initial crystals. Effective Young's modulus may also exceed Young's moduli of both initial crystals. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Cellular materials have two important properties: structures and mechanisms. This property enables one to design structures with proper stiffness and flexibility. Recent advance in 3D printing technologies enable engineers to manufacture complex cellular structures. In addition, use of smart materials, e.g., shape memory polymers (SMPs), for 3D printing enables us to construct mesostructures actively responsive to environmental stimuli with a programmable function, which may be termed '4D Printing' referring to additional dimension on time-dependent shape change after 3D printing. The objective of this study is to design and synthesize active reconfigurable cellular materials, which enables the advance of technology on intelligent reconfigurable cellular structures with 4D printing. A two layer hinge of a CPS functions through a programmed thermal expansion mismatch between two layers and shape memory effect of an SMP. Starting with thermo-mechanical constitutive modeling of a compliant porous hinge consisting of laminated elastomer composites, macroscopic behaviors of a reconfigurable compliant porous structure (CPS) will be constructed using the strain energy method. A finite element (FE) based simulation equipped with a user subroutine will be implemented with ABAQUS/Standard to simulate time dependent thermo mechanical behaviors of a CPS.
   The designed CPS with polymers shows an extremely high negative Poisson's ratio-120) and negative thermal expansion coefficient (-2,530 x 10(-6)/C). When programmed with an appropriate thermo-mechanical procedure, the hinge of the CPS bends either in positive and negative sign, which enables to tailor the CPS into desired intermediate and final configurations, ending up with achieving a reconfigurable CPS. This paper demonstrates that actively reconfigurable compliant cellular materials (CCMs) with CPSes can be used for next-generation materials design in terms of tailoring mechanical properties such as modulus, strength, yield strain, Poisson's ratios and thermal expansion coefficient together with programmable characteristics.

AB Elastomer-matrix composites show promise for high Poisson's ratio and negative Poisson's ratio (auxetic) applications due to high orthotropy. There are approximately five orders of magnitude between the axial stiffness of high modulus graphite fibres and the stiffness of low durometer elastomers. Although the maximum Poisson's ratio for isotropic elastomers is 0.5, it is easily shown that inplane Poisson's ratios twice unity can be obtained with a graphite/epoxy angle-ply laminate at 25 degrees. Chou and others have predicted inplane Poisson's ratios greater than 7 for certain cord-rubber combinations. Peel previously predicted inplane Poisson's ratios higher than 32 and less than -60. Preliminary experimental results have produced inplane Poisson's ratios as high as 14. Certain combinations of un-balanced highly orthotropic laminates may also produce inplane negative Poisson's ratios. Inplane Poisson's ratios, experimentally obtained from two laminate configurations with approximately the same axial stiffness are compared. A symmetric, balanced laminate produced an inplane Poisson's ratio of 3.7; while an unbalanced laminate with an equivalent axial stiffness produced an average inplane Poisson's ratio of - 1.5. Certain high and negative Poisson's ratio elastomer-matrix laminates appear to have quasi anti-symmetric relationships about 0 degrees, although laminate designers may consider dual angle-ply laminates to be the more likely counterpart to the unbalanced dual angle auxetic laminates. Unbalanced symmetric laminates experience significantly more inplane shear deformation when axially loaded than their balanced counterparts. The high shear may be desirable for damping applications, but less desirable otherwise. (C) 2007 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

AB Based on a 2D cross chiral structure, two novel 3D cross chiral structures (structure-1 and structure-2) with negative Poisson's ratios were proposed in this paper. Structure-1 could be evolved into structure-2 by adding a star structure. Analytical models of the two auxetic cellular structures were established based on the Timoshenko beam theory. The Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of the cellular structures were obtained in all principal directions, which were verified by finite element method (FEM). Structure-1 exhibits anisotropic auxetic behavior while structure-2 shows uniform auxetic behavior in all three principal directions with all on-axis Poisson's ratios closer to the limit of-1. Additionally, the extra addition of star structure can enhance the Young's modulus of structure-2 significantly in the case of same relative density, compared to structure-1. Moreover, the effect of parameter variation on elastic properties of two structures and the comparison with other classical 3D auxetic structures were also thoroughly studied and discussed in detail. These results are expected to eventually contribute to the advance of research and the application of new 3D auxetic structures in the future. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Materials with negative Poisson's ratios (auxetics) exhibit the property of expanding laterally when uniaxially stretched and becoming narrower when compressed. A system which exhibits this unexpected property is natrolite (NAT), a zeolite which is auxetic in its (001) plane. Here, we examine the effect of external hydrostatic pressure on the crystal structure of hypothetical silicates equivalent to frameworks in the NAT group. We show that the crystal structure and mechanical properties of the SiO2 equivalents of the NAT, THO (thomsonite) and EDI (edingtonite) frameworks are highly pressure dependent and that these systems are most auxetic at non-ambient conditions, in particular at positive external hydrostatic pressures which are predicted to be approximately 2-8% of the bulk modulus. An attempt is made to explain this pressure dependency of the Poisson's ratio in terms of the framework geometry and the deformation mechanism. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Two-dimensional auxetic materials with negative Poisson's ratio expand in response to a tensile strain in cross-section. Such counter-intuitive behaviours have been mainly ascribed to concave structures with ideal rigid ball-stick models. Here, based on first-principles calculations, we systematically analyze the mechanical behaviours of three life-boat structured two-dimensional (2D) materials and report two new auxetic materials: delta-arsenic and delta-graphane. The calculated Poisson's ratio values are correlated with Young's modulus, cohesive energy, and valence shell electron pair repulsion of isostructures. Combining with previous research, we provide a self-consistent explanation of the origin of the 2D in-plane negative Poisson's ratio and an algorithmic route to discover new auxetic materials by comparing the energy restored in bond rotation and stretch.

AB This article describes the rules and procedures for designing a three-dimensional (3D) antitetrachiral structure that achieves a negative Poisson's ratio. Numerical analysis and experimental validation showed good agreement between the deformations and Poisson's ratios. Moreover, the proposed auxetic structure displayed anisotropic behavior in x-and y-directional compression as well as isotropic behavior in z-directional compression. The parametric study and design examples presented in this article demonstrate the relationships among the Poisson's ratio, effective Young's modulus, porosity, and geometry of the proposed structure, and provide insights into the potential applications for future auxetic designs.

AB Comparing with traditional honeycomb structures, Negative Poisson's Ratio (NPR) structures had better mechanical performances in some certain respects, especially the shear modulus and fracture toughness. However, few publications focused on the cylinder-shape NPR structure, which influence the diversity and possibility of NPR structure applications. In this paper, a cylindrical NPR structure was introduced and applied as a suspension jounce bumper in order to solve the issue that the ideal uniaxial compression load-displacement curve sometimes cannot be realized by traditional Polyurethane (PU) jounce bumper. The load-displacement curve of NPR jounce bumper was proved to be smoother and more ideal than that of traditional jounce bumper. Nevertheless, the influences of NPR jounce bumper on the suspension mechanical performance and vehicle ride comfort were not comprehended yet. In this study, the traditional and NPR jounce bumpers were both assembled into virtual prototypes of Macpherson, double wishbone and multi-link suspensions to conduct single wheel travel virtual tests. The results indicated that NPR jounce bumper can achieve more ideal wheel force vs. jounce height curve without adjusting free travel, which is beneficial to spare precise suspension space. Furthermore, a jounce bumper evaluation method using pulse ride comfort was proposed in this paper. The virtual ride comfort tests of travelling through bump and pothole were conducted using established vehicle virtual prototype. The maximum vertical accelerations and weighted root mean square (RMS) of acceleration of vehicle centroid at most speeds were reduced applying NPR jounce bumper. Thus, the NPR jounce bumper can apparently improve vehicle ride comfort.

AB With the aim of understanding anisotropic crystals that possess a negative Poisson's ratio and to lay a foundation for investigating molecular mechanisms, we discuss the definition of the ratio and establish conditions on the compliance that govern its sign. We derive results on orientation averaging that are useful in the context of anisotropy and helpful in the investigation of isotropic polycrystals. We discuss alpha-cristobalite, a polymorph of silicon dioxide that possesses interesting negative ratio properties in single crystals and hypothetical polycrystals. In this connection, we draw attention to the transverse compliance as an alternative and simpler metric for gaging the ratio and for orientation averaging. For alpha-cristobalite, we arrive at new results for the directions that yield the most negative Poisson's ratio. This result should be of value in divining the underlying molecular mechanism that explains the negative values of Poisson's ratio in alpha-cristobalite, a crystal of tetragonal symmetry that possesses six independent elastic constants.

AB The need for dimensionally stable filled polymer composites has spurred the quest for materials that possess a negative coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE). Finding minerals and materials with a negative CTE large enough to counteract the substantial CTE found in polymers proves challenging. Much research has been performed over the last decade to uncover various materials that possess this unusual behavior. A list of materials that have demonstrated negative properties are discussed, as well as the experimental use of one such material (ZrW2O8), in a polymer matrix composite. Other negative properties, such as negative Poisson's ratio and negative stiffness, are also examined.

AB Shape memory polymers, as a kind of smart materials, play an important role in more and more fields, such as aerospace, biomedicine and intelligent clothing field and so on. Comparing with traditional materials, negative Poisson's ratio foam has excellent mechanical properties, such as double curvature, light weight, high shear resistance, auxetic etc., and it has a great potential application in the field of aerospace. Therefore, in this project, shape memory composite foam was fabricated based on the commercial soft polyurethane foam material as matrix and shape memory epoxy resin as functional phase. Negative Poisson's ratio of foam was fabricated based on its shape memory feature through a process of triaxial compression with heat treatment. Microstructure deformation was characterized after the transformation of auxetic foam. By adjusting the processing parameters, the auxetic shape memory foam with different "re-entrant" structure was obtained. Such fabricated shape memory composite foams display variable stiffness with auxetic behavior. Effective compressive and tensile modulus was obtained by compression and tension tests. The effect of processing parameters on foam Poisson's ratio was analyzed, which provided certain guiding significance for the further shape memory foam preparation.

AB A two-dimensional (2D) open cell topology with eight-sided star perforations is proposed. Its mechanical properties (including Poisson's ratio and energy absorption capacity) and deformation behaviors are studied using finite element method (FEM) as a function of the geometric parameters. Simulation results showed that the Poisson's ratio of the structure is tunable from positive to negative by varying the geometric parameters that define the shape of the perforation. A minimum Poisson's ratio of -0.68 is achieved when the geometric parameter , which determines the inner corner sharpness of the star perforation, is equal to 0.1. The highest energy absorption capacity is observed in the model which exhibits the minimum Poisson's ratio. The star perforation cells shrink when the lattice structure is being compressed due to the negative Poisson's ratio effect. Compressive samples are fabricated by 3D printing from Tango Black Plus, and their Poisson's ratios are measured and compared with numerical results. Excellent agreement is found between measurements and simulation.

DE Textile composites; Auxetic performance; Mechanical properties
ID POLYETHYLENE
AB Materials with a negative Poisson's ratio known also as auxetic materials [1] exhibit unusual property of getting thicker when stretched and thinner when compressed. The helical auxetic yarn (HAY) is a recently invented auxetic reinforcing structure for composites [2]. A helical auxetic yarn (HAY) consists of two fibres: a low modulus elastomeric core and a high modulus wrap fibre in a double helix structure. When a tensile load is applied the core of the HAY becomes wider as the wrap straightens out, resulting in a lateral expansion of the core, and therefore a large negative Poisson' ratio behaviour. The auxetic behaviour of the HAY can be tailored by altering fibre properties, the initial geometry and also the applied strain to comply with specific applications, such as composites [3, 4], blast mitigation, and filtration [5]. This paper introduces a further development to the current HAY by addition of a third component (a sheath). The presence of the sheath is expected to overcome problems such as slippage of the wrap and inconsistency in the initial wrap angle previously encountered during the manufacture of the HAY. The auxetic performance of conventional and novel systems is investigated and Poisson's ratio data are presented.

AB Materials with an abnormal Poisson's ratio, including those with negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) and zero Poisson's ratio (ZPR), are an important category of mechanical metamaterials, among which many exhibit NPR in all three directions. However, few of them, especially the 3D materials, exhibit ZPR in partial directions and NPR in other directions. Herein, a novel 3D structure developed by orthogonal splicing the 2D parallelogram honeycomb structure is proposed. Different from the 2D parallelogram honeycomb with ZPR, the spliced 3D parallelogram structure can exhibit not only ZPR but also NPR in different directions. The analytical model of the structure is established based on the classical beam theory, the equivalent analytical formulas of Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio are given, and finite element simulation and experiments are used for verification. The relationships between Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of the structure, as well as its geometric parameters and material parameters, are analyzed using analytical formulas and numerical simulation. The results reveal that the structure is transversely isotropic and can achieve NPR on the transverse symmetry plane and ZPR outside the plane. This unique property may accord this structure with important applications in aerospace, biomedical, and other fields.

DE African nutmeg; Poisson's ratio; elastic modulus; moisture content
AB An investigation into the Poisson's ratio and elastic modulus of African nutmeg as a function of moisture content and loading rate was carried out. Quasi-static compressive tests were conducted at moisture levels of 8, 11.2, 14, 17.4 and 28.7% (d.b.) in an axial loading orientation. Both unit lateral extension and unit normal compression values were determined. Average values of 0.512 to 0.275 were obtained for moisture levels of 8 to 28.7%, respectively. Effects of loading rates were also investigated and results show that Poisson's ratio increased from 0.136 to 0.334 at loading rates of 1 and 7 mm min(-1), respectively. Elastic modulus was observed to decrease as moisture increased. Average values of 201.5 to 41.30 N mm(-2) were noted for moisture levels of 8 to 28.7%, respectively. A similar negative trend was observed with loading rate. These finding could therefore be useful in predicting the load deformation behaviour of African nutmeg.

AB Thermal expansion and stress of solid materials can significantly affect structural safety and instrument accuracy in many engineering fields. An alternative way to overcome these drawbacks is to use materials with controllable coefficients of thermal expansion (CTEs). This work presents a new three-dimensional (3D) material with controllable CTEs that is composed of chiral honeycomb layers connected by a set of inclined struts. Although each single chiral layer has positive CTEs, by carefully designing geometric parameters and material constituents, the negative thermal expansion (NTE) can be established. Analytical solutions of the equivalent CTEs are proposed using the classical beam theory, which were verified by finite element simulations. The results show that the proposed material can achieve a large range of CTEs (from positive to negative), and has negative Poisson's ratios in the chiral honeycomb planes. In addition, isotropic negative and zero thermal expansion can be obtained with appropriate design parameters.

AB Auxetic materials are a type of novel materials exhibiting negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) with potentials for special applications. Herein, the aim is to optimize the auxetic yarn and fabric manufacturing processes, establish the understanding of the influence of yarn and fabric parameters on the auxeticity of the engineered materials and explore the potential applications of auxetic textile materials. The auxetic yarns are manufactured based on a conversional helical structure composing initially a super elastic polyurethane core and a high modulus Nylon 6,6 binder. A hollow spindle machine is used to produce the auxetic yarn with optimized twisting and delivery speeds. Stable helical yarns with auxetic properties are manufactured using the optimized parameters, and woven fabrics are produced from the selected auxetic yarns in both warp and weft directions. Experiments show that the maximum NPR of helical auxetic yarns reaches a remarkable level of -5.6, and the auxetic fabrics display notable geometric changes compared with the nonauxetic fabrics with the same structural parameters. The auxeticity demonstrated in the fabrics implies applications in areas such as filtration and impact protection.

ID PERFORMANCE
AB Helical auxetic yarn is a structural material with negative Poisson's ratio which contains a soft yarn with a higher diameter as a core component and a stiff yarn with a lower diameter as wrap component that has been wrapped around the core component. In the present study, a semi-empirical model based on the improvement of a theoretical model and an artificial neural network model was developed for predicting the maximum negative Poisson's ratio of helical auxetic yarn. In order to verify the models, an experiment according to the initial helical angle of wrap component, the diameter ratio of components, and the modulus ratio of components has been designed. To measure the Poisson's ratio of helical auxetic yarn, an algorithm based on the image processing technique has been proposed. Unlike the results of previous studies, the experimental results showed that increasing the diameter ratio of components so much, will decrease the maximum negative Poisson's ratio of helical auxetic yarn due to higher bending stiffness of core component. The results of the comparison between the predicted and experimental values indicated that the artificial neural network model has a lower error than the semi-empirical model. It is expected that this work provides engineering tools to predict the auxetic behavior of helical auxetic yarn based on the required precision.

AB Dielectric elastomer is one of the most concerned type of electroactive polymer. When a membrane of dielectric elastomer is subject to a voltage on both sides, the membrane reduces thickness and expands area, and vice versa. Due to this unique behavior, dielectric elastomer can be applied as active structure, actuator, sensor, energy harvesting component, etc. However, the mechanical performance of active structure is limited by the low Young's modulus of dielectric elastomer. Inspired by the human's bone-muscle system, a novel active structure that applying dielectric elastomer on the double-V type Negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) structure was proposed in this paper. When voltage and load vary, mechanical performance and dimensions of proposed Electroactive NPR (ENPR) structure change. The electro-mechanical model of ENPR structure was established from the perspective of Helmholtz free energy. And the theoretical model was verified by the experiment of an ENPR structure prototype. Furthermore, the influences of dimensions of dielectric elastomer and structural parameters on the electro-mechanical performance were researched. The results indicated that all variables influenced the stiffness of ENPR structure. Width L-2, number of cells n(x) and number of layers n(y) had limited effects on the electroactive response, but tuning of others variables which can improve stiffness will weaken the electroactive response. Through periodic replication of ENPR cells, the electro-mechanical property can be superimposed to satisfy higher bearing requirements and larger size demands. ENPR structure can realize integration, electronization, informatization and intellectualization of elastic component, sensor, actuator, and energy harvesting system theoretically, which is significant and can be expected to be widely applied on mechanical systems.

AB The general expressions for the compliance s(ijkl)', Young's modulus E(h k l) and Poisson's ratio v(h k l) along an arbitrary direction [h k l] are given for cubic crystals. The representation surfaces, for which the length of the radius vector in the [h k l] direction equals to E(h k l) or v(h k l), are constructed for seven BCC transition metals Cr, Fe, Mo, Nb, Ta, V and W. Neglecting W, which is isotropic, both representation surfaces of Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio are spherical surfaces. The remaining BCC transition metals may be grouped into two classes. In the first group (Cr, Mo, Nb and V) with negative values of s(A), Young's modulus surface has eight depressed corners and six rounded protuberances at the centers of the faces. In the second group (Fe and Ta) with positive values of s(A), on the contrary, Young's modulus surface has eight rounded protuberance corners and six depressions at the centers of the faces. The contrary conclusions are obtained for Poisson's ratio. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Auxetic materials expand/contract transversely while tensioned/compressed in the longitudinal direction, thus they possess a negative Poisson's ratio. According to the theory of elasticity, their existence in isotropic forms is theoretically possible, however, they are found in nature only in anisotropic forms. Auxetics are expected to possess enhanced relative static and dynamic properties, thus, several auxetic composites have been proposed and manufactured to mimic such behavior. This study shows the development of axisymmetric auxetics, a novel class of negative Poisson's ratio composites obtained by the revolution of reentrant lattices in turn of an axis. It is shown by experimental testing and FEA that an auxetic circumferential deformation mechanism increases the overall Poisson's ratio and promotes an elevation of the Specific Young's modulus relative to regular honeycombs. Furthermore, the developed composites are compared in terms of Specific Young's modulus and densities to commercial foams and other non-stochastic auxetics. It is concluded that they present enhanced specific properties for relative densities in the range of 0.28-0.35 and may be a promising route for future applications.

AB Using atomistic calculations, we study the features of uniaxial deformation of nanotubes made of rolled-up thin [010] plates of Fe cubic crystals. We find that within a certain range of chiral angles these nanotubes have both negative Poisson's ratio and axial strain-induced torsion (reverse Poynting's effect) during tension and compression. The maximum torsion and the minimum value of Poisson's ratio are observed at chiral angles of 25 degrees and 45 degrees, respectively. We show that Young's modulus of the chiral Fe nanotubes increases with a chiral angle. We demonstrate that in the discussed range of nanotube sizes there is a satisfactory correspondence between the results obtained by molecular statics and anisotropic theory of elasticity.

ID NEGATIVE POISSONS RATIO
AB Auxetic plied yarns are specially constructed with two types of single yarns of different sizes and moduli. This paper investigates how to use these types of yarns to produce woven fabrics with auxetic effects. Four-ply auxetic yarns were first incorporated into a series of woven fabrics with different design parameters to study their auxetic behavior and percent open area during extension. Effects of auxetic plied yarn arrangement, single component yarn properties, weft yarn type, and weave structure were then evaluated. Additional double helical yarn (DHY) and 6-ply auxetic yarn woven fabrics were also made for comparison. The results show that the alternative arrangement of S- and Z-twisted 4-ply auxetic yarns in a woven fabric can generate a higher negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) of the fabric. While the higher single stiff yarn modulus of auxetic yarn can result in greater NPR behavior, finer soft auxetic yarn does not necessarily generate such an effect. Weft yarns with low modulus and short float over the 4-ply auxetic yarns in fabric structure are favorable for producing high NPR behavior. The weft cover factor greatly affects the variation of the percent open area of the 4-ply auxetic yarn fabrics during extension. When different kinds of helical auxetic yarns (HAYs) are made into fabrics, the fabric made of DHY does not have the highest NPR effect but it has the highest percent open area, which increases with increasing tensile strain.

ID DEFORMATION; INDENTATION; DESIGN
AB Analytical investigations on the contact problems between two homogeneous and isotropic soft bodies were performed to simulate the contact of human buttocks and seat cushions. The cushion materials' Poisson's ratio were allowed to be negative. The human buttocks were modeled as an ideal sphere with radius 15 cm, and assumed to have a low Young's modulus and a Poisson's ratio close to 0.5. These parameters were held constant during our analysis. Peak contact pressure was reduced by adjusting the contour curvature of cushions according to Hertz theory, as expected. Moreover, analysis by both the Hertz model and a finite thickness 3D elasticity model showed that using negative Poisson's ratio cushions could further reduce the pressure. Negative Poisson's ratio cushions may be beneficial in the prevention of pressure sores or ulcers in the sick and in reduction of pressure-induced discomfort in seated people.

AB The variability of Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio for hexagonal crystals was studied. Expressions for three stationary values of Young's modulus and eight stationary values of Poisson's ratio were obtained. Numerical analysis of the extrema of the elastic characteristics for crystals was given based on experimental data from the Landolt-Bornstein reference book. Classification schemes for extreme values of Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio are proposed. Data on hexagonal materials with negative Poissons ratio are obtained. It was shown that global extremes of Poisson's ratio can exceed the value 0.5, which is the upper limit for isotropic materials. On the other hand, hexagonal crystals were not found for which the global minimum value was less than - 1 (lower limit for isotropic materials).

AB Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of a porous polymeric construct (scaffold) quantitatively describe how it supports and transmits external stresses to its surroundings. While Young's modulus is always non-negative and highly tunable in magnitude, Poisson's ratio can, indeed, take on negative values despite the fact that it is non-negative for virtually every naturally occurring and artificial material. In some applications, a construct having a tunable negative Poisson's ratio (an auxetic construct) may be more suitable for supporting the external forces imposed upon it by its environment. Here, three-dimensional polyethylene glycol scaffolds with tunable negative Poisson's ratios are fabricated. Digital micromirror device projection printing (DMD-PP) is used to print single-layer constructs composed of cellular structures (pores) with special geometries, arrangements, and deformation mechanisms. The presence of the unit-cellular structures tunes the magnitude and polarity (positive or negative) of Poisson's ratio. Multilayer constructs are fabricated with DMD-PP by stacking the single-layer constructs with alternating layers of vertical connecting posts. The Poisson's ratios of the single- and multilayer constructs are determined from strain experiments, which show (1) that the Poisson's ratios of the constructs are accurately predicted by analytical deformation models and (2) that no slipping occurrs between layers in the multilayer constructs and the addition of new layers does not affect Poisson's ratio.

AB We study thermo-elastic behaviour of the hybrid materials with auxetic inclusions. To this end we analyse representative volume elements consisting of a large number of randomly positioned cubic inclusions using the finite element method and determine the effective coefficient of thermal expansion and the average thermal stresses in constrained hybrid materials developed as a result of a uniform temperature change. We study the effect of Poisson's ratio, Young's modulus and the coefficient of thermal expansion of the inclusions on the effective coefficient of thermal expansion and thermal stresses. We demonstrate that the auxeticity of the inclusions can reduce thermal stresses, which is controlled by the values of the Poisson's ratio and the coefficients of thermal expansion of the inclusions and matrix.

AB This paper reports a theoretical analysis of deformation behavior of an innovative 3D auxetic structure. Both bending deformation and cross-sectional deformation of the yarns in a representative unit of the structure were first analyzed to establish the relationships among different geometrical parameters and yarn modulus. Then, the Poisson's ratio values of the structure under different compression strains were theoretically calculated and compared with the experimental results. Based on the validation of the theoretical analysis, the effects of different structural parameters and yarn modulus on the negative Poisson's ratio behavior of the structure were finally predicted and discussed. The results obtained from the analysis would be very useful for the optimization of the negative Poisson's ratio behavior of 3D auxetic structure.

AB The extreme values of Young's modulus for sixand seven-constant tetragonal crystals are found using the necessary and sufficient conditions for the extrema of the functions of two variables. Theoretical and numerical analyzes of stationary and extreme values are performed based on experimental data on elastic constants collected in the Landolt-Bornstein reference book. Five such Young's moduli are formed in the case of six constant and seven-constant tetragonal crystals. It is found how the stationary and extremal values of Young's modulus depend on three anisotropy coefficients that disappear in the limit of an isotropic material. Simple analytical dependences of some stationary and extreme values of Young's moduli of six-constant crystals are obtained. In the case of stationary values of Young's modulus of seven-constant tetragonal crystals, the coefficients included in the sufficient conditions for the extremum of the function of two variables are estimated numerically. Tetragonal crystals (Hg2I2, Hg2Br2, Hg2Cl2, TeO2, (NH2)(2)CO, LiY0.5Tb0.5F4 and C(CH2OH)(4)) with a large difference between the maximum and minimum values of Young's modulus are revealed. It is shown that six-constant tetragonal crystals may have a greater difference between global extrema than seven-constant tetragonal crystals. It is found that six-constant tetragonal crystals with a large difference between the global extrema of Young's modulus have a negative Poisson's ratio. In the case of seven-constant tetragonal crystals, such relationship has not been identified. A classification scheme based on the dependence of three stationary values of Young's modulus on two dimensionless parameters is proposed.

AB The Poisson's ratio is a fundamental measure of the elastic-deformation behaviour of materials. Although negative Poisson's ratios are theoretically possible, they were believed to be rare in nature. In particular, while some studies have focused on finding or producing materials with a negative Poisson's ratio in bulk form, there has been no such study for nanoscale materials. Here we provide numerical and theoretical evidence that negative Poisson's ratios are found in several nanoscale metal plates under finite strains. Furthermore, under the same conditions of crystal orientation and loading direction, materials with a positive Poisson's ratio in bulk form can display a negative Poisson's ratio when the material's thickness approaches the nanometer scale. We show that this behaviour originates from a unique surface effect that induces a finite compressive stress inside the nanoplates, and from a phase transformation that causes the Poisson's ratio to depend strongly on the amount of stretch.

AB Motivated by the recent experimental exfoliation of tellurium thin film, and the amazing physical and chemical properties of various theoretically tellurene allotropes, we design a novel and stable pentagonal structure of tellurene (SP-type Te), and make a detailed comparison with other possible Te allotropes, related to their mechanical, electronic and thermoelectric properties. SP-type Te shows the higher expandability than other Te allotropes, due to its lower layer modulus and Young's modulus. More interestingly its Poisson's ratio along x (y) direction is unusually negative (similar to -0.01) which can be further decreased by applying coaxial strain. Three-layers SP-type Te can turn into a topological insulator (TI) with a nontrivial band gap similar to 0.03 eV when uniaxial compressional strain sigma(x) = 7%. Moreover the higher the number of layers in SP-type Te, the lower sx inducing its topological transition requires. At room temperature, lattice thermal conductivity k(L) of SP-type Te is the lowest in all Te allotropes, and meanwhile its peak ZT for n-type doping even can reach up to 2.84. Thus if SP-type Te can be synthesized in future, these extraordinary properties would promote it with great potential in designing low-dimensional mechanical, spintronic and thermoelectric devices.

AB In this paper, a new kind of chiral three-dimensional honeycomb material was designed by orthogonal assembling based on chiral two-dimensional honeycomb with four ligaments. The analytical formulae of equivalent Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio are deduced using the beam theory. The calculations of the analytical formulae can be well consistent with those of finite element method. The theoretical and numerical results show that the honeycomb material proposed in this paper is isotropic at the macroscopic scale and its Poisson's ratio is close to -1, which means the material have larger ratio of shear modulus to Young's modulus. Furthermore, the influence of geometries on the equivalent elastic parameters are also discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Elastic properties of multilayers with low period thickness show in some cases anomalies which are generally correlated with structural modifications in individual layers. In the recent past, several studies have evidenced using X-ray diffraction in-plane and out-of-plane strains with the same sign. Some authors have then proposed in the case of W/Ni and Nb/Cu metallic superlattices to use a negative Poisson's ratio. This result is surprising because the value of this coefficient in metals is generally positive. In this article. we introduce a novel interpretation mainly based on the experimental determination by sin(2) Psi method of the reference parameter (stress-free lattice parameter) used in strain calculations. Then, we show that the introduction of the bulk parameter instead of stress-free parameter for the reference parameter is an unrealistic assumption in the case of thin films and multilayers (W and Ag/Ni) and may thus lead to wrong results which are then in total disagreement with those obtained by other techniques. Therefore, the elastic anomaly concerning Poisson's ratio which has been reported by some authors in scientific literature do not result from real structure of multilayers but from experimental X-ray; diffraction data analysis.

Compared to conventional materials, auxetic materials have a number of enhanced properties that could be very interesting for some special applications. This paper reviews the latest achievements in auxetic materials, including their properties, structures and applications. A special discussion on their potential applications in textiles is also made. It is expected that this review could provide some useful information for the future development of auxetic textile materials.

AB Traditional auxetic lattices are featured with negative Poisson's ratio but weak stiffness. In this work, a set of auxetic lattices with enhanced stiffness are proposed by adding a strengthening rib into conventional auxetic unit cells in a direction perpendicular to the re-entrant direction. The effective mechanical properties of these variants are calculated using the fast Fourier transform-based homogenization method, which show that their Young's modulus in 2D can be improved by approximately 200% along the strengthening direction without significant sacrifice of auxetic property. However, such an enhancement is weakened in 3D as the variant of a tetrahedral cell has an approximate 100% improvement of Young's modulus only at low relative density. Though the stiffness of a variant hexahedral cell can be doubled in 3D at a wide range of relative density, its Poisson's ratio remains negative only in a narrow range of relative density. The findings in this work will offer new opportunities for the applications of auxetic materials which not only need negative Poisson's ratio but also high stiffness.

AB Poisson's ratio is defined as the negative of the ratio of the transverse strain to the longitudinal strain in response to a longitudinal uniaxial stress. In the presence of anisotropy, this means that the ratio depends on two directions. With a view to assessing crystals that exhibit directions for which the ratio is negative, we resort to a transverse average to eliminate one directional variable and at the same time to arrive at a measure that poses a challenge to achieving significant negative values. The areal Poisson ratio coincides with the Poisson ratio for an isotropic material. We determine the stationary directions of the areal Poisson ratio for all crystal symmetry classes. The directions represented by invariant stationary points-those that hold independently of the material-we identify and explain class-by-class in terms of the axes of symmetry for the class. It is shown that for cubic crystals, positive definiteness of the strain energy requires that the areal Poisson ratio lie between -1 and 1/2, as it does for isotropy. We conclude that the areal Poisson ratio for the classes of lower symmetry are not restricted.

AB Chiral lattices are generally considered to possess auxetic properties with negative Poisson's ratios and high compressibility. However, the effects of anisotropy and handedness (chirality) on their mechanical properties, such as directional moduli, Poisson's ratio, and other coupling effects, are not clearly understood due to the lack of analytical methods to handle both anisotropy and chirality. Herein, we construct a generalized micropolar homogenization method to characterize the elastic constants of tetra-chiral and tetra-achiral lattices having different joint types. The developed method can identify the directional moduli and Poisson's ratio and coupling effects in the anisotropic wavy lattices. The generalized micropolar homogenization of the wavy square lattices reveals i) the axial-shear coupling effect of tetra-chiral structures, ii) the weak correlation of the chirality of tetra-chiral lattices to auxeticity, and iii) the directional positive and negative Poisson's ratio of tetra-achiral lattices. This work offers a powerful platform for metamaterials' design via geometric reconfiguration of lattice structures to adjust both anisotropy and chirality.

AB Orientational dependences of the Poisson's ratio have been calculated for several perovskite tetragonal ferroelectric singe crystals: 0.67Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O-3-0.33PbTiO(3), PbTiO3, and BaTiO3. All these crystals are shown to have negative values of Poisson's ratio in some crystallographic directions thus being so-called partial auxetics. The largest negative Poisson's ratio values possess 0.67Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O-3-0.33PbTiO(3) single crystals. The thermodynamic restrictions for the d(33) and d(31) piezoelectric moduli of the tetragonal crystals have been revealed. The relation between Poisson's ratio and piezoelectric properties of perovskite tetragonal ferroelectric singe crystals is discussed. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

AB Literature on the mechanical performance of additively manufactured (AM) negative Poisson's ratio (-nu) structures has been primarily focused on beam-based re-entrant structures with chevron crosslinks. The walled variants of this architecture have been shown to exhibit lateral instability. This is where a layered framework can be advantageous as they provide increased lateral stability. Much less is known regarding the behaviour of such architecture, let alone their thin/thick-walled variants. This study explores the influence of design parameters namely wall thickness (t) and angle (theta) on the mechanical performance of thin and thick-walled inherently stable -nu. lattices. The design is achieved through conceiving linearly arranged AlSi10Mg re-entrant unit-cells while discarding the traditional chevron crosslinks. The printed prototypes were experimentally tested and response surface (RS) models were generated to study the parametric influence on the elastic modulus (E), compressive strength (sigma(c)), failure strain (epsilon(f)), -nu and relative density (rho(r)). The results demonstrate that both thin- and thick-walled structures exhibit. of -0.108 to -0.257 despite the interaction effects between t and theta. The elastic modulus can be increased by either increasing t or theta without considering the interaction effects at 0.3 <= t <= 1 mm and 45 degrees <= 0 <= 85 degrees. This study presents a new understanding regarding the fabrication and performance of re-entrant structures by AM.

AB Systems with a negative Poisson's ratio (auxetic) exhibit the unusual yet very useful property of getting wider rather than thinner when uniaxially stretched. A novel mechanism to generate auxetic behaviour at tailor-made values which may be implemented in composites manufacture using readily available materials is proposed. FEA simulations are used to provide a proof of principle for this concept and an analytical model is proposed so as to elucidate the requirements for auxetic behaviour. It is shown that the simulations and analytical model give comparable results and confirm that this system may reach giant negative values of the Poisson's ratio. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A challenge in nano- and micro-mechanics is the realization of innovative materials exploiting auxetic behaviour to tailor thermal expansion properties. For this purpose, a new class of micro-structured media possessing an extremely wide range of tunable (positive, negative or even zero) thermal expansion is proposed and analytically and experimentally assessed. For this class of isotropic Mechanical-Auxetic Thermal-Shrinking media, the effective coefficient of thermal expansion is explicitly linked to two microstructural variables via a simple relation, allowing the design with desired values. The theoretical predictions for the negative thermal properties are fully validated by the experimental and numerical outcomes. The simplicity of the proposed structure makes the design useful for the production of a new generation of advanced media, with applications ranging from micromechanical devices to large civil and space structures.

AB Auxetic lattice structures are prospective candidates in many engineering applications because of their unique negative Poisson's ratio effect as well as excellent mechanical properties. An aluminum based auxetic lattice structure reinforced by polymer fillers was fabricated through pressure infiltration technology, and the compressive mechanical properties of the resultant auxetic composites were then investigated through experimental tests combined with finite element analyses in the present study. The results show that the composites exhibit higher elastic modulus, compressive strength and energy absorption capacity compared with original aluminum based auxetic lattice structures. This enhancement is ascribed to intensified interaction between the struts and the polymer filler resulted from the special deformation mode of auxetic lattice structures. Furthermore, the deformation mechanism mode of the auxetic structures and corresponding auxetic composites were also discussed. It is therefore suggested that there will be pronounced enhancement in auxetic lattice structures if the negative Poisson's ratio effect is restrained.

AB In this work we show that a structure consisting of a network of bending beams can exhibit a negative Poisson's ratio. We have shown that the negative Poisson's ratio behaviour is driven by the (bcc analogous) type Ill beams, the type II (fcc like) beams result in a structure with a Poisson's ratio of around zero and type I (simple cubic configuration) beams result in a Poisson's ratio of nearly +1. The tensile and shear strengths of the type III beams are augmented by addition of type II and type III beams. By tailoring the relative stiffness of the component beams within the structure it is possible to design an auxetic truss structure with specific Poisson's ratio, tensile and shear moduli.
   This validates the hypothesis that crystal structures can provide inspiration for macro structures with tailored mechanical properties where the mechanism for negative Poisson's ratio (auxetic) behaviour at the atomic scale in cubic crystals is replicated by bending beams.

AB In order to obtain the auxetic hydrogels with negative Poisson's ratio, porous poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) hydrogels with different contents of PVA and surfactant (alkylphenol ethoxylates : OP) were prepared by methods of surfactants template and repeatedly freezing-thawing process, according to the microstructure and deformation mechanism of auxetic materials. The Poisson's ratio and mechanical properties of porous PVA hydrogels were measured and calculated by digital speckle technique. The microstructure and pore morphology of porous PVA hydrogels were observed by optical and electron microscopy. The interrelation and variation of their parameters, including composition, Poisson's ratio, compression modulus, volume modulus of pure and porous PVA hydrogels were compared and investigated. With the increasing of PVA and OP contents, the pore's size became larger, and the Poisson's ratio of porous PVA hydrogels decreased. The values of Poisson's ratio of porous PVA hydrogels were directly proportional to the ratio of the compression modulus and volume modulus of the hydrogels.

AB As we all know, compression in one direction will cause expansion in the orthogonal direction for conventional materials. Similarly, stretching in one direction will give rise to contraction in the vertical direction. It is hence possible to combine these two properties to obtain a novel mechanism to create 3D structures with negative Poisson's ratio (PR) in some directions and positive PR in other ones (partial auxetics). The latitude-and-longitude-inspired double-elliptic-ring structures (DERs) with tunable Poisson's ratio and Young's modulus are designed and studied in this work, which offers an effective way for achieving this mechanism. A 3D structure with negative Poisson's ratio in three directions is also obtained via arranging the DERs alternately. Meanwhile, theoretical results show that the magnitude of Poisson's ratio of DERs can reach -18.3. Experimental and simulation consequences indicate that the DERs can effectively reduce stress concentration and fracture possibility due to its smooth geometry. Another advantage of DERs is that it still has negative Poisson's ratio effect under large levels of compression. This work can provide a useful reference for the design of 3D auxetic metamaterials with excellent properties, which is promising in some structural and functional applications.

AB Energy minimizations for unstretched and stretched cellulose models using an all-atom empirical force field (molecular mechanics) have been performed to investigate the mechanism for auxetic (negative Poisson's ratio) response in crystalline cellulose I-beta from kraft cooked Norway spruce. An initial investigation to identify an appropriate force field led to a study of the structure and elastic constants from models employing the CVFF force field. Negative values of on-axis Poisson's ratios nu (31) and nu (13) in the x (1)-x (3) plane containing the chain direction (x (3)) were realized in energy minimizations employing a stress perpendicular to the hydrogen-bonded cellobiose sheets to simulate swelling in this direction due to the kraft cooking process. Energy minimizations of structural evolution due to stretching along the x (3) chain direction of the 'swollen' (kraft cooked) model identified chain rotation about the chain axis combined with inextensible secondary bonds as the most likely mechanism for auxetic response.

AB The subject of thermal expansion, particularly negative thermal expansion, is a topic of great practical importance in view of its relevance in many everyday applications and the consequences which may arise when the thermal expansion if not controlled. This paper presents a detailed analytical model of a composite system, which enables control of the thermal expansion through the use of the thinning that is observed when a conventional material is mechanically stretched (the Poisson's effect). It is shown that the model can predict the thermal expansion of such systems to an extent comparable to more complex finite element simulations. The proposed model also permits optimization of the system to exhibit maximum negative thermal expansion, or, thermal expansion of a desired magnitude.

AB This paper focuses on a systematic isogeometric design approach for the optimal petal form and size characterization of tetra-petals auxetics, considering both plane stress and plane strain conditions. The underlying deformation mechanism of a tetra-petals auxetic is analyzed numerically with respect to several key parameters. Design optimizations are performed systematically to give bounding graphs for the minimum Poisson's ratio achievable with different stiffness constraints. Tunable design studies with targeted effective Poisson's ratio, shear modulus and stiffness are demonstrated. Potential application for functionally graded lattice structures is presented. Numerical and experimental verifications are provided to verify the designs. The out-of-plane buckling phenomenon in tension for thin auxetics with re-entrant features is illustrated experimentally to draw caution to results obtained using plane stress formulations for designing such structures.

AB Cubic Zr1-xYbxWMoO8-x/2 (x = 0-0.05) ceramic was first fabricated by a polymorphous precursor transition method. X-ray diffraction experiment indicates that samples with x <= 0.05 are single phase solid solution. The measured bulk density, microstructure, maximal compression strength and Young's modulus are obviously sensitive to Yb substitution level, while none of such sensitivity was found for the lattice parameters, negative thermal expansion coefficients and Vickers hardness. Drilling tests on Zr(0.96)yb(0.04)WMoO(7.98) ceramic indicate good machinability, which is often required for quality and shape control in engineering applications. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB Two-parameter analysis of auxetics among the cubic crystals is proposed. A brief analysis of the equivalence of this two-parameter consideration and other approaches is given. The main result of this paper is the classification of partial auxetics with a single dimensionless complex, which is composed of the crystals elastic compliances. The auxetic surface separates the regions with negative and positive Poisson's ratio. The character of its changes with change of the dimensionless complex is determined. The critical value of the complex where a topological rearrangement of the auxetic surface occurs is obtained. The distribution of partial auxetics in zones with different values of the dimensionless complex was found. The sign of another dimensionless parameter influences the location of a region with negative Poisson's ratio relative to the auxetic surface.

AB The effective Young's modulus of an auxetic composite is the aim of this paper. The composite is made up of alternating layers of auxetic material (with a negative Poisson's ratio) and aluminum. The problem is solved in the light of Cosserat elasticity which admits degrees of freedom not present in classical elasticity, i.e. rotation of points in the material and couple stresses. The enhancement in the Young's modulus for auxetic over nonauxetic materials is reported.

AB Poisson's ratio is a fundamental property of a material which reflects the transverse strain response to the applied axial strain. Negative Poisson's ratio is allowed theoretically, but is rare in nature. Besides the discovery and tailoring of bulk auxetic materials, recent studies have also found a negative Poisson's ratio in nanomaterials, while their negative Poisson's ratio is mainly based on conventional rigid mechanical models as bulk auxetic materials. In this work, we report the existence of in-plane negative Poisson's ratio in a two-dimensional convex structure of newly synthesized semi-fluorinated graphene by using first-principles calculations. In addition, the sign of the Poisson's ratio can be tuned by the applied strain. Interestingly, we find that this unconventional negative Poisson's ratio cannot be explained by conventional rigid mechanical models but originates from the enhanced bond angle strain over the bond strain due to chemical functionalization. This new mechanism of auxetics extends the scope of auxetic nanomaterials and can serve as design principles for future discovery and design of new auxetic materials.

AB Auxetic materials and microstructures are attracting the attention of a growing community of researchers due to their unusual properties and high mechanical performances, in both the static and dynamic regimes. The topological derivative is used in this contribution to determine microstructures having the most negative in-plane mean Poisson's ratio. The auxetic nature of the computed microstructures is demonstrated by both numerical and real experiments performed over samples fabricated by additive printing. The effective mechanical properties of these auxetic structures have been computed in the framework of couple stress elasticity, allowing to identify both in-plane and out-of plane effective properties. The calculated classical moduli are found independent of the size of the window of analysis and are consequently effective coefficients. In contrast to this, the calculated in-plane bending moduli show a clear dependency on the auxetic cell size, whereas the out-of-plane bending moduli appear to be size-independent.

AB This paper describes the manufacturing, characterization and parametric modeling of a novel fiber-reinforced composite flexible skin with in-plane negative Poisson's ratio (auxetic) behavior. The elastic mechanical performance of the auxetic skin is evaluated using a three-dimensional analytical model based on the classical laminate theory (CLT) and Sun's thick laminate theory. Good agreement is observed between in-plane Poisson's ratios and Young's moduli of the composite skin obtained by the theoretical model and the experimental results. A parametric analysis carried out with the validated model shows that significant changes in the in-plane negative Poisson's ratio can be achieved through different combinations of matrix and fiber materials and stacking sequences. It is also possible to identify fiber-reinforced composite skin configurations with the same in-plane auxeticity but different orthotropic stiffness performance, or the same orthotropic stiffness performance but different in-plane auxeticity. The analysis presented in this work provides useful guidelines to develop and manufacture flexible skins with negative Poisson's ratio for applications focused on morphing aircraft wing designs.

AB A new concept of 3D auxetic lattice structures with high stiffness is proposed in this paper. Correspondingly, a feasible method for rapidly fabricating the proposed structures with high-performance continuous carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composite is exploited. Theoretical models for predicting the homogenized elastic properties of the representative structure along all principal axes, including the Young's moduli, Poisson's ratios and shear moduli, are developed. Based on the models, directional dependence of structural homogenized elastic properties is investigated in detail. The compressive elastic behaviors of the 3D auxetic lattice structures fabricated with high-performance continuous carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composite are further investigated in a combination of numerical analysis and experiments. Our results suggest that the new concept of 3D auxetic lattice structures are very suitable for uniaxial loading and can be great candidates where excellent load bearing capacity and obvious negative Poisson's ratio effects are simultaneously desired. Coupled with the proposed efficient fabrication process, our efforts may help to promote the 3D auxetic lattice structures to be widely used in a variety of applications.

AB Carbon fibre laminates were produced with matched through-the-thickness modulus, but with negative (auxetic), positive and near zero through-the-thickness Poisson's ratios. These were indented with noses of diameter 2, 12.7 and 20 mm. Enhancements in indentation resistance were seen for the auxetic laminates with smaller, more localized damage areas for the two larger diameter indentors where delamination was the dominant failure mechanism. Little difference was seen in mechanical properties for the 2 mm diameter indentor where fibre breakage was the dominant failure mechanism, though smaller damage areas are still obtained in this case due to delamination growth suppression.

AB A novel 3-D structure is proposed by adding the reinforcing rods into the original 2-D star-shaped structure to obtain more obvious negative Poisson's ratio effect. The influence of length parameter, thickness parameter, angle parameters and material combination on the effective Poisson's ratio, effective Young's modulus and effective shear modulus of the novel 3-D structure is systematically investigated using cell-based finite element modeling. Additionally, the change rule of material combination sequence and length parameter of the structure's thermal expansion is also studied. The results show that the novel 3-D structure can achieve positive, zero and negative Poisson's ratio, as well as positive, zero and negative thermal expansion when appropriate material combination is adopted. Moreover, the negative Poisson's ratio effect of the novel 3-D structure is distinctly enhanced, and the effective Young's modulus is slightly increased through comparing with other two 3-D star shaped structures. By selecting material combinations and structural geometry parameters, metamaterials with special properties can be designed for different application fields.

AB Recently, open cellular substrates instead of traditional solid substrates have been used in flexible electronics, catering to the need for high permeability of bio-fluids through the device. The Poisson ratio of the existing open cellular designs, however, remains positive, which is inappropriate for the cellular substrates mounting on some biological auxetic materials, as the resulting mismatch in deformation may cause irritation. In the current work, a type of triangular lattice networks is presented with satisfactory negative Poisson ratio effect over large strains. A finite deformation model is developed for the deformed angles, constitutive relation and maximum strain of the building block, with nonlinear finite element method (FEM) validations. Results demonstrate desired negative Poisson ratios and mechanical properties can be achieved in an isotropic manner by tailoring three geometric parameters (arc angle theta(0), length/radius ratio L/R and width/radius ratio w/R). Thereinto, longer arm lengths not only yield lower equivalent modulus and maximum strain, but also enable wider range of isotropic negative Poisson ratios (from -0.35 to 0) and applied strains (from 0% to 80%), providing more flexibility in network designs and new possibilities to emerging biomedical applications.

AB Auxetic materials, including textiles, exhibit a negative Poisson's ratio (NPR), which is of interest for many applications. This research aims to optimize the structural parameters of helical auxetic yarns (HAYs) and to evaluate the auxetic performance of these yarns. The research reports on the improvement of auxetic yarn quality and the yarn auxeticity through studying the effect of helical angles, diameter ratio and tensile moduli of the two plies, as well as the binder filament feeding. The maximum NPR of the optimized auxetic yarns was experimentally achieved as low as -9.6, with the helical angle of around 14.0 degrees on average using the optimal machine setting. The optimized yarn parameters enabled the making of high-quality auxetic yarns with a wider range of machine settings than before. In parallel, theoretical and numerical studies were carried out for the engineering design of auxetic yarns, which enabled comparisons among the experimental results, calculated results and results from finite element analysis. The comparison showed that a lower initial helical angle, higher tensile modulus of the wrap ply and lower tensile modulus of the core ply led to a higher auxetic effect. A new finding is reported in that a concave relationship between the diameter ratio and the NPR was discovered. The results of this study could assist researchers in producing HAYs, and this type of HAY could be used for many potential applications, such as filtration and impact protection.

AB The equilibrium Young's modulus of articular cartilage is known to be primarily determined by proteoglycans (PGs). However, the relation between the Poisson's ratio and the composition and structure of articular cartilage is more unclear. In this study, we determined Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of bovine articular cartilage in unconfined compression. Subsequently, the same samples, taken from bovine knee (femoral, patellar and tibial cartilage) and shoulder (humeral cartilage) joints, were processed for quantitative microscopic analysis of PGs, collagen content, and collagen architecture. The Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, PG content (estimated with optical density measurements), collagen content, and birefringence showed significant topographical variation (p < 0.05) among the test sites. Experimentally the Young's modulus was strongly determined by the tissue PG content (r = 0.86, p < 0.05). Poisson's ratio revealed a significant negative linear correlation (r = -0.59, p < 0.05) with the collagen content, as assessed by the Fourier transform infrared imaging. Finite element analyses, conducted using a fibril reinforced biphasic model, indicated that the mechanical properties of the collagen network strongly affected the Poisson's ratio. We conclude that Poisson's ratio of articular cartilage is primarily controlled by the content and organization of the collagen network. (c) 2006 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB This paper reports a novel method to fabricate auxetic warp knitted fabrics on a tricot warp knitting machine based on a special structure design and knitting process. Three auxetic warp knitted structures were successfully developed and all of them were designed to form a reentrant hexagonal geometry to acquire an auxetic effect. To provide the fabrics with reentrant frames, elastomeric yarns and stiff yarns were used to form the elastic underlaps and stiff underlaps, respectively. While the elastic underlaps can keep the reentrant structures stable, the stiff underlaps can support the reentrant structures to keep their reentrant frames. To alleviate the transfer of yarns in the loops under tension, an additional front yarn guide bar was used to feed binding yarns to basic reentrant structures. After knitting, all the fabrics were subjected to a heat setting process to keep their shape and a tensile test to assess their auxetic behavior. The experimental results showed that all the fabrics exhibited an obvious auxetic behavior within a wide range of strain. In particular, the fabrics retained auxetic behavior until breaking when stretched in the wale direction, and the Poisson's ratio of the fabrics could be as low as -0.5. On the other hand, the fabrics exhibited a large tensile elongation when stretched in the course direction and their Poisson's ratios changed from negative to positive after the tensile strain exceeded a certain value.

It has been shown that the Poisson's ratio is positive for the planar configuration of phagraphene and negative for the nonplanar configuration. Both the Poisson's ratio and the Young's modulus are isotropic for the planar phagraphene and are characterized by a strong anisotropy in the plane of the monolayer for the nonplanar phagraphene.

SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE

DT Article
ID NEGATIVE POISSON RATIOS; POLYETHYLENE; ELASTICITY
AB A 2D model for the deformation of auxetic microporous polymers (those with a negative Poisson's ratio) has been previously developed, consisting of a network of rigid rectangular nodules interconnected by fibrils. This model has now been extended to describe the deformation of the network via concurrent fibril hinging and stretching mechanisms. Expressions for the strain-dependent Poisson's ratios and Young's moduli are derived and fully investigated with respect to their dependence on the model parameters. These expressions are compared with the experimental strain-dependent data for auxetic microporous polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE). The use of concurrent deformation mechanisms makes a very significant improvement in the agreement of theory with experiment for both cases. Slight discrepancies are discussed in terms of the use of the assumptions of a 2D network of regular, rectangular nodules and a constant force coefficient ratio governing the two deformation mechanisms.

SO NANOSCALE
LA English

ID ELASTIC PROPERTIES; PHASE-TRANSITIONS; BLACK PHOSPHORUS; GRAPHENE;
   CONSTANTS
AB As a basic mechanical parameter, Poisson's ratio (nu) measures the mechanical responses of solids against external loads. In rare cases, materials have a negative Poisson's ratio (NPR), and present an interesting auxetic effect. That is, when a material is stretched in one direction, it will expand in the perpendicular direction. To design modern nanoscale electromechanical devices with special functions, two dimensional (2D) auxetic materials are highly desirable. In this work, based on first principles calculations, we rediscover the previously proposed delta-phosphorene (delta-P) nanosheets [Jie Guan, et al., Phys. Rev. Lett., 2014, 113, 046804] which are good auxetic materials with a high NPR. The results show that the Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of delta-P are all anisotropic. The NPR value along the grooved direction is up to -0.267, which is much higher than the recently reported 2D auxetic materials. The auxetic effect of delta-P originating from its puckered structure is robust and insensitive to the number of layers due to weak interlayer interactions. Moreover, delta-P possesses good flexibility because of its relatively small Young's modulus and high critical crack strain. If delta-P can be synthesized, these extraordinary properties would endow it with great potential in designing low dimensional electromechanical devices.

AB Anelastic anomalies (sharp variations in modulus and damping with temperature) were observed in tetragonal BaTiO3 via broadband viscoelastic spectroscopy after aging at 50 degrees C for 15 h. The effect was most pronounced under electrical short circuit condition, at low frequency and under small excitation strain (10(-6)). Softening in bulk modulus and negative Poisson's ratio were observed near 60 degrees C. Effects are attributed to an oxygen vacancy mechanism. A relaxational model cannot account for sharp response at smaller strains. Heterogeneity of negative stiffness is considered as a cause.

AB This paper proposes a metacomposite that shrinks regardless of temperature decrease or increase, i.e. it exhibits positive and negative thermal expansions with cooling and heating, respectively, which leads to auxetic behavior. This metacomposite is constructed from rigid rods and bimaterial strips; the ends of the rigid rods are connected in series by freely-rotating pin joints while neighboring chains of rigid rods are linked by bimaterial strips that are connected to the mid-spans of the rigid rods by fixed joints. Thermal deformation results indicate that the magnitude of the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of the metacomposite parallel to the rigid rod is about 3 times greater than that parallel to the bimaterial strips. Upon thermal deformation, prescription of stretching parallel to the chains of rigid rods indicate a Poisson's ratio that is approximately -1/3. Results also show that the effective in-plane CTE and Poisson's ratio are influenced by the CTE ratio of the bimaterial phases and aspect ratio of the bimaterial strip. The possibility of this auxetic metacomposite to achieve in situ signswitching of CTE avails greater design options to the materials engineer.

ID FABRICS
AB Engineers have vested interested in auxetic materials because of their negative Poisson's ratio. These materials undergo perpendicular expansion under tension. Meanwhile, auxetic textiles that has both flexibility and negative Poisson's ratio have great potential in future functional materials. In this paper, different flexible re-entrant honeycomb structures are manufactured using 3D printing technology. The shape change processes were also investigated. The re-entrant honeycomb structures exhibits negative Poisson's ratio immediately when stretched. The shape change consists of three stages in X1-direction, the same as that in X2-direction. A noticeable discovery was that the shape change in the X1-direction posed an out-plane change after the first shape change stage, while the shape change in X2-direction always remained in-plane throughout the entire tension process. The Young's moduli were also tested and were consistent with the tendency of the previous works' theoretical analysis.

AB Stretching 7-constant rhombohedral crystals is described in the theory of elasticity. Numerical analysis, based on the obtained analytical expressions for Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio, is showed that three of the eight 7-constant rhombohedral crystals are partial auxetics, i.e. they have a negative Poisson's ratio in some directions of stretching crystals. Minimum and maximum values of Poisson's ratio and Young's modulus, values of the average Poisson's ratio and the minimum and maximum values of Poisson's ratio for particular orientations were obtained. Auxetic surfaces corresponding to zero Poisson's ratio were plotted. Solution of problems of tension and torsion curvilinear anisotropic nano/microtubes from 7-constant rhombohedral crystals was considered under Saint-Venant's approach. Analytical expressions of Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio for these nano/microtubes were obtained. Numerical analysis allowed to find six of the eight auxetics among nano/microtubes. Values of Poisson's ratio for thin-walled nano/microtubes from 7-constant rhombohedral crystals, as well as critical values of thickness parameter at which the change in the sign of Poisson's ratio were obtained. It is shown that Young's modulus slightly dependent on the thickness parameter of the tube. An analytical expression for the torsional stiffness of nano/microtubes from 7-constant rhombohedral crystals were obtained. The numerical values of the coefficient characterizing the torsional stiffness of nano/microtubes of 7-constant rhombohedral crystals were given. It is found that the influence of the chirality angle on the mechanical characteristics of nano/microtubes from 7-constant rhombohedral crystals in the case of the direct and inverse Poynting's effect unlike tubes from orthorhombic and tetragonal crystals are absent.

AB Auxetic foams have previously been shown to have benefits including higher indentation resistance than their conventional counterparts, due to their negative Poisson's ratio, making them better at resisting penetration by concentrated loads. The Poisson's ratio and Young's modulus of auxetic open cell foams have rarely been measured at the high compressive strain rates typical during impacts of energy absorbing material in sporting protective equipment. Auxetic closed cell foams are less common than their open cell counterparts, and only their quasi-static characteristics have been previously reported. It is, therefore, unclear how the Poisson's ratio of auxetic foam, and associated benefits such as increased indentation resistance shown at low strain rates, would transfer to the high strain rates expected under impact. The aim of this study was to measure the effect of strain rate on the stiffness and Poisson's ratio of auxetic and conventional foam. Auxetic open cell and closed cell polymer foams were fabricated, then compression tested to similar to 80% strain at applied rates up to 200 s(-1), with Poisson's ratios obtained from optical full-field strain mapping. Open cell foam quasi-static Poisson's ratios ranged from -2.0 to 0.4, with a narrower range of -0.1 to 0.3 for closed cell foam. Poisson's ratios of auxetic foams approximately halved in magnitude between the minimum and maximum strain rates. Open cell foam quasi-static Young's moduli were between 0.02 and 0.09 MPa, whereas closed cell foams Young's moduli were similar to 1 MPa, which is like foam in protective equipment. The Young's moduli of the auxetic foams approximately doubled at the highest applied strain rate of 200 s(-1).

ID NEGATIVE-POISSONS-RATIO; FABRICATION
AB Auxetic plied yarn is a novel type of yarn structure formed with two types of component yarns with different moduli. Although the effect of structural parameters on its negative Poisson's ratio behavior has been investigated by both experimental and geometrical analyses, the influence of material properties, including yarn tensile modulus and friction, has not been studied yet. In this work, these two factors are further investigated via finite element simulation. The finite element model is first created by using the commercial software ANSYS 15.0. Then, the simulation results are compared with the experimental and analytical data. Finally, the effects of the tilt angle of stiff yarn, yarn friction and tensile modulus are discussed. It is expected that the outcomes of this work would be useful to guide the design and fabrication of this type of auxetic yarn structure.

AB Auextic materials possessing negative Poisson's ratios have gained great research interest by virtue of its various exotic mechanical properties while most of these metamaterials rely on the hollow cellular configuration, largely undermining the overall mechanical performance. It therefore restricts their application in load-bearing engineering fields. In order to solve this issue, we first designed a new class of chiral structures by integrating various polynomial curves. Based on the state-of-the-art 3D printing technique, these auxetic geometries were then fabricated into high-performance composites with chopped carbon fiber (CF) as the reinforcement. Guided by experimental characterization and finite element analysis, the influences of the polynomial orders (n) and the incorporation of CF on the mechanical properties were systematically studied. Results showed that the auxetic behaviour can be tailored by varying the n value inside the polynomial equation. Moreover, the tensile modulus, strength and energy absorption at break of printed chiral samples were all enhanced with the addition of CF, especially for the large improvement of modulus and absorbed energy by 2-fold. Hence, these novel chiral composites present great potential in the development of high performance mechanical metamaterials.

AB Stability of cuboids and cylinders of an isotropic elastic material with negative stiffness under partial constraint is analyzed using an integral method and Rayleigh quotient. It is not necessary that the material exhibit a positive definite strain energy to be stable. The elastic object under partial constraint may have a negative bulk modulus K and yet be stable. A cylinder of arbitrary cross section with the lateral surface constrained and top and bottom planar surfaces is stable provided the shear modulus G > 0 and - G/3 < K < 0 or K > 0. This corresponds to an extended range of negative Poisson's ratio, - infinity < v < - 1. A cuboid is stable provided each of its surfaces is an aggregate of regions obeying fully or partially constrained boundary conditions. (C) 2007 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

AB Semi-auxetic laminates consist of conventional and auxetic laminas such that the interlacing effect results in overall properties that are absent in both conventional and purely auxetic materials. Of late it has been shown that the in-plane Young's modulus of a semi-auxetic laminate always exceeds the rule of mixtures. In this paper, the conditions by which the in-plane modulus exceeds the stiffness of the phase with higher modulus is established. In addition, an example is demonstrated whereby the maximum point of the in-plane modulus occurs where the volume fraction of the stiffer phase is lower than that of the more compliant phase.

AB This paper reports a new type of auxetic yarn made with circular braiding technology to overcome the yarn slippage problem in the conventional helical auxetic yarn structure. Various auxetic yarn structures are firstly produced on a vertical circular braiding machine with 16 yarn carries by changing the number and arrangement of stiff yarn as well as diameter of elastic yarn and core yarn, and then tested under single and repeating tensile conditions. The results show that not only yarn slippage problem could be overcome in the newly developed auxetic yarn structure, but also an early activation and a higher magnitude of negative Poisson's ratio could be achieved. The results also show that all structural parameters including stiff yarn number and arrangement, core yarn, and elastic yarn diameter have an influence on the auxetic effect of the novel yarn structure. Since the new auxetic yarn is produced by using standard braiding manufacturing technique and conventional non-auxetic yarns, there are few technological barriers for its large-scale manufacture for practical application.

AB In this paper a theoretical and numerical study on the viscoelastic behavior of auxetic polymers and cellular materials is presented. Negative Poisson's ratio materials (alpha upsilon xi epsilon o sigma in Creek) expand in all directions when pulled in only one, and contract when compressed in one direction. This behavior is due to the special geometric layout of their unit cells. A theoretical model including viscoelastic and inertia effects on the unit cell has been prepared in order to compute the equivalent in-plane dynamic storage modulus and loss factor of the cellular material. The calculations show how inertia effects and geometric layout of the unit cell affect the viscoelastic behavior of the material over the frequency domain. The results show a very good agreement with the ones from analogous FEM models. Auxetic honeycombs are a good example of cellular materials with negative Poisson's ratio behavior. A Finite Element model has been elaborated to model also the viscoelastic response of the transverse shear modulus of this kind of honeycombs and compared with analytical results.

DE Asphalt mixtures; Poisson's ratio; viscoelastic Poisson's ratio; ageing;

AB The Poisson's ratio (PR) of asphalt mixtures is an important input parameter in the constitutive models for pavement design and performance analysis. The design and performance analysis of asphalt pavements depend upon measuring proper material properties such as complex modulus and PR. The PR is often assumed to be time independent or it is calculated as the negative ratio of transverse to axial strains in the time domain under uniaxial loading when the time dependency is considered. This study used accurate methods to calculate the viscoelastic Poisson's Ratio (VPR) under various loading conditions and demonstrated the error associated with using inaccurate methods for calculating the PR. The results demonstrated that the VPR increased with time in uniaxial unconfined tension and compression tests where shear relaxation was generally faster than dilatational relaxation. While the VPR slightly decreased with time in uniaxial confined compression tests where the dilatational relaxation was faster than the shear relaxation. In addition, the results demonstrated that asphalt mixtures with coarse aggregate gradations had lower VPR compared to asphalt mixtures with finer aggregate gradations. Also, the VPR was found to be sensitive to the ageing and moisture conditions. The VPR decreased with ageing and increased with the level and time of moisture conditioning of the asphalt mixtures. Finally, the error introduced by incorrectly calculating the PR as the negative ratio of transverse to axial strains in the time domain was found to be significant in some cases, while it was insignificant in others.

AB Auxetics, i.e. systems with a negative Poisson's ratio, exhibit the unexpected property of becoming wider when stretched and narrower when compressed. This property arises from the manner in which the internal geometric units within the system deform when the system is submitted to a stress and may be explained in terms of geometry-deformation mechanism' based models. This work considers realistic finite implementations of the well known rotating squares system in the form of (i) a finite planar structure and (ii) a tubular conformation, as one typically finds in stents. It shows that although the existing models of the Poisson's ratios and moduli based on periodic systems may be appropriate to model systems where the geometry/deformation mechanism operate at the micro- or nano- (molecular) level where a system may be considered as a quasi infinite system, corrections to the model may need to be made when one considers finite structures with a small number of repeat units and suggests that for finite systems, especially for the 2D systems, the moduli as predicted by the periodic model may be significantly overestimating the moduli of the real system, even sometimes by as much as 200%.

AB Poisson's ratio is an important mechanical property that explains the deformation patterns of materials. A positive Poisson's ratio is a feature of the majority of materials. Some materials, however, display "auxetic" behaviors (i.e. possess negative Poisson's ratios). Indeed, auxetic and non-auxetic materials display different deformation mechanisms. Explaining these differences and their effects on the mechanics of these materials is of a significant importance.
   In this study, effects of Poisson's ratio on the mechanics of auxetic and non-auxetic nanobeams are revealed. A parametric study is provided on effects of Poisson's ratio on the static bending and free vibration behaviors of auxetic nanobeams. The general nonlocal theory is employed to model the nonlocal effects. Unlike Eringen's nonlocal theory, the general nonlocal theory uses different attenuation functions for the longitudinal and lateral strains. This theory emphasizes the Poisson's ratio-nonlocal coupling effects on the mechanics of nanomaterials. The obtained results showed that Poisson's ratio is an essential parameter for determining mechanical behaviors of nanobeams. It is demonstrated that auxetic and non-auxetic nanobeams may reflect softening or hardening behaviors depending on the ratio of the nonlocal fields of the beam's longitudinal and lateral strains.

AB Auxetics are a modern class of material fabricated by altering the material microstructure. Unlike conventional materials, auxetics exhibit a negative Poisson's ratio when subjected to tensile loading. These materials have gained popularity within the research community because of their enhanced properties, such as density, stiffness, fracture toughness and dampening. This paper provides a critical oversight of the auxetic field with particular emphasis to the auxetic foams, due to their low price, easy availability and desirable mechanical properties. Key areas discussed include the fabrication method, the effects played by different parameters (temperature, heating time, cell shape and size and volumetric compression ratio), microstructural models, mechanical properties and potential applications.

AB Compared with triangular, square and Kagome honeycombs, hexagonal honeycomb has superior heat dissipation capabilities, but its lower in-plane stiffness hinders its multifunctional applications. Regarding this problem, in this paper we propose a multifunctional hierarchical honeycomb (MHH) with negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) sub-structures. This MHH is constructed by replacing the solid cell walls of the original regular hexagonal honeycomb (ORHH) with two kinds of equal mass NPR honeycombs, the anisotropic re-entrant honeycomb or the isotropic chiral honeycomb. Based on the Euler beam theory, formulas for the Young's moduli of these two kinds of MHH structures are derived. Results show that by appropriately adjusting the geometrical parameters both the re-entrant honeycomb (when the cell-wall thickness-to-length ratio of the ORHH is less than 0.045) and the chiral honeycomb (when the cell-wall thickness-to-length ratio of the ORHH is less than 0.75) can greatly tune the in-plane stiffness of the MHH structure. The presented theory could thus be used in designing new tailorable hierarchical honeycomb structures for multifunctional applications. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Poisson's ratio, the relation between lateral contraction of a thin, linearly elastic rod when subjected to a longitudinal extension, has a long and interesting history. For isotropic bodies, it can theoretically range from + 1/2 to -1; the experimental gamut for anisotropics is even larger. The ratio is positive for all combinations of directions in most crystals. But as far back as the 1800s, Voigt and others found that negative values were encountered for some materials, a property now called auxeticity. Here we examine this property from the point of view of crystal stability and compute extrema of the ratio for various interesting and technologically important materials. Potential applications of the auxetic property are mentioned.

AB Mechanical metamaterials are man-made rationally-designed structures that present unprecedented mechanical properties not found in nature. One of the most well-known mechanical metamaterials is auxetics, which demonstrates negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) behavior that is very beneficial in several industrial applications. In this study, a specific type of auxetic metamaterial structure namely idealized 3D re-entrant structure is studied analytically, numerically, and experimentally. The noted structure is constructed of three types of struts-one loaded purely axially and two loaded simultaneously flexurally and axially, which are inclined and are spatially defined by angles theta and phi. Analytical relationships for elastic modulus, yield stress, and Poisson's ratio of the 3D re-entrant unit cell are derived based on two well-known beam theories namely Euler-Bernoulli and Timoshenko. Moreover, two finite element approaches one based on beam elements and one based on volumetric elements are implemented. Furthermore, several specimens are additively manufactured (3D printed) and tested under compression. The analytical results had good agreement with the experimental results on the one hand and the volumetric finite element model results on the other hand. Moreover, the effect of various geometrical parameters on the mechanical properties of the structure was studied, and the results demonstrated that angle theta (related to tension-dominated struts) has the highest influence on the sign of Poisson's ratio and its extent, while angle phi (related to compression-dominated struts) has the lowest influence on the Poisson's ratio. Nevertheless, the compression-dominated struts (defined by angle phi) provide strength and stiffness for the structure. The results also demonstrated that the structure could have zero Poisson's ratio for a specific range of theta and phi angles. Finally, a lightened 3D re-entrant structure is introduced, and its results are compared to those of the idealized 3D re-entrant structure.

AB The role of negative compressibility is considered in detail. Experimental observations of negative bulk modulus in prestrained foam are presented and interpreted. A constrained microscopic model which exhibits negative compressibility is proposed. Some other negative and counterintuitive properties of matter, like negative Poission's ratio, negative thermal expansion, negative specific heat, and negative pressure are also discussed. A simple thermodynamic model with negative thermal expansion is presented. (c) 2008 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

AB Auxetic lattice structures are a new kind of structures that show unique mechanical performance, particularly negative Poisson's ratio behavior. In the present study, an Al-based auxetic lattice structure has been fabricated by 3-D printing and investment casting, and the compressive mechanical behavior was studied. It is shown that Increasing the length of re-entrant struts or re-entrant angle leads to decreased compression strength but increased Poisson's ratio. If the relative density of the structures keeps constant, the elastic modulus and compression strength will be enhanced as the Poisson's ratio increases owing to the auxetic effect.

AB 2-D and 3-D micro-architectured multiphase thermoelastic metamaterials are designed and analyzed using a parametric level set method for topology optimization and the finite element method. An asymptotic homogenization approach is employed to obtain the effective thermoelastic properties of the multiphase metamaterials. The epsilon-constraint multi-objective optimization method is adopted in the formulation. The coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) and Poisson's ratio (PR) are chosen as two objective functions, with the CTE optimized and the PR treated as a constraint. The optimization problems are solved by using the method of moving asymptotes. Effective isotropic and anisotropic CTEs and stiffness constants are obtained for the topologically optimized metamaterials with prescribed values of PR under the constraints of specified effective bulk modulus, volume fractions and material symmetry. Two solid materials along with one additional void phase are involved in each of the 2-D and 3-D optimal design examples. The numerical results reveal that the newly proposed approach can integrate shape and topology optimizations and lead to optimal microstructures with distinct topological boundaries. The current method can topologically optimize metamaterials with a positive, negative or zero CTE and a positive, negative or zero Poisson's ratio.

AB Soft network materials that incorporate wavy filamentary microstructures have appealing applications in bio-integrated devices and tissue engineering, in part due to their biomimetic mechanical properties, such as "J-shaped" stress-strain curves and negative Poisson's ratios. The diversity of the microstructure geometry as well as the network topology provides access to a broad range of tunable mechanical properties, suggesting a high degree of design flexibility. The understanding of the underlying microstructure-property relationship requires the development of a general mechanics theory. Here, we introduce a theoretical model of infinitesimal deformations for the soft network materials constructed with periodic lattices of arbitrarily shaped microstructures. Taking three representative lattice topologies (triangular, honeycomb, and square) as examples, we obtain analytic solutions of Poisson's ratio and elastic modulus based on the mechanics model. These analytic solutions, as validated by systematic finite element analyses (FEA), elucidated different roles of lattice topology and microstructure geometry on Poisson's ratio of network materials with engineered zigzag microstructures. With the aid of the theoretical model, a crescent-shaped microstructure was devised to expand the accessible strain range of network materials with relative constant Poisson's ratio under large levels of stretching. This study provides theoretical guidelines for the soft network material designs to achieve desired Poisson's ratio and elastic modulus.

AB Analytical expressions are derived for the Poisson's ratios associated with a three-dimensional network of regular, corner-sharing tetrahedra in which: (1) the tetrahedra are assumed to be rigid and free to rotate relative to each other; (2) the tetrahedra are assumed to maintain shape and orientation but are free to change size (dilate); (3) tetrahedral rotation and dilation are assumed to act concurrently. The structure has a primitive unit cell containing four tetrahedra and is analogous to the molecular structure of a-cristobalite. Strain-dependent variations in Poisson's ratio are also predicted by the models. For deformation due to tetrahedral rotation the network is found to exhibit negative Poisson's ratios in each of the three principal directions, with the magnitude of the Poisson's ratio being dependent on the angle of rotation of the tetrahedra. The behaviour of the Poisson's ratio is isotropic in the transverse plane, but anisotropic elsewhere. In the dilation model negative Poisson's ratios equal to -1 are observed for uniaxial loading in any of the principal directions, with the value being constant irrespective of tetrahedral size. The model for concurrent tetrahedral rotation and dilation allows positive as well as negative Poisson's ratios, with the values determined by the framework geometry and relative strengths of the two mechanisms. The concurrent model also offers a design route to materials and structures having ultrahigh Young's moduli.

AB An analytical framework has been developed for predicting the equivalent in-plane elastic moduli (longitudinal and transverse Young's modulus, shear modulus, Poisson's ratios) of irregular auxetic honeycombs with spatially random variations in cell angles. Employing a bottom up multi-scale based approach, computationally efficient closed-form expressions have been derived in this article. This study also includes development of a highly generalized finite element code capable of accepting number of cells in two perpendicular directions, random structural geometry and material properties of irregular auxetic honeycomb and thereby obtaining five in-plane elastic moduli of the structure. The elastic moduli obtained for different degree of randomness following the analytical formulae have been compared with the results of direct finite element simulations and they are found to be in good agreement corroborating the validity and accuracy of the proposed approach. The transverse Young's modulus, shear modulus and Poisson's ratio for loading in transverse direction (effecting the auxetic property) have been found to be highly influenced by the structural irregularity in auxetic honeycombs.

AB This article investigates the effect of auxeticity on the thermal stresses of isotropic plates. The thermal stress is non-dimensionalized against the coefficient of thermal expansion, the change in temperature and at least one of the moduli so as to express the dimensionless thermal stresses solely in terms of Poisson's ratio of the plate material. Results show that increasing auxeticity leads to mild and significant drop in the thermal stresses under the conditions of constant Young's modulus and constant shear modulus, respectively. However, increasing auxeticity causes increase in the thermal stress under the condition of constant bulk modulus. It is also shown that increasing auxeticity under the condition of constant product of all the three moduli reduces the thermal stress if Poisson's ratio falls within a wide range of -1 and 0.303. These results suggest that, under most circumstances, the replacement of conventional plate materials with auxetic solids is useful for reducing thermal stresses therein. The use of auxetic materials, therefore, provides an additional choice for the reduction of thermal stresses in plates other than selecting materials of lower modulus and low coefficient of thermal expansion.

AB This paper introduces a novel fibre structure known as the helical auxetic yarn (HAY). The geometry of the yarn is defined and the manufacturing process described. A range of HAYs have been manufactured that vary the geometric properties of the structure. A systematic study of the yarns has been completed to evaluate the effect on the auxetic behaviour of the geometry. We also characterise the component fibres and yarns and discuss the influence of geometric and material effects on the observed Poisson's ratio of the yarns.
   It can be shown that the starting wrap angle of the yarn has the greatest effect on auxetic behaviour both in terms of magnitude and the strain range over which it may be observed.
   The maximum negative Poisson's ratio observed for a yarn manufactured from conventionally available monofilaments with positive Poisson's ratio is -2.7. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Auxetic polyproplyene fibres have been produced on a large-scale industrial extruder for the first time. A first batch of tests identified a coarse processing window which was then more closely defined by subsequent tests. The effects of barrel temperature, screw speed, take-up speed and quenching (through the parameters of air gap and bath temperature) on the Poisson's ratio and Young's modulus of the fibres were examined. It was found that a temperature of 200 degrees C, screw speed of 12.5 rpm and take-up speed of either 1.5 or 3.5 rpm produced fibres with a high degree of auxeticity up to 5% strain -significantly increasing the auxetic strain range previously reported for lab-scale extrusions at lower extruder temperatures. Quenching with a water bath reduced the auxeticity, so was not employed as a processing parameter. (C) 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB The effects of thermo-mechanical auxetic foam conversion parameters on the Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of open-cell polyurethane foam are related to changes in chemical bonding and cell structure. Applied volumetric compression, conversion temperature, and duration are reported on foam Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, and structural stability. Fourier transform infrared spectral analysis on samples converted at and above 160 degrees C strongly indicates a hydrogen bond interaction increase in urea groups (C=O---H-N) and an increase in hydrogen bonding population. Spectral changes inferred soft segment degradation following extensive heat exposure (200 degrees C, 180 min), specifically a shift and intensity change in CH2 and C-O-C polyol bands and a broad baseline increase between 3600 and 2400 cm(-1). These changes are linked to (i) resistance to dimensional recovery over time and during re-heating; (ii) Poisson's ratio becoming negative, then zero in tension or marginally positive in compression; (iii) Young's Modulus reducing then increasing; (iv) mass loss, evidenced by thermogravimetric analysis increasing from 150 degrees C. The minimum mean values of Poisson's ratio of approximate to-0.2 (to 10% compression/tension) are comparable to other studies. All samples that retain their imposed compression over time are isotropic, with near constant Young's moduli and Poisson's ratio (to 10% compression/tension).

AB Materials with a negative Poisson's ratio are referred to as auxetic. One recently invented example of this is the helical auxetic yarn (HAY). This has been proved to successfully exhibit auxetic behaviour both as a yarn and when incorporated into fabric. The HAY is based on a double-helix geometry where a relatively stiffer 'wrap' is helically wound around a compliant core fibre. This paper studies the effect of the interaction between the core and the wrap fibre on the auxetic behaviour of the HAY, including the effect of their relative moduli. Assessment of the Poisson's ratio of the HAYs has revealed that an elevated difference in component moduli causes the wrap fibre embedding itself into the core fibre, thus decreasing the auxetic effect. Careful determination of an optimum core-wrap moduli ratio where the ratio is high enough to yield an auxetic effect and low enough to prevent the core-indentation effect can lead to the fabrication of a yarn with largest negative Poisson's ratio.

AB The linear elastic analytical solution of an axisymmetric probe indenting a semi-infinite half-space forms the backbone of most indentation data analysis protocols. It has been noted in the literature that the theoretical solution relies on a boundary condition that is ill-posed which leads to discrepancies from the actual response that depends, among other parameters, on the Poisson's ratio of the indented material. While correction factors have been proposed, prior studies have concentrated on the positive Poisson's ratio regime and have neglected an exciting and developing class of materials: the auxetic systems. The finite element method is used to simulate the conical indentation response of elastic materials with Poisson's ratios covering the whole thermodynamically possible range, -1 <= v <= 0.5. Consistent with theoretical predictions, the indentation resistance and hardness of auxetic materials is enhanced compared to their non-auxetic counterparts. The stress profiles and contact details are systematically analyzed and the increase in resistance is traced to the shear stiffening and the reduction of contact area compared to conventional materials. Furthermore, it is shown that the analytical linear elastic solution falls short in accurately describing the indentation response, especially for negative Poisson's ratio materials. In contrast to the theoretical prediction, the contact area reduces as the Poisson's ratio increases resulting in increased required force to penetrate the material and an enhanced pressure distribution beneath the indenter. The analytical solution is corrected for the whole v range and best fit polynomials are proposed for ease-of-use. The effects of contact-friction and indenter cone-angle are also studied and quantified. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents an experimental study of tensile and deformation behavior of an auxetic plied yarn structure. The basic configuration of the plied structure formed with two soft yarns and two stiff yarns was firstly introduced. Based on this 4-ply helix structure, six kinds of yarn samples were made by different combinations of soft yarns, stiff yarns and twist levels. These yarn samples were first tested and the effects of different design parameters were analyzed. Apart from the tensile test, changes in the internal structure of two samples upon stretching were also studied through microscopic examination. Finally, double helix yarn and 6-ply auxetic yarn were made for a comparative purpose to investigate the effect of helical structure. The study shows that all of the 4-ply auxetic yarn samples exhibit negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) throughout the entire tensile process, and the magnitude of NPR gets larger with a smaller soft yarn diameter, a higher tensile modulus of stiff yarn and a lower twist level. The study also shows that auxetic behavior inside the 4-ply structure is generated by the interplay between the soft yarns and stiff yarns and 4-ply auxetic yarns have the advantages to produce immediate auxetic effect upon stretching.

AB Auxetic materials expand when stretched, and shrink when compressed. This is the result of a negative Poisson's ratio v. Isotropic configurations with v approximate to -1 have been designed and are expected to provide increased shear stiffness G. This assumes that Young's modulus and v can be engineered independently. In this article, a micropolar-continuum model is employed to describe the behavior of a representative auxetic structural network, the chiral lattice, in an attempt to remove the indeterminacy in its constitutive law resulting from v = -1. While this indeterminacy is successfully removed, it is found that the shear modulus is an independent parameter and, for certain configurations, it is equal to that of the triangular lattice. This is remarkable as the chiral lattice is subject to bending deformation of its internal members, and thus is more compliant than the triangular lattice which is stretch dominated. The derived micropolar model also indicates that this unique lattice has the highest characteristic length scale I of all known lattice topologies, as well as a negative first Lame constant without violating bounds required for thermodynamic stability. We also find that hexagonal arrangements of deformable rings have a coupling number N=1. This is the first lattice reported in the literature for which couple-stress or Mindlin theory is necessary rather than being adopted a priori. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Auxetic materials have numerous promising engineering applications such as fracture resistance and energy storage due to their negative Poisson's ratios (NPRs). However, compared to materials possessing positive Poisson's ratios (PPRs), auxetic materials are rare. In this paper, by employing first principles calculations, we found a high NPR two-dimensional (2D) material, tungsten carbide (W2C), in the transition metal carbides (MXenes). Our results of the relatively moderate Young's modulus and fracture strength as well as the critical strain showed that the 2D monolayer W2C is an extraordinary flexible material. Our DFT results also demonstrated that W2C possesses high NPRs while Hf2C and Ta2C have PPRs. Furthermore, the mechanically induced deformation mechanism and the NPR formation mechanism of W2C have been proposed. Such an intrinsic NPR in W2C is attributed to the strong coupling between the C-p and W-d orbitals in the pyramid structural unit. The mechanically induced deformation mechanism and the PPR formation mechanism of Hf2C have also been determined. The intrinsic NPR for W2C transforms to PPR upon the surface functionalization induced. The behavior occurs due to the W-C interaction weakening. The excellent NPR in the 2D MXene material combined with other outstanding properties such as the metallic state would bring about its promising engineering prospects, ranging from the metal-ion battery, to automobiles and aircraft.

One of these properties is negative Poisson's ratio which is commonly found in crystalline materials (materials with linear anisotropy). However, until now the capabilities of negative Poisson's ratios in tubular crystals (materials with curvilinear anisotropy), e.g., in today's popular nanotubes, have not been studied.

AB Materials that possess negative Poisson's ratio are termed "auxetic solids". The out-of-plane modulus of a laminate consisting of alternating positive and negative isotropic laminas (semi-auxetic laminate) is investigated in this paper. It is herein shown that the use of the inverse rule-of-mixture for obtaining the out-of-plane Young's modulus of a laminate is valid only for conventional laminates and fully auxetic laminates. The Young's modulus by inverse rule-of mixture significantly underestimates the out-of-plane Young's modulus of a semi-auxetic laminate. It is also shown that under certain conditions, the out-of-plane Young's modulus of a semi-auxetic laminate exceeds even the direct rule-of-mixture. A correction term is developed herein for incorporation into the inverse rule-of-mixture. (c) 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Auxetic materials exhibit negative Poisson's ratio and they expand in the lateral direction on stretching. In the present study, the auxetic behavior of dual helix yarn (DHY) system has been predicted through energy minimization approach. It has been proposed that the interplay between the bending and tensile energies is responsible for the generation of the auxetic behavior in a typical DHY system. The DHY system can be potentially tailored for a large negative Poisson's ratio under a broader "window" of axial tensile strains by simply downsizing the diameter of carbon based wrap yarn from micron to nanoscale. A comparison has been made between the theoretical and experimental results obtained from the literature. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Most studies on composites assume that the constituent phases have different values of stiffness. Little attention has been paid to the effect of constituent phases having distinct Poisson's ratios. This research focuses on a concurrent optimization method for simultaneously designing composite structures and materials with distinct Poisson's ratios. The proposed method aims to minimize the mean compliance of the macrostructure with a given mass of base materials. In contrast to the traditional interpolation of the stiffness matrix through numerical results, an interpolation scheme of the Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio using different parameters is adopted. The numerical results demonstrate that the Poisson effect plays a key role in reducing the mean compliance of the final design. An important contribution of the present study is that the proposed concurrent optimization method can automatically distribute base materials with distinct Poisson's ratios between the macrostructural and microstructural levels under a single constraint of the total mass.

AB Structures with negative Poisson's ratios have been widely applied in existing engineering, especially in the field of energy absorption. To design double-arrowed auxetic structures to better absorb energy, it is essential to conduct parametric analysis on their crashworthiness. In this paper, the effect of the geometric parameters on the crashworthiness performance is analyzed thoroughly on both macro-and micro-sized scales. At the macro scale, the effect of the slenderness ratio and size of the unit cell are analyzed. Additionally, the critical slenderness ratio is derived to distinguish the deformation modes under axial impact loading. At the micro scale, analysis of the effect of the angles and thickness of beams on the crashworthiness performance is conducted. It is found that the crashworthiness performance of double-arrowed auxetic structure is more sensitive to the parameters of the long-inclined beam than those of the short one. The discussion in this paper can help engineers to better design and optimize the double-arrowed crash box. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Cells sense and respond to mechanical forces, regardless of whether the source is from a normal tissue matrix, an adjacent cell or a synthetic substrate. In recent years, cell response to surface rigidity has been extensively studied by modulating the elastic modulus of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-based hydrogels. In the context of biomaterials, Poisson's ratio, another fundamental material property parameter has not been explored, primarily because of challenges involved in tuning the Poisson's ratio in biological scaffolds. Two-photon polymerization is used to fabricate suspended web structures that exhibit positive and negative Poisson's ratio (NPR), based on analytical models. NPR webs demonstrate biaxial expansion/compression behavior, as one or multiple cells apply local forces and move the structures. Unusual cell division on NPR structures is also demonstrated. This methodology can be used to tune the Poisson's ratio of several photocurable biomaterials and could have potential implications in the field of mechanobiology.

AB Poisson's ratios of cellulose I-beta and cellulose II were determined for purified ramie and mercerized samples by X-ray diffractometry. Poisson's ratio was 0.38 for [200]/[004] of cellulose I. and 0.30 for [200]/[004] and 0.46 for [110]/[004] of cellulose II. The smaller [200]/[004] Poisson's ratio for cellulose II could be ascribed to closer intermolecular association through hydrogen bonding and van der Waals forces. Poisson's ratio for [1 (1) over bar0]/[004] of cellulose II was estimated to be negative. (C) 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB This article summarizes the method of analytical formulation and computational approach of stress intensity factor and plastic zone calculation for auxetic materials, which have negative Poisson's ratio. A chiral structure-based material is selected as an object of the study due to its popularity. The stress intensity factor is used in combination with the von Mises yielding condition to estimate the plastic zone's shape and size. The results show that macroscopically the shape of the plastic zone for auxetic material is the same with that of ordinary materials. However, its size is smaller due to the reduction in its Young's modulus from the solid material of which the auxetic material is made. Microscopically, an auxetic material has its plastic zone shape that is unique to its microstructure. Homogenization theory was convenient to use to bridge between the microscopic and macroscopic models.

AB A new two-dimensional carbon-based material consisting of pentagonal and hexagonal elements is identified by numerical experiments, which is called phgraphene and possesses not only a tunable semimetallic feature but also a direction-dependent even sign-changed Poisson's ratio. The structural stability of such a new material is first checked systematically. It is found that phgraphene has a similar energy as the gamma-graphyne, a thermally stable structure from the room temperature to 1500 K, and elastic constants satisfying the Born-Huang criterion. Both the band structure and density of states are further verified with different techniques, which demonstrate a Dirac semimetallic characteristic of phgraphene. A more interesting finding is that the band structure can be easily tuned by an external loading, resulting in the transition from semimetal to semiconductor or from type I to type III. As a new material that may be applied in the future, the mechanical property of phgraphene is further evaluated. It shows that phgraphene is a typically anisotropic material, which has not only direction-dependent Young's moduli but also direction-dependent even sign-changed Poisson's ratios. The microscopic mechanisms of both the electrical and mechanical properties are revealed. Such a versatile material with tunable band structure and auxetic effect should have promising applications in the advanced nano-electronic field in the future.

None of the crystalline igneous and metamorphic rocks (e.g., amphibolite, gabbro, granite, peridotite, and schist) display auxetic behavior at pressures of >5MPa and room temperature. Our experimental measurements showed that quartz-rich sedimentary rocks (i.e., sandstone and siltstone) are most likely to be the only rocks with negative Poisson's ratios at low confining pressures (200MPa) because their main constituent mineral, -quartz, already has extremely low Poisson's ratio (upsilon=0.08) and they contain microcracks, micropores, and secondary minerals. This finding may provide a new explanation for formation of dome-and-basin structures in quartz-rich sedimentary rocks in response to a horizontal compressional stress in the upper crust.

AB Monte Carlo simulations in the isobaric-isothermal ensemble with variable shape of the periodic box are used to study elastic properties of two-dimensional (2D) model systems of hard discs with parallel layers of hard cyclic hexamers. Both the particles in their pure phases form elastically isotropic crystals. However, the crystal of discs shows positive and that of hexamers negative Poisson's ratio (PR). The studied systems with layers are of low symmetry. Hence, a general analytic formula for the orientational dependence of PR in 2D systems is applied to such systems. It is shown that, by changing parameters of the particles and their relative concentration, as well as orientation of the layers, one can obtain systems which are non-auxetic (their PR is positive), auxetic (their PR is negative), or partially auxetic ones (their PR is negative for some directions and positive for other ones). If the disks and hexamers are interpreted as small molecules, the obtained results indicate that by introducing auxetic nano-layers one can strongly modify PR of crystals or even thin layers.

AB Recent advances in lithography technology and the spread of 3D printers allow us a facile fabrication of special materials with complicated microstructures. The materials are called "designed materials" or "architectured materials" and provide new opportunities for material development. These materials, which owing to their rationally designed architectures exhibit unusual properties at the micro- and nano-scales, are being widely exploited in the development of modern materials with customized and improved performance. Meta-materials are found to possess superior and unusual properties as regards static modulus (axial stress divided by axial strain), density, energy absorption, smart functionality, and negative Poisson's ratio (NPR). However, in spite of recent developments, it has only been feasible to fabricate a few such meta-materials and to implement them in practical applications. Against such a backdrop, a broad review of the wide range of cellular auxetic structures for mechanical metamaterials available at our disposal and their potential application areas is important. Classified according to their geometrical configuration, this paper provides a review of cellular auxetic structures. The structures are presented with a view to tap into their potential abilities and leverage multidimensional fabrication advances to facilitate their application in industry. In this review, there is a special emphasis on state-of-the-art applications of these structures in important domains such as sensors and actuators, the medical industry, and defense while touching upon ways to accelerate the material development process.

   modulus; Poisson ratio; Thermal shock
AB Investigations into the changes of Poisson's ratio as well as other mechanical properties of selected types of refractories subjected to thermal shocks have been carried out. The investigations included several types of porous refractory materials e.g. magnesia, magnesia-spinel, magnesia-chrome, chrome-magnesia, mullite, silica and low cement chamotte castable. The Poisson's ratio value of the examined materials decreased after each thermal shock. Decreasing of Poisson ratio caused by a stronger drop in Young's modulus than that for shear modulus was explained.
   It was found that some tested materials were characterized by low values of Poisson's ratio, which after series of severe thermal shocks decreased even to negative values. In order to explain the observed phenomenon, an attempt to correlate the obtained results with the microstructure of materials before and after a series of thermal shocks was undertaken. A hypothetical model of the microstructure of a porous ceramic material with negative Poisson ratio was proposed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l. All rights reserved.

DE Foam; Poisson's ratio; Auxetic; Mechanical properties; Shape memory

ID POISSON RATIO; POLYMER
AB Shape memory is the property of a material to remember its original shape despite subsequent plastic deformation. The exposure to specific temperature profiles induces a shape memory effect on auxetic (negative Poisson's ratio) foam specimens, returning them to their initial dimensions. This behaviour is a one-way effect, and it is a property of the polyurethane (PU) constituent of the foam. The foam specimens were transformed from conventional Poisson's ratio to auxetic, returned to conventional and once again to auxetic under multiple mechanical and thermal loading. At each stage the foams were mechanically characterized under cyclic tensile and compressive loading. The manufacturing route adopted for the auxetic PU specimens involved a multiaxial compression of the native foam, heating of the compressed specimens above the T-g of the foam polymer, and cooling under running water. Twenty specimens, divided equally between two varieties of PU-based foam, were fabricated. Two different compression ratios were used during auxetic conversion for both kinds of foam, and the same final temperature of 135 degrees C was adopted. Tensile and compressive cyclic tests were performed in order to measure the tangent modulus (i.e. stiffness), Poisson's ratios and energy dissipated per unit volume. Remarkable differences before and after the memory effect took place were found, showing mechanical behaviour unique to each of these phases. The shape memory effect plays an important role in the mechanical behaviour of the auxetic foams. (C) 2009 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB More and more researches have been focused on auxetic composite materials and a number of composite structures have been fabricated, synthesized or theoretically predicted. Since their structures are complex, their mechanical behavior is very difficult to be characterized. The purpose of the present paper is to systematically investigate the negative Poisson's ratio effect of a novel three-dimensional auxetic orthogonal textile composite under compression. Firstly, a set of equations are derived for the theoretical calculation of the Poisson's ratio of the composite under uniaxial compression via an analytical analysis. Secondly, a finite element model (FEM) is created by ANSYS Parameter Design Language and is verified by experiment. The deviation between the simulation and experimental results are carefully discussed. Thirdly, the effects of geometry parameters and material properties on the negative Poisson's ratio behavior of the composite are discussed based on the FEM simulated results. At last, a general basis is concluded. It is expected that the outcomes of this study could be useful to guide the design and fabrication of auxetic textile composites with required negative Poisson's ratio behavior.

AB Diamond-like structures, that include sp(2) and sp(3) hybridized carbon atoms, are of considerable interest nowadays. In the present work, various carbon auxetic structures are studied by the combination of molecular dynamics (MD) and analytical approach. Two fullerites based on the fullerene C-60 and fullerene-like molecule C-48 are investigated as well as diamond-like structures based on other fullerene-like molecules (called fulleranes), carbon nanotubes (called tubulanes) and graphene sheets. MD is used to find the equilibrium states of the structures and calculate compliance and stiffness coefficients for stable configurations. Analytical methods are used to calculate the engineering elastic coefficients (Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, shear modulus and bulk modulus), and to study their transformation under rotation of the coordinate system. All the considered structures are partial auxetics with the negative value of Poisson's ratio for properly chosen tensile directions. It is shown that some of these structures, in a particular tension direction, have a very high Young's modulus, that is, 1852 GPa for tubulane TA6.

AB Textile structures with negative Poisson's ratio (PR) behavior are called auxetic textile structures. They have received increasing attention in recent years and have been designed and fabricated through spinning, knitting, weaving and non-woven methods. However, auxetic textile structures fabricated using braiding method have not been reported so far. This paper reported a novel type of auxetic braided structure based on a helical structural arrangement. The geometry of the structure and its deformation mechanism were first introduced and described. Then a special manufacturing process was developed by the modification of commonly used tubular braiding technology. Various auxetic braids were fabricated with different structural parameters and yarns and tested under uniaxial extension conditions. The results showed that all manufactured braids exhibited high negative PR behavior and maintained this behavior until the fracture of the component wrap yarn. Among three structural parameters discussed, namely wrap angle, braiding angle and braiding yarn diameter, the wrap angle had more effects on the tensile properties of auxetic braided structure than the other two parameters. The success of fabricating auxetic braids with commercially available yarns in this study provides an alternative way to manufacture auxetics from positive PR materials.

AB This paper presents an isogeometric shape optimization framework using genetic algorithm to design 2D auxetic structures with prescribed Poisson's ratio over large tensile or compressive strains in the nonlinear deformation regime. The design domain is parametrized using NURBS to allow smoother shape variation of the structure and enable accurate fabrication of the optimized structures. The versatility of the framework is illustrated through the optimization of a missing rib structure with four ligaments under different loading conditions. The manufacturability of specimens using the NURBS and PolyJet 3D printing technology is also shown. The first example focuses on achieving constant negative Poisson's ratio up to -0.7 within the applied tensile strain of 50% under plane stress condition. As auxetics experiments under large compressive strain are rarely performed and published, the second example demonstrates the optimization for compressive loading. The Poisson's ratio determined from experiments matches well with the numerical results. The experiments highlight that for very flexible materials, deformation under self-weight and contacts between adjacent unit cells are significant factors in compression, and further investigations are needed.

AB In this paper, two new 2D re-entrant topologies with negative Poisson's ratio are presented and their mechanical properties (Poisson's ratio and energy absorption capacity) are studied using finite element method as a function of geometric parameters. The first topology (model 1) was constructed by adding two sinusoidal-shaped ribs into the classical re-entrant topology, while the second topology (model 2) was made by introducing extra vertical ribs to reinforce the sinusoidal-shaped ribs. Simulation results show that model 1 and model 2 topologies can reach a minimum value in Poisson's ratio of - 1.12 and - 0.58 with an appropriate geometric aspect ratio, respectively. The energy absorption capacities of model 1, model 2 and classical re-entrant model were studied at various compression velocities. Enhanced energy absorption capacities were observed in the two new re-entrant topologies compared with the classical re-entrant topology. Model 2 exhibited the highest energy absorption capacity and a highest plateau stress. The plateau stress of model 1 was about half that of model 2, and when the compression velocity is more than 20 m/s, the plateau stress of model 1 became lower than that of the classical re-entrant model.

AB Open cell foams with auxeticity and modulus 5 times larger than the stiffest auxetic polymeric open cell foam featured in scientific literature are developed in this paper by using vacuum bags and autoclave following a thermoforming process. The resulting foam is transverse isotropic with microstructures exhibiting elongated semi-reticulated configurations, and contains a plane in which the auxetic behavior is evident. Tensile and compression quasi-static tests were carried out on samples cut along different directions and with different thicknesses. Foams have been also subjected to tensile training at different maximum strains to assess their mechanical performance. The tensile modulus and Poisson's ratio values of the auxetic foams produced in this work can reach 25 MPa and-0.4 in one plane and can feature a negative Poisson's ratio up to-1.3 for thinner specimens. Smaller thicknesses and higher tensile training strains can also reduce the stiffness but enhance the auxeticity of this porous material. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Auxetic metamaterials have generated a great deal of interest in recent years. In this letter, a novel approach which can be used to produce such auxetic metamaterials is presented. This method involves the introduction of patterned slit perforations within a sheet/block of material in order to create systems which resemble a large variety of auxetic systems ranging from rotating units to chiral honeycombs. These perforated systems have also been shown to have the potential to exhibit giant negative Poisson's ratios. (C) 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB In an effort to tailor functional materials with customized anisotropic properties-stiffness and yield strain, we propose porous materials consisting of flexible mesostructures designed from the deformation of a re-entrant auxetic honeycomb and compliant mechanisms. Using an analogy between compliant mechanisms and a cellular material's deformation, we can tailor the in-plane properties of mesostructures; low stiffness and high strain in one direction and high stiffness and low strain in the other direction. An analytical model is developed to obtain the effective moduli and yield strains of the porous materials by combining the kinematics of a rigid link mechanism and deformation of flexure hinges. A numerical technique is implemented with the analytical model for the nonlinear constitutive relations of the mesostructures and their strain-dependent Poisson's ratios. A finite element analysis (FEA) is used to validate the analytical and numerical models. The designed moduli and yield strain of porous materials with an aluminum alloy are 2 GPa and 0.28% in one direction and 0.2 MPa and 28% in the other direction. These porous materials with mesostructures have high negative Poisson's ratios, v(xy)* down to -82 due to the large rotation of the link member in the transverse direction caused by the input displacement in the longitudinal direction. The porous materials also show higher moduli for compressive loading due to the contact of flexure hinges. This paper demonstrates that compliant mesostructures can be used for next-generation material design in terms of customized mechanical properties; modulus, strength, strain, and Poisson's ratio. The proposed mesostructures can also be easily manufactured using a conventional cutting method.

AB The method for determining the Poisson's ratio of isotropic spheres was studied via resonant ultrasound spectroscopy (RUS). To that end, The mode structure maps for freely vibrating isotropic spheres were obtained via finite element method over the full range of Poisson's ratio (-1 to +0.5). RUS measurements for spherical samples (indium, steel, SiO2, 13.5 wt% In-Sn, and copper foam) were compared with the numerical results and the Poisson's ratios were determined as +0.4, +03, +0.2, -0.08, and -0.3, respectively. The effects of slight shape imperfection upon the first 12 modes were analyzed for various Poisson's ratios, and were found to be negligible in interpretation of the experimental results.

AB Brillouin scattering measurements of the single-crystal elastic properties of the as-made zeolite silicalite vertical bar(C(3)H(7))(4)NF vertical bar(4)[Si(96)O(192)]-MFI provides the first experimental evidence for on-axis negative Poisson's ratios (auxeticity) in a synthetic zeolite structure. MFI laterally contracts when compressed and laterally expands when stretched along x(1) and x(2) directions in the (001) plane (nu(12)=-0.061, nu(21)=-0.051). The aggregate Poisson's ratio of MFI, although positive, has an anomalously low value nu=0.175(3) compared to other silicate materials. These results suggest that the template-free MFI-silicalite [Si(96)O(192)] might have potential applications as tunable sieve where molecular discriminating characteristics are adjusted by application of stress along specific axes.

AB Limited number of papers describe the practical use of auxetics in the wood and furniture sector. Only one paper describes the auxetic nails. None of them analyzed the impact of using auxetics on the strength of furniture joints. The aim of this investigation was to design and manufacture different kinds of auxetic dowels with corresponding muffs and experimentally, theoretically, and numerically analyze the minimum mounting forces, contact pressures, and friction coefficients of these dowels in particleboard. Firstly, auxetic properties of the dowels were numerically determined, and then obtained values were confirmed by real compression tests in order to be sure that the dowels had negative Poisson's ratios. All dowels were manufactured from polyamide (PA12) with 3D printing Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) technology. Static compression tests were carried out for obtaining the minimum mounting force needed to insert the dowel into the muff. Numerical analyses were performed by means of Abaqus/Explicit v6.14-2 software. Contact pressures and friction coefficients were also theoretically calculated and compared to the results of numerical analyses and real tests. At the end of the tests, the auxetic dowels gave lower mounting force values than the non-auxetic dowels. Mounting force values of dowels decreased as the dowel hole diameter and size of inclusions are increased. Furthermore, the contact pressures on the surface of the auxetic dowels were considerably lower than in the non-auxetic dowels. In conclusion, it could be said that the auxetic dowels could be utilized as an alternative fastener for the traditional furniture dowels. Therefore, withdrawal strength and corner joint tests of the auxetic dowels should be investigated in future studies.

AB Critical drawback of poor stiffness in traditional auxetic materials limits them to be applied where negative Poisson's ratio behavior and excellent load-bearing capacity are simultaneously desired. In this work, a general prescription for designing auxetic lattice structures with high stiffness and controllable isotropic/anisotropic elastic properties is proposed. Based on it, we rationally design a class of novel auxetic lattice structures whose deformation is mainly governed by the stretching mechanisms and conducted an investigation on a tree-like re-entrant structure. A combination of theoretical predictions, numerical simulations and tensile test experiments have been carried out to gain a comprehensive understanding of the structural in-plane elastic mechanical properties along both the principal axes as well as in the off-axis directions. Besides, theoretical model for designing tree-like re-entrant structure with isotropic elastic properties is established and experimentally verified with specimens fabricated with CFRP composite. The results of this research has proven the tree-like re-entrant structure exhibits excellent effective Young's modulus, shear modulus and obvious negative Poisson's ratio effect along omni-direction. Investigation on the directional dependence of structural effective elastic properties has further indicated the proposed structure presents a great potential for designing auxetic material with controllable anisotropic elastic properties. In particular, the proposed structure is capable in achieving isotropic design with any negative Poisson's ratio between -1 and 0. The design philosophy presented in this paper provides a general prescription for solving the challenge of poor stiffness in traditional auxetic materials and paves a new way for isotropic auxetic design.

AB Materials with unusual mechanical properties can be potentially used as matrices to create high-performance lightweight composites. The appearance of materials with negative Poisson's ratio (auxetics), has led to the evaluation of auxetic composites for possible engineering applications. Because the experimental evaluation of composites with specific properties is expensive and time consuming, computational modelling and simulation provide efficient alternatives to predict the parameters of the composites. In this paper a finite element method was used to find the engineering constants (Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio) of auxetic composites consisting of concentric cylindrical inclusions made of combinations of auxetic and classic (non-auxetic) materials. It has been observed that not only the mechanical properties of the different composite phases influence the effective mechanical properties of the whole composite, but also the location of the same material phases do matter.

TI A new method for assessing Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio in tight
   interbedded clastic reservoirs without a shear wave time difference

AB Tight clastic reservoirs are an important aspect of hydrocarbon exploration and development worldwide. The Xu5 section of the Upper Triassic Xujiahe Formation in the western Sichuan Basin of central China contains tight terrestrial clastic reservoirs. The depth of these reservoirs is greater than 3000 m, while the thickness is generally greater than 500-580 m; the tight sandstone and shale reservoirs are frequently interbedded. Based on the proportion of sandstone and shale, the reservoirs can be divided into four types: sand-rich, interbedded Type I, interbedded Type II, and shale-rich. Horizontal wells and multistage fracturing are used due to the complexity and significant heterogeneity of the tight clastic reservoirs in the study area. The Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of the reservoir rocks are the two most significant parameters that must be evaluated when implementing these key techniques. Based on mechanical and acoustic tests, a new assessment system for the Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio based on the Hoek-Brown criterion was proposed. This evaluation system does not require the shear wave time difference; thus, the increase in error caused by the unreliability of the shear wave time difference can be avoided when assessing strata with complex geological structures. This method can be directly applied in single wells using only conventional longitudinal wave time difference log data. After converting the wave velocity of the high experimental frequency into the wave velocity of the logging frequency using the acoustic dispersion technique, the analysis results were applicable to the log evaluations. The relationship between the Hoek-Brown criterion parameters and the mechanical and acoustic parameters of the rock were systematically analyzed. By distinguishing the lithologies, the equations for the Young's moduli of tight sandstones and shales were established based on the Hoek-Brown criterion. The Young's modulus can be expressed using only the longitudinal wave velocity (V-p). A significant negative correlation exists between the Poisson's ratio and Young's modulus; therefore, the Poisson's ratio can be evaluated from the Young's modulus. The errors of the Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio predicted by the proposed assessment method are small, which meets engineering requirements and validates the accuracy of the method.

AB Two-dimensional lattice structures with specific geometric features have been reported to have a negative Poisson's ratio, termed as auxetic metamaterials, that is, stretching-induced expansion in the transversal direction. In this paper, we designed a novel auxetic metamaterial; by utilizing the shape memory effect of the constituent materials, the in-plane moduli and Poisson's ratios can be continuously tailored. During deformation, the curved meshes ensure the rotation of the mesh joints to achieve auxetics. The rotations of these mesh joints are governed by the mesh curvature, which continuously changes during deformation. Because of the shape memory effect, the mesh curvature after printing can be programmed, which can be used to tune the rotation of the mesh joints and the mechanical properties of auxetic metamaterial structures, including Poisson's ratios, moduli, and fracture strains. Using the finite element method, the deformation of these auxetic meshes was analyzed. Finally, we designed and fabricated gradient/digital patterns and cylindrical shells and used the auxetics and shape memory effects to reshape the printed structures.

AB Two-dimensional hierarchical re-entrant honeycomb structures were designed and the mechanical behaviors of the structures were studied using a finite element method. Hierarchical re-entrant structure of order n (n >= 1) was constructed by replacing each vertex of a lower order (n - 1) hierarchical re-entrant structure with a smaller re-entrant hexagon with identical strut aspect ratio. The Poisson's ratio and energy absorption capacity of re-entrant structures of different hierarchical orders were studied under different compression velocities. The results showed that the Poisson's ratio of the first and second order hierarchical structures can reach -1.36 and -1.33 with appropriate aspect ratio, 13.8% and 12.1% lower than that of the zeroth order hierarchical structure. The energy absorption capacity of the three models increased with an increasing compression velocity; the second order hierarchical structure exhibited the highest rate of increase in energy absorption capacity with an increasing compression velocity. The plateau stresses of the first and second order hierarchical structures were slightly lower than that of the zeroth order hierarchical structure; however the second order hierarchical structure exhibited the highest energy absorption capacity at high compression velocity (60 m s(-1)).

   Poisson's ratio
AB The objective of this work was to propose a method for dynamic testing of Poisson's ratio of dimension lumber. Based on the first-order bending mode shape of cantilever slab, Sitka Spruce was selected as research object using instruments including four-channel dynamic resistance strain gauge and CRAS vibration and a set of collection-analysis system for dynamic signal. Free vibration of cantilever specimen of Sitka Spruce and mild steel can be stimulated by knocking, and the fundamental vibration should be reserved by filtering processing. Additionally, decaying curve of oscillatory waves for transverse and longitudinal strain of fundamental vibration should also be recorded and displayed. Obtained from the positive (negative) peak in oscillatory wave curve for transverse strain, Poisson's ratios along grain and across grain on radial section and that across grain on transverse section of Sitka Spruce specimens were measured. Then measured results were applied to analyse the accuracy of calculated modulus of elasticity obtained by plugging the first-order bending frequency measured by cantilever slab into equation of cantilever beam, and this method is proved to be robust and accurate. The method based on first-order bending mode shape of cantilever slab to measure dimension lumber Poisson's ratio is efficient and simple, with good repeatability and high accuracy. Besides, the same method was also applied to test Poisson's ratio of mild steel to validate the correctness of the method on wood. It is observed that the positive (negative) peak in oscillatory wave curve for transverse strain is corresponding to that for longitudinal strain, meaning that the phase difference, between oscillatory wave curves for transverse strain and longitudinal strain, is 180 degrees, or that transverse strain and longitudinal strain are reversed. The average value should be taken after calculating the ratios between peak-to-peak values read from the first channel and the second channel in oscillatory wave curve. The results show that the Poisson's ratio along grain of Sitka Spruce specimen is one order higher than that across grain, which indicates the anisotropy of wood. The test results validated that the elastic modulus of the lumber can be accurately derived by substituting the first-order fixed frequency, measured with the cantilever plate of Sitka Spruce specimen, into the cantilever theoretical equation. This research can provide reference to practical measurement and assessment of mechanical properties of wood and steel.

AB A class of three-dimensional lattice structures of cubic symmetry is designed by spatially assembling and merging a number of two-dimensional re-entrant honeycomb structures. We demonstrate that the effective thermoelastic properties of these structures are widely tunable by tailoring the microstructural geometry and/or constituent materials. Particularly, they possess negative effective Poisson's ratios. If the inclined and non-inclined walls are of dissimilar thermal expansion coefficients, they can further attain isotropic negative or positive effective thermal expansion coefficients with a magnitude as large as several to dozens of times that of the constituent materials. Owing to these novel properties, they are well suitable as structural or functional components in engineering systems for preventing or harnessing thermal and/or mechanical deformation.

   BEHAVIOR
AB Materials and structures with negative Poisson's ratio exhibit a counter-intuitive behaviour. Under uniaxial compression (tension), these materials and structures contract (expand) transversely. The materials and structures that possess this feature are also termed as 'auxetics'. Many desirable properties resulting from this uncommon behaviour are reported. These superior properties offer auxetics broad potential applications in the fields of smart filters, sensors, medical devices and protective equipment. However, there are still challenging problems which impede a wider application of auxetic materials. This review paper mainly focuses on the relationships among structures, materials, properties and applications of auxetic metamaterials and structures. The previous works of auxetics are extensively reviewed, including different auxetic cellular models, naturally observed auxetic behaviour, different desirable properties of auxetics, and potential applications. In particular, metallic auxetic materials and a methodology for generating 3D metallic auxetic materials are reviewed in details. Although most of the literature mentions that auxetic materials possess superior properties, very few types of auxetic materials have been fabricated and implemented for practical applications. Here, the challenges and future work on the topic of auxetics are also presented to inspire prospective research work. This review article covers the most recent progress of auxetic metamaterials and auxetic structures. More importantly, several drawbacks of auxetics are also presented to caution researchers in the future study.

Negative Poisson's ratios were observed from 24 degrees C to 67 degrees C for alloys near the phase boundary. Properties were unaffected by annealing at 100 degrees C for 2 days. This isotropic fully dense negative Poisson's ratio material is temperature insensitive, in contrast to other materials that undergo phase transformation. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

AB Nature has evolved with a recurring strategy to achieve unusual mechanical properties through coupling variable elastic moduli from a few GPa to below KPa within a single tissue. The ability to produce multi-material, three-dimensional (3D) micro-architectures with high fidelity incorporating dissimilar components has been a major challenge in man-made materials. Here we show multimodulus metamaterials whose architectural element is comprised of encoded elasticity ranging from rigid to soft. We found that, in contrast to ordinary architected materials whose negative Poisson's ratio is dictated by their geometry, these type of metamaterials are capable of displaying Poisson's ratios from extreme negative to zero, independent of their 3D micro-architecture. The resulting low density metamaterials is capable of achieving functionally graded, distributed strain amplification capabilities within the metamaterial with uniform micro-architectures. Simultaneous tuning of Poisson's ratio and moduli within the 3D multi-materials could open up a broad array of material by design applications ranging from flexible armor, artificial muscles, to actuators and bio-mimetic materials.

AB Normally, enhancement of mechanical properties of auxetic cellular materials is at the expense of its negative Poisson's ratio. Here, two novel auxetic cellular structures are proposed, with the Young's modulus and yield strength of the auxetic structures significantly enhanced and without sacrifice of their negative Poisson's ratio in the corresponding perpendicular direction. Analytical solutions and finite element simulations are carried out to predict the mechanical properties of these new auxetic materials, and the results are validated by the experiments. In addition, the Young's moduli and strengths of the novel structures can be designed independently with the corresponding Poisson's ratios. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The ship's pedestal is the connection structure between the ship's equipment and the hull, and is also the basis for the installation of the equipment. The pedestal bears both the static load generated by the weight of the equipment and the dynamic load generated during the operation of the equipment, and at the same time transmits the external load received by the hull to the equipment, and the load it bears is very complicated. If there is a problem with the pedestal in an impact environment, the accuracy of the system equipment will be affected, the system equipment will not work properly. Negative Poisson's ration structures have a unique set of properties because of their tensile expansion, such as increased shear modulus, enhanced fracture toughness, better energy absorption and co-curvature. In recent years, the negative Poisson's ration honeycomb structure has been applied to the pedestal of marine equipment, which demonstrates good vibration damping effect. However, the pedestal has two functions: vibration damping and impact resistance, there is not much research on the impact resistance of the pedestal. In this paper, an "arrow-shaped" honeycomb pedestal is taken as the research object. Firstly, the analytical expression of the Poisson's ration of the honeycomb pedestal is derived theoretically and the influence of each parameter on the Poisson's ration is analyzed. Secondly, the effect of Poisson's ration on the impact resistance of the pedestal was analyzed by ensuring that the pedestal height was constant. It was found that with the reduction of Poisson's ration, the impact resistance of the pedestal and the output impact environment of the pedestal panel were effectively optimized. Finally, by ensuring that the height of the pedestal is constant and the Poisson's ration is the same, the influence of the number of honeycomb layers on the impact resistance of the pedestal is analyzed.

It is shown that such behaviour is scale-independent and may be obtained from particular conformations of this highly versatile system. This model may be used to explain the auxetic behaviour in auxetic foams and in other related cellular systems; such materials are widely known for their superior performance in various practical applications. It may also be used as a blueprint for the design and manufacture of new man-made multifunctional systems, including auxetic and negative compressibility systems, which can be made to have tailor-made mechanical properties.

AB Auxetic materials or structures on the application of a tensile or compressive load expand or contract laterally, respectively. Over the years, multiple auxetic structures have been proposed. The most studied type is the re-entrant honeycomb model. In this work, a novel modified re-entrant honeycomb model is proposed to improve the elastic properties of the structure by adding additional members to the unit cell. Analytical equations for the Poisson's ratio, strain, deflection and Young's modulus are derived in two orthogonal directions. The proposed model provides significantly higher values of Negative Poisson's Ratio (NPR) for the same relative density in loading in one direction at the cost of other orthogonal direction when compared to the existing re-entrant honeycomb model. The results are evaluated for multiple geometric parameters for the calculation of NPR. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Materials with negative Poisson's ratios (auxetic) get fatter when stretched and thinner when compressed. This paper discusses a new explanation for achieving auxetic behaviour in foam cellular materials, namely a 'rotation of rigid units' mechanism. Such auxetic cellular materials can be produced from conventional open-cell cellular materials if the ribs of cell are slightly thicker in the proximity of the joints when compared to the centre of the ribs with the consequence that if the conventional cellular material is volumetrically compressed (and then 'frozen' in the compressed conformation), the cellular structure will deform in such a way which conserves the geometry at the joints (i.e. behave like 'rigid units') whilst the major deformations will occur along the length of the more flexible ribs which form 'kinks' at their centres as a result of the extensive buckling. It is proposed that uniaxial tensile loading of such cellular systems will result auxetic behaviour due to re-unfolding of these 'kinks' and re-rotation of the 'rigid joints'.

AB Based on lightweight design concepts, lattices are increasingly considered as internal structures. This work deals with the simulation of periodically constructed lattices to characterize their behaviour under different loadings considering various material models. A thermo-mechanical analysis was done, which is resulting in negative CLTE-values (Coefficient of Linear Thermal Expansion). Simulations with linear-elastic behaviour were evaluated regarding the tensile, compression and shear modulus and the Poisson's ratio. Some of the investigated structures behave auxetic. Beside the linear elastic behaviour, also the hyper-elastic and visco-elastic behaviour of some structures were investigated. Furthermore, elasto-plastic simulations were performed where the applied loading was biaxial. As a result the initial yield surfaces were presented. The individual RVEs (Representative Volume Elements) can be utilized for different areas of application dependent on the used materials.

AB Mechanical metamaterials exhibit unusual mechanical properties that originate from their topological design. Origami graphene may provide a platform for constructing novel carbon nanostructures. In the current study, a novel composite material that incorporates aligned graphene with localized origami shapes into the copper matrix is designed. Unlike many auxetic materials that have void phase, the proposed layer-by-layer assembled composite material appears to be solid in the microscopic scale. Based on the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, it is observed that depending on the origami shapes, the in-plane Poisson's ratio of origami graphene reinforced copper (100) composites can be tuned from positive to negative and, more importantly, it is discovered that the Young's modulus of the graphene/Cu composites can also be tuned from positive to negative in certain in-plane directions.

AB The effective elastic properties 3-layered plates consisting of auxetic and nonauxetic cubic crystals are investigated based on stretching and bending modes. In many cases effective Young's modulus is higher than Young's modulus of the stiffest layer with sufficiently thick auxetic layers. In stretching, 3-layered nonauxetic-auxetic-nonauxetic plates exhibit positive out-of-plane Poisson's ratio. In-plane Poisson's ratios are negative in the case of relatively soft nonauxetic layers and positive for stiff nonauxetics. The effective Young's moduli can exceed the original Young's moduli of all three layers of the auxetic-nonauxetic-auxetic category. For this category, both effective Poisson's ratios are negative more often and in-plane Poisson's ratio increases with Young's moduli of the original nonauxetics.
   In addition to well-known Poisson's ratio under stretching, the concept of Poisson's ratio under pure bending is introduced. There is a large difference between them in the case of 3-layered plate. Effective in-plane Poisson's ratio for symmetrical 3-layered plates are different depending on the loading mode, i.e. the outer layers exert a greater influence under bending mode in comparison to stretching mode. Therefore, nonauxetic-auxetic-non-auxetic cubic plates exhibit an overall auxetic and nonauxetic behaviour under stretching and bending modes, respectively, while the reverse is true for auxetic-nonauxetic-auxetic cubic plates.

AB The strain-dependent behaviour characteristic of auxetic (i.e. having a negative Poisson's ratio) polymers has been modelled using a simple geometric model which consists of rectangular nodules interconnected by fibrils. Careful consideration of the correct form of the model to use depending on the experimental method employed to test samples of auxetic ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) has resulted in very good agreement between the experimental and theoretical Poisson's ratios and total engineering strain ratios when the deformation is predominantly due to hinging of the fibrils.
   Auxetic UHMWPE has been processed to yield a very wide range of Poisson's ratios depending on its microstructural parameters (i.e. nodule shape and size, fibril length and the angle between the fibril and nodule). These can be predicted using the model, allowing the possibility of tailoring Poisson's ratio of the material.

AB A general expression for the Poisson's ratio (PR) of square or 2D cubic materials is discussed in terms of the elastic moduli ratios,X=G/KandY=G/W, whereGandWare the shear moduli, andKis the bulk modulus. The entireXY-plane is partitioned into nonauxetic, partially auxetic, and auxetic regions by two straight lines. A representation of theXY-plane with the elastic constant ratio lambda=C12/C44is exploited to investigate 2D square materials under nonzero hydrostatic pressure. It is demonstrated that 2D square materials with lambda>0can be auxetic only under negative pressure. Similarities and differences between the corresponding descriptions of auxetic behavior of cubic 3D materials are pointed out.

AB Materials with a negative Poisson's ratio (auxetic) exhibit the unusual property of becoming wider when stretched and thinner when compressed. A naturally occurring auxetic material which has attracted a lot of research in recent years is alpha-cristobalite, a silicate for which negative Poisson's ratios have been experimentally measured. We present the results of force-field based molecular modelling studies which will provide an insight into nano-level deformations that occur when this silicate is subjected to externally applied uniaxial mechanical stresses. These results will suggest that the auxetic behaviour can be explained in terms of a 'rotation of rigid units' model and, more specifically we will show that the auxetic behaviour in the (010) and (100) planes may be explained in terms of 'rotating rectangles' which are the projections of the three-dimensional silicate framework in the (010) and (100) planes.

AB An incremental (or tangent) bulk modulus for finite isotropic elasticity is defined which compares an increment in hydrostatic pressure with the corresponding increment in relative volume. Its positivity provides a stringent criterion for physically reasonable response involving the second derivatives of the strain energy function. Also, an average (or secant) bulk modulus is defined by comparing the current stress with the relative volume change. The positivity of this bulk modulus provides a physically reasonable response criterion less stringent than the former. The concept of incremental bulk modulus is extended to anisotropic elasticity. For states of uniaxial tension an incremental Poisson's ratio and an incremental Young's modulus are similarly defined for nonlinear isotropic elasticity and have properties similar to those of the incremental bulk modulus. The incremental Poisson's ratios for the isotropic constraints of incompressibility, Bell, Ericksen, and constant area are considered. The incremental moduli are all evaluated for a specific example of the compressible neo-Hookean solid. Bounds on the ground state Lame elastic moduli, assumed positive, are given which are sufficient to guarantee the positivity of the incremental bulk and Young's moduli for all strains. However, although the ground state Poisson's ratio is positive we find that the incremental Poisson's ratio becomes negative for large enough axial extensions.

AB The main content dealt with in the paper was to present a flexible auxetic re-entrant honeycomb fabric, which was made of a formulated thermoplastic polyurethane material PolyFlex with super elastic properties by 3D printing technology. The auxetic fabric shows perpendicular expansion under tension and is flexible. So. its special property makes auxetic fabric have great potential in future functional materials. Wherein, the honeycomb cell angle is a key factor affecting Poisson's ratio of fabric. In this paper, flexible re-entrant honeycomb structures with different cell angle are manufactured using 3D printing technology. The shape change under tension of two directions were investigated. The re-entrant honeycomb structures presented negative Poisson's ratio immediately when stretched. The shape change consisted of three stages in X-1-direction, the same as that in X-2-direction. A noticeable discovery was that the shape change in X-1-direction posed an out-plane change after the first shape change stage, while the shape change in X-2-direction always remained in-plane in the whole tension process. The tensile modulus tested was consistent with the tendency of theoretical analysis of previous work. The bending rigidities were tested and similar to fabrics of poplin and denim. The results indicate that the auxetic fabric is suitable for special clothing.

AB Auxetic materials and structures exhibit the very unusual property of becoming wider when stretched and narrower when squashed (i.e. they have a negative 'Poisson's ratio'). This property results in many beneficial effects in the characteristics of the system that make auxetics superior to conventional systems in many practical and high tech applications, including aeronautics where, for example, auxetics are being proposed as potential components for the production of better quality lifting devices such as helicopter rotor blades or airplane wings. This work reviews and discusses the behaviour of known and novel cellular systems, which exhibit this unusual but highly desirable property.

AB We propose in this paper analytical and numerical models that describe the in-plane uniaxial elastic properties (Young's moduli and Poisson's ratios) of a honeycomb structure with curved walls. We perform a parametric analysis of the mechanical performance of this honeycomb also by taking into account the different types of deformations acting inside the cell walls. The curved wall honeycomb possesses higher magnitudes of the Poisson's ratio (12) in the auxetic configuration compared to classical center symmetric configuration with straight cell wall. The presence of the curvature also allows creating configurations with positive Poisson's ratio even for negative internal cell angles, and makes this honeycomb design attractive for mechanical tailoring.

AB The mechanical properties of 2D honeycomb-structured polymer sheets (HSPS) are investigated with respect to the polar angle at large deformation. The tensile force fluctuates as an undamped negative sinusoidal wave with a periodicity of 15 degrees. The amplitude of the fluctuation is proportional to the thickness of the HSPS, but the Young's modulus is independent of the thickness and the polar angle. Total and local Poisson's ratios of HSPS at the 30 degrees polar angle are lower than those obtained at the 0 degrees polar angle over the entire strain range, and the difference becomes smaller with increasing tensile strain. The experimentally observed structure-property relationship of the HSPS can provide important clues for understanding the deformation behavior of patterned polymeric materials.

Because of the high residual compressive stress of the film, the bridge exhibited a sinusoidal displacement by removing the constraint of the substrate. By measuring the amplitude with known bridge length, we could determine the strain of the film required to adhere to the substrate. Combined with independent stress measurement by laser reflection method, this method allows calculation of the biaxial elastic modulus, E/(1-nu), where E is the elastic modulus and nu Poisson's ratio of the DLC film. By comparing the biaxial elastic modulus with plane-strain modulus, E/(1-nu(2)), measured by nano-indentation, we could further determine the elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio, independently. The elastic modulus, E, increased From 87 to 133 GPa as the negative bias voltage increased from 400 to 550 V. Poisson's ratio was estimated to be about 0.20 in this bias voltage range. For the negative bias voltages less than 400 V, however, the present method resulted in negative Poisson's ratio which is physically impossible. The limitation of the present method was also discussed.

ID AUXETIC BEHAVIOR
AB This paper presents a novel honeycomb structure that exhibits a negative Poisson's ratio (NPR). In contrast to other NPR honeycomb structures studied in the past, the new structure can be easily fabricated using conventional technology and materials on a large scale of production with a low cost. The geometry of the structure is first described, and then an elastic analysis based on standard beam theory is carried out to establish the relation of its Young's modulus with relevant geometrical parameters and material properties. The effects of the geometrical parameters in non-dimensional forms on the Young's modulus of the structure are discussed. The compressive tests were performed on samples of the structure made with the same aluminum alloy but with different geometrical parameters to verify the theoretical analysis. The results obtained from both the theoretical calculations and experiments show that the proposed NPR honeycomb structure has a very obvious NPR behavior. Moreover, its elastic modulus is significantly affected by its geometrical parameters, and can be optimized for specific applications through the design and control of honeycomb geometry parameters.

AB Using solid-state reaction method, Zr2WP2O12 powder was synthesized for this study. The optimum heating condition was 1200 degrees C for 4 h. The obtained powder was compacted and sintered. The relative density of the Zr2WP2O12 ceramics with no sintering additive was 60%. That of samples sintered with more than 0.5 mass% MgO was about 97%. The average grain size (D-50), as estimated from the polished surface of a sample sintered at 1200 degrees C for 4 h was about 1 mu m. The obtained ceramics showed a negative thermal expansion coefficient of about -3.4 x 10(-6) degrees C-1. Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, three-point bending strength, Vickers microhardness, and fracture toughness of the obtained ceramics were, respectively, 74 GPa, 0.25, 113 +/- 13 MPa, 4.4 GPa and 2.3 Mpa m(1/2).

AB Negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) material attracts a lot of attentions for its unique mechanical properties. However, achieving NPR is at the expense of reducing Young's modulus. It has been observed that the composite stiffness can be enhanced when blending positive Poisson's ratio (PPR) material into NPR material. Based on the respective interpolation of Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio, two concurrent topology optimization problems with different types of constraints, called Problem A and B, are respectively discussed to explore the Poisson's ratio effect in porous microstructure. In Problem A, the volume constraints are respectively imposed on macro and micro structures; in Problem B, besides setting an upper bound on the total available base materials, the micro thermal insulation capability is considered as well. Besides considering the influence of micro thermal insulation capability on the optimized results in Problem B, the similar and dissimilar influences of Poisson's ratios, volume fractions in Problem A and B are also investigated through several 2D and 3D numerical examples. It is observed that the concurrent structural stiffness resulting from the mixture of PPR and NPR base materials can exceed the concurrent structural stiffness composed of any individual base material.

AB Frictionless indentation of an elastic layer attached to an elastic half-space is considered in the small-scale contact range. Based on the first-order asymptotic solution, a simple analytical approximation is suggested for the indentation scaling factor that takes into account the elastic layer's finite thickness as well as the effect of the elastic substrate. The influence of both Poisson's ratios on the substrate effect is studied in detail, and the error of the 1/10 rule of Buckle is estimated for a relatively large range of the elastic moduli mismatch.

AB A new kind of chiral stent was designed by three-dimensional lozenge grid structure structure with four ligaments. Based on the conventional beam theory and energy conservation principle, in-plane Poisson's ratio and equivalent Young's modulus are derived, and finite element analysis was employed to validate the analytical estimates of the elastic module. Then the FEM models are used to investigate the elastic deformation behaviours of lozenge grid structure. The calculated results of equivalent elastic modulus based on beam theory are in consistent with those obtained by finite element method. The theoretical and numerical results show that lozenge grid structure stent proposed in this paper is negative Poisson's ratio material. The presented theory could be used in designing new hierarchical honeycomb structures for multifunctional applications.

AB Laser Brillouin spectroscopy was used to determine the adiabatic single-crystal elastic stiffness coefficients of silicon dioxide (SiO2) in the alpha-cristobalite structure. This SiO2 polymorph, unlike other silicas and silicates, exhibits a negative Poisson's ratio; alpha-cristobalite contracts laterally when compressed and expands laterally when stretched. Tensorial analysis of the elastic coefficients shows that Poisson's ratio reaches a maximum value of -0.5 in some directions, whereas averaged values for the single-phased aggregate yield a Poisson's ratio of -0.16.

AB A theoretical analysis of longitudinal stretching of a thin rectangular two-layered plate formed of hexagonal crystals with the same orientation is given. The effective elastic properties (Young's modulus and Poisson's ratios) of the plate are dependent on such properties of the constituent crystal as the sign and value of Poisson's ratios, the ratio of Young's moduli and the ratio of the thicknesses of the layers. These dependencies can be either simple or complex. It is shown that effective Young's modulus of the two-layered plate always exceeds the result calculated by the rule of mixtures of Voigt. For small differences between Young's moduli (or Poisson's ratios) of the initial crystals, the accuracy of predicting effective Young's modulus by the rule of mixtures turns out to be quite satisfactory. Effective in-plane Poisson's ratio can be either larger or smaller than the prediction by the rule of mixtures. Special results were obtained for plates of the auxetic-nonauxetic type. In the case of plates with varying layers thickness ratios, the increase in the thickness of the auxetic layer makes it possible to control the value of negative effective in-plane Poisson's ratio of the two-layered auxetic-nonauxetic plate.

AB Auxetic metamaterials have received increasing interest due to their distinct mechanical properties. However, most developed auxetic metamaterials feature a uniform auxeticity in the elastic deformation stage, which limits their functional applications. Here, based on double-elliptic-ring (DER) partial auxetic structures, an enhanced double-elliptic-ring (EDER) structure with strain-dependent auxeticity is introduced. The proposed EDERs consist of DERs and an enhanced structure (ES). Under compression, the ES will exhibit directional instability owing to the shrinking of DERs, and these directional instabilities will enhance the auxetic behaviors of EDERs. Analytical and simulation models are carried out to explore the equivalent Young?s modulus and Poisson?s ratio of EDERs and are validated via experiments. The results show that the strain value in the shrinking direction is different in different regions due to the directional instability of the ES which occurs layer by layer. By varying the geometric parameters of the ES of the EDERs, its deformation can be programmed and EDERs display varying localized deformation mechanisms.

AB Fabrics with zero or negative Poisson's ratio are referred as auxetic fabrics, which have the unusual property of lateral expansion or zero expansion upon stretch. The use of conventional materials and machinery to produce auxetic fabrics has gained the interest of researchers in recent years. However, this approach is limited to knitted fabrics only. The development of auxetic fabric using conventional yarns and weaving technology is a research area that is still unaddressed. This paper reports a study on the development of a novel class of stretchable auxetic woven fabrics by using conventional yarns and weaving machinery. The phenomenon of differential shrinkage was successfully employed to realize auxetic geometries capable of inducing auxetic behavior in woven fabrics, and a series of auxetic woven fabrics were fabricated with elastic and non-elastic yarns and a dobby machine. The uni-axial tensile tests showed that auxetic woven fabrics developed exhibited zero or negative Poisson's ratio over a wide range of longitudinal strain.

AB Helical auxetic yarn (HAY) is a newly developed composite yarn with negative Poisson's ratio. HAYs offers advantageous merits as a reinforcing element in composite materials. In this paper high stiffness HAYs composed of Nylon filament core and fine steel wire wrap yarns were developed. The importance of the stiffness ratio of the wrap to the core components in the resultant auxetic yarn was examined. The differences between instantaneous and engineering Poisson's ratio analyses in the understanding of the strain-dependent behavior of HAY was investigated. Results revealed that the utilization of the fine steel multifilament in the developed HAY samples enormously improves the stiffness of HAY. It was possible to obtain an elastic modulus of 9 GPa and a maximum auxetic effect of -16.82 in the samples. It was concluded that such highly stiff auxetic yarn can successfully be used as reinforcement in various composite materials such as cementitious composites.

AB The microstructure of the manmade auxetic materials always involve inherited porosity and sharp corners, where the stress concentration occurred. We have proposed a novel kind of non-porous smooth curve sheet which exhibits a negative Poisson's ratio and has a low stress concentration factor. The auxetic response was validated by good qualitative and quantitative agreements between the tensile experiments and numerical analysis of array model. Using the experimentally validated finite element model, the parametric study on the evolution of the macroscopic Poisson's ratio, the stress concentration factor on the geometry parameters and the parental material properties were investigated. This one phase auxetic smooth curve sheet, which is simple to manufacture and assemble into 3D structures, may be used in a variety of industrial applications.

AB Auxetic honeycombs exhibit low weight, shear stiffness, and excellent energy absorption capacity and thus have great potential for achieving the requirements of crashworthiness and lightweight in automotive fields. This work presents a novel auxetic structure called the star-triangular honeycomb (STH), in which the horizontal and vertical ligaments of the star honeycombs (SH) are replaced with triangular structures. The dynamic crushing behaviors of the STH under three different crushing velocities were investigated using 1D shock theory. The results show that the STH has a more obvious negative Poisson's ratio effect than the SH and that transverse contraction mainly occurs in the first plateau stage. Theoretical models were deduced based on the collapse mechanism of the typical unit revealed by numerical simulation for STH crushing strength prediction. The theoretical predictions agreed well with the simulation results, and two different plateau stresses appeared under low-velocity crushing. In addition, the influences of the STH geometric parameters and crushing velocity on the energy-absorbing capacity and densification strain were systematically explored. The parameter analysis indicated that the effects of the cell-wall thickness and incline angle on the dynamic response and energy absorption capacity of the STH under low-and medium-velocity crushing are more significant than those under high-velocity crushing. Moreover, the STH showed better energy absorption capacity than the SH. Thus, this design is expected to provide a novel means of improving the mechanical properties of honeycombs.

AB The unusual thermal expansion properties of a prototype nanoporous, crystalline solid have been determined by studying epitaxially grown, highly oriented thin films rigidly anchored to a solid substrate using out-of-plane and in-plane X-ray diffraction (XRD). The analysis of the data for the particular metal organic frameworks (MOFs) studied here, HKUST-I, reveals a thermal expansion which is negative for the direction perpendicular and positive for the direction parallel to the substrate surface. The corresponding anisotropic coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE) amount to (-75 +/- 16) x 10(-6) K-1 in the direction perpendicular to the substrate and to (11.7 +/- 3.7) x 10(-6) K-1 in the direction parallel to the substrate surface. These values substantially differ from the intrinsic CTE, measured for powder MOFs (-4.1 x 10(-6) K-1). The substrate-induced anisotropic thermal expansion allows for a direct measurement of the Poisson's ratio of MOF materials, which is hardly measurable for powder MOFs. The Poisson's ratio of HKUST-1 was determined to be 0.69 +/- 0.37. Furthermore, thermal cycling experiments of the HKUST-1 SURMOFs reveal a pronounced stability, a necessary requirement for using MOFs in thermal response sensor devices and for high-temperature membrane separation.

AB Auxetic (negative Poisson's ratio) and gradient open cell foams have shown promise for their conformability and high impact energy absorption-useful in applications like protective equipment, footwear and prosthetics. Recent methods fabricated auxetic closed cell foam by steaming conventional closed cell foam. Methods developed herein control the cell structure of auxetic closed cell foam, to produce novel intentionally anisotropic and gradient auxetic closed cell foam. Pins passed through the foam constrained or stretched regions during steaming to further modify cell structure, and impart gradients in cell structure, Young's modulus and Poisson's ratios. Fabricated foams had Poisson's ratios between 1 and -1. Imparted Young's moduli of 1-12 MPa were similar to foams used in footwear, prosthesis, helmets and other impact protection. The effect of changes to cell structure on Young's moduli and Poisson's ratio are explained by combining analytical models of auxetic open cell and conventional closed cell foam.

AB Assessing equivalence or similarity has drawn much attention recently as many drug products have lost or will lose their patents in the next few years, especially certain best-selling biologics. To claim equivalence between the test treatment and the reference treatment when assay sensitivity is well established from historical data, one has to demonstrate both superiority of the test treatment over placebo and equivalence between the test treatment and the reference treatment. Thus, there is urgency for practitioners to derive a practical way to calculate sample size for a three-arm equivalence trial. The primary endpoints of a clinical trial may not always be continuous, but may be discrete. In this paper, the authors derive power function and discuss sample size requirement for a three-arm equivalence trial with Poisson and negative binomial clinical endpoints. In addition, the authors examine the effect of the dispersion parameter on the power and the sample size by varying its coefficient from small to large. In extensive numerical studies, the authors demonstrate that required sample size heavily depends on the dispersion parameter. Therefore, misusing a Poisson model for negative binomial data may easily lose power up to 20%, depending on the value of the dispersion parameter.

AB Honeycombs or foams with reentrant microstructures exhibit effective negative Poisson's ratio. Although they are light weight due to inherently empty space, their overall stiffness and damping are somewhat limited. With judiciously chosen filler material to fill the voids in star-shaped honeycomb, it is numerically demonstrated its auxeticity may be enhanced. By combining the filler and skeleton, the hierarchical composite materials are constructed. The magnitude of the enhancement depends on inner and outer filler's modulus mismatch, as well as the types of filling. Filler's auxeticity also largely enhances overall auxeticity of the outer- and all-filled honeycomb. In addition, for outer-filled honeycomb, its effective viscoelastic modulus and damping are significantly increased, while maintaining relatively light weight, due to local stress concentration.

DE Auxetic honeycomb; Plateau stress; Deformation modes; Negative Poisson's

AB In order to improve the energy absorption capacity of the honeycomb, a combined auxetic honeycomb is designed in this paper. By using the double-inclined walls replacing the horizontal walls of the star-shaped honeycomb (SSH), and introducing a thin-walled circle contacting with the four concave corners of the SSH, the star-circle honeycomb (SCH) is designed. The in-plane dynamic crushing behaviors was explored based on finite element method (FEM). There are three types of deformation modes observed with different impact velocity, including low-, medium- and high-velocity loading modes and the stress-strain curve exhibits two plateau stress stages. Based on the deformation characteristics of the representative unit, theoretical calculation models were established to estimate the plateau stress of the SCH under lowand high-velocity loading according the conservation of energy and the theoretical calculation was in keep well with the numerical simulation. A deformation modes map was summarized to investigate the effects of the impact velocity and the relative density on the deformation modes and the energy absorption capability and the dynamic Poisson's ratio were studied. The result shows that the SCH presents better energy absorption compared with SSH as well as retaining the negative Poisson's ratio property. The deformation mechanism was revealed form the structural design and plastic hinge dissipation. This work presents a different design strategy for the auxetic honeycomb, expected to guide the design of more novel auxetic with better energy absorption and mechanical property.

AB Entropic surfaces represented by fluctuating two-dimensional (2D) membranes are predicted to have desirable mechanical properties when unstressed, including a negative Poisson's ratio ("auxetic" behavior). Herein, we present calculations of the strain-dependent Poisson ratio of self-avoiding 2D membranes demonstrating desirable auxetic properties over a range of mechanical strain. Finite size membranes with unclamped boundary conditions have positive Poisson's ratio due to spontaneous non-zero mean curvature, which can be suppressed with an explicit bending rigidity in agreement with prior findings. Applying longitudinal strain along a singular axis to this system suppresses this mean curvature and the entropic out-of-plane fluctuations, resulting in a molecular-scale mechanism for realizing a negative Poisson's ratio above a critical strain, with values significantly more negative than the previously observed zero-strain limit for infinite sheets. We find that auxetic behavior persists over surprisingly high strains of more than 20% for the smallest surfaces, with desirable finite-size scaling producing surfaces with negative Poisson's ratio over a wide range of strains. These results promise the design of surfaces and composite materials with tunable Poisson's ratio by prestressing platelet inclusions or controlling the surface rigidity of a matrix of 2D materials.

AB Auxetics (negative Poisson's ratio) and materials with negative linear compressibility (NLC) exhibit the anomalous mechanical properties of getting wider rather than thinner when stretched and expanding in at least one direction under hydrostatic pressure, respectively. A novel mechanism-termed the 'triangular elongation mechanism'-leading to such anomalous behavior is presented and discussed through an analytical model. Amongst other things, it is shown that this novel mechanism, when combined with the well-known 'rotating squares' model, can generate giant negative Poisson's ratios when the system is stretched.

AB An auxetic braided structure was developed in our previous work for overcoming the slippage problem encountered in the double-helix yarn. However, the influences of the micro-geometric parameters on the macroscopic behavior, which are significant for the structure's design and application, have not been addressed yet. By using a standard tubular braiding technology, several samples of the auxetic braided structure were fabricated in this work and the design concept and manufacture process were described in detail. Then, systematic parameters studies were completed through experimentally validated finite element models. The study showed that the braided structure could achieve a robust auxetic behavior and its Poisson's ratio and stiffness were strongly dependent on their initial micro-geometric parameters, especially initial braiding angle and diameter of component yarns. A maximum negative Poisson's ratio of -9.49 could be achieved by lowering the angle value to 15 degrees. Higher negative Poisson's ratio effect could be obtained with grosser stiff yarn and finer elastic yarns. However, the existence of the elastic wraps would diminish the auxeticity of the braided structure, which should be taken into consideration in design and application.

AB Poisson's ratio is the ratio of the displacement in the lateral direction to the displacement in the longitudinal direction when a material is deformed. The value of Poisson's ratio is constant for isotropic and homogeneous materials. The range of Poisson's ratio varies from -1 to 0.5 theoretically, but the value is typically positive. Recently, negative Poisson's ratios have attracted significant attention to researchers. Negative values are observed in some artificial structures; however, these structures do not exhibit isotropic characteristics. In this study, the characteristics of negative Poisson's ratios were investigated, and it was found that reentrant lattice structures can have negative Poisson's ratio values. Conceptual design for such structures was carried out, and detailed design considering the isotropic characteristics was performed through optimization to extremize the negative value of the Poisson's ratio. The optimization formulation was defined, and the size/shape structural optimization techniques were employed in finalizing the structures.

AB Materials or structures that contract in the transverse direction under uniaxial compression, or expand laterally when stretched are called to have negative Poisson's ratios. A theoretical approach to predict negative Poisson's ratios of auxetic honeycombs has been developed, which is based on the large deflection model. The equations of the deflection curves of the inclined member of the re-entrant cell, strains and Poisson's ratios of auxetic honeycombs in two orthogonal directions have been derived. The deformed shapes of the inclined member of the re-entrant cell are calculated. The negative Poisson's ratios of auxetic honeycombs are no longer a constant at large deformation. They, vary significantly with the strain. The effect of the geometric parameters of the cell on the Poisson's ratios is analyzed. (C) 2003 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.

ID NEGATIVE POISSON RATIO; ELASTIC PROPERTIES
AB Recently an enhancement of certain mechanical properties of composites have been shown to be attained by the introduction of auxetic phases (materials with negative Poisson's value) such as indentation resistance, fracture toughness and improved energy absorption. Here one aim is to use well-known closed-form formulas for the effective stiffness and engineering constants of a periodic composite where the repetitive cell is a laminate of n elastic isotropic constituents. The formulas are given as a function of the elastic stiffnesses or in terms of the engineering constants of the constituents and their volume fraction. Effective mechanical properties are independent of the order in which the laminas are taken. In order to confirm the theoretical formulas and show them reliable, comparisons with two independent numerical calculations using finite element are given. They are excellent. For a bilaminate the conditions by which Young's moduli are enhanced are given. Also we provide expressions for auxetic and enhancement windows. The stiffness constants exhibit certain characteristics associated with auxetics such as the negatively of non-diagonal components of the stiffness tensor. It is shown that the laminas combination of positive-positive materials may be produce enhancement of Young's moduli as some auxetic-auxetic ones. The relative indentation compliance of a circular punch upon transversely isotropic medium is calculated using Fabrikant's formulas. Two different indentations are considered. In one the indenter and the bilaminate are frictionless contact and in the other they are bonded. The indentation attains the asymptotic limits of Boussinesq or Mossakovskii-Spence when the auxetic phase is very thin compared with the width of the non-auxetic phase and in the opposite case. The results given here may be of interest in practical applications using composites with auxetic constituents when the microstructure is small compared with the dimensions of the laminate.

AB The synthesized understanding of the mechanical properties of negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) convex-concave honeycomb tubes (CCHTs) under quasi-static and dynamic compression loads is of great significance for their multifunctional applications in mechanical, aerospace, aircraft, and biomedical fields. In this paper, the quasi-static and dynamic compression tests of three kinds of 3D-printed NPR convex-concave honeycomb tubes are carried out. The sinusoidal honeycomb wall with equal mass is used to replace the cell wall structure of the conventional square honeycomb tube (CSHT). The influence of geometric morphology on the elastic modulus, peak force, energy absorption, and damage mode of the tube was discussed. The experimental results show that the NPR, peak force, failure mode, and energy absorption of CCHTs can be adjusted by changing the geometric topology of the sinusoidal element. Through the reasonable design of NPR, compared with the equal mass CSHTs, CCHTs could have the comprehensive advantages of relatively high stiffness and strength, enhanced energy absorption, and damage resistance. The results of this paper are expected to be meaningful for the optimization design of tubular structures widely used in mechanical, aerospace, vehicle, biomedical engineering, etc.

AB The crystal structure and mechanical properties of silver oxalate, AgC2O4, are determined using first-principles solid-state methods. The set of calculated mechanical properties include the bulk modulus and its pressure derivatives, the Young and shear moduli, the Poisson's Ratio and the ductility, hardness, and anisotropy indices. Silver oxalate is a highly anisotropic brittle material possessing a small bulk modulus of approximate to 9.6 GPa. It displays the negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) phenomenon, the value of the lowest NPR having a very large magnitude, -1.27. Besides, it exhibits the most extreme form of the negative linear compressibility (NLC) phenomenon found to date. Silver oxalate displays anisotropic NLC for external pressures in the range -0.1 to -2.4 GPa directed along the [010] crystallographic direction and isotropic NLC for isotropic pressures in the range -0.51 to 13.4 GPa. The lowest value of the negative compressibility, -831.9 +/- 10 TPa-1, is found for an isotropic pressure of -0.16 GPa. The absolute value of the computed lowest NLC is extremely large, about three times larger than the absolute value ofthe lowest NLC found so far. The NLC pressure range is also very wide, its width being more than two times the largest range found to date.

AB Poisson's ratio is one of the fundamental features of materials, reflecting the transverse strain response to the applied certain axial strain. The materials with a negative Poisson's ratio, also known as auxetic materials, are rare in nature and attract lots of research interest because of their unusual mechanical behavior and extensive applications in mechanical nanodevices. Here, we proposed and studied a novel hyperbolic two-dimensional graphene-like structure (GLS) showing a negative Poisson's ratio behavior by first-principles calculation. The thermodynamic, dynamic, lattice dynamic, and mechanical stabilities of the GLS were carefully studied. In addition, we also explored the electronic structure, mechanical characteristics, and optical-electronic characteristics. The GLS not only displays a negative Poisson's ratio in certain directions but also shows low-gap semiconductor characteristics and superior electronic conductivity. It is a potential sunscreen material because of the outstanding reflection and absorption for ultraviolet and infrared light.

AB Auxetics are materials showing a negative Poisson's ratio. This characteristic leads to unusual mechanical properties that make this an interesting class of materials. So far no systematic approach for generating auxetic cellular materials has been reported. In this contribution, we present a systematic approach to identifying auxetic cellular materials based on eigenmode analysis. The fundamental mechanism generating auxetic behavior is identified as rotation. With this knowledge, a variety of complex two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) auxetic structures based on simple unit cells can be identified.

AB Hard-body models reproduce many fundamental features of real physical systems and are convenient tools to study the role of molecular shape and its influence on macroscopic, for example, elastic, properties of condensed matter. In this article, a degenerate (aperiodic) crystal of hard dimers with arrays of nanochannels introduced in the direction [001] is studied by Monte Carlo simulations. The nanochannels are filled by hard spheres of diameter sigma' which can be different from the diameter sigma of spheres forming dimers. It is shown that, by modifying the ratio o'/o, one can qualitatively modify the Poisson's ratio of the system. In particular, one can obtain partial auxetics (i.e., systems with negative Poisson's ratio in some directions) with auxetic directions [110] or [111]. The applied method is convenient to determine Poisson's ratio in all directions for crystals of arbitrary symmetry. Explicit formulae for Poisson's ratio in main directions of the studied structures are given. (C) 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB In the present work, two new designs of honeycomb structures were presented based on the basic re-entrant structure namely, splined-reentrant and stiffened-reentrant honeycombs. The new structures were designed in order to enhance the in-plane stiffness and maintaining the auxetic behavior of the structure. In this study, finite elements modeling and experimental work were carried out to evaluate the in-plane properties of the new designs. The effect of the geometrical parameters such as rib length and rib thickness of the unit cell of the new designs on the in-plane properties was investigated. Finite elements results showed that the in-plane stiffness of the new designs was improved significantly compared to the basic re-entrant structure. Also, the stiffened-reentrant structure showed better enhancement of the stiffness than the splined-reentrant structure. For example the modulus of elasticity of the stiffened-reentrant structure exceeds 16x that of the basic re-entrant structure in x-direction and was over two times in the y-direction with lower values of the negative Poisson's ratio. Compression tests were carried on honeycomb samples made of steel using laser cutting technique with different geometrical parameters. Test results for the three designs were compared with the finite element results and they were in a good agreement.

AB Young's modulus, fracture stress, and Poisson's ratio are important mechanical characteristics for micromechanical devices. The Poisson's ratio of a material is a good measure to elucidate its mechanical behavior and generally is the negative ratio of transverse to axial strain. A nanocrystalline (NCD) and an ultrananocrystalline (UNCD) diamond sample with grain boundaries of different chemical and structural constitutions have been investigated by an ultrasonic resonance method. For both samples, the elastic moduli are considerably reduced, compared with the elastic modulus of single crystal diamond (sc-diamond). Depending on the chemical and structural constitution of grain boundaries in nano-and ultrananocrystalline diamond different values for Poisson's ratio and for the fracture strength are observed. We found a Poisson's ratio of 0.201 +/- 0.041 for the ultrananocrystalline sample and 0.034 +/- 0.017 for the nanocrystalline sample. We discuss these results on the basis of a model for granular media. Higher disorder in the grain boundary leads to lower shear stiffness between the single grains and ultimately results in a decrease of Young's and shear modulus and possibly of the fracture strength of the material.

AB Customarily, in-plane auxeticity and synclastic bending behavior (i.e. out-of-plane auxeticity) are not independent, being the latter a manifestation of the former. Basically, this is a feature of three-dimensional bodies. At variance, two-dimensional bodies have more freedom to deform than three-dimensional ones. Here, we exploit this peculiarity and propose a two-dimensional honeycomb microstructure with out-of-plane auxetic behavior opposite to the in-plane one. With a suitable choice of the lattice constitutive parameters, in its continuum description such a structure can achieve the whole range of values for the bending Poisson coefficient, while retaining a membranal Poisson coefficient equal to 1. In particular, this structure can reach the extreme values, -1 and +1, of the bending Poisson coefficient. Analytical calculations are supported by numerical simulations, showing the accuracy of the continuum formulas in predicting the response of the discrete structure.

AB Auxetic polymeric materials are a special kind of materials that exhibit negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) effect. They get fatter when stretched and thinner when compressed. Auxetic behavior is a scale-independent property which can be achieved at different structural levels from molecular to macroscopic levels. The internal structure of material plays an important role in obtaining auxetic effect. Because of NPR effect, auxetic polymeric materials demonstrate a series of particular characteristics when compared with conventional materials. In recent years, a variety of auxetic polymeric materials have been designed and fabricated for diverse applications. This article presents a review on advances in this area. The emphasis is focused on the geometrical structures and models, particular properties and applications of auxetic polymeric materials developed.

AB In this work, an analytical model of a 3D re-entrant honeycomb auxetic cellular structure has been established based on both a large deflection beam model and a Timoshenko beam model. Analytical solutions for the modulus, Poisson's ratios and yield strength of the cellular structure in all principal directions were obtained, which indicate a wide range of mechanical property control via geometrical designs. The results were compared with experimentation and finite element analysis, and it was verified that the analytical model provides a convenient and relatively accurate method in the prediction of the performance for the auxetic cellular structures once the manufacturing related factors are adequately incorporated into the model. It was also found that the model provides less accurate predictions when higher-order coupling effects such as warp locking becomes significant under lower structural symmetry. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Helical auxetic yarns (HAYs) spun by ring spinning have a large residual torque, which restricts their application. To address this problem, the hollow-spindle covering system was adopted to prepare structurally stable HAYs consisting of the core yarn and the wrap yarn. Four types of HAYs were manufactured, and a self-designed automatic stretching device was prepared for recording the alteration of yarn diameter. These as-fabricated yarns were measured and characterized in terms of their deformation behavior and auxetic performance. The strain-stress curves of these HAYs have two peaks corresponding to their respective two component yarns during stretch until completely failure, and also it was found that the wrap component is always broken before the core yarn. By comparison, the maximum negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) of -2.55 was achieved with as-prepared HAYs composed of spandex and stainless steel monofilaments. Meanwhile, the structural stability of these yarns was discussed with respect to the residual torque, and the experimental results indicate that the residual torque of these HAYs is obviously smaller than that of conventional ring-spun yarns. These confirm the superiority of our proposed hollow-spindle method. Furthermore, the effects of the diameter of the core yarn and tensile modulus of the wrap yarn on the auxetic behavior were systematically investigated. It is found that a larger NPR can be obtained with a thicker diameter of core yarn and a higher tensile modulus of wrap yarn. It is also demonstrated that an appropriate combination of the component modulus and geometric parameters is essential to fabricate HAY with an obvious auxetic behavior.

AB Aerogels with negative parameters have become a research hotspot since the discovery of negative Poisson's ratio and negative thermal expansion coefficient in aerogels. The negative parameters are originally brought up and studied in electromagnetic metamaterials, leaving a question that whether aerogels can be used to construct metamaterials with negative electromagnetic parameters. Here, the authors show that negative permittivity (epsilon-negative) property can be achieved in carbon aerogels, and its value is adjusted continuously by changing the composition of carbon aerogels but keeping their microstructure unchanged. This is a novel strategy different from the typical array-structure-containing metamaterials. Moreover, a physical state transition is found when increasing the carbonization temperature, where the initial low-loss dielectric state evolves into a high-loss one upon increasing the temperature from 400 to 700 degrees C followed by a final degenerate semiconductor state when increasing the temperature to 800 degrees C and above. This work can provide a new method toward the design of electromagnetic metamaterials, starting by choosing the component materials with optimal composition.

AB A number of basic features of the mechanical properties of a cubic symmetry solid material are identified and discussed within the framework of the XY-plane approach, where X?=?G/K, Y?=?G/W, K is the bulk modulus and G, W are shear moduli. An anisotropic part of the Debye temperature is analysed, which was found to be weakly dependent on X and is mainly determined by Y which quantifies the material elastic anisotropy. The anisotropic part has a considerable effect on the Debye temperature of partially auxetic materials. An empirical ductility-brittleness criterion is considered, which indicates that many auxetics may deform in a brittle manner. A possible correlation between directional tensile deformation and the surface of the most extreme Poisson's ratio (PR) values is suggested. Finally, the reasons for the paucity of cubic materials in the part of the XY-plane with low Y values is investigated using static microscopic models in which the particles interact with nearest and next nearest neighbours only. An example of a type of microscopic model system located in this empty region has been found, which consists of a system under tension, where the interparticle interaction decays with distance in an oscillatory way. The results obtained suggest that a rather unconventional form of the interparticle interaction set and thermodynamic conditions may therefore be required to develop a solid material with these mechanical properties.

AB Auxetics ( materials or structures) are systems with a negative Poisson's ratio, a property that arises from the way various geometric features in the structure ( or internal structure in the case of materials) deform when subjected to uniaxial loads. Such systems are normally studied by examining the behaviour of idealised representations of structures, which deform in a controlled fashion ( e. g. deforming solely through hinging or stretching). Methods used for the analysis typically involve construction of real physical macro-models and/or derivation of analytical expressions for the mechanical properties. This paper proposes an alternative method for analysing such structures whereby idealised "hinging" or "stretching" structures are constructed within a molecular modelling environment using dummy atoms and examined using standard molecular mechanics techniques. We will show that this methodology of "empirical modelling using dummy atoms" (EMUDA) successfully reproduces the known properties of 2D conventional and auxetic hexagonal honeycombs hence confirming the suitability of this technique for studying auxetic structures.

AB The relationship between elastic anisotropy and extreme Poisson's ratio behaviour (either positive or negative) in single-crystalline materials has been investigated using experimentally determined single-crystal elastic constants for a wide range of solid materials. This makes use of a recently proposed elastic anisotropy index that is applicable to all crystal symmetries. For many real materials we find a striking correlation between the value of the elastic anisotropy index and the magnitudes of maximum and minimum Poisson's ratios this is independent of crystal symmetry. This structure property relationship provides new examples of auxetics and shows that negative Poisson's ratios are actually not uncommon among many classes of inorganic (and organic) materials, including elemental metals, alloys, ionic solids, molecular solids and giant covalent networks.

AB Theoretical and numerical analyses of engineering elastic characteristics (Young's modulus and Poisson's ratios) of cylindrically anisotropic tubes formed by rolling-up plates of cubic crystallographic structures (110) and (111) are given. Present results are compared with the results for tubes with crystal structural orientation (001), studied previously. It is found that tubes with (110) crystal structure exhibit auxetic properties (negative Poisson's ratio) more often. Poisson's ratios averaged over the cross-section of some tubes have negative values.

AB Auxetic materials and structures as a class of metamaterials have been extensively studied and evaluated for many applications. This paper focuses on the fabrication and vibration damping of the carbon fiber composite auxetic double-arrow corrugated sandwich panels (DACSPs). The negative Poisson's ratio effects of the composite auxetic DACSPs are analytically studied based on energy method. 3D finite element (FE) models combined with Modal Strain Energy (MSE) approach are developed to investigate their vibration and damping characteristics. To validate the numerical models in the present study, the composite auxetic DACSPs and such structures inserted with high damping layer are designed and manufactured. Modal vibration and three-point bending tests are conducted to investigate their vibration damping and bending responses. The results show that the 3D FE models combined with MSE approach are valid to predict the modal properties of the composite auxetic DACSPs. The influence of the different inclined corrugated angles on the natural frequencies and damping loss factors are plotted and discussed. Meanwhile, the effect of Poisson's ratio on the nominal Young's modulus, natural frequencies and damping loss factors of the composite auxetic DACSPs are also revealed. It is observed from the results that it is possible to obtain both increased stiffness and high damping capacity of such composite auxetic DACSPs by optimizing the inclined corrugated angles and inserting suitable damping layers.

SO SOFT MATTER

DT Article
ID COUNTERION CONDENSATION; DNA; ENERGY; SALT; NEUTRALIZATION; ONSET
AB Poisson's ratio sigma in linear elasticity theory is the ratio of the transverse compression of a rod to its longitudinal extension. For common macroscopic materials, sigma is a positive quantity, implying that the rod becomes thinner when stretched. If the rod is a polyelectrolyte that bears a charge density above the threshold for counterion condensation, then the condensed layer of counterions should be regarded as an integral part of the rod. We show on a simple model that Poisson's ratio is then negative for high charge densities. For the charge density characteristic of DNA, the negative value found for sigma is in approximate agreement with the negative value inferred from measurements of the bending and twisting moduli of DNA.

AB Auxetics are materials showing a negative Poisson's ratio. Early research found several categories of auxetic materials in the chemical field. Later research identified the fundamental mechanism generating this behavior is rotation; a variety of two-dimensional auxetic material have been generated accordingly. Nevertheless, the successful example of three-dimensional auxetic material is still rare. This paper introduces a new design of three-dimensional periodic cellular auxetic material based on geometrical and mechanical methodology. The projections of the optimized periodic modules in two horizontal directions are geometrically same with auxetic hexahedral poem, so that the optimized periodic material can perform auxetic in both two horizontal directions under vertical compression. Parametric model is simulated to prove the design.

AB A new method for the production of thin flat and curved auxetic foam sheets by uniaxial compression is reportted in this paper. Detailed optical microscopy and Poisson's ratio measurement by videoextensometry has revealed that the auxetic behaviour is due to a crumpling of the pores through the foam thickness, caused by a uniaxial compression of 4060% in combination with shear for the curved foams. Poisson's ratio values of up to -3 have been recorded for the curved foams and -0.3 for the flat sheets.

AB The development of longitudinally and radially gradient open-cell polyurethane foams is reported. Local and global mechanical properties and pore structure have been characterized using video extensometry with x-y strain-mapping capability, and x-ray microtomography (CT) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), respectively. The local axial Poisson's ratio varies in a smoothly continuous manner along the length of the longitudinally gradient foam from large negative (auxetic), through zero, to positive (conventional) values. The production of radially gradient foams having a coaxial core-sheath structure is reported for the first time. Two radially gradient foams have been produced, each displaying similar global negative axial Poisson's ratio responses but with markedly different local axial Poisson's ratio and local axial Young's modulus behaviours. One of the radially gradient foams displays a positive Poisson's ratio core and an auxetic sheath resulting from conventional and higher density re-entrant open-cell pore structures, respectively.

AB Artificial auxetic materials with negative Poisson's ratio enable distinctive elastic response in the direction orthogonal to the loaded direction, i.e. shrinking when compressed and expanding when stretched, compared to conventional materials. Such distinctive mechanical characteristic makes auxetic materials unique in practice. Current studies in this aspect focus mainly on the realization of beam-dominated microstructures such as reentrant and chiral lattices and of cellular microstructures with orthogonal elliptical hole pattern. In this study, a novel two-dimensional auxetic microstructure is designed by introducing peanut-shaped holes in solid bulk matrix. Compared to the microstructure with elliptical hole pattern, the present design can produce slightly larger negative Poisson's ratio and achieve significantly lower stress level. The samples consisting of a number of centimeter-scale unit cells with the peanut-shaped holes are fabricated efficiently via additive manufacturing technique. Experiment and finite element simulation of tensile test are carried out on the specific sample to demonstrate the auxetic effect of the present design and simultaneously verify the computational model. Finally, effects of some parameters on Poisson's ratio, which may control the auxetic behavior of the present microstructure, are discussed for better understanding deformation mechanism of the proposed auxetic material.

AB Conventional porous piezoelectric ceramics can possess superior figures of merit only at very high values of porosity, leading to bad fragileness, small stiffness, low toughness, and the difficulty of polarization. To this end, this study for the first time shows that it is possible that the piezoelectric ceramic with ultra-low porosity is capable of superior figures of merit based on the concept of auxetic piezoelectric ceramics. Owing to the ultra-low porosity and auxetic effect, the auxetic piezoelectric ceramic shall also possess larger stiffness, higher toughness, and is more easily polarized. First, the auxetic piezoelectric ceramic with ultra-low porosity is proposed to achieve highly tunable electromechanical properties on the basis of the rotating square mechanism. Then, using a multiscale finite element method, the effects of geometric architecture and polarization directions on the electromechanical properties including Poisson's ratios, elastic coefficients, piezoelectric stress coefficients, dielectric coefficients, and figures of merit in the auxetic piezoelectric ceramics are investigated in detail. Furthermore, the stress fields in conventional and proposed porous piezoelectric ceramics subjected to mechanical and electrical loads are compared and discussed. Finally, it can be concluded that the auxetic piezoelectric ceramic exhibits (a) giant negative Poisson's ratios (smaller than-5), (b) negative elastic coefficients, (c) more extensible, higher piezoelectric sensitivity, lower acoustic impedance, stronger crack resistance than conventional porous piezoelectric ceramics with the same porosity, and (d) larger stiffness than conventional porous piezoelectric ceramics with similar figures of merit.

AB Auxetic materials exhibit a negative Poisson's ratio behavior that makes them useful for a variety of structural applications by virtue of their ability to counterintuitively deform due to a reentrant cellular structure. This property allows the cellular material to expand laterally when pulled in the longitudinal direction or, conversely, contract laterally when compressed, with the manner of deformation of the internal structure depending upon the configuration of the cellular structure. The purpose of this research was to develop carbon black nanoparticle-reinforced natural rubber vulcanizates and to investigate the effects of carbon black reinforcement on the mechanical behavior of an idealized auxetic foam structure using modeling and numerical simulation techniques. This has been achieved by mechanically characterizing vulcanized natural rubber of various nanoparticle loadings and then using the test data to perform finite element (FE) simulations on the foam models. Material models have been developed in the FE simulation software ANSYS by curve fitting experimental data (hyperelastic) to theoretical material models. Large deformation analysis of this foam structure has been carried out to determine structural reorganizations and negative Poisson's ratio effect in the foam structure.

AB This paper presents a theoretical analysis of the auxetic plied yarn (APY) structure formed with two types of single yarns having different diameter and modulus. A model which can be used to predict its deformation behavior under axial extension is developed based on the theoretical analysis. The developed model is first compared with the experimental data obtained in the previous study, and then used to predict the effects of different structural and material parameters on the auxetic behavior of the APY. The calculation results show that the developed model can correctly predict the variation trend of the auxetic behavior of the APY, which first increases and then decrease with the increase of the axial strain. The calculation results also indicate that the auxetic behavior of the APY simultaneously depends on the diameter ratio of the soft yarn and stiff yarn as well as the ratio between the pitch length and stiff yarn diameter. The study provides a way to design and fabricate APYs with the same auxetic behavior by using different soft and stiff yarns as long as these two ratios are kept unchanged.

AB An engineered Negative Poisson's Ratio (NPR) material is investigated in this paper for its design variations based on two design variables. The investigated material properties include effective Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, material density, and load-bearing efficiency in terms of rigidity/weight ratio of the material. Nonlinear behaviors of the design variations are also investigated for large deformation applications. it is seen that by varying the two design variables, the NPR can reach as low as minus sixty in a special design. Any NPR number between a positive number and minus sixty can be obtained within the design domain through the design process. The nonlinear analysis results show that the effective material properties vary depending on the load amplitude, and the NPR material becomes stiffer and stiffer when the compression load is increased.
   The finite element method is utilized with a multi-step linearization method to predict the nonlinear behaviors of NPR materials. This will allow the effective material properties to be calculated for any given load amplitude. The new capability can be then used to design desired NPR material in a function-oriented material design (FOMD) environment for advanced application development. Both linear and nonlinear analysis results are presented and compared in this paper in order to demonstrate the necessity of accounting for geometric nonlinearity in the NPR material design process. An NPR material simulation and design system, called FOMD-NPR, has also been developed at MKP Structural Design Associates, Inc. for designing innovative NPR materials for various applications.

AB The work describes a cellular structure configuration with a rectangular perforation topology exhibiting auxetic (negative Poisson's ratio) in-plane behaviour. The rectangular voids used in this structure produce a rigid rotating squares effect. Changes in the sizing parameters of aspect ratio, intercell spacing, and number of unit cells are made through non-dimensional modelling. The effects on the key properties of in-plane Poisson's ratio, Young's modulus and shear modulus are investigated. Through numerical modelling and experimental testing the auxetic behaviour is confirmed, with increased negative Poisson's ratio values in comparison to rhomboidal patterns of perforations available in open literature.

AB Auxetic materials with large negative Poisson's ratios are fabricated by highly oriented carbon nanotube structures. The Poisson's ratio can be obtained down to -0.50. Furthermore, negative Poisson's ratios can be maintained in the carbon nanotube/polymer composites when the nanotubes are embedded, while the composites show much better mechanical properties including larger strain-to-failure (similar to 22%) compared to the pristine nanotube thin film (similar to 3%). A theoretical model is developed to predict the Poisson's ratios. It indicates that the large negative Poisson's ratios are caused by the realignment of curved nanotubes during stretching and the theoretical predictions agree well with the experimental results.

ID TRANSVERSE-SHEAR; HONEYCOMB-CORES
AB This paper is concerned with re-entrant cell honeycombs which show in-plane negative Poisson's ratio values, in which their anisotropic mechanical properties are described using the cellular material theory. Out-of-plane shear moduli are affected by the unit cell geometric parameters and, for some ranges of the latter, it is possible to obtain higher values of the shear moduli compared to those of a regular hexagonal honeycomb, in particular for cell geometries with a negative Poisson's ratio. A first order sandwich plate theory is applied in order to obtain the fundamental frequencies of sandwich laminates in cylindrical bending and for the simply supported case. Sensitivities of the frequencies per unit mass versus the geometric cell parameters are also calculated. The results suggest that the dynamic performance of a sandwich structure could be significantly improved with a proper design of the unit cell shape of the honeycomb. In particular, re-entrant cell cores offer improvements in bending stiffness capabilities for particular cell parameter ranges. (C) 2000 Academic Press.

AB The Poisson's ratio of a material characterizes its response to uniaxial strain. Materials normally possess a positive Poisson's ratio - they contract laterally when stretched, and expand laterally when compressed. A negative Poisson's ratio is theoretically permissible but has not, with few exceptions of man-made bulk structures, been experimentally observed in any natural materials. Here, we show that the negative Poisson's ratio exists in the low-dimensional natural material black phosphorus and that our experimental observations are consistent with first-principles simulations. Through applying uniaxial strain along armchair direction, we have succeeded in demonstrating a cross-plane interlayer negative Poisson's ratio on black phosphorus for the first time. Meanwhile, our results support the existence of a cross-plane intralayer negative Poisson's ratio in the constituent phosphorene layers under uniaxial deformation along the zigzag axis, which is in line with a previous theoretical prediction. The phenomenon originates from the puckered structure of its in-plane lattice, together with coupled hinge-like bonding configurations.

AB Monte Carlo computer simulations with variable shape of the periodic box were performed for a few two-dimensional, hard-body models showing elastically isotropic solid phases. Two examples of homomolecular (i.e. consisting of identical molecules) systems of anisotropic molecules are discussed which form unusual solid phases, showing negative Poisson's ratio and know as auxetic ones, at densities and pressures higher than the elastically isotropic solid phases. Sharp extremes of the Poisson's ratio were observed for both systems at freezing of the orientational degrees of freedom of the molecules: a minimum was observed for the system for which the auxetic phase with frozen rotation is isotropic and a maximum was found for the other system. This indicates that isotropic auxetic phases can have auxetic precursors with much more negative Poisson's ratios than those characterizing the auxetic phases themselves. An example of a hetero-molecular (i.e. mixture consisting of different molecules), elastically isotropic system is also discussed - the polydisperse hard disc system. The simulations revealed a maximum of the Poisson's ratio in the close packing limit at any nonzero polydispersity. Although no manifestation of any auxetic behaviour has been found in this system, the obtained results indicate other unusual effect - a jump (discontinuity) of the Poisson's ratio at close packing when the polydispersity tends to zero. The results obtained in this work demonstrate that the Poisson's ratio can play the role of a sensitive indicator of (at least) some structural changes in solids. (c) 2005 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB Phononic crystals (PCs) are a kind of acoustic composite materials which have periodic structures and exhibit elastic wave (EW) band gaps. Due to their unique properties the phononic crystals have potential applications in acoustic devices and noise control, etc. The effects of both positive and negative Poisson's ratios on the phononic band gaps (PBGs) due to either Bragg scattering or locally resonance in three-dimensional (3D) solid/solid phononic crystals with a simple-cubic (SC) lattice are studied. The band structures are obtained by the finite difference time domain (FDTD) method combined with the fast Fourier transform-(FFT-) based postprocessing method. The numerical results show that Poisson's ratio of the scatterer plays an important role in tuning the PBGs.

AB Double arrowhead honeycombs (DAHs) are auxetic cellular materials with negative Poisson's ratio (NPR). The quasi-static and impact behaviors of both uniform and functionally graded DAHs are explored. Analytical expressions for the in-plane Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio and quasi-static yield stress of uniform DAHs are derived and are found to be consistent with finite element (FE) predictions, showing that the quasi-static yield stress of DAHs is dependent upon the geometrical parameters and NPR. Systematical simulations of uniform DAHs subject to different impact velocities reveal that there exists a critical impact velocity beyond which the dynamic plateau stress is insensitive to the effect of NPR. A semi-empirical expression of the plateau stress is obtained. For functionally graded DAHs, they are shown to only have improved energy absorption capacity under high velocity impacts. Moreover, the results of uniform DAHs are shown to be able to be adopted to interpret the simulated plateau stress of functionally graded DAHs under impact loading. The deformation mechanisms associated with the impact resistance of DAHs are also discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To date, microstructural modelling of auxetic materials has relied mainly on the assumption of both a regular and a homogeneous microstructure present throughout the bulk material. The disorder within a material is seen as something undesirable, with the expectation that disorder or heterogeneity will tend to reduce the range of properties available. In this work the presence of short-range variations in the elastic Moduli are considered together with the resulting effect on a material's Poisson's ratio. It is shown that such variations alone can Cause a Material with a mean positive Poisson's ratio to become negative (auxetic). In addition, anisotropic variations can enhance the magnitude of a negative Poisson's ratio. (C) 2008 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Although a number of interesting physical properties such as a negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) and Dirac semimetal (DS) properties have been recently predicted in two-dimensional (2D) materials, the realization of a 2D material that exhibits both of these DS and NPR features has rarely been reported. Here by adopting particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms combined with first-principles methods, we successfully construct a novel SiO monolayer (Pmna), the dynamic and thermal stability of which was characterized using phonon spectrum calculations and molecular dynamics simulations. In particular, Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio calculations showed that thePmnamonolayer exhibits high mechanical anisotropy with an in-plane NPR originating from its puckered atomic arrangement. More notably, the band structure of thePmnamonolayer possesses zero bandgap with four Dirac cones in its first Brillouin zone, exhibiting a DS feature. From the calculations of orbital-resolved band structures, the Dirac cone was revealed to originate from the orbital hybridization of Si and O atoms. ThePmnamonolayer is the first 2D structure in the Si-O system that has both an NPR and Dirac semi-metal properties, providing a new model for exploring 2D multifunctional materials.

AB A simple method to measure the elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio of diamond-like carbon (DLC) films deposited on Si wafer was suggested. This method involved etching a side of Si substrate using the DLC him as an etching mask. The edge of DLC overhang free from constraint of Si substrate exhibited periodic sinusoidal shape. By measuring the amplitude and the wavelength of the sinusoidal edge, we can determine the strain of the film required to adhere to the substrate. Combined with independent stress measurement by laser reflection method, this method allows calculation of the biaxial elastic modulus, E/(1 - nu); where E is the Elastic modulus and nu Poisson's ratio Of the DLC films. By comparing the biaxial elastic modulus with plane-strain modulus, E/(1 - nu(2)), measured by nano-indentation, me could further determine the elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio, independently. This method was employed to measure the mechanical properties of DLC films deposited by C6H6 r.f. glow discharge at the deposition pressure 1.33 Pa. The elastic modulus, E, increased from 94 to 128 GPa as the negative bias voltage increased from 400 to 550 V. Poisson's ratio was estimated to be about 0.22 in this bias voltage range. For the negative bias voltages less than 400 V, however, the present method resulted in negative Poisson's ratio. The limitation of the present method was discussed.

AB In this paper the static and dynamic performances of sandwich structures with in-plane negative Poisson's ratio core are investigated from an analytical point of view. The cellular material theory is applied to calculate the orthotropic mechanical properties of re-entrant cell honeycomb cores which shows negative Poisson's ratio values. This special geometrical layout of the cells allows an higher out-of-plane shear modulus compared to the one of regular honeycombs. The laminate orthotropic plate theory with shear correction factors is applied in order to describe the static and dynamic behaviour of symmetric sandwich plates with different core to sheet thickness ratios. Comparisons are made with analogous structures with regular honeycomb. The maximum deflections due to uniform pressure and buckling loads are enhanced, while the natural Frequencies show a slight enhancing for some parameters of the cells.

AB The auxetic materials and structures exhibiting negative Poisson's ratio are essentially used in filtration, medical devices, energy absorbing applications, etc. The auxetic materials excel at traditional materials due to better mechanical performance. This paper presents the auxetic fabrics produced using Helical Auxetic Yarn (HAY). The HAY was developed by wrapping a stiffer yarn (multifilament Kevlar) on core yarn (multifilament Polypropylene), by varying wrap to core angle from 8 degrees to 20 degrees. The recent research works report the auxeticity of HAY woven fabric, but the scope is limited to a particular weave pattern with a certain warp to core angle. In this study, the developed HAYs were used to weave fabrics in four different weaving patterns. The woven fabrics were produced using HAY as warp and Kevlar as weft. Furthermore, auxetic effect exhibited by HAY and subsequent woven fabrics was studied. It was found that the lower wrap to core angle in HAY yielded higher auxetic effect. Moreover, the matt woven fabric developed using 8 degrees HAY exhibited maximum auxetic effect. The developed structure can be effectively used for filtration or energy absorbing applications.

AB This paper presents an experimental investigation on the acoustic properties of a novel concept of auxetic (Negative Poisson's ratio) open cell polyurethane gray foam for dynamic crash loading applications. The acoustic absorption coefficients and real and imaginary part of the specific acoustic impedance have been measured with an ASTM standard impedance tube using a transmissibility technique. The foam shows a significant increase of the absorption properties in the low frequency range compared to equivalent conventional open cell foams. The acoustic properties of the foams are identified using an empirical model to describe their structural characteristic.

AB The Poisson's ratio of materials describes the ratio of the transverse to axial strain. While most materials exhibit non-negative Poisson ratio, here we focus on the topological properties of negative ratio materials also known as auxetic constructs. Digital modelling and physical fabrication are employed to generate and test experimental auxetic configurations. The first set of studies employ 2D space-filling tessellations integrating both negative and positive Poisson ratio cells. The tessellations are designed through binary state transitions and gradual morphing transitions. A second set of studies explores the topological optimization of a single negative Poisson cell configuration following the logic that a cell constitutes the building block of auxetic materials. The third set of studies focuses on the translation of heterogeneous Poisson ratio 2D tessellations into 3D constructs. Here, two methods of fabrication are explored: lamination method and cellular grading. The precision of the cellular grading method renders it particularly suitable for multi-material 3D printing fabrication which is theoretically studied and proposed. Space-filling heterogeneous tessellation studies are applied to architectural and product design proposals. These proposals exhibit properties that could serve to design and develop further research on real-world applications.

ID DESIGN
AB Auxetic honeycombs show in-plane negative Poisson's ratio properties; they expand in all directions when pulled in only one, and contract when compressed. This characteristic is due to the re-entrant shape of the honeycomb unit cell. The cell convoluteness gives a geometric stiffening effect that affects the linear elastic properties of the whole cellular solid. In this paper finite element simulations are carried out to calculate the in-plane Poisson's ratio and Young's moduli of re-entrant cell honeycombs for different geometric layout combinations (side cell aspect ratio, relative thickness and internal cell angle) subjected to uniaxial loading. The results show a high sensitivity of the mechanical properties for particular ranges of the geometric cell parameters. An image data detection technique is used to extract displacements and strains from an aramid paper re-entrant honeycomb sample in a tensile test. The comparison between numerical and experimental results shows good agreement.

AB This paper has demonstrated that interpenetrating composites could be designed to not only have an significantly enhanced Young's modulus, but also have a Poisson's ratio at a desired value (e.g. positive, or negative, or zero). It is found that when the effect of the Poisson's ratio is absent, the Young's modulus of interpenetrating composites is closer to the Hashin and Shtrikman's upper limit than to their lower limit, and much larger than the simulation and experimentally measured results of the conventional isotropic particle or fibre composites. It is also illustrated that at the nanoscale, the interphase can either strengthen or weaken the stiffness, and the elastic properties of interpenetrating composites are size dependent.

AB An auxetic foam structure is described which has the property of widening when stretched (negative Poisson's ratio behaviour), in contrast to the situation with most materials which narrow when stretched. The fabrication of this material involves a combination of heat and compressive treatments of a conventional commercial air-filtration foam. The resulting microstructure is examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The pertinent mechanical properties are described in terms of the changes in specimen dimensions and associated strains. From these quantities, Poisson's ratios are determined for the large strain regime involved. The property of being able to open pores by stretching the material is a useful feature in various types of filtration application. In particular, where the long-term efficiency of the process is hindered by ingress of particles into the system which block the active pore structure, the marriage of permeability and mechanical deformation via a negative Poisson's ratio offers an alternative to other methods of clearance. This notion is illustrated by the use of some very simple tests in which the foam is challenged by glass beads of uniform diameter. Simple air pressure-drop tests are also performed on auxetic and conventional foams to demonstrate that the change in permeability due to mechanical deformation enables a means of varying the pressure-drop acting across an auxetic foam to a far greater degree than is possible for the conventional foams.

AB In this paper, a new kind of hierarchical tube with a negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) is proposed. The first level tube is constructed by rolling up an auxetic hexagonal honeycomb. Then, the second level tube is produced by substituting the arm of the auxetic sheet with the first level tube and rolling it up. The Nth (N >= 1) level tube can be built recursively. Based on the Euler beam theory, the equivalent elastic parameters of the NPR hierarchical tubes under small deformations are derived. Under longitudinal axial tension, instead of shrinking, all levels of the NPR hierarchical tubes expand in the transverse direction. Using these kinds of auxetic tubes as reinforced fibers in composite materials would result in a higher resistance to fiber pullout. Thus, this paper provides a new strategy for the design of fiber reinforced hierarchical bio-inspired composites with a superior pull-out mechanism, strength and toughness. An application with super carbon nanotubes concludes the paper.

AB This paper presents a systematic approach for designing 3D auxetic lattice materials, which exhibit constant negative Poisson's ratios over large strain intervals. A unit cell model mimicking tensile tests is established and based on the proposed model, the secant Poisson's ratio is defined as the negative ratio between the lateral and the longitudinal engineering strains. The optimization problem for designing a material unit cell with a target Poisson's ratio is formulated to minimize the average lateral engineering stresses under the prescribed deformations. Numerical results demonstrate that 3D auxetic lattice materials with constant Poisson's ratios can be achieved by the proposed optimization formulation and that two sets of material architectures are obtained by imposing different symmetry on the unit cell. Moreover, inspired by the topology-optimized material architecture, a subsequent shape optimization is proposed by parametrizing material architectures using super-ellipsoids. By designing two geometrical parameters, simple optimized material microstructures with different target Poisson's ratios are obtained. By interpolating these two parameters as polynomial functions of Poisson's ratios, material architectures for any Poisson's ratio in the interval of nu is an element of [ -0.78, 0.00] are explicitly presented. Numerical evaluations show that interpolated auxetic lattice materials exhibit constant Poisson's ratios in the target strain interval of [0.00, 0.20] and that 3D auxetic lattice material architectures with programmable Poisson's ratio are achievable.

AB Two very important factors which determine the effectiveness of a pump are its volumetric and energy efficiencies. Yin and Ghoneim constructed a prototype of a flexible body pump with a very high volumetric efficiency or pumping potential (the relative volume reduction due to a relative input stroke) [1]. The high volumetric efficiency is attributed to the geometry of the pump's structure (hyperboloid) as well as the high negative effective Poisson's ratio of the 3 layer ([0/13/0]) flexible-matrix-composite (carbon/polyurethane) laminate adopted for the body of the pump. The energy efficiency was not evaluated. An important factor in assessing the energy efficiency of flexible-body pumps is the effective damping (a measure of the energy dissipation per cycle) of the flexible body material. An objective of the current work is to determine the effective damping inherent in the 3-layer laminate, as a function of the two angle orientations 0 and (3, employed for the design of the flexible body pump. Thereby, the best fiber angle orientation, for the highest volumetric as well as energy efficiency, can be considered. The contribution of this " work is twofold: 1) viscoelastic characterization (longitudinal, transverse, and shear complex moduli, as well as the in-plane complex Poisson's ratio) of the polyurethane/carbon composite, used in the Geo-polymer lab at RIT; the results may be utilized as benchmarks for other researchers using similar carbon/polyurethane in dynamic applications, and 2) provide a comprehensive study of the effect of the two angles 0 and 13 on the effective damping factors of the three-layer laminate. Together with the similar study on the negative Poisson's ratio [1], a better design of the laminate for the most efficient flexible-body pump performance can be established.

AB Auxetics expand laterally when uniaxially stretched. In many cases, this behaviour has been attributed to the interplay between the geometry of the system and its deformation mechanism. This work revisits a class of 2D motifs, the so-called chiral honeycombs, which are closely associated with auxetic behaviour. More specifically, we show that systems based on this motif, particularly those having a Poisson's ratio of -1, can be engineered with specific constraints that limit the in-plane expansion, with the result that on inducing deformation of the systems, these veer out-of-plane to form dome-like structures. This effect is demonstrated in simple prototypes and it is shown through a simplified mathematical model that the extent of curvature can be controlled through the various parameters that describe such structures.

AB Structures that possess Negative Poisson's Ratio are known as auxetics. The successful application of auxetics requires appropriate design optimisation. Hence, in the present work, customised auxetics namely re-entrant honeycomb, missing rib and anti-tri-chiral has been developed using a two-step hybrid optimisation technique. The technique is based on the amalgamation of multiobjective optimisation and topological optimisation. A combined objective is set as maximum elastic moduli and minimum Poisson's ratio with prioritised objective as maximum elastic moduli and mass as the response constraint. Initially, an optimal shape of a unit cell based on the Pareto front has been chosen considering the prioritised objective. Thereafter, finite element simulation was performed to evaluate the auxetic behaviour followed by topological optimisation using the density-based method. Using the developed model, the morphological and mechanical properties of the designed auxetics have been compared. The re-entrant honeycomb structure has been found as the most reliable auxetics with the highest elastic modulus and auxetic behaviour. The induced maximum stress in the array and structure of re-entrant honeycomb was 320.7 MPa and 168.77 MPa respectively. The results revealed that the developed methodology can be utilised as an advanced tool for achieving topologically optimised auxetics with desired properties.

AB Auxetic metamaterials have enhanced indentation and penetration resistance due to their high shear strength and modulus. Its auxetic performance under dynamic loading cases is an important property for shields and armour applications. In the present study, compressive tests at different impact velocities on buckling-induced auxetic metamaterials were conducted for two different initial geometries. A photographic technique was applied to measure the Poisson's ratio. When the dynamic data were compared with those of quasi-static experiments, it was found that the negative Poisson's ratio for the buckling-induced metamaterial is sensitive to the rate of loading, while the negative Poisson's ratio for the metamaterial with initial auxetic behaviour is insensitive to the loading rate. It was also found that the deformation pattern is similar to that in the quasi-static loading condition when the impact force measured by the test machine is dominated by the inertia force of the metamaterials.

AB A new design thought for 3D auxetic material is proposed based on the rotaion mechanism of chiral honeycombs. Two kinds of cell shape of the 3D auxetic material are studied as example, which are developed from the tetrachiral honeycombs with circular loops and square loops, respectively, with inclined rods connecting the neighbor layers. By replacing the tetrachiral honeycomb layers by other chiral honeycombs, such as trichiral, hexachiral honeycombs, other kinds of 3D chiral material with negative Poisson's ratio can be obtained. Moreover, since the cells' deformation of the 3D material is dominated by that of ligaments and rods under small deformation, the elastic properties of the 3D auxetic material are almost independent of the loops' shape. Thus, the loop can be designed to any shape instead of the traditional circular loop in order to obtain priory mechanical properties under large deformation. Based on beam theory and micromechanical method, the analytical formulas of both the elastic mudulus and Poisson's ratio are deduced for this category of 3D chiral material, which are verified by numerical simulations but also the experiment of 3D printed model. The verification results indicate that the formulas have higher precision and wider application scope. The influence of layer space on the equivalent parameters and the conditions for isotropic realization are discussed base on the analytical formulas. By changing the oblique direction of the inclined rods, another new 3D material can be obtained with positive Poisson's ratio in two directions and negative Poisson's ratio in the other one direction, for which the analytical formulas are still applicable.

AB Foams have previously been fabricated with a negative Poisson's ratio (termed auxetic foams). A novel model is proposed to explain this and to describe the strain-dependent Poisson's function behaviour of honeycomb and foam materials. The model is two-dimensional and is based upon the observation of broken cell ribs in foams processed via the compression and heating technique usually employed to convert conventional foams to auxetic behaviour. The model has two forms: the "intact" form is a network of ribs with biaxial symmetry, and the "auxetic" form is a similar network but with a proportion of cell ribs removed. The model output is compared with that of an existing two-dimensional model and experimental data, and is found to be superior in predicting the Poisson's function and marginally better at predicting the stress-strain behaviour of the experimental data than the existing model, using realistic values for geometric parameters.

AB Large sheets of polyurethane open-cell foam were compressed (or stretched) using pins and a conversion mould whilst undergoing thermal softening and controlled cooling. Sheets (final dimensions 355 x 344 x 20 mm) were fabricated with uniform triaxial compression, with and without through thickness pins, and also with different compression regimes (uniform triaxial compression or through thickness compression and biaxial planar tension) in opposing quadrants. The samples fabricated under uniform triaxial compression with and without pins exhibited similar cell structure and mechanical properties. The sheets fabricated with graded compression levels displayed clearly defined quadrants of differing cell structure and mechanical properties. The graded foam quadrants subject to triaxial compression displayed similar cell structure, tangent moduli and negative Poisson's ratio responses to the uniform foams converted with a similar level of triaxial compression. The graded foam quadrants subject to through-thickness compression and biaxial planar tension displayed a slightly re-entrant through-thickness cell structure contrasting with an in-plane structure resembling the fully reticulated cell structure of the unconverted parent foam. This quadrant of graded foam displayed positive and negative Poisson's ratios in tension and compression, respectively, accompanied by high and low in plane tangent modulus, respectively. The strain-dependent mechanical properties are shown to be fully consistent with expectations from honeycomb theory. The triaxially compressed quadrants of the graded sheet exhibited 4 times lower peak acceleration than quadrants with through-thickness compression and biaxial planar tension in 6 J impact tests using a steel hemispherical drop mass.

AB Ten different simulation models are used to investigate the effects of content and chirality of graphene on the mechanical properties of nanolayered graphene/Cu composites. The increasing volume fraction of graphene can significantly enhance the Young's modulus and tensile strength of composites, but it leads to a lower yield strain. The negative Poisson's ratio of composites (NPRC) under uniaxial tension is observed at an atomic level. The corresponding mechanism is revealed by enhanced surface effect and inhomogeneous distribution of stress due to graphene-Cu interface. The strengthening mechanism of graphene is investigated by constraining effect in elastic region and blocking effect in plastic region. In a multi-layer structure, the middle copper film shows better tensile properties as its movement is constrained between two graphene layers. The blocking effect plays an important role in the interface interaction between graphene and dislocations. Graphene effectively blocks dislocations from penetrating through and restricts the synergistic movement of copper atoms. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A highly fibrillar auxetic form of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) has been fabricated by using a powder processing route comprising two stages-sintering and extrusion. The resulting material has a low density (720 kg/m(3)) and low flexural strength and modulus (up to 6 MPa and 62 MPa, respectively) but much larger negative Poisson's ratio when compared with auxetic UHMWPE fabricated using an additional preliminary compaction stage followed by sintering and extrusion. The effects of die geometry on the mechanical properties of this material are examined. The indentation resistance and ultrasonic attenuation of the novel, highly fibrillar auxetic material were measured, and it was found that the indentation resistance was enhanced only at very low loads (i.e. 5 N and 10 N) when compared with conventionally processed UHMWPE. After this, the lack of structural integrity of the material outweighed the benefits of its being auxetic. However the ultrasonic attenuation was found to be extremely good, and much enhanced over conventionally processed UHMWPE, with the attenuation coefficient being at least 47 dB/cm, compared with 8 dB/cm.

AB The surge of interest in so-called "designer materials" during the last few years together with recent advances in additive manufacturing (3D printing) techniques that enable fabrication of materials with arbitrarily complex nano/micro-architecture have attracted increasing attention to the concept of mechanical metamaterials. Owing to their rationally designed nano/micro-architecture, mechanical metamaterials exhibit unusual properties at the macro-scale. These unusual mechanical properties could be exploited for the development of materials with advanced functionalities, with applications in soft robotics, biomedicine, soft electronics, acoustic cloaking, etc. Auxetic mechanical metamaterials are identified by a negative Poisson's ratio and are perhaps the most widely studied type of mechanical metamaterials. Similar to other types of mechanical metamaterials, the negative Poisson's ratio of auxetics is generally a direct consequence of the topology of their nano/micro-architecture. This paper therefore focuses on the topology-property relationship in three main classes of auxetic metamaterials, namely re-entrant, chiral, and rotating (semi-) rigid structures. While the deformation mechanisms in the above-mentioned types of structures and their relationship with the large-scale mechanical properties receive most attention, the emerging concepts in design of auxetics such as the use of instability in soft matter and origamibased structures are discussed as well. Furthermore, the data available in the literature regarding the elastic properties of auxetic mechanical metamaterials are systematically analyzed to identify the spread of Young's modulus-Poisson's ratio duos achieved in the auxetic materials developed to date.

AB Lightweight auxetic reentrant honeycombs (ARH) with negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) are very promising for crashworthiness applications due to high specific-strength and energy-absorption (EA). To dig up the potential of ARH, a bio-inspired self-similar "concentric auxetic reentrant honeycomb (CARH)" is proposed to reinforce the EA. Finite element model is established and verified via available reference results for quasi-static-, low-, medium- and high-velocity compression. Two types of CARHs including CARH-I and CARH-II are designed to systematically explore the crashworthiness. The quasi-static and dynamic compression behaviors and EA characteristics are compared among different structures. There is a harvest that the bio-inspired CARHs show higher plateau stress and EA than the traditional ARH, while CARH-II > CARH-I. To clearly understand strengthening mechanisms, different global and unicellular shrinkage deformation modes (e.g., "x", "X", "I", "V", etc.) are revealed under different velocities. Summarily, the enhancement is due to coupling deformation and energy-dissipation of more plastic-hinges. The horizontal strain of each layer is studied to reveal the NPR effect, which shows a significant velocity effect on the horizontal strain. From parametric studies, typical parameters (e.g. wall-thickness, distance and number of concentric walls) have considerable effects on crashworthiness of CARH. The present bio-inspired design and findings offer a reference for the development of honeycomb with special functions.

AB This work is devoted to the experimental determination of Poisson's ratio at temperatures of 20-1000A degrees C, which was carried out on cylindrical samples of a single-crystal heat-resistant nickel alloy with crystallographic orientations of (CGOs) [001], [011], and [111]. The modulus of elasticity for the samples of these orientations has also been determined. It has been established that, in samples of heat-resistant nickel singlecrystal alloy with CGO [011], Poisson's ratio can vary from negative to positive values depending on the azimuthal orientation, i.e., on the crystallographic directions that lie in the plane perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the sample. To control the azimuthal CGO of cylindrical samples [011], a special metallographic procedure was developed based on the determination of the dendritic structure on the butt ends of these samples using etching. The data on the azimuthal orientation were subsequently used to place a sensor in order to determine the transverse deformation in these directions.

AB Common materials have Poisson's ratio values ranging from 0.0 to 0.5. Auxetic materials exhibit negative Poisson's ratio. They expand laterally when stretched longitudinally and contract laterally when compressed. In recent years the use of textile technology to fabricate auxetic materials has attracted more and more attention. It is reflected in the extent of available research work exploring the auxetic potential of various textile structures and subsequent increase in the number of research papers published. Generally there are two approaches to producing auxetic textiles. The first one includes the use of auxetic fibers to produce an auxetic textile structure, whereas the other utilizes conventional fibres to produce a textile structure with auxetic properties. This review deals with auxetic materials in general and in the specific context of auxetic polymers, auxetic fibers, and auxetic textile structures made from conventional fibers and knitted structures with auxetic potential.

AB Unprecedented sign change of Poisson's ratio not only paves the way for diverse applications, but it provides a sense of deep understanding of 'hidden' mechanics, yet to be discovered. Stochastically distributed multi-walled carbon nanotubes in the form of buckypaper can possess negative Poisson's ratio, but the underlying design principles are still unclear. Herein, we explored analytical approaches, namely, energy minimization, structural modeling, and force-balance as a means to target negative Poisson's ratio in the buckypaper. Though 'zero' Poisson's ratio is still achievable, the controlling parameters could not be identified. Guided by a 'keyed-brick' structure, a simple geometrical model is then constructed to account for sliding effects in carbon nanotubes for contemporary understanding of auxetic behavior (negative Poisson's ratio). The alignment of carbon nanotubes plays a prominent role in augmenting the magnitude of negative Poisson's ratio. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Control over the deformation behaviour that a cellular structure shows in response to imposed external forces is a requirement for the effective design of mechanical metamaterials, in particular those with negative Poisson's ratio. This article sheds light on the old question of the relationship between geometric microstructure and mechanical response, by comparison of the deformation properties of bar-and-joint frameworks with those of their realisation as a cellular solid made from linear-elastic material. For ordered planar tessellation models, we find a classification in terms of the number of degrees of freedom of the framework model: first, in cases where the geometry uniquely prescribes a single deformation mode of the framework model, the mechanical deformation and Poisson's ratio of the linearly-elastic cellular solid closely follow those of the unique deformation mode; the result is a bending-dominated deformation with negligible dependence of the effective Poisson's ratio on the underlying material's Poisson's ratio and small values of the effective Young's modulus. Second, in the case of rigid structures or when geometric degeneracy prevents the bending-dominated deformation mode, the effective Poisson's ratio is material-dependent and the Young's modulus (E) over tilde (cs) large. All analysed structures of this type have positive values of the Poisson's ratio and large values of (E) over tilde (cs). Third, in the case, where the framework has multiple deformation modes, geometry alone does not suffice to determine the mechanical deformation. These results clarify the relationship between mechanical properties of a linear-elastic cellular solid and its corresponding bar-and-joint framework abstraction. They also raise the question if, in essence, auxetic behaviour is restricted to the geometry-guided class of bending-dominated structures corresponding to unique mechanisms, with inherently low values of the Young's modulus.

AB Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) layered materials with orthorhombic symmetry and distinct planar crystallographic lattices down to the monolayer limit, can potentially display in-plane anisotropy and diverse functionalities arising from their structural anisotropy. Typically, group-IV monopnictides (SiP, SiAs, GeP and GeAs) and dipnictides (SiP2, SiAs2, GeP2 and GeAs2) are two prototypical types of synthetic vdW layered materials characterized by orthorhombic symmetry and in-plane anisotropy in their 2D layered structural forms. In the current work, in order to provide deep insights into the in-plane anisotropic properties and especially to explore the new functionalities associated with in-plane anisotropy that have not yet been uncovered experimentally so far, we perform first-principles calculations to systematically investigate the structural, mechanical, electronic and optical properties, and electromechanical responses for 2D group-IV monopnictide AB and dipnictide AB(2) (A = Si and Ge, B = P and As) monolayers. Based on our calculations, both 2D monopnictide and dipnictide monolayers are predicted to exhibit in-plane anisotropy in their mechanical, electronic and optical absorption properties, including distinct elastic constants, Young's moduli, effective carrier masses and optical absorption along the two planar directions. Especially, owing to the unique 2D puckered crystal structure composed of corner-sharing AB(4) tetrahedrons, AB(2) monolayers can exhibit an extraordinarily large in-plane negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) of up to -0.32, making these group-IV dipnictides rare 2D auxetic materials. Moreover, compared to the centrosymmetric AB monopnictides, 2D AB(2) monolayers are characterized by acentric symmetry, where non-zero electric polarization can be obtained along one of the planar axes. Such a structural polarity can lead to a sizable negative longitudinal piezoelectric coefficient d(33) as large as -11.84 pC N-1. These intriguing properties arise from the in-plane anisotropy making 2D group-IV dipnictides of great promise for applications such as nanoscale auxetic sensors and low dimensional electromechanical devices.

AB Poisson's ratio (PR), the relation between lateral contraction of an elastic rod when subjected to a longitudinal extension, has a long and interesting history. For isotropic bodies, it can theoretically range from + 1/2 to - 1; the experimental gamut for anisotropic materials is even larger. For the vast majority of materials the PR is positive for all combinations of directions. But as far back as the 1800s, Voigt and others found that for some materials negative values were encountered. Negative PR (nPR) values remained for man), years merely a curiosity, but more recently some of the interesting technological consequences have come to he recognized [1-3]. Some of the counterintuitive acoustic possibilities of nPRs are analogous, in a certain fashion, to those arising with negative refraction electromagnetic materials [4]. Even when a material does not have nPR properties, if it is piezoelectric, then the PR can be altered, sometimes by, appreciable amounts, by changing the electrical boundary conditions [5-6]. We review Poisson's ratio in crystals, describing technologically important materials that have small, or negative PRs. Potential applications of the nPR property are also mentioned.

AB This paper presents a stiffening method by which new inclined walls are added to the classical re-entrant honeycomb cell. This modification boosts the in-plane rigidity of the re-entrant cell without significant loss from auxetic behaviour. This study focuses on the in-plane elasticity moduli and negative Poisson's ratios along the principal axes. Analytical expressions that calculate the elasticity moduli and negative Poisson's ratios are derived; both finite element modelling and experiments reported in the literature validate the expressions of this work. Further, the variation in the in-plane elastic properties of the core cell is examined by altering the new wall's geometric, sectional, and material parameters. The results from the analytical expressions and the finite element models match very closely and demonstrate the boosted rigidity of the cell proposed in this work. This work also provides a benchmark of the new cell against the classical cell that can be used to tailor the in-plane elasticity moduli and negative Poisson's ratios to suit the needs of different applications.

Moreover, its Poisson's ratio can be designed at a desired value, e.g. positive, or negative, or zero.

AB Architectured materials exhibit negative Poisson's ratios and enhanced mechanical properties compared with regular materials. Their auxetic behaviors emerge from periodic cellular structures regardless of the materials used. The majority of such metamaterials are constructed by top-down approaches and macroscopic with unit cells of microns or larger. There are also molecular auxetics including natural crystals which are not designable. There is a gap from few nanometers to microns, which may be filled by biomolecular self-assembly. Herein, we demonstrate two-dimensional auxetic nanostructures using DNA origami. Structural reconfigurations are performed by two-step DNA reactions and complemented by mechanical deformation studies using molecular dynamics simulations. We find that the auxetic behaviors are mostly defined by geometrical designs, yet the properties of the materials also play an important role. From elasticity theory, we introduce design principles for auxetic DNA metamaterials.

AB Eight diamond-like structures (tubulanes) of different morphology based on carbon nanotubes are studied by the combination of molecular dynamics simulation and analytical calculations. Molecular dynamics is used for the structure relaxation, stability analysis, and calculation of the stiffness and compliance coefficients of stable tubulanes. Six stable tubulanes which can be elastically deformed are distinguished among the considered structures. Engineering elastic constants such as Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, shear modulus, and bulk modulus are found by analytical methods. Two of the studied structures, TA6 and TB, are found to be partial auxetics having negative Poisson's ratio with the minimum values of -0.01 and - 0.8, respectively. The maximum Young's modulus for tubulanes TA6, TA8, and TB is found to be > 1 TPa. In combination with hardness close to that of diamond, considered phases with their outstanding mechanical properties can be potentially used as protective coatings.

AB Buckling is one type of unstable structural response which has been known for centuries. Although buckling is generally regarded as a type of undesirable phenomenon, many investigations reported that it can be utilized to generate buckling-induced metamaterials and structures with negative Poisson's ratio. Recent studies demonstrate that buckling-induced auxetic behavior will disappear when the base material is changed from elastomer to metal. A pattern scale factor (PSF) method to recover auxeticity of metallic metamaterials and structures was mentioned in previous studies, but the method has not been specifically introduced. Herein, a more detailed introduction of the PSF method is made and some successful case studies are presented.

AB Materials and structures with negative Poisson's ratio are characterized as auxetics. They are interesting for engineering applications due to their non-conventional behavior. However, most of the auxetic structures suffer with a disadvantage that they are difficult to be fabricated because of their complicated geometry structure. To overcome this problem, an auxetic structure made of tubes and corrugated sheets using conventional technology is proposed in this study. Its auxetic effect is investigated by both geometrical analysis and finite element method. For validating the analyses, a real auxetic structure is made with aluminum material and tested under compression condition. All the results obtained show that the proposed structure has very significant negative Poisson's ratio effect under compression. The study has provided a simple way to fabricate auxetic structure for using in a wide range of industrial fields at a low cost.

First, we illustrate how we can construct 2-dimensional (2D) auxetic structures with bow-tie shaped rigid sliding hexagonal units. Next, we show that we can construct 3-dimensional (3D) auxetic structures by arranging hourglass shaped rigid sliding units in regular triangular configuration or in regular square configuration. Also, we show, through theoretical and numerical analysis, that these structures indeed exhibit auxetic behaviors. (C) 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB In this work, a new structure for designing auxetic yarn and its geometrical analysis is presented. The proposed structure is referred to as a double-core helical auxetic yarn (DC-HAY). It consists of two core components of soft yarn with a larger diameter and one wrap component of stiff yarn with a smaller diameter. A primary geometrical model for predicting the Poisson's ratio of the structure was presented through the deformation analysis of the DC-HAY during the tensile loading. Also, the primary proposed model was modified by considering the non-linear behavior of Poisson's ratio of the core components. For the verification of the proposed models, some experiments were conducted based on the initial wrapping angle, as well as the diameter ratio and modulus ratio of components. The results showed that the proposed yarn structure exhibits an apparent auxetic outcome. Moreover, the modified model is capable of predicting the maximum negative Poisson's ratio of the DC-HAY with a desirable error. Furthermore, it was found that the higher modulus ratio of components, higher diameter ratio of components and the lower initial wrapping angle will result in a higher maximum NPR, which were -8.23, -8.16 through the main lateral directions of samples.

AB The study analyzes the elastic properties of chiral metallic nanotubes formed by rolling up thin crystal plates with the [011] and [111] orientations within two frameworks of anisotropic elasticity and molecular statics. Iron, copper and aluminum nanotubes are discussed. It is shown that the tubes have a positive Poisson's ratio in the entire range of chiral angles, unlike nanotubes obtained by rolling up crystal plates with the [010] orientation. Poynting's coefficient of nanotubes rolled up from plates with the [011] orientation becomes negative at certain chiral angles, which corresponds to a change in the twisting direction of the nanotubes under tension. The description of the dependence of the elastic properties of nanotubes on the chiral angle and thickness within anisotropic elasticity theory agrees qualitatively with the results of molecular statics simulations. The results for some chiral metallic nanotubes are quantitatively different.

AB In recent years, three-dimensional auxetic structures have attracted great interest. Generally, three-dimensional auxetic structures are of complicate geometries which make them difficult to fabricate, benefiting from the development of additive manufacturing technologies, many three-dimensional auxetic structures can be made from metals or polymers. However, to the authors' knowledge, the additive manufacturing technology of fiber reinforced polymer is not fully developed, and none three-dimensional auxetic structure made from fiber reinforced polymer has been reported before. To integrate the high specific stiffness, high specific strength, and light weight merits of high-performance fiber reinforced polymer composites into three-dimensional auxetic structures with unique properties, research on composite three-dimensional auxetic structures made from fiber reinforced polymer should be conducted. This paper presents the composite three-dimensional re-entrant auxetic structures made from carbon fiber reinforced polymer laminates using an interlocking assembly method. The auxetic nature of the composite structure has been verified by experimental testing and finite element simulations. Based on the finite element models, the dependences of the Poisson's ratio and effective compression modulus of the composite auxetic three-dimensional re-entrant structure on the re-entrant angle have been studied and compared to metal three-dimensional re-entrant structure. A comparative study of the Poisson's ratio and specific stiffness of carbon fiber reinforced polymer composite auxetic structure with the three-dimensional printed polymer and metal auxetic structures in literature has also been conducted.

AB We describe a new class of negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) open cell PU-PE foams produced by blocking the shape memory effect in the polymer. Contrary to classical NPR open cell thermoset and thermoplastic foams that return to their auxetic phase after reheating (and therefore limit their use in technological applications), this new class of cellular solids has a permanent negative Poisson's ratio behavior, generated through multiple shape memory (mSM) treatments that lead to a fixity of the topology of the cell foam. The mSM-NPR foams have Poisson's ratio values similar to the auxetic foams prior their return to the conventional phase, but compressive stress strain curves similar to the ones of conventional foams. The results show that by manipulating the shape memory effect in polymer microstructures it is possible to obtain new classes of materials with unusual deformation mechanisms.

AB With the development of functional and structural materials, increasing interests have been shown in the field of biomaterials with a negative Poisson's ratio (auxetic), which exhibit the unusual property of becoming thinner when compressed. This unusual property makes it potentially a synthetic replacement biomaterial with adequate mechanical property and wear resistance. In this study, the potential of applying the auxetic ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) for the artificial hip joint was discussed. The contact mechanics characteristics in artificial hip joint replacement under different Poisson's ratios of -1<mu <= 0.5 were investigated and compared using the finite element method. The results show that Poisson's ratio had great effect on the contact mechanics in artificial hip joint replacement. Therefore, the future work should focus on tailoring an auxetic UHMWPE with a suitable Poisson's ratio for artificial hip joint replacements.

TI Sign change of Poisson's ratio for carbon nanotube sheets
SO SCIENCE

DT Article
ID NETWORK; MECHANICS; BUNDLES; PAPER
AB Most materials shrink laterally like a rubber band when stretched, so their Poisson's ratios are positive. Likewise, most materials contract in all directions when hydrostatically compressed and decrease density when stretched, so they have positive linear compressibilities. We found that the in- plane Poisson's ratio of carbon nanotube sheets ( buckypaper) can be tuned from positive to negative by mixing single- walled and multiwalled nanotubes. Density- normalized sheet toughness, strength, and modulus were substantially increased by this mixing. A simple model predicts the sign and magnitude of Poisson's ratio for buckypaper from the relative ease of nanofiber bending and stretch, and explains why the Poisson's ratios of ordinary writing paper are positive and much larger. Theory also explains why the negative in- plane Poisson's ratio is associated with a large positive Poisson's ratio for the sheet thickness, and predicts that hydrostatic compression can produce biaxial sheet expansion. This tunability of Poisson's ratio can be exploited in the design of sheet- derived composites, artificial muscles, gaskets, and chemical and mechanical sensors.

AB Auxetic materials exhibiting a negative Poisson's ratio are shown to have better indentation resistance, impact shielding capability, and enhanced toughness. Here, we report a class of high-performance composites in which auxetic lattice structures are used as the reinforcements and the nearly incompressible soft material is employed as the matrix. This coupled geometry and material design concept is enabled by the state-of-the-art additive manufacturing technique. Guided by experimental tests and finite element analyses, we systematically study the compressive behavior of the 3D printed auxetics reinforced composites and achieve a significant enhancement of their stiffness and energy absorption. This improved mechanical performance is due to the negative Poisson's ratio effect of the auxetic reinforcements, which makes the matrix in a state of biaxial compression and hence provides additional support. This mechanism is further supported by the investigation of the effect of auxetic degree on the stiffness and energy absorption capability. The findings reported here pave the way for developing a new class of auxetic composites that significantly expand their design space and possible applications through a combination of rational design and 3D printing.

AB Auxetic composites have attracted considerable attention in recent years and have demonstrated a high potential of applications in different areas due to their wonderful properties as compared to non-auxetic composites. In this study, a three-dimensional (3D) auxetic textile structure previously developed was used as reinforcement to fabricate auxetic composites with conventional polyurethane (PU) foam. Both the deformation behavior and mechanical properties of the auxetic composites under compression were analyzed and compared with those of the pure PU foam and non-auxetic composites made with the same materials and structural parameters but with different yarn arrangement. The results show that the negative Poisson's ratio of composites can be obtained when suitable yarn arrangement in a 3D textile structure is adopted. The results also show that the auxetic composites and non-auxetic composites have different mechanical behaviors due to different yarn arrangements in 3D textile structure. While the auxetic composites behave more like damping material with lower compression stress, the non-auxetic composite behaves more like stiffer material with higher compression stress. It is expected that this study could pave a way to the development of innovative 3D auxetic textile composites for different potential applications such as impact protection.

AB Of late, metamaterials have been designed such that they possess properties that can switch between positive and negative signs depending on the external environment. This paper draws inspiration from an Islamic geometric design at the Alhambra Palace for designing a metamaterial that exhibits positive coefficients of thermal, pressure, and moisture expansions upon cooling, pressurizing, and drying but manifests negative coefficients of thermal, pressure, and moisture expansions with heating, deceasing pressure, and moistening such that the metamaterial always shrinks with environmental changes with reference from the original state. The metamaterial is constructed by using straight bimaterial strips with alternating orientation that are joined at the rigid hexagonal junction nodes to form equilateral triangular array such that it transforms into the hexachiral honeycomb structure regardless of how the environmental conditions change. Results indicate that every effective in-plane expansion coefficient is almost linearly proportional to its corresponding environmental change. In addition to exhibiting sign-switching expansion coefficients, the metamaterial displays positive Poisson's ratio in its original state but manifests negative Poisson's ratio upon environmental change(s).

AB This paper presents a study of using weft-knitting technology to fabricate negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) knitted fabrics, which exhibit the unusual property of becoming wider when stretched. Based on a geometrical analysis of a three-dimensional NPR structure constructed with parallelogram planes of the same shape and size, a new kind of NPR weft-knitted fabric was firstly designed and fabricated on a computerized flat-knitting machine. Then the NPR values of these fabrics were evaluated and compared with those from the theoretical calculations. The results show that all knitted fabrics have the NPR effect, which decreases with increased strain in the course direction. This variation trend is consistent with the theoretical prediction. The results also show that the main structure parameter affecting the NPR effect of a fabric is the opening angle at its initial state. Fabric with a smaller opening angle will have higher NPR values. This paper demonstrates the feasibility of fabricating NPR-knitted fabrics by using weft-knitting technology if a suitable structure and parameters are selected.

AB Auxetic metamaterials are known for having a negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) and for displaying the unexpected properties of lateral expansion when stretched and densification when compressed. Even though a wide set of micro-manufacturing resources have been used for the development of auxetic metamaterials and related devices, additional precision and an extension to other families of materials is needed for their industrial expansion. In addition, their manufacture using ceramic materials is still challenging. In this study we present a very promising approach for the development of auxetic metamaterials and devices based on the use of lithography-based ceramic manufacturing. The process stands out for its precision and complex three-dimensional geometries attainable, without the need of supporting structures, and for enabling the manufacture of ceramic auxetics with their geometry controlled from the design stage with micrometric precision. To our knowledge it represents the first example of application of this technology to the manufacture of auxetic geometries using ceramic materials. We have used a special three-dimensional auxetic design whose remarkable NPR has been previously highlighted.

AB Materials that possess a negative Poisson's ratio are called Auxetics. They are characterized by the counterintuitive behavior of expanding in tension and contracting in compression. To justify this deformation behavior, there have been developed theoretical modelations like the reentrant and bowtie models. However, the most generalized models are based on geometries that possess rigid trusses and hinging nodes. This does not portrait the reality of the application of these models. In this study, there have been performed simulations, using kinematic analysis to characterize the auxetic behavior of the theoretical rigid/hinging models and finite element analysis to characterize elastic models that represent real bodies. There were determined and compared the Poisson's ratios of the theoretical and elastic reentrant and bowtie. Additionally it was shown that there is a significant difference between the results. In conclusion the theoretical models predict lower values of Poisson's ratio, while the elastic models that simulate a real body show less auxetic behavior.

AB Negative Poisson's ratio copper foam was prepared and characterized experimentally. The transformation into re-entrant foam was accomplished by applying sequential permanent compressions above the yield point to achieve a triaxial compression. The Poisson's ratio of the re-entrant foam depended on strain and attained a relative minimum at strains near zero. Poisson's ratio as small as - 0.8 was achieved. The strain dependence of properties occurred over a narrower range of strain than in the polymer foams studied earlier. Annealing of the foam resulted in a slightly greater magnitude of negative Poisson's ratio and greater toughness at the expense of a decrease in the Young's modulus.

AB Tendons are visco-elastic structures that connect bones to muscles and perform the basic function of force transfer to and from the skeleton. They are essential for positioning as well as energy storing when involved in more abrupt movements such as jumping. Unfortunately, they are also prone to damage, and when injuries occur, they may have dilapidating consequences. For instance, there is consensus that injuries of tendons such as Achilles tendinopathies, which are common in athletes, are difficult to treat. Here we show, through in vivo and ex vivo tests, that healthy tendons are highly anisotropic and behave in a very unconventional manner when stretched, and exhibit a negative Poisson's ratio (auxeticity) in some planes when stretched up to 2% along their length, i.e. within their normal range of motion. Furthermore, since the Poisson's ratio is highly dependent on the material's microstructure, which may be lost if tendons are damaged or diseased, this property may provide a suitable diagnostic tool to assess tendon health.
   Statement of significance
   We report that human tendons including the Achilles tendons exhibits the very unusual mechanical property of a negative Poisson's ratio (auxetic) meaning that they get fatter rather than thinner when stretched. This report is backed by in vivo and ex vivo experiments we performed which clearly confirm auxeticity in this living material for strains which correspond to those experienced during most normal everyday activities. We also show that this property is not limited to the human Achilles tendon, as it was also found in tendons taken from sheep and pigs. This new information about tendons can form the scientific basis for a test for tendon health as well as enable the design of better tendon prosthesis which could replace damaged tendons.

AB The question is discussed on the possibility of utilization of such simplest fractional derivative viscoelastic models as Kelvin-Voigt and standard linear solid models for the description of the dynamic response of viscoelastic bodies, namely: beams and plates. It has been shown that the adoption of the Kelvin-Voigt model with the fractional derivative in conjunction with the time-independent Poisson's ratio for the description of the dynamic behavior of a viscoelastic Kirchhoff-Love plate results in the fact that the given problem is reduced to the equivalent problem on dynamic response of an elastic Kirchhoff Love plate in a viscoelastic medium with fractional damping. If Young's operator is preassigned via the fractional derivative Kelvin-Voigt model in conjunction with the time-independent coefficient of volume extension-compression for solving the same problem, what seems to be more logical from the point of view of experimental data, then such a model tunes out to be inapplicable at all, while if the shear operator is governed by the fractional derivative Kelvin-Voigt model, then such a model could describe the behavior of so-called auxetic materials with negative Poisson's ratios. As for the fractional derivative standard linear solid model, then it remains to be correct both with and without considering the volume relaxation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In comparing a material's resistance to distort under mechanical load rather than to alter in volume, Poisson's ratio offers the fundamental metric by which to compare the performance of any material when strained elastically. The numerical limits are set by 1/2 and -1, between which all stable isotropic materials are found. With new experiments, computational methods and routes to materials synthesis, we assess what Poisson's ratio means in the contemporary understanding of the mechanical characteristics of modern materials. Central to these recent advances, we emphasize the significance of relationships outside the elastic limit between Poisson's ratio and densification, connectivity, ductility and the toughness of solids; and their association with the dynamic properties of the liquids from which they were condensed and into which they melt.

AB Mechanical metamaterials represent a class of deformable systems, which exhibit macroscopic deformations, mechanical, and/or thermal properties. These emerge due to the structure of their subunits rather than their materials composition and typically exhibit anomalous (normally negative) macroscopic structural, mechanical, or thermal property/properties caused by a change in shape/size of the system. Herein, a class of honeycombs is discussed, which push to the extreme the classical definition of "mechanical metamaterials," exhibiting temperature-tunable Poisson's ratio properties. More specifically, centrosymmetric honeycombs with T-shaped joints constructed from different materials are shown to exhibit temperature-dependent Poisson's ratio values, which can be either positive or negative (auxetic) depending on the external stimulus the system is subjected to. The sign and magnitudes of the Poisson's ratio values are explained in terms of particular geometries that these composite honeycomb systems attain at different temperature conditions. In particular, auxeticity is attributed to the transformation of the T-shaped units to re-entrant units. Practical aspects on how these properties may be achieved are discussed, including the possibility that the changes in shape, and hence Poisson's ratios, are inducedviadifferent extents of dryness on opposite surfaces of ligaments made from absorbent materials.

AB Effective properties and dynamic response of a sandwich panel made of two face sheets and auxetic core are analyzed in this study by computer simulations. The inner composite layer is made of a cellular auxetic structure immersed in a filler material of a given Poisson's ratio (filler material fills the voids in structure). Each cell is composed of an auxetic structure (re-entrant honeycomb or rotating square), i.e., exhibiting negative Poisson's ratio without any filler. Influence of filler material on the effective properties of the sandwich panel is investigated. The proposed structure shows interesting structural characteristics and dynamic properties. Our results clearly show that it is possible to create auxetic sandwich panels made of two solid materials with positive Poisson's ratio. This is even possible if the filler material is nearly incompressible, but can move in out-of-plane direction. Moreover, effective Young's modulus of such sandwich panels becomes very large if the Poisson's ratio of the filler material tends to -1. (C) 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB Some exceptional materials become fatter when stretched and are described as auxetics or having negative Poisson's ratio. Auxetic textiles belong to this class of extraordinary materials that are increasingly attaining some prominence in many applications of technical textiles. We have sustained the efforts to fabricate auxetic fabric structures based on non-auxetic yarns. The focus is to combine our knowledge of geometry and fabric structural characteristics to engineer auxetic textiles and to determine the properties of such auxetic textile fabrics. To realize our objective, we designed and investigated hexagonal knit structures as auxetic textiles offering optimum performance. The factors that influence Poisson's ratio are identified as yarn type, number of chain courses and strain level. Also, a method has been developed for quantifying the geometrical structural unit cell of the auxetic structure based on measured parameters, namely a1, a2, b1, b2, h and c, as detailed in this paper.

AB Force field based simulations have been employed to model the structure, and mechanical and mass transport properties of the all-silica zeolite MFI (ZSM5-Si96O192). Undeformed and deformed MFI subject to uniaxial loading in each of the three principal directions were investigated. The mechanical properties are predicted to include negative on-axis Poisson's ratios ( auxetic behaviour) in the x(1)-x(3) plane of the undeformed structure, and are strain-dependent. Transformation from positive-to-negative Poisson's ratio behaviour, and vice versa, is predicted for most on-axis Poisson's ratios at critical loading strains. Simulations of the simultaneous sorption of neopentane and benzene guest molecules onto the undeformed host MFI framework indicate a low neopentane-to-benzene loading ratio, consistent with experimental observation. The sorption of these two molecular species onto deformed MFI is Poisson's ratio-and strain-dependent. Uniaxial tensile loading along a direction containing a negative on-axis Poisson's ratio leads to an increase in the loading of the larger neopentane molecules with respect to benzene, strongly correlated with the increase in volume associated with auxetic behaviour.

AB Auxetic materials (i.e. materials with a negative Poisson's ratio) expand laterally when stretched and become thinner when compressed. This unusual yet very useful property arises from the way by which the nano or microstructure of the material deforms when subjected to uniaxial mechanical loads. This paper discusses a novel class of molecular-level auxetic (networked polymers) built from calix[4] arene building blocks. These calix[ 4] arene subunits are connected in such a way that they mimic the shape of a "folded macrostructure" which is known to exhibit auxetic behaviour. We confirm through force-field based simulations that these newly proposed networked polymers exhibit negative Poisson's ratios, the magnitudes of which can be changed by introducing slight variations in the molecular structure of these polymers. We also develop simple geometry-based models which explain the values of the Poisson's ratios obtained through the force-field based simulations, and which give an insight into the features of the molecular structure that are responsible for the auxetic effect.

AB Composite materials made of auxetic inclusions and giving rise overall to negative Poisson's ratio are considered, adopting a two-steps micromechanical approach for the calculation of their effective mechanical properties. The inclusions consist of periodic beam lattices, whose equivalent mechanical properties are calculated by a discrete homogenization scheme in a first step. The hexachiral and hexagonal reentrant lattices are considered as representative of the two main deformation mechanisms responsible for auxeticity. In a second step, the equivalent properties of the composite are calculated from numerical homogenization using the finite element method. It is shown that both an auxetic behavior and enhanced moduli can be obtained for not too slender micro-beams. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We conducted molecular statics simulations to investigate the negative Poisson's ratio (auxetic behavior) of periodic porous graphene structures based on the rotating rigid unit mechanism. To obtain a negative Poisson's ratio, simple voids were periodically introduced into graphene. We showed that the Poisson's ratio of the designed graphene structure is strongly dependent on the aspect ratio of the voids, and it can approach the theoretical limit of -1.0. More importantly, the graphene periodic structure maintains its auxetic behavior even under large strains (epsilon similar to 0.20). Hence, it can be employed in a wide range of applications requiring structures that can endure large deformation. In addition, we found that the key factor in the auxeticity of the investigated structures is the deformation occurring at the void tips. (C) 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB Two-dimensional auxetic materials have attracted considerable attention due to their potential applications in medicine, tougher composites, defense, and so on. However, they are scare especially at low dimension, as auxetic materials are mainly realized in engineered materials and structures. Here, using first-principles calculations, we identify a compelling two-dimensional auxetic material, single-layer Ag2S, which possesses large negative Poisson's ratios in both in-plane and out-of-plane directions, but anisotropic ultralow Young's modulus. Such a coexistence of simultaneous negative Poisson's ratios in two directions is extremely rare, which is mainly originated from its particular zigzag-shaped buckling structure. In addition, contrary to the previously known metal-shrouded single-layer M2X (M = metal, X = nonmetal), single-layer Ag2S is the first nonmetal-shrouded M2X. Electronic calculations show that it is an indirect-gap semiconductor with gap value of 2.83 eV, and it can be turned to be direct with strain. These intriguing properties make single-layer Ag2S a promising auxetic material in electronics and mechanics.

AB A 3D lattice structure consisting of pivoting cubes with flexible links at the corners is presented. It exhibits anisotropic negative Poisson's ratio -0.54 and -0.75. Size effects occur in torsion and bending; these effects are consistent with Cosserat elasticity but not with classical elasticity. Cosserat elastic solids exhibit sensitivity to strain gradients; size effects occur in torsion and bending; also reduction in stress concentrations. The observed Cosserat effects also reveal anisotropy.

AB Auxetic materials are those exhibiting negative Poisson's ratio (v) behavior. Polymeric auxetic extruded products in the form of cylinders and fibers have previously been reported. This article reports the successful production of auxetic polypropylene films (similar to 0.15-mm thick) using a melt extrusion process. Video extensometry and tensile testing techniques have been used to measure the in-plane Poisson's ratios and Young's moduli of the auxetic film, both on an Instron tensile testing machine and a Deben microtensile testing machine. The film is elastically anisotropic with the Poisson's ratio and Young's modulus along the extrusion (x) direction being v(xy) = -1.12 +/- 0.06 and E-x = 0.34 +/- 0.01 GPa, respectively, while the Poisson's ratio and Young's modulus in the transverse (y) direction to the extrusion direction are v(yx) = -0.77 +/- 0.01 and E-y = 0.20 +/- 0.01GPa, respectively.

AB A new design principle is suggested for constructing auxetic structures - the structures that exhibit negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) at macroscopic level. We propose 2D assemblies of identical units made of a flexible frame with a sufficiently rigid reinforcing core at the centre. The core increases the frame resistance to the tangential movement thus ensuring high shear stiffness, whereas the normal stiffness is low being controlled by the local bending response of the frame. The structures considered have hexagonal symmetry, which delivers macroscopically isotropic elastic properties in the plane perpendicular to the axis of the symmetry. We determine the macroscopic Poisson's ratio as a ratio of corresponding relative displacements computed using the direct microstructural approach. It is demonstrated that the proposed design can produce a macroscopically isotropic system with NPR close to the lower bound of -1. We also developed a 2D elastic Cosserat continuum model, which represents the microstructure as a regular assembly of rigid particles connected by elastic springs. The comparison of values of NPRs computed using both structural models and the continuum approach shows that the continuum model gives a healthy balance between the simplicity and accuracy and can be used as a simple tool for design of auxetics.

AB Classical elasticity theory indicates that the existence of negative Poisson's ratios (NPRs), i.e. auxetic behavior in materials, will result in an increase in shear stiffness. Motivated by the assumption of gaining potential structural benefits, this study undertook to examine two main issues: (i) the feasibility of inducing auxetic behavior into thin-walled structures; and (ii) in cases where it is possible, whether it leads to shear stiffness enhancement. In the present study, the geometry of a membrane was chosen as a geometric model to address these issues. The results obtained in this study reveal that on the one hand the model effective elastic properties, E* and G*, are lower than those of the material the Surface is fabricated from, E* similar to 1% of the material elastic modulus and G* similar to 80% of its shear modulus. On the other hand, the obtained properties are much higher than those observed for other available auxetics like honeycombs, foams and polymers. (C) 2008 Acta Materialia Inc.

AB Mean-field theory of elastic moduli of a two-phase disordered composite with ellipsoidal inclusions is reviewed together with an indication as to how interactions among inclusions may be taken into account. In the mean-field approximation, the effective Poisson ratio sigma(e) in composites with auxetic inclusions of various shapes such as discs, spheres, blades, needles, and disks is studied analytically and numerically. It is shown that phase properties such as inclusion volume or area fraction phi and matrix and inclusion Poisson ratios (sigma(m) and sigma) and Young's moduli (E-m and E) have a marked effect on sigma(e). The earlier theoretical findings of the existence of auxeticity windows and the widening effect of inclusion-inclusion interactions on the window for delta=E/E-m are reconfirmed for composites of auxetic spheres in both two and three dimensions, with new auxeticity windows discovered for the other inclusion shapes. For a composite with sigma= -0.8, sigma(m) = 0.25, and phi=0.4, it is found that the sphere is the most sigma(e)-lowering or negative-sigma(e)-producing inclusion shape for delta around 1/2, while disklike inclusions yield a most negative sigma(e) for delta greater than 1.

AB This paper details a new 2D auxetic honeycomb that was structured by mirroring the horizontal series-connected parallelograms along the vertical direction. A combination of analytical, numerical, and experimental methods was used to gain a deep understanding of the elastic behavior of the new honeycomb and examined its dependence on the geometric parameters. The results showed that the new honeycomb can achieve a negative Poisson's ratio via a novel mechanism. Furthermore, the newly developed 2D honeycomb was extended to three dimensions, and three kinds of 3D structures were conceived via different splicing methods. A preliminary numerical study was conducted to explore the mechanical properties of the 3D structures. An auxetic effect was found in two principal orthogonal coordinate directions of those 3D structures when they were compressed along the other principal axis. This work may provide a new insight into the design of both the 2D and 3D auxetics.

AB Auxetic foam was a new kind of material which exhibit negative Poisson's ratio effect. It has a wide application prospect. However, auxetic foam would gradually expand to its original volume with time increasing, and the negative Poisson's ratio effect will disappear. The practical use of the auxetic foam has been limited, and it becomes an urgent problem to be solved before its application. The preparation conditions and the recovery ability of auxetic foam, the 60 ppi open cell polyurethane (PU) foam was used as the parent material. The PU foams were compressed in three dimensions and been heat treated at setting temperatures. After cooling down, the auxetic foams were made. In this study, all samples were set with the same radial compression ratio, but three different axial compression ratios. During the heat treatment process, the setting temperatures were 140 degrees C, 150 degrees C and 160 degrees C respectively. It was found that the setting temperature in the condition of this study should be heated until 150 degrees C to obtain the re-entrant structure.

AB In this paper, an investigation on the low-velocity impact (LVI) response of a shear deformable beam laminated by carbon nanotube reinforced composite (CNTRC) layers is performed. The composite beam is "auxetic" due to the negative out-of-plane Poisson's ratio (NPR) through special symmetric stacking sequences of layers that are designed based on the Classical Laminate Theory. To study the effect of the out-of-plane NPR on the LVI response of the composite beam, a newly defined Hertz model is developed. The motion equations of Karman type for the CNTRC laminate beam are derived in the framework of the Reddy beam theory and solved by means of a two-step perturbation approach while the dynamic equation of the impactor is built on Newton's Law. Since temperature-dependent material properties of both carbon nanotube (CNT) and matrix are employed, the thermal influence on the LVI behavior is also investigated. Moreover, a piece-wise method is employed herein to investigate the effect of functionally graded (FG) patterns of the CNT reinforcements on the impact response. Numerical results elucidating the effects of temperature, FG distribution, and CNT volume fraction on the out-of-plane Poisson's ratio and impact response of the beam are obtained by using a Range-Kutta method and discussed in details.

AB We report that carbon honeycomb, a new three-dimension carbon allotrope, exhibits large negative Poisson's ratio, as large as -0.32, in tensile revealed via molecular dynamics simulations. The Poisson's ratio of carbon honeycomb is anisotropic, and sensitive to temperature. The carbon honeycomb has phase transformation from normal to auxetic by tensile, along both zigzag and armchair directions. The critical strain for the normal-auxetic transition along the cell-axis direction reduces with respect to an increase in temperature. Combined with high strength of 50 GPa, such a unique and adjustable negative Poisson ratio suggests broad engineering applications of carbon honeycomb.

AB Auxetic materials (or metamaterials) have negative Poisson ratios (NPR) and display the unexpected properties of lateral expansion when stretched, and equal and opposing densification when compressed. Such auxetic materials are being used more frequently in the development of novel products, especially in the fields of intelligent expandable actuators, shape-morphing structures and minimally invasive implantable devices. Although several micromanufacturing technologies have already been applied to the development of auxetic materials and devices, additional precision is needed to take full advantage of their special mechanical properties. In this study, we present a very promising approach for the development of auxetic materials and devices based on the use of deep reactive ion etching (DRIE). The process stands out for its precision and its potential applications to mass production. To our knowledge, it represents the first time this technology has been applied to the manufacture of auxetic materials with nanometric details. We take into account the present capabilities and challenges linked to the use of DRIE in the development of auxetic materials and auxetic-based devices.

AB Auxetic materials have negative Poisson's ratios and so expand rather than contract in one or several direction(s) perpendicular to applied extensions. The auxetics community has long sought synthetic molecular auxetics - non-porous, inherently auxetic materials which are simple to fabricate and avoid porosity-related weakening. Here, we report, synthetic molecular auxeticity for a non-porous liquid crystal elastomer. For strains above similar to 0.8 applied perpendicular to the liquid crystal director, the liquid crystal elastomer becomes auxetic with the maximum negative Poisson's ratio measured to date being -0.74 +/- 0.03 - larger than most values seen in naturally occurring molecular auxetics. The emergence of auxeticity coincides with the liquid crystal elastomer backbone adopting a negative order parameter, Q(B) = -0.41 +/- 0.01 - further implying negative liquid crystal ordering. The reported behaviours consistently agree with theoretical predictions from Warner and Terentjev liquid crystal elastomer theory. Our results open the door for the design of synthetic molecular auxetics.

AB Mechanical metamaterials are man-made structures with counterintuitive mechanical properties that originate in the geometry of their unit cell instead of the properties of each component. The typical mechanical metamaterials are generally associated with the four elastic constants, the Young's modulus E, shear modulus G, bulk modulus K and Poisson's ratio v, the former three of which correspond to the stiffness, rigidity, and compressibility of a material from an engineering point of view. Here we review the important advancements in structural topology optimisation of the underlying design principles, coupled with experimental fabrication, thereby to obtain various counterintuitive mechanical properties. Further, a clear classification of mechanical metamaterials have been established based on the fundamental material mechanics. Consequently, mechanical metamaterials can be divide into strong-lightweight (E/rho), pattern transformation with tunable stiffness, negative compressibility (-4G/3 < K < 0), Pentamode metamaterials (G << K) and auxetic metamaterials (G >> K), simultaneously using topology optimisation to share various fancy but feasible mechanical properties, ultralight, ultra-stiffness, well-controllable stiffness, vanishing shear modulus, negative compressibility and negative Poisson's ratio. We provide here a broad overview of significant potential mechanical metamaterials together with the upcoming challenges in the intriguing and promising research field. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The lattices exhibit geometry-dependent Poisson's ratio that can be tuned to negative values. Poisson's ratio decreases from positive to negative values as the number of cells increases. Isotropy is obtained by adjustment of aspect ratio. The lattices exhibit significant size effects. Such a phenomenon cannot occur in a classical elastic continuum but it can occur in a Cosserat solid. (C) 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

TI Negative poisson's ratio in single-layer black phosphorus
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
LA English
DT Article
ID AUXETIC MATERIALS; GRAPHENE
AB The Poisson's ratio is a fundamental mechanical property that relates the resulting lateral strain to applied axial strain. Although this value can theoretically be negative, it is positive for nearly all materials, though negative values have been observed in so-called auxetic structures. However, nearly all auxetic materials are bulk materials whose microstructure has been specifically engineered to generate a negative Poisson's ratio. Here we report using first-principles calculations the existence of a negative Poisson's ratio in a single-layer, two-dimensional material, black phosphorus. In contrast to engineered bulk auxetics, this behaviour is intrinsic for single-layer black phosphorus, and originates from its puckered structure, where the pucker can be regarded as a re-entrant structure that is comprised of two coupled orthogonal hinges. As a result of this atomic structure, a negative Poisson's ratio is observed in the out-of-plane direction under uniaxial deformation in the direction parallel to the pucker.

AB This work discusses the concept of allowing the control of the stiffness of a particular class of re-entrant auxetic magneto-mechanical metamaterials through the introduction of magnets to the system. It is shown, through experimental testing backed up by a theoretical model, that the appropriate insertion of magnets in such a system will alter its stiffness, possibly even making it exhibit 'negative stiffness'. This leads to a completely different behaviour of the structure in terms of stability. It is also reported that the investigated mechanical metamaterials may exhibit both negative stiffness and negative Poisson's ratio at the same time. Moreover, it is shown that the effect which magnets have on the stiffness of the system may be fine-tuned upon replacing magnets with electromagnets. Such systems have the potential to be used in a wide range of practical applications such as vibration damping devices where achieving a negative stiffness is of fundamental importance.

AB Chiral cellular structures inspired by the microstructure of biomaterials can display auxetic performances, such as negative Poisson's ratio (NPR), negative stiffness, energy dissipation, and acoustic absorption. In this study, novel chiral-type cylindrical shells were designed and fabricated via 3D printing method. Theoretical analysis, finite element analysis, and experiments were conducted to investigate the mechanical properties and deformation characteristics of cylindrical shell with various categories of chiral-type cells. Results revealed that the anti-chiral shell and chiral-axial shell can achieve auxetic behavior, namely, NPR behavior and compressive-twist response, which are beneficial for energy absorption and vibration isolation performance. Given the distinction in the geometrical configuration of unit cell, the cylindrical shells exhibited extremely diverse mechanical properties. The analytical formulae of axial compressive modulus were deduced based on Euler-Bernoulli beam theory, and the applicability and accuracy were verified. The new mechanical metastructures offer potential applications as smart actuators, biomechanical devices, and sensors in various industries. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Closed-form expressions for the nine effective elastic constants of a binary fiber-reinforced composite with transversely isotropic constituents with positive (conventional) and negative (auxetic) Poisson's ratio are considered. Such formulae were obtained by means of the asymptotic homogenization method and were verified numerically with an independent finite element model. The overall properties display explicit dependence on (i) the properties of the constituents, (ii) the volume fraction or radius of inclusion and (iii) the array periodicity. They are finally obtained by solving a normal infinite symmetric linear system of algebraic equations by truncation to a relatively small order term. This allows a fast solution and low computation cost. The overall orthotropy of the elastic properties is obtained by varying the distance between the fibers in two of the principal directions leading to different spacial aspect ratio for fiber distribution. In addition to this, an analytical relation between the effective properties based on the symmetry of the stiffness tensor is introduced. With the previous elements, we present reliable predictions for auxetic and conventional composites of this kind wherein a significant enhancement in Young's modulus is found in a composite with an auxetic matrix reinforced by conventional fibres. Finally, we compute auxeticity windows (i.e., intervals of volume fraction where the composite is auxetic) when the fibres are auxetic. It is reported that spacial fiber aspect ratio plays a key role in the composite auxetic behavior. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Intrinsic Negative Poisson's Ratio for Single-Layer Graphene
SO NANO LETTERS

DT Article
DE Graphene; intrinsic negative Poisson's ratio
ID DEPENDENT ELASTIC PROPERTIES; NANOTUBES; RANGE
AB Negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) materials have drawn significant interest because the enhanced toughness, shear resistance, and vibration absorption that typically are seen in auxetic materials may enable a range of novel applications. In this work, we report that single-layer graphene exhibits an intrinsic NPR, which is robust and independent of its size and temperature. The NPR arises due to the interplay between two intrinsic deformation pathways (one with positive Poisson's ratio, the other with NPR), which correspond to the bond stretching and angle bending interactions in graphene. We propose an energy-based deformation pathway criteria, which predicts that the pathway with NPR has lower energy and thus becomes the dominant deformation mode when graphene is stretched by a strain above 6%, resulting in the NPR phenomenon.

AB In this work, we used molecular dynamics simulations to study the effect of vacancy defects and impurity defects on the tensile properties of monolayer borophene under uniaxial tension. The effects of the number of point defects and defect angle on the fracture behavior and the tensile properties were investigated under different tensile strains along the zigzag direction and armchair direction. Furthermore, the impact of temperature on their mechanical properties has been analyzed and discussed. We find that borophene has anisotropic properties, Young's modulus of the borophene nanosheet at 1 K is 165.03 Nm(-1) in the zigzag direction and 390.02 Nm(-1) in the armchair direction. The borophene has a negative Poisson's ratio in the direction perpendicular to the atomic plane. The mechanical strength and the ultimate strain of borophene decrease as increasing the temperature. Moreover, the stress concentration around the vacancy defect leads to the initial crack formed at the vacancy position and the reduction of the fracture strength. If increasing the dimension of the vacancies projected onto the direction, which is perpendicular to the tensile direction, the fracture strength, fracture strain, and Young's modulus will decrease. Besides, the mechanical strength of borophene is reduced by the substitutional C atoms defects. With the angle defect of theta = 60 degrees the fracture of nanosheet which has C impurity defects easier occurs than the angle defect of theta = 0 degrees in both zigzag and armchair tensile directions.

AB Ternary Zr-TM-Al (TM: Cu, Ni or Cc) bulk glassy alloys were fabricated to clarify the relations between the thermal and mechanical features. These alloy systems show the distinct ternary eutectic point, and a bulk glassy phase also forms around the ternary eutectic composition. We determine the 12 standard Zr-TM-Al bulk glassy alloys in this study. In the twelve standard Zr-TM-Al bulk glassy alloys, the glass-transition temperature has large positive correlation coefficient with Young's modulus and Vickers hardness. The melting temperature has large negative correlation coefficient with Charpy impact value, fracture strain and volume change due to structural relaxation. Furthermore, in order to recognize the origin of ductility. Poisson's ratio (metallic bond nature) and volume change (free volume) were also examined.

AB How can we modulate the inherent Poisson's ratio value of soft elastomeric materials? The theoretical limit value of the Poisson's ratio of isotropic materials can be defined from -1 to 0.5 but elastomers generally take the Poisson's ratio of 0.5. Herein, we introduce and establish the concept of a mechanical meta elastomer called "auxetic elastomer". This is a continuum-solid elastomer having unique programmable elastic properties of Poisson's ratio that are beyond their conventional ranges, and include in-plane negative and out-of-plane high positive Poisson's ratios. Leveraging these unique deformation characteristics, we applied auxetic elastomers as a soft dielectric material for a highly stretchable capacitive-type strain sensor that overcomes the inherent performance limitations in terms of the low gauge factor.

Such extreme values may be coupled with a choice of other mechanical properties, e.g., Youngs modulus or breaking strength or toughness. In this paper, we demonstrate how to obtain negative values of the expansivity. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Three-dimensional carbon diamond-like phases consisting of sp (3)-hybridized atoms, obtained by linking of carcasses of fullerene-like molecules, are studied by methods of molecular dynamics modeling. For eight cubic and one hexagonal diamond-like phases on the basis of four types of fullerene-like molecules, equilibrium configurations are found and the elastic constants are calculated. The results obtained by the method of molecular dynamics are used for analytical calculations of the elastic characteristics of the diamond- like phases with the cubic and hexagonal anisotropy. It is found that, for a certain choice of the dilatation axis, three of these phases have negative Poisson's ratio, i.e., are partial auxetics. The variability of the engineering elasticity coefficients (Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, shear modulus, and bulk modulus) is analyzed.

AB Negative Poisson's ratio materials, or auxetics, have drawn attention for the past 30 years. The auxetic effect could lead to improved mechanical properties such as acoustic damping, indentation resistance, or crashworthiness. In this work, two 3D auxetic lattices are introduced. Auxeticity is achieved by design through pre-buckling of the lattice struts. The influence of geometrical parameters on the effective elastic properties is investigated using computational homogenization method with periodic boundary conditions. Effective Young's modulus is 3D mapped to reveal anisotropy and identify spatial orientations of interest. The effective Poisson ratio is computed for various geometric configurations to characterize auxeticity. Finally, the influence of effective elastic properties on energy dissipation under compression is explored for elastoplastic lattices with different loading directions, using finite element simulations. Results suggest that loading 3D auxetic lattices along their stiffest direction maximizes their crashworthiness.

AB Material properties can be tailored through modification of their geometry or architecture. With this concept, a lot of smart materials, metamaterials, and smart structures have been developed. Auxetic materials and structures are a novel class of materials which exhibit an interesting property of negative Poisson's ratio. By virtue of the auxetic behavior, mechanical properties such as fracture toughness, indentation resistance, etc., can be improved. In order to exploit the interesting properties of auxetic materials, several potential applications of auxetic materials have been explored in medical, sports, automobile, defense, etc. Design and modeling of novel auxetic materials and structures is still on the way. Here, the article focuses upon the different aspects of auxetic materials and structures. A comprehensive updated review of auxetic materials, their types and properties, and applications has been presented. This paper also discusses the design and modeling approaches of auxetic structures.

ID DESIGN
AB A two-dimensional auxetic lattice structure was fabricated from a PZT piezoceramic. Tape casted and sintered sheets with a thickness of 530 mu m were laser cut into inverted honeycomb lattice structure with re-entrant cell geometry (theta = -25 degrees) and poling direction oriented perpendicular to the lattice plane. The in-plane strain response upon applying an uniaxial compression load as well as an electric field perpendicular to the lattice plane were analyzed by a 2D image data detection analysis. The auxetic lattice structure exhibits orthotropic deformation behavior with a negative in-plane Poisson's ratio of -2.05. Compared to PZT bulk material the piezoelectric auxetic lattice revealed a strain amplification by a factor of 30-70. Effective transversal coupling coefficients d(31)(al) of the PZT lattice exceeding 4 x 10(3) pm V-1 were determined which result in an effective hydrostatic coefficient d(h)(al) 66 times larger than that of bulk PZT.

AB Auxetic materials, a class of metamaterials with negative Poisson's ratio, have been extensively studied due to their attractive mechanical properties. In this study, an auxetic material was developed using new perforation shapes with stiffeners. Standard elliptical perforations were stiffened and analyzed by the finite-element method. Periodic boundary conditions were applied to the unit cell of the new shapes and their effective Poisson's ratio and Young's modulus were calculated. The finite-element analysis found that the proposed stiffened perforated sheets exhibited auxetic behavior and had enhanced stiffness compared with standard elliptically perforated sheets.

AB Auxetic cellular materials are modern materials which have some unique and superior mechanical properties. As a consequence of the structural deformation of their internal cellular structure they exhibit a negative Poisson's ratio, i.e. they significantly increase in volume when stretched and vice versa. The effect of negative Poisson's ratio is useful in many applications to enhance certain physical properties such as the density, stiffness, fracture toughness, energy absorption and damping. These properties can be further tailored by using variable cell geometry and density distribution, which can be achieved with functionally graded porosity of auxetic materials. This review paper provides the state-of-the-art overview of the auxetic materials, their development, most common geometries, fabrication methods, mechanical properties, applications and further possibilities for their development.

AB Dynamic simulations under stress were carried out on a series of main-chain polymers containing two types of mesogen. One mesogen is orientated in-line with the chain (end-to-end) and the second ( swivelling) has the main chain passing at right angles through it. Under strain the swivelling mesogens are expected to rotate, pushing apart the neighbouring chains. Polymers incorporating 50% of both mesogens showed a reduced Poisson's ratio. In particular, swivelling mesogens of seven rings length produced a negative Poisson's ratio, and thus should be auxetic. In contrast, polymers containing only end-to-end mesogens had relatively high Poisson's ratios of 0.53-0.59.

AB Analytical and Molecular Mechanics methods have been used to study the deformation mechanisms acting at the molecular level in the auxetic polymorph of crystalline silica (alpha-cristobalite). The analytical models indicate that alpha-cristobalite deforms by concurrent tetrahedral dilation and cooperative rotation when stretched along the x(3) axis, and that a second phase is predicted to exist for this loading scenario, having a geometry similar to that of 'idealised' beta-cristobalite. This is supported by preliminary Molecular Mechanics simulations, which also indicate that the cooperative rotation predicted for loading along x(3) is not sufficient to describe the deformation mechanism for loading along x(1). A negative hydrostatic pressure offset is observed to lead to a change in the sign of the predicted Poisson's ratio from positive to negative, leading to improved agreement of the Molecular Mechanics model with experiment.

AB Previously, auxetic materials were realized by designing building blocks with specific geometries or tuning topology of spring networks. Here, we propose a new approach by properly manipulating the disorder, especially the bond stiffness disorder, of an unstressed spring network. When randomly distorting a spring network initially with a close-packed lattice structure, we find that the resultant unstressed network becomes auxetic. Resulted from the distortion, longer bonds are likely to contribute more to the shear modulus but less to the bulk modulus. Inspired by this correlation, we realize isotropic auxeticity in the unstressed triangular lattice, by distributing each bond a spring constant according to a virtual lattice distortion. In the perspective of previous approaches, however, it is not straightforward to figure out how the close-packed lattices can be turned into auxetic independent of directions. The key of our approach is the correlated disorder induced by the (virtual) lattice distortion, which leads to a sufficiently large nonaffine contribution responsible to the auxeticity.

AB Elastic instability of soft cellular solids plays an increasingly important role in the creation of metamaterials with smart properties. Inspiration for much of this research comes from a planar metamaterial with negative Poisson's ratio behavior induced by elastic instability. Here we extend the concept of buckling induced pattern switch further to the design of a new series of three-dimensional metamaterials with negative Poisson's ratio over a large strain range. The highlight of this work is that our designs are based on very simple initial geometric shapes.

AB Auxetic materials and structures exhibit the unexpected behaviour of getting wider when stretched and thinner when compressed. This behaviour requires the structures ( the internal structure in the case of materials) to have geometric features, which must deform in a way that results in the structure expanding when stretched. This paper assesses the potential for auxetic behaviour of a novel class of two-dimensional periodic structures which can be described as "connected stars" as they contain star-shaped units of different rotational symmetry which are connected together to form two-dimensional periodic structures. These structures will be studied through a technique based on force-field based methods ( the EMUDA technique) and it will be shown that some, but not all, of these structures can exhibit auxetic behaviour. An attempt is made to explain the reasons for the presence or absence of a negative Poisson's ratio in these systems.

ID NEGATIVE POISSONS RATIOS
AB Three new kinds of molecular networks are designed and predicted to exhibit negative Poisson ratios. Molecular mechanics calculations on these networks show that the magnitude of Poisson ratios depends on the relative flexibility of beam and arm structures. Several new kinds of auxetic polymers, whose successful synthesis should be easier than that of the corresponding auxetic networks, are then proposed. It is found that the kabob-like polymers with auxegens lying vertically on the main chain can acquire auxeticity while those with auxegens lying horizontally on the main chain cannot. Besides, a half kabob-like or pseudo-ladder polymer with auxegens linked at the intersection of the beam and the arm does show auxeticity when adopting constrictive conformers. It is, however, worthwhile noting that the origins of auxeticity still await and strongly deserve further experimental and theoretical investigations.

AB Auxetic behavior (negative values of Poisson's ratio) in some cubic metals for a stretch along a cube-face diagonal was investigated in detail by R. H. Baughman et al., F. Milstein, K. Huang, M. Jain, M. P. Verma. Directions with extreme values of Poisson's ratio in crystals for a stretch along a cube-face diagonal and corresponding lateral strain along the orthogonal cube-face diagonal and cube-axis were considered by the authors. In this paper the stereographic projections of Poisson's ratio for a set of natural crystals with cubic, hexagonal and monoclinic symmetry were computed. From these stereographic projections the Poisson's ratio for any possible directions of stretch and lateral strain in the crystal were calculated and orientations of stretch and lateral strain with extreme values of Poisson's ratio were obtained. Crystals with auxetic behavior were revealed. Orientations of stretch directions and lateral strain directions with negative values of Poisson's ratio were determined. By analysis of the above results cuts with optimal negative values of Poisson's ratio were revealed in zinc, molybdenum sulfide, carbon, graphite, polypropylene, monoclinic natural minerals labradorite and augite, a complex silicate and in a set of cubic alloys. The exotic behavior of change of cross-section of a cylindrical rod during stretching along the rod axis was revealed in the naturally-occurring mineral SiO2, cristobalite - an example of a molecular auxetic. The elastic constants of crystals from the manual of Landolt-Bornstein were used in the calculations. (c) 2005 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH A Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

The effects of the cell geometry and relative density over the global stiffness, equivalent in-plane Poisson's ratios and shear modulus of the Voronoi-type structure are evaluated with a parametric analysis. Empirical formulas are identified to reproduce the mechanical trends of the equivalent homogeneous orthotropic material representing the Voronoi-type structure and its geometry parameters.

AB To improve the resistance to vibration and reduce its structure mass, the structural dynamic properties of hexachiral structure with negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) are investigated. The optimization function of natural frequencies parameters is established, in which the thickness of circular nodes wall and ligaments of the hexachiral structure are defined as design variable. By normalizing the weight coefficients corresponding to the natural frequencies of different orders, the multi-objective optimization problem is converted into a single objective structural optimization problem. Finally, the cell of hexachiral structure for example, by introducing the response surfaces method, the structural optimization is carried out. The numerical analysis shows that the natural frequency is greatly increased, and the vibration resistance is strengthened. The results provide technical support for the design and application of high performance materials.

AB This paper proposes a three-dimensional (3D) lattice meta-material made by extending the existing two-dimensional enhanced auxetic model to a 3D one. With narrow ribs embedded into every cell of the typical 3D re-entrant honeycomb (TRH), the new structure can also be considered as an enhanced design of the TRH. A combination of theoretical and numerical analysis is carried out to gain a deeper understanding of the elastic behavior of the new 3D structure and its dependence on the geometric parameters. The new structure is proved analytically and numerically to exhibit a negative Poisson's ratio, while its Young's modulus is significantly improved compared to that of the TRH. It is remarkable that the Young's modulus of the new structure increases linearly with the relative density while an approximate square relation is found between that of the THR and the relative density, which reveals that the dominated deformation model of the micro-structures has been changed by the embedded ribs from bending to stretching. The present layout may be promising for some special applications due to its superior performance and may provide a new concept for the optimization design of 3D auxetic materials, whose stiffness is relatively low.

AB We investigate auxetic isotropic elastic materials with the Poisson's ratio of exactly -1 and isotropic materials with the Poisson's ratio of near 0.5 (incompressible). In both cases the energy is not positive definite, which can lead to the material instability. In incompressible materials, the instability manifests itself in the emergence of non-uniform displacement distribution. Investigation of the behavior of such materials with respect to damage or crack accumulation is based on the notion that during the instantaneous process of fracture formation, the fracture acts as a negative stiffness element; after the fracture is formed, it immediately turns into a conventional fracture with usual positive stiffness. We demonstrate that the cracks formed due to tensile or combined tensile and shear fracturing of the material are capable of momentarily bringing the Poisson's ratio of nearly incompressible material to 0.5, which instantaneously turns the material into unstable. On the other hand, the formation of shear cracks leads to reduction in the Poisson's ratio bringing the material away from the point of instability. Opposite to this, cracks of all kinds do not change the Poisson's ratio in extreme auxetics (the Poisson's ratio equal to -1). Thus the auxetic materials remain stable with respect to fracture formation.

AB It is known that metamaterials with negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) can be designed to possess negative thermal expansion (NTE) property. However, it is uncommon to use NTE structures to obtain NPR behavior. In this paper, based on a typical NTE unit structure, two novel meta-structures with auxetic behavior are proposed, which are demonstrated by the micro-scale mechanical experiments and numerical simulations. By changing the angle of the structure, the Poisson's ratio of the structures could be positive, zero and negative. The extreme negative Poisson's ratio of the structures is about -0.94. Moreover, the thermal expansion of the novel 2D structures can also be designed and modulated to be positive, zero and negative. This concept of building 2D metamaterials with NPR in this study would open up new avenues to understand and design metamaterials with NPR and NTE for potential engineering applications, such as smart sensors and electronic components.

AB Specifications and moment properties of the univariate Poisson and negative binomial distributions me briefly reviewed and illustrated. properties and limitations of the corresponding Poisson and negative binomial (gamma mixtures of Poissons) regression models are described it is shown how a misspecification of the mixing distribution of a mixed Poisson model to accommodate hidden heterogeneity ascribable to unobserved variables-although not affecting the consistency of maximum likelihood estimators of the Poisson mean rate parameter or its regression parameterization-can lead to inflated t ratios of regression coefficients and associated incorrect inferences. Then the recently developed semiparametric maximum likelihood estimator for regression models composed of arbitrary mixtures of Poisson processes is specified and further developed It is concluded that the semiparametric mixed Poisson regression model adds considerable flexibility to Poisson-family regression models and provides opportunities for interpretation of empirical patterns not available in the conventional approaches.

AB This paper investigates the longitudinal wave velocity in auxetic plates in comparison to conventional ones, in which the plate is constrained from motion in the width direction. By taking into account the thickness change of the plate and its corresponding change in density, the developed wave velocity is casted not only as a function of Young's modulus and density, but also in terms of Poisson's ratio and longitudinal strain. Results show that density and thickness variations compensate for one another when the Poisson's ratio is positive, but add up when the Poisson's ratio is negative. Results also reveal that the classical model of longitudinal wave velocity for the plate is accurate when the Poisson's ratio is about 1/3; at this Poisson's ratio the influence from density and thickness variations cancel each other. Comparison between the current corrected model and the density-corrected Rayleigh-Lamb model reveals a number of consistent trends, while the discrepancies are elucidated. If the plate material possesses a negative Poisson's ratio, the deviation of the actual wave velocity from the classical model becomes significant; auxeticity suppresses and enhances the wave velocity in compressive and tensile impacts, respectively. Hence the use of the corrected model is proposed when predicting longitudinal waves in width-constrained auxetic plates, and auxetic materials can be harnessed for effectively controlling wave velocities in thin-walled structures.

AB This paper presented a detailed study of the negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) effect on shrinkage deformation and crushing stress of metallic auxetic reentrant honeycomb under low, medium and high-velocity compressions. Instead of the traditional calculating method for the crushing stress of auxetic honeycomb, the new theoretical formula considering the NPR effect was proposed. The theoretical and finite element (FE) results showed that the crushing stress of reentrant honeycomb had been underestimated according to the traditional nominal stress strain curve. Not only had that, but also the theoretical results showed that the NPR effect could enhance the inertial effect during dynamic compression. Subsequently, under the medium and high-velocity compressions, the dynamic deformations of reentrant honeycomb were obviously different from that under low-velocity compression and those of metallic cellular materials with positive Poisson's ratio (such as Al foam and traditional hexagonal honeycomb) under medium or high-velocity compressions. In view of these differences, a new shrinkage deformation mechanism of reentrant honeycomb was proposed and a characterization parameter in contrast to the Poisson's ratio was presented to describe its dynamic shrinkage deformation capacity.

AB A computational finite element analysis based on a structural molecular mechanics approach was conducted to predict effective mechanical stiffness properties of a novel 3D carbon structure, pillared graphene structure (PGS), which is constituted with several graphene sheets and single-walled carbon nanotubes. Four sets of representative unitcell models were developed atomistically for predicting the mechanical properties of PGSs having different values of pillar length and inter-pillar distance. We introduced proper selections of the periodic geometry and boundary conditions which enabled our unitcell model to yield consistent results on the property prediction without any size or edge effects. The parametric study shows that the pillar length and inter-pillar distance significantly affect the effective in-plane and through-thickness properties. PGSs with shorter pillars in height yield higher planar Young's and shear moduli, while those with smaller interpillar distance yield higher through-thickness moduli. Negative in-plane Poisson's ratios are observed for all sets of PGSs and are associated with the curvature at the junction. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Auxetic cellular solids in the forms of honeycombs under blast load have great potential in a diverse range of applications, including core material in sandwich plates composite components. Based on Reddy's first-order shear deformation plate theory, this paper presents an analysis of the nonlinear dynamic response and vibration of sandwich plates with negative Poisson's ratio in auxetic honeycombes on elastic foundations subjected to blast and mechanical loads. A three-layer sandwich plate is considered discretized in the thickness direction by using analytical methods (stress function method, approximate solution), Galerkin method, and fourth-order Runge-Kutta method. The results show the effects of geometrical parameters, material properties, mechanical and elastic foundations on the nonlinear dynamic response, and vibration of sandwich plates.

AB Materials with an isotropic negative coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of the order of -10(-3) K-1 are rare, and almost all of them are porous. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we show that graphene origami structures obtained by pattern-based hydrogenation can exhibit a negative CTE. The magnitude and anisotropy of the CTE can be controlled by parameters of the pattern-based hydrogenation that determine the stiffness and Poisson ratio, respectively. We achieve an isotropic CTE of -20.7 x 10(-3) K-1, which is an enhancement by three orders of magnitude as compared to reports for other graphene-based structures and comes close to the record of all known materials.

AB Various carbon nanostructures and their properties are of great interest nowadays. It is well known that graphene has unique mechanical properties among other carbon nanomaterials and at some conditions graphene can show auxetic behavior which means that it can have negative Poisson's ratio. From the consideration of the mechanical properties of graphene and 3D carbon-based nanomaterials, several groups of promising candidates to be auxetics can be mentioned. In this study, mechanical properties of strained graphene and different diamond-like three-dimensional structures based on carbon nanotubes (tubulanes) are investigated by molecular dynamics method. It is shown that graphene has negative Poisson's ratio under homogeneous tensile strain above 0.12. It is found that three of the studied tubulanes have negative Poisson's ratio.

AB Application of auxetic materials in automobile and biomedical engineering is widely reported and their usage in civil engineering is emerging. This paper reports the manufacturing and characterising of cementitious polymer mortar auxetic foam composites suitable for wall rendering. The deformation behaviour of the composites with the high negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) auxetic foam embedded in polymer cement mortar matrix has been experimentally evaluated and compared to the commonly used mortar composites containing fiberglass mesh layers (that exhibits positive Poisson's ratio). It is shown that the auxetic embedded polymer cement composite outperformed other composites through elimination of delamination and minimisation of brittleness. The auxetic foams used in this research were manufactured from the inexpensive open cell polyurethane foam through a thermo-mechanical process and characterised through lab tests; the maximum Poisson's ratio determined was 1.5. Sixty composite specimens tested under axial compression exhibited a maximum NPR of 0.11. The results were validated numerically. The numerical model was then used to examine the effectiveness of the relative thickness of the auxetic foam layers and the polymer cement matrix for maximising the NPR of the composites. The results show that through auxetic material embedment, delamination and brittleness suffered by the cementitious composites could be eliminated. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB For homogeneous cubic elastic materials with positive definite stored energy it is shown that the maximum and minimum values of Young's modules E are related to the maximum and minimum values of the shear modulus G through the simple connection
   1/G(min) - 1/G(max) = 3(1/E-min - 1/E-max).
   It is deduced that the ration of compliances -s(12)/s(44) is the maximum value of Poisson's ratio v in the cubic materials with a positive parameter chi equivalent to 2s(11) - 2s(12) - s(44), and the minimum value of v in the cubic materials with negative chi.

AB In this study, the responsive-behavior of auxetic and non-auxetic polymer gels to mechanical loads is modeled. The elastic deformation patterns of gels with different structural and mechanical properties are depicted. The first strain gradient theory is employed to model the random structure of crosslinked polymer gels. The applicability of the first strain gradient theory to model the mechanics of polymer gels is demonstrated. The equations governing the elastostatic equilibrium of polymer gels under finite strain gradient and infinitesimal strain gradient regimes are derived depending on the strain and its first-order gradient. An analytical solution for the plane strain deformation is derived. This solution is harnessed to investigate effects of Poisson's ratio and the strain gradient on the plane strain deformation of auxetic and non-auxetic polymer gels. The results revealed that Poisson's ratio and the micro-strain field significantly influence the elastic extensibility and elastic compressibility of polymer gels. Depending on its Poisson's ratio and the nature of its microstructure, a polymer gel may exhibit homogeneous/inhomogeneous deformation, and its rigidity may be enhanced/degraded.

AB The elastic properties of two artificial arterial prostheses have been measured. One is a fibrillar polyurethane (PU) material, the other is an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ex-PTFE). It is shown that the conventional assumption of incompressibility is invalid for both materials and that changes in the thickness of the prosthetic artery wail must be measured directly. The ex-PTFE shows highly strain-dependent properties, the most significant being that of large negative through-thickness Poisson ratios, up to -11. These results have important consequences for matching the properties of prostheses to natural materials.

AB Poisson's ratio for isotropic elastic materials is bounded between -1 and 1/2. It is shown that Poisson's ratio for anisotropic elastic materials can have an arbitrarily large positive or negative value under the prerequisite of positive definiteness of strain energy density. The large Poisson's ratio for cubic materials is physically realistic because the strains are bounded.

ID CELLULAR MATERIALS
AB Auxetic (negative Poisson's ratio) cellular materials expand in all direction when pulled in only one, thus behaving in an unusual manner compared to "classical" materials. Negative Poisson's ratio honeycombs and open cell foams have shown increased shear modulus, indentation resistance and low cut-off frequency acoustic properties. In this paper FEM microstructure models are used to compute the static and viscoelastic properties of closed-cell and two-phase foam composites. The complex modulus of the materials is calculated making use of the correspondence principal and evaluating the strain energy distributions for the different phases. The results are compared to the ones given by models representing a global in-plane uniaxial loading. The static and storage modulus values of two-phase composite foam are significantly enhanced by the presence of a re-entrant (auxetic) skeleton layout. The loss factor shows also a significant sensitivity on the volume fraction and strain energy distribution on the microstructure unit cells. Static and free-vibration simulations on sandwich beams with different core cellular materials show that it is possible to obtain both enhanced stiffness per unit weight values and modal loss factors using two-phase cellular solids with a re-entrant skeleton.

AB Single crystal specimens of Fe-17 at. % Ga were tested in tension at room temperature. Specimens with a tensile axis orientation of [110] displayed slip lines on the specimen faces corresponding to slip on the {110}<111> with a critical resolved shear stress tau(CRSS) = 220 MPa. Yielding began at 0.3% elongation and 450 MPa. An ultimate tensile strength of 580 MPa was observed with no fracture occurring through 1.6% elongation. The Young's modulus was 160 GPa in the loading direction with a Poisson's ratio of -0.37 on the (100) major face. A specimen with a tensile axis orientation of [100] showed slip lines corresponding to slip on the {211}<111>with tau(CRSS) = 240 MPa. Discontinuous yielding began at 0.8% elongation, which was thought to result from twinning, kink band formation, or stress-induced transformation. The Young's modulus was 65 GPa in the loading direction with a Poisson's ratio of 0.45 on the (001) major face. A maximum tensile strength of 515 MPa was observed with fracture occurring after 2% elongation. A sizeable elastic anisotropy of 19.9 was identified for Fe-27.2 at. % Ga accompanied by a Poisson's ratio of -0.75 to produce a large in-plane auxetic behavior.

AB Auxetic materials with negative Poisson's ratio have potential applications across a broad range of engineering fields. Several FE based design techniques have been developed to achieve auxetic materials with targeted effective properties, mostly in linear deformation regime. In this paper, an isogeometric shape optimization framework for designing 2D auxetic materials with prescribed deformation over large strain intervals is presented Taking into account practical manufacturing considerations, a minimum thickness for each member is imposed via a spline-based geometric constraint. The capability of the framework is demonstrated through two examples. First, the paper considers shape optimization of smoothed hexa-petals in plane strain condition to achieve constant Poisson's ratios ranging from a null value to -0.5 to an effective tensile strain of 50%. The second example showcases the shape optimization of smoothed tri- and hexa-petals in plane stress condition for targeted nonlinear deformation behaviour of cat's skin up to 90% tensile strain.

AB Auxetic materials exhibit the unusual property of becoming fatter when uniaxially stretched and thinner when uniaxially compressed (i.e. they exhibit a negative Poisson ratio; NPR), a property that may result in various enhanced properties. The NPR is the result of the manner in which particular geometric features in the micro- or nanostructure of the materials deform when they are subjected to uniaxial loads. Here, we propose and discuss a new model made from different-sized rigid rectangles, which rotate relative to each other. This new model has the advantage over existing models that it can be used to describe the properties of very different systems ranging from silicates and zeolites to liquid-crystalline polymers. We show that such systems can exhibit scale-independent auxetic behaviour for stretching in particular directions, with Poisson's ratios being dependent on the shape and relative size of different rectangles in the model and the angle between them.

AB Two-dimensional (2-D) micro-architectured mechanical metamaterials are designed using a topology optimization approach that integrates a parametric level set method (PLSM) with a meshfree method based on compactly supported radial basis functions (CS-RBF). The PLSM is employed as the optimization algorithm to achieve desired microstructures with targeted material properties. The effective elastic properties, including the bulk modulus, shear modulus and Poisson's ratio, are predicted using a strain energy-based homogenization method and the CS-RBF meshfree algorithm. Two sets of optimizations are implemented: one is for the case of a single solid material, and the other is for the case of two solid materials, each involving an additional void phase. Three numerical examples are provided for each case with the same optimization objectives: maximizing the effective bulk modulus, maximizing the effective shear modulus, and minimizing the effective Poisson's ratio under given volume fraction constraints. The numerical results reveal that the newly proposed approach can generate smooth topological boundaries and optimal microstructures. In particular, the current method can topologically optimize auxetic metamaterials with a negative Poisson's ratio. It can also be extended to design other periodic metamaterials, including those with a negative coefficient of thermal expansion or frequency bandgaps.

AB A surface wave of frequency lying within bulk band of transverse waves is found in an elastic medium coated with a thin layer endowed with a surface mass density, surface Young's modulus and surface bending modulus. The wave is a particular case of surface resonance with infinite lifetime. In materials with negative Poisson's ratio (auxetics) the wave exists even for coating material with zero bending modulus, whereas with positive Poisson's ratio it requires the surface bending modulus to be larger than the surface Young's modulus. The manifestation of this wave in the reflection coefficient seems promising for fabrication of devices showing monochromator properties.

AB We develop mechanical and numerical homogenization models for the large strains response of auxetic structures in order to derive their effective elastic response accounting for large changes of the geometry. We construct a strain driven nonlinear scheme for the computation of the stress-strain relation of these repetitive networks over a reference representative unit cell (abbreviated as RUC). Homogenization schemes are developed to evaluate the effective nonlinear mechanical response of periodic networks prone to an auxetic behavior, in both planar and 3D configurations, which are substituted by an effective micropolar continuum at the intermediate mesoscopic level. The couple stress part of the homogenized constitutive law takes into account the impact of the local rotations at the mesoscopic level and allows computing the bending response. This methodology is applied to four planar auxetic periodic lattices (the re-entrant hexagonal honeycomb and alternative honeycomb topologies, including the arrowhead, Milton and hexachiral structures), and to the 3D re-entrant and pyramid-shaped lattices. We have considering successively the in-plane and out-of-plane responses of these structures. The transition to an auxetic behavior is shown to be triggered by the imposed strain over the unit cell boundary. The computed evolutions of Poisson's ratio versus the imposed stretch traduce an enhanced auxetic response as the stretch is increased. A satisfactory agreement is obtained between the homogenized stress strain responses and the responses computed numerically by finite element simulations performed over a repeating unit cell.

AB It is confirmed, by considering a wide range of laminated composites containing a variety of fibres and matrices, that negative thermal expansion coefficients may be obtained. These are usually accompanied by a correspondingly large value of the in-plane axial Poisson's ratio (PR). By making use of this large PR extremely negative values of expansivity may be obtained - much further negative than for any monolithic materials. The use of laminated composites also overcomes some of the previously reported limitations of a device to control thermal expansion when made with monolithic materials. The use of the device, as a platform to control the expansivity of an optical fibre containing a Bragg grating, is discussed in detail and it is shown that the required negative expansivity of -10(-5) K-1 may easily be obtained with a number of composite systems.

AB Most of the auxetic materials that have been characterized experimentally or studied analytically are anisotropic and this limits their possible applications, as they need to be carefully oriented during operation. Here, through a combined numerical and experimental approach, we demonstrate that 2D auxetic materials with isotropic response can be easily realized by perforating a sheet with elongated cuts arranged to form a periodic pattern with either six-fold or three-fold symmetry. Moreover, we also show that the auxetic behavior can be easily tuned by varying the length of the cuts and that it is retained even under large levels of applied deformation beyond the limit of small strains. This novel, simple and scalable design can serve as an important guideline for designing and fabricating isotropic auxetic materials that can have a significant impact on a wide range of applications.

AB One of the most important goal of modern material science is designing structures which exhibit appropriate properties. These properties can be obtained by optimization methods which often use numerical calculations e.g. finite element method (FEM). This paper shows the results of topological optimization which is used to obtain the greatest possible negative Poisson's ratio of the two-phase composite. The shape is anti-tetra-chiral two-dimensional unit cell of the whole lattice structure which has negative Poisson's ratio when it is built of one solid material. Two phase used in optimization are two solid materials with positive Poisson's ratio and Young's modulus. Distribution of reinforcement hard material inside soft matrix material in anti-tetra-chiral domain influenced mechanical properties of structure. The calculations shows that the resultant structure has negative Poisson's ratio even eight times smaller than homogenous anti-tetra chiral structure made of classic one material. In the analysis FEM is connected with algorithm Method of Moving Asymptote (MMA). The results of materials' properties parameters are described and calculated by means of shape interpolation scheme - Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization (SIMP) method.

AB As promising metamaterials, 3D periodic auxetic cellular structures (PACSs) have attracted great interest. However, they usually consist of intricate geometries which make their fabrication a significant challenge. The present paper is focused on introducing the interlocking assembly concept into the fabrication of 3D PACSs. There are distinct advantages of the interlocking assembly method compared with the additive manufacturing methods mainly used before. Based on the interlocking assembly method, the dependences of mechanical properties mainly including the Poisson's ratio and the Young's modulus of the structure on the re-entrant angle were investigated through a combination of uniaxial compression experiments and numerical simulations, excellent qualitative and quantitative agreement was found. Using the experimentally verified numerical model, the effects of the strut thickness and the ratio of the vertical strut length to oblique strut length on the mechanical properties of the structure were investigated. Results show that the compression modulus of the structure will increase with the structure becomes more re-entrant, but there exists an extreme value for Poisson's ratio with the reentrant angle around 45 which differs from former studies. With the thickening of the struts the compression modulus of the structure monotonously increases and the Poisson's ratio of the structure will gradually changes from negative to positive then gradually approaches to the Poisson's ratio of the parent material. The vertical strut length to oblique strut length ratio plays fewer roles on the mechanical properties compared with the re-entrant angle and the strut thickness. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper provides a theoretical investigation of negative refraction and focusing of elastic guided waves in a freestanding plate with a steplike thickness change. Under certain conditions, a positive phase velocity (forward) Lamb mode can be converted into a negative phase velocity (backward) mode at such interface, giving rise to negative refraction. A semianalytical model is developed to study the influence of various parameters such as the material Poisson's coefficient, the steplike thickness, the frequency, and the incidence angle. To this end, all the Lamb and shear horizontal propagating modes and also a large number of their inhomogeneous and evanescent counterparts are taken into account. The boundary conditions applied to the stress-displacement fields at the thickness step yields an equation system. Its inversion provides the transmission and reflection coefficients between each mode at the interface. The steplike thickness and Poisson's ratio are shown to be key parameters to optimize the negative refraction process. In terms of material, Duralumin is found to be optimal as it leads to a nearly perfect conversion between forward and backward modes over broad frequency and angular ranges. An excellent focusing ability is thus predicted for a flat lens made of two symmetric thickness steps. A laser ultrasonic experiment quantitatively confirms those theoretical predictions. This study paves the way toward the optimization of elastic devices based on negative refraction, in particular for cloaking or superfocusing purposes.

AB Auxetic materials possess the fascinating property of expanding laterally when stretched longitudinally. However, previous investigations into behavior under large deformation of such materials in tension have been very limited. This work systematically analyses the tensile behavior beyond yield of re-entrant hexagonal honeycombs in the two principal directions. Analytical modeling is performed by considering the plastic, nonlinear behavior of cell walls based on idealized mechanisms. The analytical results are compared with those of the corresponding finite element simulations. Two material models have been studied, a rigid-perfectly plastic material model and that with strain hardening. Plastic Poisson's ratio is calculated as the ratio of the incremental strains in the two perpendicular directions and this ratio changes significantly, from negative to positive, for the re-entrant honeycombs in tension. The elastic slope of stress-strain curves is also considered and initial yielding point is determined. The influences of various geometrical and material parameters on the response of re-entrant honeycombs are discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Auxetics exhibit the unusual property of a negative Poisson's ratio, meaning they get wider rather than thinner when stretched. This work employs force-field based simulations to study the effect of solvent molecules on the structure and mechanical properties of porous polyphenylacetylene auxetic organic networked polymers. In particular, nano-level re-entrant honeycombs 1,4- and 2,8-reflexyne were exposed to three types of solvent molecules (ethanol, propanol and benzene) at different concentrations by performing Monte-Carlo based sorption simulations in two scenarios, one where the solvent was permitted into the pores of the system upon exposure, and one were the solvent could also enter in between the layers of the polymer. Results indicate that the presence of solvent molecules within the molecular framework of the networked polymers has a significant effect on their density and stiffness but does not influence the Poisson's ratio of the material. The effect on the stiffness was found to be highly dependent on various factors, including the properties of the network and the type and amount of solvent adsorbed. These results have important implications in future case scenarios which may involve the synthesis of such systems, and it throws light on how the mechanical properties could be affected due to contamination, while also identifying new methods on how to tailor such properties by exposing the material to specific solvents.

AB In this paper, star-shaped honeycombs are analyzed in terms of their equivalent mechanical behaviors and band gap properties. Firstly, by applying Castigliano's second theorem, the effective Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio are derived by an analytical method used in structural mechanics. On the basis of Bloch's theorem, the dispersion characteristics are then analyzed by the dynamic matrix in conjunction with the Wittrick-Williams (W-W) algorithm. It should be noted that the presented method can form a more simple stiffness and mass matrices of the proposed structures, compared with the traditional finite element (FE) method. Thereafter, the effects of the geometrical parameters on the effective constants and band gaps are investigated and discussed. Numerical results demonstrate that the negative Poisson's ratio provides an enhanced effective Young's modulus of the considered honeycombs. Furthermore, the band gap exists in a much lower frequency region with an unchanged summing band gap width when the Poisson's ratio is in negative values. In general, the work can serve as a guide for the optimal design of cellular structures.

AB An experimental study by holographic interferometry is reported of the following material properties of conventional and negative Poisson's ratio copper foams:  Young's moduli, Poisson's ratios, yield strengths and characteristic lengths associated with inhomogeneous deformation.  The Young's modulus and yield strength of the conventional copper foam were comparable to those predicted by microstructural modelling on the basis of cellular rib bending.  The re-entrant copper foam exhibited a negative Poisson's ratio, as indicated by the elliptical contour fringes on the specimen surface in the bending tests.  Inhomogeneous, non-affine deformation was observed holographically in both foam materials.

AB Purpose - Auxetic materials differ from conventional materials by the manner in which they respond to stretching; they tend to get fatter when stretched, resulting in a negative Poisson's ratio. The purpose of this paper is to present a numerical methodology for design of microstructure of 2D and 3D auxetic materials with a wide range of different negative Poisson's ratios.
   Design/methodology/approach - The proposed methodology is based on a combination of finite element method and a genetic algorithm. The problem is formulated as an optimization problem of finding microstructures with prescribed behavioral requirements. Different microstructures are generated and evolved using the genetic algorithm and the behavior of each microstructure is analyzed using the finite element method to evaluate its fitness in competition with other generated structures.
   Findings - Numerical examples show that it is possible to design a large number of new auxetic materials, each with a different value of negative Poisson's ratio.
   Originality/value - The proposed methodology can be used as an effective method to tailor new materials with prescribed values of negative (or positive) Poisson's ratio. The methodology can also be used to optimize other material properties.

AB Auxetic materials are endowed with a behavior that contradicts common sense, when subjected to an axial tensile load they increase their transverse dimension. In case of a compression load, they reduce their transverse dimension. Consequently, these materials have a negative Poisson's ratio in such direction. This paper reviews research related to these materials. It presents the theories that explain their deformation behavior and reveals the important role represented by the internal structure. Their mechanical properties are explored and some potential applications for these materials are shown.

AB We simulate and analyse three types of two-dimensional networked polymers which have been predicted to exhibit on-axis auxetic behaviour (negative Poisson's ratio), namely (1) polyphenylacetylene networks that behave like flexing re-entrant honeycombs, commonly referred to as 'reflexynes', (2) polyphenylacetylene networks that mimic the behaviour of rotating triangles, commonly referred to as 'polytriangles' and (3) networked polymers built from calix[4]arene units. More specifically, we compute and compare their in-plane off-axis mechanical behaviour, in particular their off-axis Poisson's ratios and show that in some cases, the sign and magnitude of the Poisson's ratio are dependent on the direction of loading. We propose two functions that can provide a measure for the extent of auxeticity for such anisotropic materials and show that the polytriangles are predicted as the most auxetic when compared with the other networks with the reflexyne re-entrant networks being the least auxetic.

AB This report employed molecular statics simulation and density-functional-theory calculation to study the Poisson's ratios of face-centered-cubic materials. We provide numerical and theoretical evidences to show that cubic materials can exhibit auxetic behavior in a principal direction under proper loading conditions. When a stress perpendicular to the loading direction is applied, cubic materials can exhibit a negative Poisson's ratio at finite strain. The negative Poisson's ratio behavior, including its direction and value, is highly dependent on the direction and magnitude of the transversely applied stresses. As a result, we show that it is possible to tune the direction and magnitude of the negative Poisson's ratio behavior of cubic materials by controlling the transverse loadings.

AB The thermal properties of the new negative Poisson's ratio honeycomb structure is investigated. The Poisson's ratio is calculated subject to pure bending. On this basis, the influence of auxetic effect caused by negative Poisson's ratio on thermal conductivity is further investigated. The thermal anisotropic characteristics are also reported in accordance with the anisotropic physical mechanism. Applying this structure to the satellite antenna reflection surface, the thermal deformation value of the antenna reflection surface under a uniform temperature field can be calculated by finite element analysis. Using particle swarm optimization, the optimization target is the accuracy of the antenna reflection surface profile and the total mass of the antenna. The optimization parameter is the design parameters of the negative Poisson's ratio honeycomb structure. The results show that the satellite's overall profile accuracy is reduced by 22.6%. Effectively improving the accuracy of the reflective surface of the antenna.

AB Auxetic materials (or metamaterials) are those with a negative Poisson ratio (NPR) and that display the unexpected property of lateral expansion when stretched, as well as an equal and opposing densification when compressed. Such geometries are being progressively employed in the development of novel products, especially in the fields of intelligent expandable actuators, shape morphing structures and minimally invasive implantable devices. Although several micromanufacturing technologies have already been applied to the development of auxetic geometries and devices, additional precision is needed to take full advantage of their special mechanical properties. In this study we present a very promising approach for the development of auxetic metamaterials and devices based on the use of direct laser writing. The process stands out for its precision and complex three-dimensional (3D) geometries attainable without the need of supporting structures. To our knowledge it represents one of the first examples of the application of this technology to the manufacture of auxetic geometries and mechanical metamaterials, with details even more remarkable than those shown in very recent studies, almost reaching the current limit of this additive manufacturing technology. We have used some special 3D auxetic designs whose remarkable NPR has been previously highlighted.

AB This paper focuses on systematically analyzing the influence of macro fabric structure and yarn architecture on the mechanical and auxetic performance of parametric auxetic fabrics. Re-entrant hexagonal (REH) and helical auxetic yarn (HAY) were adopted as a macro fabric structure and weft yarn to produce three kinds of auxetic fabrics: REH fabric with HAY as weft yarn (REH-HAY); REH fabric with elastic yarn as weft yarn (REH-1, REH-2, REH-3); and plain fabric with HAY as weft yarn (NREH-HAY). By controlling the existence of the HAY and REH structure, the influence of the REH structure and HAY on the mechanical and auxetic properties was thoroughly analyzed. It is demonstrated that both the REH macrostructure and HAY micro configuration can contribute to the performance of the auxetic fabric. Specifically, in the presence of the REH structure and HAY, the auxeticity was found to a 77% increase compared with NREH-HAY and the breaking strain and load rises by about 37.50% and 90.42%, respectively. Notably, the variation of the polyurethane (PU) weft yarn per unit length influenced the tensile and auxetic performance to a lesser extent, while by changing PU to HAY, a significant increase of negative Poisson's ratio value from -1.155 to -1.492 was noticed without greatly jeopardizing the stretchability. Furthermore, the cyclic tensile results demonstrate the stability and elasticity of the fabric. The comparative analysis can give guidance to optimize fabric design and inspire the innovative design of the auxetic textiles, all of which will pave the way for a quantitative and optimizing design for auxetic textiles.

AB While lead-free piezocomposites offer an environmentally friendly solution to mechanical sensing and energy harvesting, they lag state-of-the-art lead-based materials in terms of performance. It is therefore important to develop new material designs to bridge this performance gap. Considering composites where rigid piezoelectric inclusions are embedded in soft matrices, a major cause of poor performance is weak coupling of applied strains to the inclusions. We show here that by designing matrices with negative Poisson's ratios (auxetic matrices) it is possible to considerably improve this coupling. We first demonstrate this concept using a matrix which is inherently auxetic where we show an improvement of 40%-50% in the piezoelectric response. Based on the observations made, we develop a scalable design for auxetic matrices using conventional non-auxetic polymeric materials. This is done by embedding rigid auxetic structures in softer matrices. We show that with such designed auxetic matrices, which are amenable to fabrication through 3D printing, it is possible to achieve considerably larger piezoelectric response with a significant retention of the matrix softness. Particularly, we show that auxetic designs can show piezoelectric enhancements exceeding 300% compared to non-auxetic reference designs having similar a non-auxetic rigid backbone of similar volume as the auxetic backbone. Therefore, the use of matrices with negative Poisson's ratios is a promising design avenue to decouple mechanical coupling of strain to inclusions and matrix hardness. This strategy can pave way to design of softer piezocomposites with superior responses employing only structured polymeric materials without the use of expensive nanomaterials.

AB Materials having a negative Poisson's ratio (auxetic) get fatter rather than thinner when uniaxially stretched. This phenomenon has been often explained through models that describe how particular geometric features in the micro or nanostructure of the material deform when subjected to uniaxial loads. Here, a new model based on scalene rigid triangles rotate relative to each other will be presented and analysed. It is shown that this model can afford a very wide range of Poisson's ratio values, the sign and magnitude of which depends on the shape of the triangles and the angles between them. This new model has the advantage that it is very generic and may be potentially used to describe the properties in various types of materials, including auxetic foams and their relative surface density. Specific applications of this model, such as a blueprint for a system that can exhibit temperature-dependent Poisson's ratios, are also discussed.

AB The global maximum and global minimum Poisson's ratio (PR) surfaces, regions of different auxetic behaviour and the domains of the different extreme directions of cubic materials are shown and discussed in terms of the elastic moduli ratios, X = G/K, Y = G/W, where K is the bulk modulus and G, W, are shear moduli. A straightforward way is given to classify any cubic material as being auxetic, nonauxetic and partially auxetic, as well as calculating its extreme PR values. A decomposition of the XY plane with the elastic constant ratio lambda = C-12/C-44 is introduced to facilitate the interpretation of cubic materials under hydrostatic pressure, P > 0, and isotropic tension, P < 0, which are two qualitatively different situations. Using this representation it is demonstrated that cubic materials with lambda > 0 can be auxetic only under 'negative' pressure (P < 0). It is shown that the influence of pressure on the auxetic behaviour is different for the positive and negative X cases. In particular, a cubic material with 0 > lambda > 1 may be auxetic at negative as well as positive pressure. The work demonstrates the crucial role of P in obtaining desired auxetic behaviour. Microscopic mechanisms which tune the cubic system to targeted regions in the XY plane are investigated with a fcc crystal of particles interacting via the pairwise spherically symmetric potential, phi(r). It is found that all fcc static models in which the range of interaction is only between nearest neighbour particles are placed on a universal curve in the XY plane. It is shown that auxetic behaviours can be achieved with simple static phi(r) analytic forms. The influence of the next neighbour interactions on the universal curve is also considered. In order to assess the role of thermal fluctuations, molecular dynamic simulations for two different phi(r) (the Lennard-Jones (LJ) and the tethered particle potentials) were performed. At low temperatures the studied systems are well represented by the universal curve and on increasing temperature a systematic departure from it is observed. (C) 2010 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB Auxetics are materials that contract laterally when compressed, rather than expand, in contrast to common experience. Here we show that common metals and plastics can be rendered auxetic through the introduction of a regular array of holes. Under compression, these hard holey materials bypass localized failure modes, such as shear banding, and instead deform via a global pattern transformation previously reported in elastomeric structures. Despite significant variations in internal structure, the pattern transformation responsible for auxetic behaviour in both metals and plastics is governed by the buckling of the slender struts that comprise the microarchitecture. Furthermore, in contrast to elastomeric structures, holey sheets made from hard materials exhibit significant negative post-buckling stiffness. This suggests that, beyond the geometrical nonlinearities associated with topological modifications, material nonlinearities which arise during plastic deformation offer further potential for altering the material properties of the constituent.

AB This paper introduces a novel extrusion process for manufacturing helical auxetic yarn (HAY). A range of semi-coextruded HAYs have been manufactured in a cost-effective, consistent and readily usable form. The semi-coextruded HAYs were compared to the conventional spun yarns in terms of tensile properties and auxetic behavior. The results show the presence of the auxetic effect in newly fabricated semi-coextruded HAYs. Similar to the traditional spun HAYs, the new HAYs are sensitive to parameters such as the initial wrap angle, the core/wrap diameter ratio and component moduli. Importantly, a few new manufacturing parameters have been identified for tailoring the auxetic behavior of the semi-coextruded HAYs. The semi-coextruded HAYs are auxetic when an instantaneous true Poisson's ratio analysis method is applied. The semi-coextruded HAYs give a larger maximum negative Poisson's ratio than the conventional HAYs due to the advantages of the pre-formed helical wrap structure.

AB We theoretically investigated the variable mechanical properties such as Young's modulus, Poisson's ratios and compressibility in super-hard materials. Our tensorial analysis reveals that the mechanical properties of super-hard materials are strongly sensitive to the anisotropy index of materials. In sharp contrast to the traditional positive constant as thought before, the Poisson's ratio of super-hard materials could be unexpectedly negative, zero, or even positive with a value much larger than the isotropic upper limit of 0.5 along definite directions. Our results uncover a correlation between compressibility and hardness, which offer insights on the prediction of new super-hard materials. (C) 2014 Author(s).

AB A construct in the form of a multi-layered system built from conventional materials having different mechanical and thermal properties is proposed. This construct can exhibit predetermined values of thermal expansion which could also be negative. It is shown that for maximising negative thermal expansion (NTE) there should be a combination of thin layers of stiff materials having a high positive coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) bonded with thicker layers of a soft material having low CTE values and, more importantly, having Poisson's ratio as high as possible.

AB Auxetic behavior refers to material with negative Poisson's ratio. In this research, a new type of cementitious auxetic material is developed. A novel crack bridging auxetic mechanism is discovered which is in contrast with a local buckling mechanism commonly employed to trigger auxetic behavior. Taking advantage of 3D printing techniques, cementitious cellular composite (CCC) specimens with auxetic cellular structures were produced. Meanwhile, cementitious materials with different fiber content were used as constituent material. Uniaxial compression and cyclic loading tests were performed on the CCCs. Experiments show that with proper constituent material, CCCs can exhibit auxetic behavior which is induced by crack bridging process of the cementitious constituent material. In addition, strain hardening behavior can be identified in the stress-strain curve under uniaxial compression and consequently high specific energy absorption is obtained. Furthermore, 2.5% of reversible deformation which is significantly higher than conventional cementitious materials under cyclic loading is obtained within 25,000 cycles. Obvious fatigue damage is observed in the first 3000 cycles, afterwards signs of mechanical properties recovering can be found. The discovered auxetic mechanism indicates a new designing direction for brittle materials to achieve auxetic behaviors.

AB Auxetic materials are characterized by a negative Poisson's ratio that they expand laterally in the directions perpendicular to the applied stretching stress and vice versa. Piezoelectrics will change their dimensions when exposed to an external electric field. Here we introduce the concept of the "electric auxetic effect": electric auxetic materials will contract or expand in all dimensions in response to an electric field. Such unusual piezoelectric response driven by an electric field is a close analogy to the auxetic effect driven by a stress field. A key feature of electric auxetic materials is that their longitudinal and transverse piezoelectric coefficients are of the same sign. We demonstrate using first-principles calculations that the Pca2(1) orthorhombic phase of ferroelectric HfO2 exhibits both the negative longitudinal piezoelectric effect and the electric auxetic effect. The unusual negative longitudinal piezoelectric effect arises unexpectedly from the domination of the negative internal-strain contribution over the positive clamped-ion contribution, a character often found in van der Waals solids. We confirm a few more electric auxetic materials with finite electric field calculations by screening through a first-principles-based database of piezoelectrics.

AB An important feature that drives the auxetic behaviour of the star-shaped auxetic structures is the hinge-functional connection at the vertex connections. This feature poses a great challenge for manufacturing and may lead to significant stress concentrations. To overcome these problems, we introduced smoothed petal-shaped auxetic structures, where the hinges are replaced by smoothed connections. To accommodate the curved features of the petal-shaped auxetics, a parametrisation modelling scheme using multiple NURBS patches is proposed. Next, an integrated shape design frame work using isogeometric analysis is adopted to improve the structural performance. To ensure a minimum thickness for each member, a geometry sizing constraint is imposed via piece-wise bounding polynomials. This geometry sizing constraint, in the context of isogeometric shape optimization, is particularly interesting due to the non-interpolatory nature of NURBS basis. The effective Poisson ratio is used directly as the objective function, and an adjoint sensitivity analysis is carried out. The optimized designs smoothed petal auxetic structures are shown to achieve low negative Poisson's ratios, while the difficulties of manufacturing the hinges are avoided. For the case with six petals, an in-plane isotropy is achieved. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Auxetic materials having a network like structure are analyzed in terms of their deformation mechanisms and equivalent homogenized mechanical properties thanks to the discrete asymptotic homogenization method. This systematic and predictive methodology is exemplified for five different 2D periodical lattices: the re-entrant hexagonal, hexachiral, cross chiral, rafters and the re-entrant square. The equivalent moduli and Poisson's ratio are expressed in closed form versus the microbeam geometrical parameters and rigidities. As a novel result, the predicted homogenized properties depend on the slenderness of the beam, hence providing more accurate results in comparison to the literature. The studied lattices allow to explore the two main mechanisms responsible for negative Poisson's ratio, the re-entrant and the rolling-up mechanism. Non-standard overall behaviors, such as traction-shear coupling occurring for the cross chiral lattice, are evidenced. Negative values of the Poisson's ratio are obtained in a certain range of the configuration parameter of each lattice. Comparisons of the obtained homogenized moduli with finite element simulations show a very good accuracy of the predicted effective mechanical behavior. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Auxeticity is the result of internal structural degrees of freedom that get in the way of affine deformations. This paper proposes a new understanding of strains in disordered auxetic materials. A class of iso-auxetic structures is identified, which are auxetic structures that are also isostatic, and these are distinguished from conventional elasto-auxetic materials. It is then argued that the mechanisms that give rise to auxeticity are the same in both classes of materials and the implications of this observation on the equations that govern the strain are explored. Next, the compatibility conditions of Saint Venant are demonstrated to be irrelevant for the determination of stresses in iso-auxetic materials, which are governed by balance conditions alone. This leads to the conclusion that elasticity theory is not essential for the general description of auxetic behaviour. One consequence of this is that characterisation in terms of negative Poisson's ratio may be of limited utility.
   A new equation is then proposed for the dependence of the strain on local rotational and expansive fields. Central to the characterization of the geometry of the structure, to the iso-auxetic stress field equations, and to the strain-rotation relation is a specific fabric tensor. This tensor is defined here explicitly for two-dimensional systems, however, disordered. It is argued that, while the proposed dependence of the strain on the local rotational and expansive fields is common to all auxetic materials, iso-auxetic and elasto-auxetic materials may exhibit significantly different macroscopic behaviours.

ID FATIGUE
AB This work presents a comparative analysis between the cyclic loading compressive behaviour of conventional, iso-density non-auxetic and auxetic (negative Poisson's ratio) thermoplastic polyurethane foams. While the three types of foam share the same base material (open cell rigid PU), one batch is transformed into auxetic, (i.e., negative Poisson's ratio) using a special manufacturing process involving moulding and exposure to particular temperature profiles to stabilize the microstructure transformation. The specimens have been loaded in cyclic compression with a sinusoidal waveform in displacement control. The static tests show the specific stress-strain compressive mechanical behaviour of these auxetic thermoplastic foams, opposite to conventional ones and other similar data on auxetics available in open literature. The effect of the load loss, stiffness degradation, the evolution of dynamic rigidity and accumulation of energy dissipation versus the number of cycles are discussed for different loading levels. The analysis of the results shows that the fatigue behaviour until failure occurs in two stages, subjected to cyclic loading, depends on the loading level. The hysteresis loop tends to close itself as function as the number of cycles N, while the slope of the dynamic stiffness decreases with increasing N, therefore with decrease of dissipated energy. The energy dissipated by the auxetic foams is significantly higher than the one from conventional parent phase and the iso-density foams at every number of cycles and loading level.

ID NEGATIVE POISSON RATIO
AB Auxetic foams exhibit the unusual property of a negative Poisson's ratio and hence expand laterally when stretched. In this, the first of two papers, a systematic study is made of the mechanical properties of a range of foams fabricated to have different negative Poisson's ratios. The stress-strain behaviour, in both tension and compression, is compared with conventional foams. Values for the Young's moduli and Poisson's ratios in the three principal directions, in both tension and compression, are obtained. Negative Poisson's ratios ranging between -0.2 and -0.9 in tension, and between -0.1 and -0.8 in compression have been obtained. The effect of densification, during loading is significantly enhanced in auxetic foams, and this significantly affects the stress-strain curves. The creep resistance of the foams is also examined.

AB This paper presents a systematic study of the helical auxetic yarn (HAY) via careful in-house fabrication and characterisation of a wide range of polymeric fibres and yarns. It provides a better understanding of the auxetic behaviour of the HAY in order to tailor their properties for specific applications. The study focused on three parameters: component moduli, the core/wrap diameter ratio and the initial wrap angle. The results show that a larger difference in component moduli, a higher core/wrap diameter ratio and a lower initial wrap angle can produce a larger maximum negative Poisson's ratio value and thereby a better auxetic performance for HAYs. All three parameters could be carefully utilised when in combination to achieve the required auxetic behaviour of HAYs. Moreover, the instantaneous true Poisson's ratio analysis accurately presents the instantaneous behaviour of highly strain dependent HAYs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Auxetic structures with negative Poisson's ratio have been widely studied due to their unique mechanical properties. In this paper, a novel auxetic cylindrical double-arrowed honeycomb (DAH) is proposed. First, an analytical model to predict the elastic mechanical properties of DAH structure in the longitudinal and circumferential directions is developed utilizing the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory. Then, the finite element models are utilized to verify the analytical method. However, the results show that the analytical model cannot accurately predict the elastic mechanical properties when the radial width is large. Furthermore, the analytical model is revised to predict elastic properties considering the effect of the radial width. The effect of the geometric parameters on the elastic properties is also investigated. The quasi-static compression experiments of ABS auxetic DAH prototypes are conducted to validate the revised analytical models. It is observed that the revised analytical model can accurately predict the elastic mechanical properties of DAH structures.

AB Using molecular dynamics simulations, we find an in-plane negative Poisson's ratio intrinsically existing in the graphene-based three-dimensional (3D) carbon foams (CFs) when they are compressed uniaxially. Our study shows that the negative Poisson's ratio in the present CFs is attributed to their unique molecular structures and triggered by the buckling of the CF structures. This mechanism makes the negative Poisson's ratio of CFs strongly depend on their cell length, which offers us an efficient means to tune the negative Poisson's ratio in nanomaterials. Moreover, as the buckling modes of CFs are topographically different when they are compressed in different directions, their negative Poisson's ratio is found to be strongly anisotropic, which is in contrast to the isotropic positive Poisson's ratio observed in CFs prior to buckling. The discovery of the intrinsic negative Poisson's ratio in 3D CFs will significantly expand the family of auxetic nanomaterials. Meanwhile, the mechanism of nano-auxetics proposed here may open up a door to manufacture new auxetic materials on the nanoscale.

DT Article
ID MICROPOROUS POLYETHYLENE
AB Recent papers have described a particular form of ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) which possesses a large negative Poisson's ratio (nu) because of its complex microstructure. Classical elasticity theory predicts that this should lead to enhancements in certain mechanical properties and this paper examines one such property-that of ball indentation resistance or hardness. The hardness of auxetic UHMWPE with a negative nu, compression moulded UHMWPE and a microporous form of UHMWPE with a positive nu was measured. It was found that the presence of a negative nu resulted in enhancements of the hardness by up to a factor of 2 over conventional UHMWPE.

AB Fundamental behavior of auxetic solids is laid down in terms of linear anisotropic constitutive relationship, followed by the derivation of Poisson's ratio bounds for isotopic solids in 3D and 2D cases. Increasing simplifications are then imposed on the compliance matrices of the complete anisotropic solid until linear isotropic case is obtained, whereby special trends are observed for Poisson's ratio of -1, -2/3, -1/2 and 0, followed by distinct moduli ratio that separates auxetic solids from conventional ones. Thereafter the chapter explores large elastic deformation, anisotropic crystals, elastoplasticity and viscoelasticity of auxetic media.

AB H2O ice is known to exist as a number of different polymorphs. One such polymorph is ice X, a symmetrical phase of ice which is known to be stable at high pressures and low temperatures. In this work, the mechanical properties of ice X have been studied through DFT simulations, and it has been shown that ice X has the potential to exhibit auxetic behaviour (negative Poisson's ratio) at 45 degrees off-axis in the (100), (010) and (001) planes. Studying the deformation of two orthogonally interconnected rhombi has shown that this predicted negative Poisson's ratio can be attributed to the interplay between distortion and hinging of these rhombi. Moreover, it has been shown that the auxetic potential of ice X increases with an increase in hydrostatic pressure, which behaviour is explained by the rhombi approaching quasi-perfect behaviour resulting in a decrease in the distortion of the rhombi and an increase in hinging mechanism.

AB Poisson's ratios of 2D crystals of hard, cyclic tetramers, further referred to as tetramers, are investigated by Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. The tetramers, very simple model molecules, which are composed of four identical hard disks of diameter sigma with centers forming a square of side d, are studied in the isobaric-isothermal ensemble. It is found that, at the same thermodynamical parameters, but depending on the anisotropy parameter alpha=d/sigma, the tetramers spontaneously form crystalline phases, representing each of the five Bravais lattices (BLs) which are possible in the 2D space. The following BLs are observed: 1) the oblique (monoclinic) one, 2) the rectangular (orthorhombic) one, 3) the centered rectangular (orthorhombic) one, 4) the hexagonal one, and 5) the square (tetragonal) one. Among them, structures showing auxetic, partially auxetic, and nonauxetic behaviour are found. This fact makes the tetramer an interesting example of a prototype "molecule," which, depending on its shape, assembles materials of all possible behaviors regarding Poisson's ratio. It is worth noting that tetramers with alpha=1.7 form a strongly auxetic phase that, at the considered thermodynamic conditions, reaches Poisson's ratios varying in the range between -0.589(3) and -0.162(4).

AB In the framework of the theory of anisotropic elasticity, a theoretical analysis of the out-of-plane extension of thin two-layered plates of hexagonal crystals is carried out. The six-fold axes of all pairs of crystals are assumed to be perpendicular to the plane of the plates. Formulae for effective Young's modulus and effective Poisson's ratio are obtained. It is shown that in most cases effective Young's moduli exceed Reuss's average, and thus the rule of mixtures is violated. Equality of these characteristics is possible if the ratios of Young's moduli and the ratios of Poisson's ratios of crystal pairs are the same. Effective Poisson's ratio may be greater or less than the corresponding Reuss's average. In addition, it was found that effective Young's modulus can surpass Young's moduli of both crystals forming a two-layered plate. Effective Poisson's ratio can be both larger and smaller than Poisson's ratios of the initial pair of crystals. The general theoretical conclusions are illustrated by numerical estimates using the experimental values of the elastic constants of the known hexagonal crystals.

AB A novel 3D closed-cell cellular structure with different negative Poisson's ratio under tension and compression was presented. The 3D closed-cell cellular structure was generated by assembling the plane repeat units and sinusoidal wavy sheets units into the frame seamlessly. Four kinds of cellular structures with different responses under tension and compression are introduced. The mechanical properties of the proposed models were investigated. By choosing different repeated units, either positive or negative Poisson's ratio in three orthogonal directions can be achieved. Experiments and numerical simulations results show that the 3D closed-cell cellular structures have different responses under tension and compression loads. Considering material nonlinearities, the numerical results are analyzed using the instantaneous Poisson's ratio. The instantaneous Poisson's ratio can transit from negative to positive as the loads increase in 4 models. The results show that we can predict the auxetic response in a specific direction based on the repeated units that assembled into the frame. This designed structure provides an effective way to achieve a combination of negative, positive or zero Poisson's ratio.

AB The fabrication of auxetic fabrics by using conventional yarns and machinery has gained extraordinary interest from researchers in recent years. However, to date this approach has only been adopted to fabricate auxetic knitted fabrics and uni-stretch auxetic woven fabrics. This paper reports a study that aimed to develop a new class of bi-stretch woven fabrics with auxetic behavior using conventional elastic and non-elastic yarns, and available weaving machinery. Bi-stretch auxetic woven fabrics were firstly designed based on a foldable geometry possessing negative Poisson's ratio by consideration of different design parameters, including the yarn float length, the placement of tight and loose weaves, and the arrangement of elastic and non-elastic yarns in the weft direction, and then fabricated on a dobby weaving machine equipped with multiple weft supplies and a separately controlled second beam assembly attachment. The fabricated fabrics were finally tested on a tensile machine to assess their auxetic behavior in both the warp and weft directions. The results showed that the bi-stretch woven fabrics developed exhibit negative Poisson's ratio up to -0.36 and -0.27 when stretched along the warp and weft directions, respectively, and could be applied for clothing applications that require enhanced shape fit and comfort.

AB Auxetic structures have attracted attention in energy absorption applications owing to their improved shear modulus and enhanced resistance to indentation. On the other hand, four-dimensional (4D) printing is an emerging technology that is capable of 3D printing smart materials with additional functionality. This paper introduces the development of a NiTi negative-Poisson's-ratio structure with superelasticity/shape memory capabilities for improved ballistic applications. An analytical model was initially used to optimize the geometrical parameters of a re-entrant auxetic structure. It was found that the re-entrant auxetic structure with a cell angle of -30 degrees produced the highest Poisson's ratio of -2.089. The 4D printing process using a powder bed fusion system was used to fabricate the optimized NiTi auxetic structure. The measured negative Poisson's ratio of the fabricated auxetic structure was found in agreement with both the analytical model and the finite element simulation. A finite element model was developed to simulate the dynamic response of the optimized auxetic NiTi structure subjected to different projectile speeds. Three stages of the impact process describing the penetration of the top plate, auxetic structure, and bottom plate have been identified. The results show that the optimized auxetic structures affect the dynamic response of the projectile by getting denser toward the impact location. This helped to improve the energy absorbed per unit mass of the NiTi auxetic structure to about two times higher than that of the solid NiTi plate and five times higher than that of the solid conventional steel plate.

AB Iron-Gallium alloy (Galfenol) is a magnetostrictive material (lambda(sat) similar to 400 ppm) with potential for robust transduction. In addition, Galfenol is auxetic in the < 110 > direction with Poisson's ratio values of as low as -0.7. In recent years, this phenomenon has been examined with several experimental protocols. The negative Poisson's ratio of Fe-Ga (attributed to lattice softening under applied stresses) has been documented using tensile tests (with and without a dc magnetic bias) and resonant ultrasound spectroscopy. In addition, density functional theory has been used to produce simulations that explain atomic mechanisms for the observed highly auxetic behavior in this alloy. This paper examines the auxetic response of Galfenol to varying magnetic fields and zero applied stress. An energy based mathematical model of the coupled magnetoelastic properties of the alloy is derived and used to predict Poisson's ratio at magnetic saturation. The results from this approach with no mechanical excitation shows an increase in the Poisson's ratio with increase in the Ga content of the alloy. This is opposite to the trends observed with applied stresses where there is a decrease in the Poisson's ratio with increase in the Ga content. Experimental results for Galfenol of compositions between 15 and 33 atomic percent Gallium will be presented and compared with values from the magnetoelastic model.

AB In recent years, 3D structures with negative Poisson's ratio (auxetic) have attracted great interest. Many polymer and metal 3D auxetic structures have been manufactured using additive manufacturing technology, however composite 3D auxetic structures are rarely reported. Auxetic structures are normally of low stiffness which causes limitations on the structural applications of them. The specific stiffness and strength of auxetic structures can be significantly improved by making them from high-performance fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) composites. Consequently, research of composite 3D auxetic structures made from FRP should be conducted. This paper presents the composite 3D double-arrow-head (DAH) auxetic structure made from carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) using an assembly method. Experimental, finite element and theoretical methods are adopted to study the mechanical properties of the composite 3D DAH auxetic structures. Results show that the Poisson's ratios and effective compression moduli of the composite 3D DAH auxetic structures vary depending on the compression strain amplitude, and the structures become more auxetic and stiffer with the increase of the compression strain. The specific stiffness of the composite 3D DAH structure is much higher than that of the metal structure. In addition, the dependences of the structures Poisson's ratio and effective compression modulus on the geometry parameters have also been given. Making auxetic structures from high-performance FRP composites can significantly improve their mechanical properties which will enable them to have a much wider variety of applications.

AB Materials with a negative Poisson's ratio (PR) are called auxetics; they are characterized by expansion/contraction when tensioned/compressed. Given this counterintuitive behavior, they present very particular characteristics and mechanical behavior. Geometrical models have been developed to justify and artificially reproduce such materials' auxetic behavior. The focus of this study is the exploration of a reentrant model by analyzing the variation in the PR of reentrant structures as a function of geometrical and base material parameters. It is shown that, even in the presence of protruding ribs, there may not be auxetic behavior, and this depends on the geometry of each reentrant structure. Values determined for these parameters can be helpful as approximate reference data in the design and fabrication of auxetic lattices using reentrant geometries.

AB Auxetic metamaterials and structures have excellent mechanical properties such as shear resistance, impact resistance, fracture resistance, energy absorption and vibration isolation, permeability variability, synclastic curvature in bending, etc. Auxetic metamaterials have broad application prospects in the fields of aerospace, navigation, mechanical automation, biomedicine, national defense and military and textile industry. Based on the deformation mechanism of auxetic metamaterials and structure, the physical models of re-entrant mechanism, rotating rigid mechanism, chiral/antichiral mechanism, fibril/nodule mechanism, miura-folded mechanism, buckling-induced mechanism, helical auxetic yarn structure were reviewed. These models can be widely applied in various engineering applications such as light laminated plates, fluid transportation and yarn to improve their properties. Finally, prospects to the upcoming challenges and progress trends of auxetic metamaterials and structures are made. It is pointed out that the application of negative Poisson's ratio effect can help compensate the change of volume and area under the deformation of uniaxial loading. Then the shock resistance of turbine blade, antenna and car suction box can be improved. As a result, this review can provide benefits for the development of auxetic metamaterials.

AB Materials with a negative Poisson's Ratio (PR), known as auxetics, exhibit the counterintuitive behavior of becoming wider when uniaxially stretched and thinner when compressed. Though negative PR is characteristic of polymer foams or cellular solids, tight as well as highly porous rocks have also been reported to exhibit negative PR. The paper proposes a novel auxetic structure based on pore-space configuration observed in rocks. We developed a theoretical auxetic 3D model consisting of rotating rigid bodies. To alleviate the mechanical assumption of rotating bodies, the theoretical model was modified to include crack-like features being represented by intersecting, elliptic cylinders. We then used a 3D printer to create a physical version of the modified model, whose PR was tested. We also numerically explored how the compressibility of fluids located in the pore-space of the modified model as well as how the elastic properties of the material from which the model is made of affect its auxetic behavior. We conclude that for a porous medium composed of a single material saturated with a single fluid (a) the more compliant the fluid is and (b) the lower the PR of the solid material, the lower the PR value of the composite material.

AB The auxetic metamaterials exhibit attractive mechanical properties, including negative Poisson's ratio and compressional resistance. Although auxetic metamaterials have been extensively investigated using experimental and computational approaches, the consistent estimation of shear properties has still not been clarified. According to Cauchy elasticity, the shear properties of an auxetic structure should be enhanced owing to the negative Poisson's ratio. However, this study used homogenisation and experimental approaches to demonstrate that the shear elasticity is highly non-linear with respect to the characteristic geometrical parameters of a unit cell and that shear properties, particularly normal elasticity, are not always improved. Furthermore, the estimation of the shear elasticity based on the classical isotropic continuum elasticity relations can result in misleading values and should be avoided.

AB Auxetic materials with negative Poisson's ratio have recently attracted the interest of the scientific community. This is because these materials have the potential to deliver specific functions thanks to a discretization of their constitutive matter that is intended as an aggregation of macro-scaled cellular structures characterized by specific geometries. Many auxetic structures with different geometries and auxetic response have been proposed. Downscaling the cellular structures (e.g. micro scale) has the potential to improve the overall auxetic properties of the material, yet there is not enough research on the behavior of these structures at the microscale. This paper studies the auxetic behavior of a modified hexachiral structure formed by microscale elements. First an optimization study was performed to define the most appropriate geometrical dimensions. Then the auxeticity of the proposed cell was assessed carefully introducing a new Coefficient of Auxeticity which allowed to capture complex mechanical responses (e.g. including cellular rotations) as those faced with the proposed design. The proposed miniaturized design shows an outstanding stable auxetic response up to 20% strain of the micro-cell. It is believed that this study has the potential to pave the way to a new class of auxetic materials.

AB In this current work, a Ti-6Al-4V 3-D re-entrant lattice auxetic structure is manufactured by the electron beam melting (EBM) process. Four different design configurations (two negative Poisson's ratio values x two relative densities) were manufactured and tested under compressive stress. Two failure modes were observed whose occurrence appeared to be dependent on the ratio of vertical strut length to re-entrant strut length. A small deflection analytical model is presented that predicts yield strength and modulus for one type of design with good accuracy. Results also show that the re-entrant lattice structure possesses superior mechanical properties compared to regular foam structures. Limitations of the analytical model are also discussed.

AB The static bulk and shear modulus of poly (N-isopropylacrylamide) /water gel (NIPA gel) have been obtained as a function of temperature by measuring the change of sample size induced by an applied tension.  It is deduced that the method gives the static elastic moduli of gels to a good approximation except just above the discontinuous transition temperature T(o), where the stress-induced shift of T(o) made the estimation of elastic strain impossible.  Two kinds of NIPA gels with different polymer concentration and crosslinking density were used as samples, of which one undergoes a discontinuous volume phase transition and the other a continuous one.  In both gels, the bulk modulus softens drastically towards the transition showing that the soft mode of this transition is a uniform and isotropic volume-deformation mode.  The shear modulus, on the other hand, shows only a small anomaly at the transition.  The anomaly exhibited by the Poisson's ratio sigma is quite peculiar, i.e., it becomes negative and approaches - 1 towards the critical point.  It is shown that the results can be explained fairly well on the basis of the Flory-type phenomenological theory extended to take into account the concentration dependence of the interaction parameter.

AB The material with negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) is a typical metamaterial, which is considered to have great prospects in energy absorption, but the low modulus and low strength of the materials are the biggest obstacles to its engineering applications. In this paper, the basic mechanical properties and energy absorption performance of an auxetic material with ultra-low density, named as a novel cross-chiral structure (NCCS), are systematically studied under quasi-static and dynamic compression. The results reveal that this auxetic material shows strong anisotropy and enhanced mechanical properties in the principal directions. Compared to the previously reported auxetic materials, it exhibits higher modulus and strength as well as superior energy absorption capability with the relative density less than 0.1, which is validated by both numerical simulations and experiments. In addition, the results indicate that the presented model can be optimized to achieve excellent mechanical properties and outstanding energy absorption capability with ultra-low densities, by tailoring strut's tilt angle and relative density. This architectured metamaterial is expected to find a bright future in the applications of energy absorption such as sandwich cores of armor.

AB In recent years, materials with negative poisson's ratio properties have attracted great interest from both scientific and industry fields, since they exhibit special properties: such as dramatic increases in the cross section when a force is applied in the vertical direction and contraction when compacted. In this paper, polyolefin blends with negative poisson's ratios were prepared successfully. The value of the negative poisson's ratio of the polyolefin blends was investigated by using a YJY stress flake deformation transducer. A maximum value of - 9 was observed for the poisson's ratio of the blends, and the stable value for samples may reach - 1.4. The morphology of the blends was also studied. The results showed that the convacation phenomenon occurred between the two components when the samples were stretched. It also showed that it is possible to get materials with negative poisson's ratio by decreasing the compatibility of the two components in the blends.

ID NEGATIVE POISSONS RATIO
AB Auxetic spacer fabrics are a novel kind of three-dimensional (3D) fabric structure with a negative Poisson's ratio. They have found a number of applications in functional garments, protective pads and sportive shoes due to their unusual properties. In this paper, a study on deformation behaviors of 3D spacer fabrics that could be fabricated on a large scale is reported. Through experimental observations of deformation of a basic hexagonal unit at different tensile strains, two different geometrical models are proposed for the fabric structure when extended in the course direction and wale direction, respectively. Based on the geometrical models, two semi-empirical equations between the Poisson's ratio and tensile strain are established for both tensile directions. The study shows that the established semi-empirical equations fit well with experimental results. Therefore, they could be used in the design and prediction of 3D auxetic spacer fabrics with different values of geometrical parameters.

ID SEISMIC RESPONSE
AB To analyze the influence of an adjacent foundation on ground stiffness, a new concept of ground stiffness influence coefficient is introduced, which is defined as the ratio of the ground stiffness with the adjacent foundation to that without. Based on the Mindlin solution, an analytical expression of the influence coefficient is derived from a system of two rigid, surface, rectangular foundations under three-dimensional elastic half space. Through calculating the influence coefficient, we analyze the influences of clear distance, side-length ratio of foundations and Poisson's ratio of the ground soil on ground stiffness when the adjacent foundation exists. It is shown that: (1) The ground stiffness can be improved when the effect of the adjacent foundation is taken into account. (2) The influence of the adjacent foundation on ground stiffness shows a positive correlation with the side-length ratio and the Poisson's ratio, and a negative correlation with the clear distance. (3) The influence is more significant in clay ground than in other kinds of ground, such as silt ground. (4) It is not necessary to consider the influence of adjacent foundation when the clear distance is larger than 15 times the side length of the foundation or the side-length ratio is less than 0.1. In other cases, however, we should decide whether or not it is necessary to consider the influence of both the clear distance and the side-length ratio.

AB The influence of auxeticity on the mechanical behavior of isotropic plates is considered herein by evaluating the plate flexural rigidity as the Poisson's ratio changes from 0.5 to -1. Since the change in plate's Poisson's ratio is followed by a change in at least one of the three moduli, any resulting change to the plate flexural rigidity is only meaningful when at least one of the moduli is held constant. This was performed by normalizing the plate flexural rigidity by a single modulus, a square root of two moduli product, or a cube root of three moduli product to give a dimensionless plate flexural rigidity. It was found that the plate flexural rigidity decreases to a minimum as the plate Poisson's ratio decreases from 0.5 to 0 when only the Young's modulus is held constant. Thereafter the plate flexural rigidity increases with the plate auxeticity. Results also reveal that when only the shear modulus or when the bulk modulus is held constant, the plate flexural rigidity decreases or increases, respectively, with the plate auxeticity. Intermediate trend in the plate flexural rigidity is observed when the product of two moduli is held constant. When the product of all three moduli is held constant, the plate flexural rigidity increases with the plate auxeticity, and the change is especially drastic when the plate Poisson's ratio is near to the upper and lower limits of Poisson's ratio for isotropic solids. Results from this work are useful for structural designers to control the flexural rigidity of plate made from auxetic materials.

AB Graphene monolayers engineered to adopt a corrugated conformation are found to exhibit very pronounced lateral expansion characteristics upon uniaxial stretching in specific directions, i.e. giant negative Poisson's ratio (auxeticity). Such anomalous properties are manifested in-plane and may be controlled through the shape and amplitude of the wave-like pattern of the corrugation, which in the case of graphene may be controlled through the introduction of patterned defects'. This confirms that auxeticity via corrugation can be achieved even at the nanoscale, as demonstrated here for graphene with patterned defects', suggesting that this mechanism should be operational at different scales of structures, thus providing a new blueprint for the design or manufacture of auxetic materials and metamaterials which can have tailor-made giant negative Poisson's ratio properties.

Numerical results revealed that the predictions using variable shear factor in Mindlin plate models resulted in high wave frequencies, which were more significant for plates with negative values of Poisson's ratio. The present study can be useful for the design of critical applications by varying the values of Poisson's ratio.

AB Auxetic materials with negative Poisson's ratio are alternatively used in engineering applications. In engineering design, light-weight auxetic material with low stress and negative Poisson's ratio is the main topic. The peanut pattern can be reduced the weight by decreasing the equivalent density. The unit cell of the peanut pattern lattice can be drilled with four circle holes. In this study, the auxetic two-dimension material with modified peanut pattern is used to study the effect of the pattern geometric shape and the equivalent density on the stress and the Poisson's ratio. A four-circle punched pattern has been designed with the original peanut pattern. The equivalent density will be changed by varying their radius lengths. The results show that, the stress and the Poisson's ratio can be reduced by increasing the radius length. In the other words, by decreasing the equivalent density, the stress and the Poison's ratio is decreased. The parabolic relationship between the radius length and the stress is found with R-square value more than 0.95 similar to the relationship between the radius length and the Poissong's ratio.

TI Strain dependent densification during indentation in auxetic foams
SO CELLULAR POLYMERS

DT Article
ID NEGATIVE POISSONS RATIO; POLYETHYLENE
AB Negative Poisson's ratio foams have improved indentation resistance over conventional materials. The mechanism for this is thought to be strain dependent densification but experimental verification of this has been lacking. Novel Surface Displacement Analysis (SDA) software, which uses a speckle analysis technique, allows visualisation of displacements and strains over a surface. Cross sections of foam specimens with various Poisson's ratios, bulk densities and moduli undergoing indentation were examined using the SDA software. We define a Poisson's function analogous to a tangential Poisson's ratio. The specimens with negative Poisson's function demonstrated enhanced indentation resistance independent of bulk density and modulus. The results of the tests with the SDA software showed that auxetic foams do densify under indentation, and the strain field under the indenter is much larger, probably due to enhanced shear stiffness.

AB Auxetic composites are non-conventional materials with negative Poisson's ratio (NPR). They have received great attention in recent years due to their particular properties and high application potential in different areas. In this study, a novel kind of auxetic composite was proposed and fabricated via an injecting and foaming process by using multilayer orthogonal auxetic structure as reinforcement and polyurethane foam as matrix. The NPR effect and mechanical behavior of the composite under quasi-static compression were investigated and compared with those of the pure polyurethane foam and non-auxetic composite. The results obtained show that the auxetic composite fabricated has an obvious NPR effect and behaves more like a damping material with a large range of deformation strain. The study has provided a simple way to design and fabricate auxetic composite materials by using suitable arrangement of reinforcement materials in a multilayer orthogonal structure.

AB Auxetic materials are those which expand when stretched and contract when pushed. One area which is currently attracting attention is in the production of auxetic fibres and textiles. Here, the history of auxetic microporous polymers and subsequent fibres development and production is reviewed along with attempts to understand how the auxetic effect is achieved based on the observed microstructures. Larger scale auxetic polymers appear to have a different causal mechanism to auxetic fibres. A natural development from the production of auxetic fibres is to use the fibres to produce textiles. Progress in this area is examined together with work towards using conventional fibres to produce a textile which is auxetic due to its structure rather than its constituents. Possible applications are also presented.

AB Impact induced geometrically non-linear vibrations of a viscoelastic plate are investigated for the case when the shear operator is governed by the fractional derivative Kelvin-Voigt model in conjunction with the time-independent coefficient of volume extension-compression. Such a model could describe the behavior of so-called auxetic materials with negative Poisson's ratios. The modified method of multiple time scales involving the expansion of the fractional derivative in terms of a small parameter has been utilized for solving nonlinear governing equations of motion. The asymptotic behavior of the roots of the characteristic equation for determining the frequencies of the system as a function of the retardation time is studied and three modes of vibration in the process of impact interaction are described.

ID AUXETIC HONEYCOMB; IMPACT; STIFFNESS; DESIGN; BEAMS
AB Both auxetic structures and hierarchical honeycombs are marked with lightweight and excellent mechanical properties. Here, we combine the characteristics of auxetic structures and hierarchical honeycombs, and propose two re-entrant hierarchical honeycombs constructed by replacing the cell walls of re-entrant honeycombs with regular hexagon substructure (RHH) and equilateral triangle substructure (RHT). The honeycombs are subjected to in-plane impact in order to investigate the crashworthiness by using the commercial software LS-DYNA. The plateau stress of RHH and RHT in x and y directions are derived by a two-scale method. The results from numerical simulation indicate that the specific energy absorption of RHT and RHH is improved by up to 292% and 105%. RHT and RHH improve the mean crushing force value by 298%, 108% respectively compared with the classic re-entrant honeycomb (RH) under quasi-static loading at stress plateau region. The RHT and RHH still have the characteristic of negative Poisson's ratio. Additionally, the parametric studies are further carried out to investigate the effects of impact velocities and relative densities on crashworthiness. All the findings of this study indicate that the proposed two hierarchical honeycombs exhibit an improved crushing performance, and RHT provides the highest energy absorption capacity among all specimens.

AB Recently, the auxetic fabrics have gained much importance in the scientific and industrial community due to their excellent impact-resistance property. Due to this property, they have several applications, including automotive, aerospace, and ballistic areas. The auxetic three-dimensional (3D) woven fabrics are a less explored domain in the auxetic community. Herein, special attention is given to the numerical analysis of the 3D auxetic structure. The negative Poisson's ratio of 3D auxetic structures is studied using ANSYS workbench structural analysis module. The effect of binding yarn float length on negative Poisson's ratio is tested on ten different 3D orthogonal through the thickness structures with binding yarn float length of 1:1, 2:1, and 3:1. Furthermore, the effect of the number of binding yarns and the number of layers is also studied numerically. The results show that the auxeticity of the woven structure increases with increasing the number of binding yarns and their float length. Moreover, decreasing the number of layers from 3 to 1 increases the auxeticity.

This study considers a three - layer circular cylindrical shells in which the core layer is the auxetic material with negative Poisson's ratio, and the external layers are reinforced by a system of stiffeners. Based on the analytical solution, Reddy's first order shear deformation theory with the geometrical nonlinear in von Karman and Airy stress functions method, Galerkin method and the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method, out explicit expressions can be determined: fundamental frequency, dynamic response and frequency-amplitude curves. Numerical results are provided to explore the effects of geometrical parameters, material properties, elastic foundations, imperfections, eccentrically stiffeners, mechanical and blast loads on the nonlinear dynamic behavior: fundamental frequency, dynamic response and frequency-amplitude curves.

AB Ceramic aerogels are attractive for thermal insulation but plagued by poor mechanical stability and degradation under thermal shock. In this study, we designed and synthesized hyperbolic architectured ceramic aerogels with nanolayered double-pane walls with a negative Poisson's ratio (-0.25) and a negative linear thermal expansion coefficient (-1.8 x 10(-6) per degrees C). Our aerogels display robust mechanical and thermal stability and feature ultralow densities down to similar to 0.1 milligram per cubic centimeter, superelasticity up to 95%, and near-zero strength loss after sharp thermal shocks (275 degrees C per second) or intense thermal stress at 1400 degrees C, as well as ultralow thermal conductivity in vacuum [similar to 2.4 milliwatts per meter-kelvin (mW/m.K)] and in air (similar to 20 mW/m.K). This robust material system is ideal for thermal superinsulation under extreme conditions, such as those encountered by spacecraft.

AB This paper reports quasi-static and low-kinetic energy impact testing of auxetic and conventional open-cell polyurethane foams. The auxetic foams were fabricated using the established thermo-mechanical process originally developed by Lakes. Converted foams were subject to compression along each dimension to 85% and 70% of the unconverted dimension during the conversion process, corresponding to linear compression ratios of 0.85 and 0.7, respectively. The 0.7 linear compression ratio foams were confirmed to have a re-entrant foam cell structure and to be auxetic. Impact tests were performed for kinetic energies up to 4J using an instrumented drop rig and high speed video. A flat dropper was employed on isolated foams, and a hemispherical-shaped dropper on foams covered with a rigid polypropylene outer shell layer. The flat dropper tests provide data on the rate dependency of the Poisson's ratio in these foam test specimens. The foam Poisson's ratios were found to be unaffected by the strain rate for the impact energies considered here. Acceleration-time data are reported along with deformation images from the video footage. The auxetic samples displayed a six times reduction in peak acceleration, showing potential in impact protector devices such as shin or thigh protectors in sports equipment applications.

AB Composites with elliptic inclusions of long semi-axis a and short semi-axis b are studied by the Finite Element method. The centres of ellipses form a square lattice of the unit lattice constant. The neighbouring ellipses are perpendicular to each other and their axes are parallel to the lattice axes. The influence of geometry and material characteristics on the effective mechanical properties of these anisotropic composites is investigated for deformations applied along lattice axes. It is found that for anisotropic inclusions of low Young's modulus, when a + b -> 1 the effective Poisson's ratio tends to -1, while the effective Young's modulus takes very low values. In this case the structure performs the rotating rigid body mechanism. In the limit of large values of Young's modulus of inclusions, both effective Poisson's ratio and effective Young's modulus saturate to values which do not depend on Poisson's ratio of inclusions but depend on geometry of the composite and the matrix Poisson's ratio. For highly anisotropic inclusions of very large Young's modulus, the effective Poisson's ratio of the composite can be negative for nonauxetic both matrix and inclusions. This is a very simple example of an auxetic structure being not only entirely continuous, but with very high Young's modulus. A severe qualitative change in the composite behaviour is observed as a/b reaches the limit of 1, i.e. inclusions are isotropic. The observed changes in both Poisson's ratio and Young's modulus are complex functions of parameters defining the composite. The latter allows one to tailor a material of practically arbitrary elastic parameters. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A finite element model for three-dimensional, open-celled foams is developed. A reentrant cell shape is defined that has the unusual property of exhibiting a negative Poisson's ratio. By altering the cell shape it is possible to achieve different values for the elastic constants and different degrees of anisotropy. It is shown that simple two-dimensional approximations fail to model the properties of the three-dimensional network accurately and a full three-dimensional analysis is required. The reentrant cell used is fully auxetic, with negative Poisson's ratios exhibited when loaded in all three orthogonal directions.

AB In this study, some new 2D auxetic metamaterials were investigated and called octagonal auxetic metamaterials. The structures were examined by numerical and experimental approaches and 3D printing additive manufacturing technique was employed to fabricate the structures from thermoplastic polyurethane elastomer (TPU) which is considered as a hyperelastic material. Auxetic behavior was caused by adding small triangles and squares to the vertices of the octagonal structure and applying high compressive strain. Although the octagonal structure showed negative Poisson's ratio at high compressive strain, the results suggested that adding triangles to the vertices of the octagonal structure as well as increasing the triangle edge length led to higher negative Poisson's ratio. In contrast, with small squares adding to the vertices of the octagonal structure, Poisson's ratio became slightly more negative. In addition, by increasing the square edge length, Poisson's ratio measured near zero or even positive values. Moreover, a parametric study was carried out by Python 3.6.5 programming language to find the best triangle and square edge length which caused the most auxeticity.

AB Auxetic structures exhibit negative Poisson's ratios based on the deflection characteristics of the macrostructural forms generated by integrating specific base units. Considering the advantages of the abnormal metamaterial behavior, auxetic structures attained considerable research attention. While theoretical predictions indicate the possibilities to achieve very high auxetic responses, practical implementation and experimental validation were limited due to the difficulties in manufacturing the complex structural forms. Practical realization of true auxetic structural solutions attained a great impetus with the advent of the additive manufacturing solutions, opening up wider opportunities and renewed interests. The current research is an attempt towards enhancing the auxetic nature of a square grid structure by numerical and experimental methods. Finite element simulations allowed to identify structural changes for improved auxeticity and experimental validation based on selective laser melted structures proved the trends to be true. Experimental results based on the fabricated structure indicate the Poisson's ratio to be -7.

AB In this paper, an auxetic design is proposed for the flexible membrane of a piezoelectric pulse sensor and computationally analyzed for a high-sensitivity vibration sensing in micro electro-mechanical system (MEMS). Auxetics are metamaterial structures with negative Poisson's ratio which enables sensor's flexible diaphragm to be expanded in both longitudinal and transverse directions easily. The sensitivity of a pulse sensor with an auxetic membrane was studied and compared to an equivalent plain membrane when the substrate was under harmonic bending. The sensing response was determined for the both models using detailed Finite Element Model (FEM) simulations. The sensor with the auxetic membrane demonstrated excellent sensitivity output over a harmonic pressure input which shows its strong potential for high-sensitive MEMS sensing applications. A detailed fabrication process is also discussed.

AB Auxetic materials or structures, especially 3D cellular lattice architectures with negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) have attracted great attention due to their unprecedented mechanical behaviors and promising applications in recent years. Many 3D auxetic architected cellular materials have been manufactured and characterized with polymers and metals using additive manufacturing technology as well as some fibre reinforced polymers (FRP) composites via assembly method, however metal 3D printed auxetic structures with high-quality are rarely reported and FRP composites using assembly method contain a variety of defects which result in a knock-down effect on mechanical properties. Auxetic structures made from polymers are normally of low stiffness and strength and FRP composites are of low toughness and impact resistance, which causes limitations on their structural and functional applications. If rationally designed structures can be made from high-performance metal materials the specific stiffness and strength of which are much higher than polymers, their specific stiffness and strength can be significantly increased which will make them more suitable for various potential applications. This paper presents novel 3D double-U hierarchical structures (DUHs) based on double-V hierarchical structures (DVHs) with tunable Poisson's ratio and Young's modulus by tailoring the geometry parameters. Experimental, numerical and theoretical results show that DUHs have smooth geometry that can reduce manufacturing damage and stress concentration under elastic loading. Another advantage of DUHs is that the curved configurations have enhanced auxetic behavior and higher static collapse stress than DVHs under crushing. The advanced 3D printing technology and those excellent mechanical properties of 3D DUHs meet the requirements of structural and functional applications. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Over the years, great advances have been made in the field of auxetic metamaterials where one of the main focuses was the production of systems which can be produced through simple and relatively inexpensive means. In this work, auxetic systems created through the introduction of elliptical grooves, meant to mimic the rotating units mechanism, are proposed and analyzed. These systems were found to have the potential to exhibit Poisson's ratios ranging from ca.-1 to the Poisson's ratio of the material of the system itself, with some systems also possessing the remarkable property of a zero Poisson's ratio. The final product is a non-porous metamaterial with potentially tailor-made Poisson's ratio properties. (C) 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB Auxetic materials with negative Poisson's ratios unusually exhibit intuitive mechanical behaviors, such as cross-section expansion instead of contraction during tension. Such behaviors are interesting because they may enhance unusual mechanical properties. However, controllable preparation of materials with negative Poisson's ratio is still a major challenge. In this study, we report the synthesis of a flexible auxetic graphene assembled macrofilm (GAMF) from graphene oxide nanosheets by a thermal annealing and press assistant method. The obtained materials exhibit good flexibility and significantly wide tunable negative Poisson's ratios ranging from -0.11 to -0.53. We also develop a reconstruction model for characterization the uniaxial tension of GAMF based on X-ray tomographic images. The tensile simulation result predicts the function relationship between Poisson's ratio and critical thickness of pore channels, which is in good agreement with the experimental data. As a result, an effective tunable way is proposed for customizable fabrication of GAMF with tunable negative Poisson's ratios, and the GAMF materials with good flexibility, high electrical conductivity and superior auxetic behavior looks promising for future development of wearable electronics.

AB This paper describes the fabrication of polymeric auxetic foam using a quasi tri-axial compression method. In this method, the conversion process is executed by applying a quasi tri-axial compression on conventional closed-cell polyurethane foams. In order to achieve optimum auxetic characteristics, the densification points in various directions are evaluated. In addition, the heating time of the compressed foam is also determined and applied to minimize the residual stress due to the volumetric compression. It leads to the fabrication of auxetic foams with achievable maximum re-entrancy and minimum collapsed cells without surface creasing. The results also show that the optimized auxetic foam exhibits isotropic behavior compared to its pre-cursor foam as verified by the morphological analysis. The produced foam has all the desired properties of auxetic foams. The auxetic foam with a negative Poisson's ratio may be have great potential as the supplementary materials in energy absorption and structural applications.

AB Negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) material with unique geometry is rare in nature and has an auxetic response under strain in a specific direction. With this unique property, this type of material is significantly promising in many specific application fields. The curling structure commonly exists in knitted products due to the unbalanced force inside a knit loop. Thus, knitted fabric is an ideal candidate to mimic natural NPR materials, since it possesses such an inherent curly configuration and the flexibility to design and process. In this work, a weft-knitted Miura-ori fold (WMF) fabric was produced that creates a self-folding three-dimensional structure with NPR performance. Also, a finite element analysis model was developed to simulate the structural auxetic response to understand the deformation mechanism of hierarchical thread-based auxetic fabrics. The simulated strain-force curves of four WMF fabrics quantitatively agree with our experimental results. The auxetic morphologies, Poisson's ratio and damping capacity were discussed, revealing the deformation mechanism of the WMF fabrics. This study thus provides a fundamental framework for mechanical-stimulating textiles. The developed NPR knitted fabrics have a high potential to be employed in areas of tissue engineering, such as artificial blood vessels and artificial folding mucosa.

ID NEGATIVE POISSONS RATIO
AB Auxetic materials with a negative Poisson's ratio have the fascinating property of expanding laterally when stretched longitudinally. This property is fundamentally important to the properties of a material, and significant changes in the value of the ratio have important effects on mechanical performance. This paper examines the variation in static and dynamic shear moduli on a range of auxetic foams and also examines variation in loss tangent. It is shown that both the static, elastic shear modulus and the dynamic loss tangent may increase with a negative Poisson's ratio. Such changes are attributed to modifications of the cell structure of the foam, not to changes in the material of the foam, during conversion to an auxetic foam. Such changes may have important applications in cushioning, packaging, sound absorption and protection.

ID ELUTING STENTS; BEHAVIOR; FABRICATION
AB Background: Auxetics, a special class of materials, tend to expand both in the radial and longitudinal directions when a unidirectional tensile force is applied. Recently, studies have come up with new designs for auxetic vascular and nonvascular stents which are deployed with commercial balloon catheters. There are some inherent limitations associated with a unidirectional application of expansion force in the effective deployment of stents. This work proposed a solution to some of these limitations through the use of a biaxial mode of a predetermined strain-based expansion mechanism.
   Method: The design incorporated a pressure-activated crank-slider mechanism. Fabrication of a prototype for experimental verification was carried out through milling and high-speed lathe machining. The testing of the device employed the use of auxetic stents, fabricated from a biocompatible polymer. A finite element study is presented to extrapolate experimental results to a broader range of operation and working conditions.
   Results and conclusions: The expansion mechanism is similar in operation to the opening of an umbrella. The length of the connected auxetic stent increases when internal hydraulic pressure is applied. The degree of linear expansion in 1 direction influences the expansion of auxetic stent in the lateral direction. As the device exerts pressure longitudinally, a larger amount of the force is distributed on the unit cells/hinges which ultimately results in an increased expansion of the stent.

AB The longitudinal and transverse strains were measured as a function of applied electric fields in a bulk ceramic sample of Pb(0.99)Nb(0.02)[(Zr(0.57)Sn(0.43))(0.94)Ti(0.06)](0.98)O(3) at room temperature. Instead of a transverse contraction, a transverse expansion was observed in the electric-field-induced ferroelectric phase after the antiferroelectric-to-ferroelectric phase transition. Therefore, an auxetic behavior was established in monolithic ferroelectric polycrystalline ceramics under electrical loads. The behavior is characterized by a negative strain ratio that is analogous to the Poisson's ratio. The transverse expansion leads to a large hydrostatic piezoelectric coefficient d(h), which suggests new applications of antiferroelectric ceramics in piezoelectric devices.

AB This work demonstrates auxetic behavior in a solid polycrystalline shunted piezoelectric cube. Piezoelectric elements are commonly bonded to structures to reduce vibrations by tuning an attached shunt circuit to resonate at the same frequency as the mechanical vibrations in the structure. Literature has provided an extensive analysis of vibration suppression in passively shunted piezoelectric systems, but in practice, the three-dimensional constitutive equations are almost always reduced to one-dimensional stresses and strains within the piezoelectric. In this work, resistive inductive shunt circuits are applied to the electrical terminals of a harmonically forced piezoelectric cube, and the directional displacements are determined in all three dimensions when it is loaded parallel and perpendicular to the poling direction, as well as dilatationally. By comparing these directional displacements, the effect of the shunt circuit on Poisson's ratio can be measured. It is demonstrated that an inductive shunt leads to a complex Poisson's ratio with a real part approaching positive and negative infinity over a discrete band of frequencies, implying that a polycrystalline piezoelectric cube can become auxetic through the application of a properly engineered shunt circuit. The auxetic behavior is explored through finite element modeling, and the derivation of analytical expressions for Poisson's ratio in shunted piezoelectric elements. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The behaviour of the Poisson's ratio is investigated on the basis of derived by the authors explicit equations determining the components of the compliance tensor in an arbitrarily rotated coordinate frame. Clear analytical expressions describing the angular dependencies of the auxetic properties have been found and the crystallographic regions possessing such auxetic behaviour have been revealed for single crystals of elemental metals. This was completed with the straightforward expressions for calculation of the maximum values of auxeticity. The connection between the auxetic properties and the level of anisotropy of single crystals as well as the Cauchy relation has been analysed for various metals with BCC and FCC lattices.

AB Elastic properties of the face centered cubic (fcc) phase of particles, interacting through hard-core repulsive Yukawa potential are determined by Monte Carlo (MC) simulations in the NpT ensemble with variable shape of the periodic box. The effects of the Debye screening length (-1) and contact value of the potential (epsilon) on elastic properties of the system are studied. It is found that the hard-core repulsive Yukawa system is partially auxetic. The Poisson's ratio of the system in the [110][1 (1) over bar0] direction is negative and decreases with increasing the Debye screening length.

AB Auxetic materials are materials which present negative Poisson ratios. This unusual behavior is due to their particular microstructures. It is frequent that during large deformation processes in auxetic foams, the value of the Poisson ratio also presents large variations, with transitions from auxetic to conventional behavior. In this paper we present a procedure to perform large strain finite element analysis of energy-conservative isotropic auxetic materials from a continuum perspective. Two possible approaches are used. The first one is based on uncoupled WYPiWYG hyperelasticity. This decomposition permits a simple analysis of the behavior using also infinitesimal bi-linear models. The second approach is a novel procedure for coupled hyperelasticity based on classical invariants. This latter procedure is amenable for obtaining the stored energy of highly compressible foams, including coupling terms and generic invariants, as for example those used by the analytical Blatz-Ko model or the hyperelastic model of Ciambella and Saccomandi, which was explicitly developed for auxetic foams. The applicability and efficiency of the method is shown through fmite element analyses of auxetic foams at large strains using the continuum approach. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Studies on the mechanical behavior of materials are often performed on the assumption of positive Poisson's ratio except for auxetic materials. Auxetic materials and structures are intriguing systems that exhibit negative Poisson's ratio. Recently some investigation were made on semi-auxetic materials in terms of their directional and positional auxeticity. In this paper we furnish a simple example of a 3-ply laminate consisting of isotropic plies whereby the sign of its effective Poisson's ratio changes when the loading mode changes between pure axial loading and pure bending. In addition, both positive and negative Poisson ratio behaviors do not cancel one another, but are simultaneously manifested when the above-mentioned loading modes are combined.

ID NEGATIVE POISSONS RATIO; MECHANICS; BEHAVIOR; SHAPE
AB Auxetic materials exhibiting a negative Poisson's ratio are of great research interest due to their unusual mechanical responses and a wide range of potential deployment. However, due to the cellular structure and the bending or rotation deformation nature of the elements in auxetic materials, they usually have relative low stiffness, limiting their applications where high stiffness, strength, hardness, and energy absorption are simultaneously desired. To overcome this limitation, we apply the auxetic lattice structures as the reinforcements combining with the nearly incompressible soft materials as the matrix to create a class of high-performance composites. This coupled geometry and material design concept is enabled by the state-of-the-art additive manufacturing technique. Guided by static and dynamic experimental testing, we systematically study the indentation behavior of the 3D printed auxetics reinforced composites and achieve a significant enhancement of their indentation stiffness and impact resistance compared with the non-auxetic reinforced composites. By digital image correlation processing of experimental tests and numerical simulation, this improved mechanical performance is found due to two deformation mechanisms. The first mechanism is the negative Poisson's ratio effect of the auxetic reinforcements, which makes the matrix in a state of biaxial compression during indentation and impact and hence provides additional support. The second mechanism is the negative Poisson's ratio effect of the overall composites, which makes the auxetic reinforced composites denser at the site of the indentation and therefore are more resistant to indentation. The results show that auxetic structures can lead to design stiffer, harder and tougher composite materials. The material design strategy provides insights into the development of classes of novel auxetic composites with a wide range of mechanical and structural applications.

AB An effective anisotropic continuum formulation for auxetic cellular materials is the objective of this paper. A skeleton is modelled as a plane beam elastic structure with stiff joints. The skeleton topology, forming concave polygons, is responsible for negative Poisson's ratio effect. The essential macroscopic features of mechanical behaviour are inferred from the deformation response of a representative volume element using the framework of micromechanical analysis. The strain energy of a unit cell is calculated by adding the tensile, shearing and bending strain energy of individual members. The equivalent continuum is based on averaging this energy, thus formulating the basis for computing the anisotropic stiffness matrix. The structural mechanics methodology and ANSYS finite element code are applied to solve the beam model of the skeleton. Graphical representation of certain material constants such as Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, shear modulus and generalized bulk modulus is given. The results of included parametric study may be used for proper choice of geometric and material data of the skeleton for a given structural application of the anisotropic continuum.

AB A 2D 'Rough Particle' model consisting of interlocking hexagons is reported. Analytical expressions for the in-plane Poisson's ratios and Young's moduli due to particle translation along the geometrically matched male and female interlocks are derived for the model. The dependency of the mechanical properties on each of the model (geometrical and stiffness) parameters is provided, and it is shown that the assembly of interlocking hexagons deforming by particle translation along the interlocks displays auxetic (negative Poisson's ratio) behaviour. The model predictions are compared with experimental mechanical properties for auxetic polypropylene (PP) films and fibres. The model predicts the experimental Poisson's ratio values very well (model: nu(xy) = -1.30, nu(yx) = -0.77; experiment (PP films): nu(||) = -1.12, nu(perpendicular to) = -0.77). The model generally overestimates the Young's moduli of the films, but is in reasonable agreement with the axial Young's modulus of the fibres.

AB Auxetic materials refer to materials that exhibit a negative Poisson's ratio. They behave directly opposite to conventional materials by becoming wider when stretched and narrower when compressed. The unique property of this group of materials has led to them gaining a wider range of applications. This paper presents a study on the use of a flatbed knitting machine to fabricate and experiment on an arrow-headed auxetic tubular fabric. The study used three kinds of yarns: nylon (PA), PES, and cotton as the materials for knitting the tubular samples. Three variations of an arrow-head design (4x4, 6x6, and 8x8) were also used as the three main structural patterns. The results reveal that the 6x6' structure gives the best auxetic effect among the three and the nylon (PA) yarn had the best auxeticity.

DE auxetic networks; self-assembly; molecular design; molecular mechanics
AB Most materials will shrink or expand laterally when stretched or compressed, i. e. they have positive Poisson ratios,but materials with negative Poisson ratios will undergo lateral expansion when stretched longitudinally and become thinner when compressed. And materials exhibiting this novel and counterintuitive behavior, now known as auxetic materials, have been successfully fabricated with many new applications. Currently, molecular auxeties, namely auxetic materials at the molecular level, have become the most exciting endeavor in the development of auxetic materials. In this paper, as new alternatives to the making of molecular auxetics, several types of centipede-like linear polymers both with single and double legs on the side chain, single-arrow-like, double-arrow-like organic compounds were designed as building blocks for self-assembling into auxetic network structures through hydrogen bonds. The second derivative method is used to calculate Poisson ratios after doing molecular mechanics (MM) optimization. The results show that all these self-assembly networks can be arranged as inverted honey-comb like structures and their Poisson's ratios in at least one plane are negative and even the self assembly of small molecules with special architecture may achieve auxeticity in some cases. Compared with many approaches proposed so far, that of the self-assembly of both single polymers and single small molecules into molecular auxetics reported here is quite novel. It provides a new route to synthesize molecular auxetics, which should be much easier than that for synthesizing two-dimensional cross-linked auxetic networks. Yet its successful realization requires great experimental efforts.

The lattices exhibit geometry dependent Poisson's ratio that can be tuned to negative values. Poisson's ratio tends to zero as the cubes become further apart. The lattices exhibit stretch-twist coupling. Such coupling cannot occur in a classical elastic continuum but it can occur in a chiral Cosserat solid.

AB The origin of negative Poisson's ratio in rutile-type oxides and fluorides is explored through density functional theory (DFT) simulation. The study highlights the dominant role of nearest-neighbor central force interactions, thereby inspiring the design of a new three-dimensional (3D) mechanical metamaterial by mimicking the bond structure via elastic beams. Analytical expressions for the effective Poisson's ratio and compressibility are derived and validated by finite element computations. Numerical results indicate that the material can exhibit simultaneously negative Poisson's ratio and negative linear, area, or volume compressibility. The negative Poisson's ratio is conformed experimentally, and the parametric spaces leading to negative compressibilities are identified explicitly.

AB We report here structures, constructed with regular polygonal prisms, that exhibit negative Poisson's ratios. In particular, we show how we can construct such a structure with regular n-gonal prism-shaped unit cells that are again built with regular n-gonal component prisms. First, we show that the only three possible values for n are 3, 4 and 6 and then discuss how we construct the unit cell again with regular n-gonal component prisms. Then, we derive Poisson's ratio formula for each of the three structures and show, by analysis and numerical verification, that the structures possess negative Poisson's ratio under certain geometric conditions.

AB Auxetic structure and tunable phase transitions are fascinating properties for future application. Herein, we propose two three-dimensional (3D) carbon honeycombs (CHC), known as Cmcm -CHC and Cmmm-CHC. Based on first-principles calculations, these novel 3D materials exhibit auxeticity with a fascinating negative Poisson's ratio, which stems from (i) the puckered structure of Cmcm -CHC along the tube axis and (ii) significant change of angle-dominant deformation for Cmmm-CHC in the armchair direction. In addition, the moderate strain drives semimetal to semiconductor phase transition in CHCs, which thoroughly establishes its C-C bond formation. In the meantime, two new phases, namely P6(3)/mmc-CHC and P6/mmm-CHC, form and exhibit semiconductor characteristics. Our results also show that Cmcm -CHC and P6(3)/mmc-CHC are superhard materials. The outstanding negative Poisson's ratio and phase transition properties make CHCs highly versatile for innovative applications in microelectromechanical and nanoelectronic devices.

AB The purpose of the present study is to investigate the influences of changes in the microstructure of the re-entrant auxetic foam during the conversion-based fabrication on its elastic and plastic behaviors. The 20 re-entrant honeycomb is used for the finite element (FE) study. The FE method is firstly validated with theoretical calculations. Then, for the first time, the irregularity of the re-entrant honeycomb is considered in the study of irregularity mechanical relationship. Compared to the regular re-entrant honeycomb, the irregular structures tend to have lower magnitudes of the effective elastic modulus, yield strength and Poisson's ratio. It is also highlighted that the irregularity has indirect effects on the effective mechanical properties of the re-entrant honeycomb by changing its relative density. Moreover, the residual convex units (the uncompressed convex corners of the conventional foams during the conversion-based fabrication) make the Poisson's ratio of the re-entrant honeycomb less negative. Therefore, the superior abilities brought by the negative Poisson's ratio such as the shear modulus and indentation hardness can be impaired by the residual convex units. Besides, the role of the residual stress is also explored with FE methods. The present study is helpful to the understanding of the structure mechanical relationship in the auxetic foams.

ID ARRAYS
AB We demonstrate a negative Poisson's ratio in carbon nanotube forest devices subjected to extension motion obtained by means of electrostatic actuation. Actuated devices were optically monitored, while electrostatic force was applied and the axial (parallel to the carbon nanotubes) and lateral (perpendicular to the carbon nanotubes) motions were extracted. Poisson's ratios were then calculated for the top, middle and bottom portions of the carbon nanotube forest devices. Since extension motion is associated with morphology change of enhancement of carbon nanotube alignment, negative Poisson's ratios were obtained. Large negative Poisson's ratios were obtained in the top portion (where morphology change is most significant), while other portions (where morphology change is less significant) demonstrated smaller value of negative Poisson's ratio. This property makes carbon nanotube forest attractive material for building of micro-electromechanical devices with versatile motion transformation.

AB Background: Cardiovascular heart disease is one of the leading health issues in the present era and requires considerable health care resources to prevent it. The present study was focused on the development of a new coronary stent based on novel auxetic geometry which enables the stent to exhibit a negative Poisson's ratio. Commercially available coronary stents have isotropic properties, whereas the vascular system of the body shows anisotropic characteristics. This results in a mismatch between anisotropic-isotropic properties of the stent and arterial wall, and this in turn is not favorable for mechanical adhesion of the commercially available coronary stents with the arterial wall. It is believed that an auxetic coronary stent with inherent anisotropic mechanical properties and negative Poisson's ratio will have good mechanical adhesion with the arterial wall.
   Methods: The auxetic design was obtained via laser cutting, and surface treatment was performed with acid pickling and electropolishing, followed by an annealing process. In vitro mechanical analysis was performed to analyze the mechanical performance of the auxetic coronary stent. Scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) was used to determine the effects of fabrication processes on the topography of the auxetic stent.
   Results and Conclusions: The elastic recoil (3.3%) of the in vitro mechanical analysis showed that the auxetic stent design effectively maintained the luminal patency of the coronary artery. Also, the auxetic coronary stent showed no foreshortening, therefore it avoids the problem of stent migration, by expanding in both the radial and longitudinal directions. By virtue of its synclastic behavior, the auxetic stent bulges outward when it is radially expanded through an inflated balloon.

AB Perforated systems constitute one of the most important classes of mechanical metamaterials. In this work, two types of "I"-shaped slit perforation patterns are proposed which may be used to design perforated systems that mimic the deformation mechanisms of a variety of re-entrant and anti-tetrachiral honeycomb systems. Using finite element analysis, it is shown how these systems have the potential to exhibit a large spectrum of negative Poisson's ratios, ranging from extremely negative to zero, which are retained over a wide tensile strain range. A detailed analysis of the deformation behavior of these systems is also presented along with a comparison of the changes in overall expansion and Poisson's ratios of both systems observed upon loading with those predicted by previously formulated theoretical models of re-entrant and anti-tetrachiral systems. It is hoped that this work will be of considerable aid in the efforts of scientists to understand the underlying principles governing the production of auxetic mechanical metamaterials through the use of perforations and also stimulate further research on how these and similar mechanisms may be implemented in perforated systems to design other metamaterials with anomalous mechanical properties.

AB Morphological changes resulting from the elongation of poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) have been examined using rheo-photoacoustic Fourier transform infra-red (r.p.a. FTi.r.) methodology. Based on the quantitative analysis of the r.p.a. FTi.r. data, several transitions in the film permeability are identified over the range of examined elongations, and the mechanism responsible for these transitions is discussed. Electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction measurements were utilized in an attempt to further support the proposed mechanism of elongation in the negative Poisson ratio region. In contrast to polyethylene and other polymers, this phenomenon is characteristic of PTFE. The strain dichroic ratios obtained using transmission FTi.r. spectroscopy are not sensitive to these transitions.

AB Amorphous zirconium tungstate (a-ZrW2O8), prepared at 7.7 GPa, was subjected to successive heat treatments at increasingly higher temperatures, up to 640 degrees C. Evidence of recrystallization into alpha-ZrW2O8 was found in the room temperature X-ray powder diffraction pattern of samples previously heated above 600 degrees C. Changes in elastic moduli and linear thermal expansion coefficient upon annealing of a-ZrW2O8 up to 600 degrees C cannot be accounted for by assuming a composite sample consisting of alpha-ZrW2O8 domains dispersed into an amorphous zirconium tungstate matrix. The irreversible relaxation of a-ZrW2O8 and recrystallization into alpha-ZrW2O8 is accompanied by an increase of bulk modulus (from 61.8(8) GPa to 74.4(9) GPa) and Poisson's ratio (from 0267(3) to 0302(3)) and diminution of density (from 6.54(1) g/cm(3) for a-ZrW2O8 to 5.18(1) g/cm(3) for alpha-ZrW2O8). Despite the greater density, a-ZrW2O8 (as well as gamma-ZrW2O8, a high pressure polymorph) is more compressible than alpha-ZrW2O8, possibly owing to the new degrees of freedom provided by lowering symmetry, which allow external stresses to be accommodated by polyhedral tilting. Furthermore, the observed increase of Poisson's ratio upon thermal treatments at increasingly higher temperatures indicates that annealing of a-ZrW2O8 is accompanied by the irreversible reduction in the average number of bridging oxygen atoms.

Proposed by Wojciechowski and implemented later by Lakes, these structures have aroused interest due to their remarkable mechanical properties and numerous potential applications. In view of this, this paper investigates the on-axis mechanical properties of the general forms of the flexing anti-tetrachiral system through analytical and finite element models. The results suggest that these are highly dependent on the geometry (the ratio of ligament lengths, thicknesses, and radius of nodes) and material properties of the constituent materials. We also show that the rigidity of an anti-tetrachiral system can be changed without altering the Poisson's ratio.

AB The purpose of the present study is to investigate dynamic response and vibration of composite double curved shallow shells with negative Poisson's ratios in auxetic honeycombs core layer on elastic foundations subjected to blast and damping loads using analytical solution. This study considers composite double curved shallow shells with auxetic core which have three layers in which the top and bottom outer skins are isotropic aluminum materials; the central layer has honeycomb structure using the same aluminum material. Based on the first order shear deformation theory (FSDT) with the geometrical nonlinear in von Kannan and using Airy stress functions method, Galerkin method and the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method, the resulting equations are solved to obtain expressions for nonlinear motion equations. The effects of geometrical parameters, material properties, elastic foundations Winkler and Pasternak, the nonlinear dynamic analysis and vibration of double curved shallow shells with negative Poisson's ratios in auxetic honeycombs core layer are studied.

AB This research presents a numerical method to design a two-dimensional auxetic microstructure with negative Poisson's ratios. The method is established by combining the finite element method (FEM) with two different optimization procedures called bi-directional evolutionary structural optimization (BESO) and solid isotropic material with penalization (SIMP), respectively. The results show that by choosing any of the two methods of optimization (FEM and BESO or FEM and SIMP), each with a different objective function, it is possible to create microstructures that show negative Poisson's ratio. In addition, there is a significant resemblance between the results of both optimization methodologies. The final part of this study is to verify the outcome of optimization, both numerically and experimentally using three-dimensional (3D) printing techniques.

AB Auxetic materials expand in at least one dimension, when stretched longitudinally i.e. they have negative Poisson's ratio. Development of 2D woven auxetic fabrics (AF) is a new approach to develop mechanically stable auxetic textile structures. However, the mechanical response of such emerging structure is still not studied in detail yet, therefore different mechanical properties of 2D woven AF are compared with conventional non-auxetic fabric (NAF). AF was developed by orienting yarns in auxetic honey-comb (AHC) geometry and auxeticity is induced due to such orientation of yarns. AF was developed using conventional (non-auxetic) materials; cotton yarn and elastane cotton yarn in warp and weft dimension respectively, using air jet loom. Structure and auxeticity of AF were analyzed using a digital microscope and its different mechanical properties (tensile strength, tear strength, bursting strength, cut resistance, and puncture resistance) were studied. AF showed superior mechanical properties with a lower initial modulus, which is beneficial for different protective textiles applications like cut resistance gloves, blast resistant curtains, and puncture tolerant elastomeric composites.

AB A sub-domain size optimization method is conducted to design degraded negative Poisson's ratio honeycomb structures, which could fully utilize the material behavior, such as minimum weight, maximum stiffness and maximum strength etc. The flexural stiffness of negative Poisson's ratio honeycomb structure is greatly associated with the geometry size, which are obtained by geometry size parameter analysis from the representative volume cell of negative Poisson's ratio honeycomb sandwich structure. A three-point bending specimen is designed by sub-domain size optimization method, which is verified by bending experiments. The optimal three-point bending specimen with graded negative Poisson's ratio honeycomb core have the largest bearing capacities and relatively lower weight. The variable thickness wing structure with graded negative Poisson's ratio honeycomb core is also designed by using the sub-domain size optimization method.

AB The growing interest in the field of negative Poisson's ratio materials is motivated by the attractive mechanical properties of these materials and the potential enhancements that might be derived from replacing a positive Poisson's ratio component with its auxetic counterpart. In this paper we report on preliminary results of an ongoing experimental study to test the hypothesis that an auxetic composite can be produced by embedding an auxetic fibre network within a conventional (positive Poisson's ratio) matrix. First we present results of tensile tests performed on samples of compressed mats of sintered stainless steel fibres which are known to have a negative Poisson's ratio out-of-plane. Next we present results of mechanical tests and imaging studies on composite samples made by infusing the stainless steel mats with a polymer. Finally we report on the auxetic behaviour observed in some polymer nanocomposites with a high loading of carbon nanofibers. We conjecture that the embedded nanofibers form an effective network and, like the stainless steel mats, the compression of the samples during fabrication renders the embedded networks auxetic. The compliance of the polymer matrix relative to the nanofiber network results in an auxetic composite. The results demonstrate the feasibility of the approach and the potential for developing new auxetic composites with auxetic fibre networks as the reinforcing phase.

AB Auxetics exhibit the anomalous property of getting fatter rather than thinner when uniaxially stretched [negative Poisson's ratio (NPR)]. This paper presents an analytical model of a structure constructed from umbrella type sub-units which is predicted to exhibit this property together with the results of mechanical tests of a structure having this geometry. It is shown that such systems can exhibit negative on-axis Poisson's ratio of -1 which means that they maintain their aspect ratio, while Poisson's ratio becomes less negative for loading off-axis. It is also shown that this model can explain the sign and anisotropy of Poisson's ratio demonstrated by a molecular level system constructed from calix(4)arenes having the same geometry.

AB With the use of a three-stage thermal processing route, similar to that used previously for the production of ultra high molecular weight polyethylene possessing a negative Poisson's ratio (i.e. displaying auxetic behavior), an auxetic form of polyethylene has been fabricated. The polypropylene is processed by the compaction, sintering, and extrusion of a powder. The importance of powder morphology on the ability of polypropylene to achieve magnetic behavior has been examined, revealing that particle shape, size, and surface roughness are critical variables for successful processing. Negative Poisson's ratios of up to -0.22 at 1.6% strain have been obtained. The data have been successfully interpreted by use of a simple geometric model based on the polymer microstructure. These suggest that, by further optimizing the processing conditions, much larger negative Poisson's ratios should be achievable.

ID DEFORMATION
AB Motivated by the authors' previous study on flexible honeycomb design with negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) often called `auxetic' [1], more geometric options of hexagonal honeycomb meso-structures are explored with various ratios of the vertical cell length, h to the inclined length, 1. While designing an effective shear modulus, e.g., G(12)* of 1 OMPa, of hexagonal honeycombs, we are searching honeycomb geometries. Using an aluminum alloy (7075-T6) as the constituent material, the in-plane linear elastic honeycomb model is employed to get effective shear moduli, effective shear yield strengths and effective shear yield strains of hexagonal honeycombs. The numerical parametric study based on the linear cellular theory is combined with honeycomb design to get the optimal cell geometry associated with a manufacturing limitation. The re-entrant geometry makes 7075-T6 NPR honeycombs flexible, resulting in an effective shear yield strength, (tau(pl)*)12 of 1.7MPa and an effective shear yield strain, (gamma(pl))12 of 0.17 when they are designed to have a G(12)* of lOMPa.

AB This work describes the theoretical, numerical and experimental in-plane and out-of-plane elastic behavior of a class of anti-tetrachiral lattice structures with in-plane negative Poisson's ratios and anisotropic behavior. Closed form analytical solutions related to the uniaxial stiffness, in-plane Poisson's ratio and bounds for the transverse shear modulus are derived, and compared against homogenization-based finite element methods and experimental tests performed on rapid prototyping-made samples. The bench-marked models are then used to investigate the behaviors of the anisotropic negative Poisson's ratio structures against the geometry parameters defining the unit cell. The results show the existence of large variations in linear elastic constants and degree of anisotropy, which can be achieved by changing the lattice geometry parameters. The analysis presented in this work provides meaningful guidance to assist design anti-tetrachiral anisotropic lattices, which could serve as sandwich panel cores in aerospace applications.

ID NEGATIVE-POISSONS-RATIO; BEHAVIOR; MODEL
AB Auxetic materials have gained increasing interest in the last decades, fostered by auspicious applications in various fields. While the design of new auxetics has largely focused on metamaterials with deterministic, periodically arranged structures, we show here by theoretical and numerical analysis that pronounced auxetic behaviour with negative Poisson's ratios of very large magnitude can occur in random fibre networks with slender, reasonably straight fibre segments that buckle and deflect. We further demonstrate in experiments that such auxetic fibre networks, which increase their thickness by an order of magnitude and more than quintuple their volume when moderately extended, can be produced by electrospinning. Our results thus augment the class of auxetics by a large group of straightforwardly fabricable meta-materials with stochastic microstructure.

AB Focusing on planar isotropic petal-shaped auxetics, an isogeometric design framework is presented to achieve tunable effective properties. Specifically, the design framework includes (i) a NURBS-based parametric modelling scheme that characterizes petal-shaped auxetics with a small number of design variables; (ii) a systematic consideration of petal form, component widths and base material properties; (iii) a semi-analytical sensitivity analysis method based on material derivatives; and (iv) constraints for effective stiffness and target Poisson ratio. Three cases are considered: Case A with the same component width, Case B with different component widths, and Case C for composite designs with multiple base materials. For each case, a design limit curve is obtained for the effective Poisson ratio over a range of effective stiffness constraints, to give a quick overview on the properties attainable for each design setting. The optimization framework is next demonstrated for designing composite petal-shaped auxetics with target effective properties.

AB Triangle and honeycomb mechanical metamaterials possess exclusive characteristic of programmable Poisson's ratio. Up to now, the Poisson's ratio of these metamaterials in reported experiments is only within the range of [-4, 1], which is far narrow than the theoretical prediction. In this work, triangle and honeycomb metamaterials were exclusively designed and were fabricated by additive manufacturing. The large magnitude of Poisson's ratios including both positive and negative values was obtained in experimental measurements. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulation were also performed and discussed with the experiments. The results reveal that, under large loading strain, the metamaterials suffer plastic and large deformation, making their Poisson's ratios show significant loading strain dependence. Below the critical loading strain, the metamaterials generate elastic deformation, and the experimentally measured Poisson's ratios agree well with the theoretical perditions and numerical calculation. The as-fabricated triangle and honeycomb metamaterials present programmable positive Poisson's ratio in the ranges of [0.75, 10.92] and [2.80, 13.79], respectively. Besides, the reentrant triangle and honeycomb metamaterials show programmable negative Poisson's ratio in the ranges of [-0.87, -7.01] and [-2.13, -10.24], respectively. These experimentally obtained ranges of Poisson's ratios are far larger than the literature reported experimental results, and provide experimental basis of these mechanical metamaterials to the applications in such as aerospace, civil and transportation.

AB Auxetic structures exhibit certain abnormal mechanical responses such as negative Poisson's ratios, mainly through the intertwined deformation attributes of inter-connected members of macro structural forms. Considering the relative ease of achieving complex forms with the advent of the additive manufacturing technologies, there is a renewed interest in auxetic structures, as the already established as well as new structural shapes are physically produced and tested to ascertain the theoretical predictions. While the focus was mostly around the auxetic responses, the stress distribution patterns and in particular the stress concentration effects were mostly neglected. This paper fills this gap, evaluating the stress concentration aspects of a standard re-entrant auxetic structure. A new structure is designed and proven to be less stressed in comparison with the re-entrant form commonly reported in the literature by means of analytical, experimental, and numerical results. The new structure proposed has proved to be more auxetic up to 15% of the external strain and with Poisson's ratios up to -2.5. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper presents an innovative three-dimensional (3D) fabric structure for composite reinforcement. Different from most conventional 3D fabric structures, the new structure displays a negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) effect under compression. Based on a manufacturing process developed by combining both non-weaving and knitting technologies, four NPR 3D fabric samples with different warp yarn diameters were first manufactured manually. Then, their Poisson's ratio (PR) values under compression along the fabric thickness direction were experimentally evaluated. A geometrical model was also proposed for the theoretical calculation of PR values of these fabrics and was compared with experimental data. The good agreements were obtained between the calculation and experiment. The results show that all the 3D fabrics display NPR effect under compression, which results in a unique feature that allows the structure to concentrate itself under the compressive load to better resist the load. This special feature makes this innovative 3D fabric structure very attractive for many potential applications such as automobile, aerospace, defense and sports equipment, where impact protection can be a highly desirable property.

AB A series of auxetic warp knitted fabrics based on reentrant geometry were developed in our previous study and their Poisson's ratio in the wale direction and course direction can be as low as -0.5 and -0.15, respectively. However, the quantitative relationships between structural parameters and auxetic effect, which can offer a guide to the design and manufacture process, are still unknown. Herein, the aim is to find such relationships. Based on the geometrical analysis, two semiempirical equations between Poisson's ratio and tensile strain are established when stretched in the wale direction and course direction, respectively. The study shows that the established semiempirical equations fit well with experimental results and can be used to predict auxetic effect of fabrics made with the same type of materials and similar structures. With the relationships proposed, warp knitted fabrics can be designed and manufactured directly without trials to obtain the desired auxetic effect, which can largely save the time and cost of production.

AB Re-entrant anti-trichiral honeycomb is a typical auxetic material. The collapse process can be divided into three stages while its negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) effect under large deformation is still unclear. In the present paper, the NPR effects of re-entrant anti-trichiral honeycombs under large deformation are studied by numerical and theoretical method. Numerical results are verified by the experiments with respect to their deformation mechanism and stress-strain behavior. Theoretical formulas are derived to predict the NPR effect of the honeycomb under large deformation. The analytical predictions are in good agreement with the FEM results. It is revealed that the NPR effect of the honeycomb is magnified with the global strain in the second stage while is weaken in the third stage of the deformation process. The decrease of the ligament-ratio and the mean radius will result in more obvious NPR effect. Variation of cell-wall thickness doesn't have much impact on the Poisson's ratio in the second stage, while smaller cell-wall thickness will induce larger NPR in the third stage. The present work is supposed to shed light on the design and fabrication of re-entrant anti-trichiral honeycombs with desired Poisson's ratio.

AB An experimental and numerical investigation of fatigue life and crack propagation in two-dimensional perforated aluminum structures is presented. Specifically, the performance of positive Poisson's ratio (PPR) geometries using circular holes is compared to that of auxetic stop-hole and straight-groove hole geometries. Mechanical fatigue testing shows that the considered auxetic structures have more than 20% longer life than the porous PPR structure at the same porosity and peak effective maximum stress despite having holes with larger stress concentrations. Digital image correlation is used to detect crack initiation and damage propagation much earlier than can be detected by the unaided eye. Accompanying finite element analyses reveal that auxetic structures have the advantage over their PPR counterparts by delaying crack initiation, spreading damage over a larger area, and having a stress intensity factor that decreases over a significant range of crack lengths. In addition, numerical simulations suggest that auxetic structures maintain their negative Poisson's ratios in the presence of cracks.

ID NEGATIVE-POISSONS-RATIO
AB Materials science has adopted the term of auxetic behavior for structural deformations where stretching in some direction entails lateral widening, rather than lateral shrinking. Most studies, in the last three decades, have explored repetitive or cellular structures and used the notion of negative Poisson's ratio as the hallmark of auxetic behavior. However, no general auxetic principle has been established from this perspective. In the present article, we show that a purely geometric approach to periodic auxetics is apt to identify essential characteristics of frameworks with auxetic deformations and can generate a systematic and endless series of periodic auxetic designs. The critical features refer to convexity properties expressed through families of homothetic ellipsoids.

AB Recently, auxetic cellular solids in the forms of honeycombs and carbon nanotube reinforced composite (CNTRC) have great potential in a diverse range of applications. This paper studies the nonlinear free and forced vibration of sandwich cylindrical panel on visco-Pasternak foundations in thermal environment subjected to blast load The sandwich cylindrical panel consists of auxetic honeycombs core layer and two CNTRC face sheets. The Poisson' ratio of the auxetic core is negative and the material properties of CNTRC face sheets are assumed to continuously vary in the thickness direction according to four different types of linear functions. The blast load is determined from the distance of the center of blast to center of the structure and the mass of explosive materials. The fundamental equations are established based on Reddy's higher order shear deformation shell theory taking into account the effect of initial imperfection and visco-Pasternak foundations. The Galerkin and Runge-Kutta methods are used to obtain the nonlinear dynamic response and the natural frequency of the sandwich cylindrical panel. The numerical results show the effect of geometrical parameters, visco foundations, initial imperfection, temperature increment, nanotube volume fraction and blast load on the nonlinear vibration characteristics of the sandwich cylindrical panel. The accuracy of present approach and theoretical results is verified by some comparisons with the known data in the literature.

AB Nowadays, sandwich plates with cellular core structures are gaining the attention of researchers owing to their outstanding features. For a better insight into auxetic structures, in this study, we propose an excellent computational approach based on polygonal meshes to comprehensively examine the free vibration, buckling and dynamic instability behaviors of the auxetic honeycomb sandwich plate structures. A generalized C-0-type higher-order shear deformation theory (C-0-HSDT) in conjunction with both Laplace and quadratic serendipity shape functions is employed to approximate the strain fields for polygonal plate elements. The sandwich plate structures are constituted by an auxetic honeycomb core layer with negative Poisson's ratio and two skin layers reinforced by graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs). Ultra-light features of the plate structures can be obtained by using the auxetic honeycomb cells with negative Poisson's ratio while the GNPs are embedded into skin layers to enhance the structural stiffness. In order to determine the dynamic instability region of the sandwich plate, Bolotin's approach is utilized in the current research. Several numerical examples are carried out to investigate the influences of geometrical parameters of auxetic cell and GNPs reinforcement on the structural behaviors. The results obtained in the current research can be considered as benchmark ones to investigate auxetic sandwich plate structures.

AB Metamaterials can be designed to contain functional gradients with negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) that have counterintuitive behavior compared with monolithic materials. These NPR materials, referred to as auxetics, are relevant to engineering sciences because of their unique mechanical expansion. Previous studies have explored compliant actuators using analytical and numerically derived mechanics of materials principles. However, the control of compliant gradient mechanisms frequently uses complex analytical equations combined with traditional control algorithms, making them difficult to design. To confront the design processes and computational load, herein, machine learning is used to predict errors in compliant auxetic designs based on a mathematically optimal deformation. Finite element analysis and experimental specimens validate the theoretical mechanical behavior of a specific auxetic configuration as well as demonstrate the capabilities of additive manufacturing of graded auxetic materials. Pseudorandomized images and their respective computational deformation results are used to train a regressive model and predict the deviation from optimal behavior. The model predicts the deviation from the desired behavior with a mean average percent error below 5% for the validation set. Subsequently, a scalable workflow design process connecting the unique performance of auxetics to machine learning design predictions is proposed.

AB In this study, two dimensional double-U auxetic honeycombs (2D DUHs) composed of curved shell members have been proposed based on traditional double-V (concave quadrilateral or re-entrant double-arrowhead) auxetic honeycombs (2D DVHs). Theoretical analysis, numerical simulation and compression experiments are adopted to characterize the mechanical properties including equivalent Young's modulus, equivalent Poisson's ratio, and quasi-static collapse process of 2D DVHs and DUHs. Specimens of the 2D DUHs and DVHs made of Aluminum alloy (A6061) are fabricated through wire cut electrical discharge machining. Both numerical and experimental results illustrate that concave DUHs exhibit tunable negative Poisson's ratio and equivalent stiffness level compared to DVHs. Furthermore, DUHs have smooth geometry configurations that can reduce stress concentration at elastic region and exhibit stronger auxetic behavior during large deformation. Those mechanical properties of 2D DUHs satisfy the requirements for practical engineering applications such as energy absorption. The dynamic crushing responses of 2D DVHs and DUHs are also investigated, and it is found that the crushing collapse modes and plateau stress improvement of 2D DUHs are related to the crushing velocity. Finally, the local impact responses of 2D DVHs and DUHs are studied numerically, the influences of impact velocity and indenter size are considered. This study provides useful instructions for the design, fabrication and analysis of auxetic structures, which has a broad prospect in some advanced technical applications.

AB Negative Poisson's ratio or auxetic foams were fabricated and studied for use in prosthetic applications. A thermomechanical process was used to convert conventional polyurethane (PU) foam into auxetic PU foam. Two types of auxetic PU foams were made using two different volumetric compression ratios, 3.02 and 3.86. Chemical composition analysis showed that chemical structure of the converted auxetic foam remained the same as the conventional PU foam after the thermomechanical process. Compression tests showed that the auxetic foams had higher stiffness than conventional foams, implying that the auxetic foams could be potentially used in seat cushions, shoe soles, and as liners in prosthetic applications. Compression fatigue tests showed that percentage loss in thickness in auxetic foam fabricated using lower compression ratio had loss in thickness that is comparable to conventional foam, whereas auxetic foam fabricated using higher compression ratio had greater loss in thickness. Our study indicates that the auxetic foams made using lower compression ratio need to be further explored for suitability in various rehabilitation applications.

ID RANGE
AB The Poisson's ratio characterizes the resultant strain in the lateral direction for a material under longitudinal deformation. Though negative Poisson's ratios (NPR) are theoretically possible within continuum elasticity, they are most frequently observed in engineered materials and structures, as they are not intrinsic to many materials. In this work, we report NPR in single-layer graphene ribbons, which results from the compressive edge stress induced warping of the edges. The effect is robust, as the NPR is observed for graphene ribbons with widths smaller than about 10 nm, and for tensile strains smaller than about 0.5% with NPR values reaching as large as -1.51. The NPR is explained analytically using an inclined plate model, which is able to predict the Poisson's ratio for graphene sheets of arbitrary size. The inclined plate model demonstrates that the NPR is governed by the interplay between the width (a bulk property), and the warping amplitude of the edge (an edge property), which eventually yields a phase diagram determining the sign of the Poisson's ratio as a function of the graphene geometry.

AB The auxetic composites are materials characterized by a negative Poisson's ratio value. Such composites can be made of conventional materials with a positive value of Poisson's ratio, but the specific arrangement of the composite reinforcement structures provides this composition with a negative Poisson's ratio. It is also possible to create such structures from already existing auxetic subassemblies. In comparison to conventional composites, the auxetic reinforced ones have a lot of positive features, i.e.: higher shear resistance, better crack resistance and better damping properties. The aim of this article was to present the review of elastomeric materials for the possible application as the matrix for composite reinforced by auxetic fabrics, especially fabrics made of Helical Auxetic Yam (HAY).

ID FRICTION; MODEL
AB It has been shown that the coefficient of dynamic friction between two surfaces decreases when ultrasonic vibrations are super imposed on the macroscopic sliding velocity. Instead of longitudinal vibrations, this paper focuses on the lateral contractions and expansions of an object in and around the half wavelength node region. This lateral motion is due to the Poisson effect (ratio of lateral strain to longitudinal strain) present in all materials. We numerically and experimentally investigate the Poisson-effect ultrasonic lubrication. A motor effect region is identified in which the effective friction force becomes negative as the vibratory waves drive the motion of the interface. Outside of the motor region, friction lubricationis observed with between 30% and 60% friction force reduction. A "stick-slip" contact model associated with horn kinematics is presented for simulation and analysis purposes. The model accurately matches the experiments for normal loads under 120 N

AB A two phase, fibrous composite subjected to bending non-uniform load is studied in this article. The composite is built of two constituents: the matrix is built of conventional material characterised by constant positive Poisson's ratio, whereas the Poisson's ratio of fibres is changed from positive (common materials) to negative values (auxetics). The influence of the arrangement of fibres, the volume fraction of fibres' materials and the distribution of loading force is studied by means of FEM. The behaviour of the composite is investigated in order to determine if auxetic reinforcement improves rigidity and indentation resistance of the composite. The results obtained confirm that auxetics can be used in composites to decrease deformation in the direction of acting force. (C) 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB Upon defining two types of semi-auxetic solids directional and positional semi-auxetic solids this chapter develops the elastic properties of a directional semi-auxetic solid based on a combined hexagonal and re-entrant honeycomb structure and the 3D kinematic characteristics of another directional semi-auxetic solid based on rotating units. This is followed by an analysis and proposed fabrication methods of directional semi-auxetic yarns. An analysis is then given for a functionally-graded beam from positive Poisson's ratio on one surface to a negative Poisson's ratio on the opposite surface. Finally analyses are given for the mechanical properties of positional semi-auxetic structures in the form of compound rods and sandwich structures. Results for positional semi-auxetic structures show that the extent of auxeticity depends not only on the auxeticity of the constituent structures and the relative volume fractions, but also on the modes of deformation, i.e. these structures exhibit overall conventional properties under one type of loading mode, but overall auxetic properties under a different type of loading mode.

AB Auxetic materials become thicker rather than thinner when stretched, exhibiting an unusual negative Poisson's ratio well suited for designing shape transforming metamaterials. Current auxetic designs, however, are often monostable and cannot maintain the transformed shape upon load removal. Here, inspired by ancient geometric motifs arranged in square and triangular grids, we introduce a class of switchable architected materials exhibiting simultaneous auxeticity and structural bistability. The material concept is experimentally realized by perforating various cut motifs into a sheet of rubber, thus creating a network of rotating units connected with compliant hinges. The metamaterial performance is assessed through mechanical testing and accurately predicted by a coherent set of finite element simulations. A discussion on a rich set of mechanical phenomena follows to shed light on the main design principles governing bistable auxetics. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Metamaterials that exhibit negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) are known as auxetics. They laterally expand or contract when they are axially tensioned or compressed. A re-entrant chiral auxetic structure (RCA) is a recently developed structure, which combines the topological features of re- entrant and chiral honeycombs. Comparative study between the RCA structure and popular benchmarks subjected to uniaxial compression has been conducted experimentally and numerically. Specimens have been fabricated from polyamide12 (PA12) using Multi Jet Fusion (MJF). Numerical models have been developed using ABAQUS/Explicit and verified by the experiments. The experimental measurements manifest the high accuracy of the MJF process to produce robust components with precise details. It has been found that the RCA structure outperforms the other types of honeycombs in terms of strength and specific energy absorption when loaded in the Y direction, while only the tetrachiral honeycomb surpasses the RCA structure in terms of specific energy absorption when loaded in the X direction. The auxeticity (NPR) of the RCA structure compressed in the Y direction was larger than that of the other honeycombs. Numerical models have been employed to study the effects of friction and the number of cells on the mechanical response of the RCA structure.

AB We propose in this work an innovative hybrid auxetic metamaterial with a centersymmetric unit cell and tessellation topology similar to the one provided by the missing rib configuration. The tessellation proposed is applied to different core unit cells (star shape, cross-chiral shape with same dimensions, and reentrant). The effects of the geometric parameters of the cells on the in-plane mechanical properties of this hybrid auxetic metamaterial system are investigated via finite elements (FEMs). Representative unit cells (RUCs) with optimal mechanical behaviors are identified; those configurations exhibit the larger negative Poisson's ratios and enhanced specific moduli. Designs related to two groups of auxetic metastructures with cylindric and cubic shapes are then developed based on the optimized RUCs along x and y directions. The equivalent mechanical performance of these metastructures under internal pressure is evaluated from a numerical standpoint. Auxetic cylindrical metastructures can be tailored by adjusting the number of the optimized RUCs along the circumferential and longitudinal directions, together with the geometric parameters of the optimized RUC itself. These hybrid auxetic metamaterials and metastructures provide the potential for multifunctional applications in biomechanics, flexible electronics, and aerospace.

AB Finite-element methods have been used to examine the elastic properties of continuous-fibre reinforced composites. Consideration has been given to the possibilities of using either reinforcing or matrix constituents with large negative Poisson's ratios (with values of -1.0 less-than-or-equal-to nu less-than-or-equal-to 0.3).  It is shown that a large negative Poisson's ratio can lead directly to considerably enhanced transverse moduli without altering the longitudinal moduli. For example, changing the matrix Poisson's ratio from 0.3 to -0.9 and keeping all other constituent properties constant produces an almost four-fold increase in the composite transverse modulus.

AB Iron-gallium alloy (galfenol) is a body centered cubic (BCC) magnetostrictive alloy that, like many other BCC metals, is auxetic in the < 110 >{100} directions. For compositions of 12-33 at.% gallium, Poisson ratio (nu) values as low as -0.7 are observed along these directions in response to a uniaxial elastic force (tensile tests, resonant ultrasound spectroscopy, etc.). In 2014, Raghunath and Flatau first reported that galfenol also exhibits positive strain in both these directions when the uniaxial force applied along the < 110 >{100} directions is provided solely by a magnetic field, i.e., with no external mechanical/elastic force or stress being applied to the alloy [Raghunath and Flatau, IEEE Trans. Magn. 50(11), 1-4 (2014)]. The observed response is a result of the intrinsic, atomic-scale, bi-directionally coupled magnetoelastic properties of these alloys. In this paper, we advance the understanding of the intrinsic atomic-scale magnetoelastic coupling of the alloy that leads to the observed magnetoelastic auxetic-like behavior by presenting simulations developed based on density functional theory, which we show match the experimental findings and energy-based simulations. The elastic anisotropy and the electronic mechanisms that lead to magnetoelastic auxetic-like behavior in galfenol are discussed. (C) 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB The drilling-related geomechanics requires a better understanding of the encountered formation properties such as poroelastic parameters. This paper shows set of laboratory results of the dynamic Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, and Biot's coefficient for dry and water-saturated Istebna sandstone samples under a series of confining pressure conditions at two different temperatures. The predicted results from Wyllie's equation were compared to the measured ones in order to show the effect of saturation on the rock weakening. A negative correlation has been identified between Poisson's ratio, Biot's coefficient and confining pressure, while a positive correlation between confining pressure and Young's modulus. The predicted dynamic poroelastic rock properties using the P-wave value from Wyllie's equation are different from measured ones. It shows the important influence of water saturation on rock strength, which is confirmed by unconfined compressive strength measurement. Linear equations have been fitted for the laboratory data and are useful for the analysis of coupled stress and pore pressure effects in geomechanical problems. Such results are useful for many drilling applications especially in evaluation of such cases as wellbore instability and many other drilling problems.

AB Sheets made from easily available conventional non-crystalline materials which contain star or triangular shaped perforations are simulated through FE models and are shown to be capable of exhibiting auxetic behaviour, a property which may be observed for loading in both tension and compression. An attempt is made to explain this behaviour in terms of analytical models based on "rotating rigid triangles" and we also show that through careful choice of the shape and density of the perforations, one may control the magnitude and sign of the Poisson's ratio. All this provides an easy and cost-effective method for the manufacture of systems at any scale which can be tailor made to exhibit particular values of the Poisson's ratio (auxetic or non-auxetic) so as to fit particular practical applications.

AB Macroscopic elastic properties of sintered, randomly packed balloons are estimated for various degrees of sintering and for a wide range of balloon wall thickness. Macroscopic elastic moduli are little affected by a balloon's inner/outer diameter ratio for thicker balloons, while those of thinner balloons are very sensitive to the ratio. The elastic moduli rapidly decline with decreasing wall thickness. They are larger in the direction of gravity than in the horizontal one, corresponding to gravity-affected packing structures. Specific elastic moduli have a peak against porosity. Poisson's ratios are negative in some cases of very thin balloon walls and very low sintering degree. Comparison of the present random packing with the regular simple cubic packing reveals that there is a significant difference between them in their elastic properties and their structures of anisotropy, although both have almost the same coordination number.

ID NEGATIVE POISSONS RATIO; BEHAVIOR; MODULUS
AB This paper illustrates various dynamic characteristics of open cell compliant polyurethane foam with auxetic (negative Poisson's ratio) behaviour. The foam is obtained from off-the-shelf open cell polyurethane grey foam with a manufacturing process based on mechanical deformation on a mould in a temperature-controlled oven. The Poisson's ratio is measured with an image processing technique based on edge detection with wavelet methods. Foam samples have been tested in a viscoelastic analyser tensile test machine to determine the Young's modulus and loss factor for small dynamic strains. The same samples have also been tested in an acoustic impedance tube to measure acoustic absorption and specific acoustic resistance and reactance with a transmissibility technique. Another set of tests has been set up on a cam plastometer machine for constant strain rate dynamic crushing analysis. All the tests have been carried out on auxetic and normal foam samples to provide a comparison between the two types of cellular solids. The results from the experimental tests are discussed and interpreted using microstructure models for cellular materials existing in the literature. The negative Poisson's ratio foam presented in this paper shows an overall superiority regarding damping and acoustic properties compared to the original conventional foam. Its dynamic crushing performance is also significantly superior to the normal foam, suggesting a possible use in structural integrity compliant elements.

AB In recent years, various auxetic material structures have been designed and fabricated for diverse applications that utilize normal materials that follow Hooke's law but still show the properties of negative Poisson's ratios (NPR). One potential application is body protection pads that are comfortable to wear and effective in protecting body parts by reducing impact force and preventing injuries in high-risk individuals such as elderly people, industrial workers, law enforcement and military personnel, and athletes. This paper reports an integrated theoretical, computational, and experimental investigation conducted for typical auxetic materials that exhibit NPR properties. Parametric 3D CAD models of auxetic structures such as re-entrant hexagonal cells and arrowheads were developed. Then, key structural characteristics of protection pads were evaluated through static analyses of FEA models. Finally, impact analyses were conducted through dynamic simulations of FEA models to validate the results obtained from the static analyses. Efforts were also made to relate the individual and/or combined effect of auxetic structures and materials to the overall stiffness and shock-absorption performance of the protection pads. An advanced additive manufacturing (3D printing) technique was used to build prototypes of the auxetic structures. Three different materials typically used for fused deposition modeling technology, namely polylactic acid (PLA) and thermoplastic polyurethane material (NinjaFlex (R) and SemiFlex (R)), were used for different stiffness and shock-absorption properties. The 3D printed prototypes were then tested and the results were compared to the computational predictions. The results showed that the auxetic material could be effective in reducing the shock forces. Each structure and material combination demonstrated unique structural properties such as stiffness, Poisson's ratio, and efficiency in shock absorption. Auxetic structures showed better shock absorption performance than non-auxetic ones. The mechanism for ideal input force distribution or shunting could be suggested for designing protectors using various shapes, thicknesses, and materials of auxetic materials to reduce the risk of injury.

AB This study presents an evaluation of the mechanical behaviour of low porosity, ductile auxetic structures.
   Using time-averaged speckle interferometry and a specific experimental set-up, the eigenmodes and displacement fields of three low-porosity metallic auxetic samples were assessed and compared with the numerical simulations obtained using the commercial software Abaqus/Standard (Simulia Providence, RI).
   Guided by the finite element predictions, the eigenmode analysis was carried out by vibrating the specimens-each characterized by a different pore geometry-from 100 Hz to about 10 kHz analysing the structural response. A good agreement between the numerical calculations and the experimental results was found. This study not only validates the numerical-experimental approach used to analyse materials, but also to open a way to test and validate the performances of negative Poisson's ratio structures and meta-materials in general applications.
   Furthermore, the findings of this work provides a new convincing and reliable experimental data, enlarge the knowledge about the elastic instabilities in metallic auxetic structures, supporting their use in critical applications.

AB Door system plays a very important role in the domain of automobile passive safety. In order to improve its side crashworthiness, some affiliated impact components are assembled. Conventional impact parts can make the door system possess enough stiffness and strength so as to ensure the integrity of car body when side collision occurs. But for occupant protection, the excessive rigidity may increase the risk of occupant injury. To address this problem, this work first introduces a kind of negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) structure, and proposes a novel door system which is composed of NPR energy-absorbing block, NPR impact beam, inner panel, outer panel, and reinforcing plate. Next, parameter sensitivity analysis for each performance index is conducted to determine the corresponding variables when constructing the approximate model. Then, aiming at the disadvantages of the Technology for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) and the Mean Square Deviation Method (MSDM) in processing performance index data, a novel integrated weighting method is used to determine the weighting coefficient of each performance index. Finally, considering side structural crashworthiness, occupant protection, and lightweight, the hierarchical optimization for the novel door system is conducted to further enhance its overall performance. The result demonstrates that compared with the conventional door, the optimal door can improve the performance of occupant protection and ensure the side crashworthiness more effectively.

AB Auxetic materials exhibit the unexpected feature of becoming fatter when stretched and narrower when compressed, in other words, they exhibit a negative Poisson's ratio. This counter-intuitive behaviour imparts many beneficial effects on the material's macroscopic properties that make auxetics superior to conventional materials in many commercial applications. Recent research suggests that auxetic behaviour generally results from a cooperative effect between the material's internal structure (geometry setup) and the deformation mechanism it undergoes when submitted to a stress. Auxetic behaviour is also known to be scale-independent, and thus, the same geometry/deformation mechanism may operate at the macro-, micro- and nano- (molecular) level. A considerable amount of research has been focused on the 're-entrant honeycomb structure' which exhibits auxetic behaviour if deformed through hinging at the joints or flexure of the ribs, and it was proposed that this 're-entrant' geometry plays an important role in generating auxetic behaviour in various forms of materials ranging from nanostructured polymers to foams. This paper discusses an alternative mode of deformation involving 'rotating rigid units' which also results in negative Poisson's ratios. In its most ideal form, this mechanism may be constructed in two dimensions using 'rigid polygons' connected together through hinges at their vertices. On application of uniaxial loads, these 'rigid polygons' rotate with respect to each other to form a more open structure hence giving rise to a negative Poisson's ratio. This paper also discusses the role that,rotating rigid units' are thought to have in various classes of materials to give rise to negative Poisson's ratios. (c) 2005 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH A Co.

ID NEGATIVE POISSONS RATIO; LIQUID-CRYSTALLINE POLYMER; BEHAVIOR
AB Auxetic materials are those which exhibit negative Poisson's ratio, i.e. these solids expand transversely when stretched longitudinally. In recent years the concept of semi-auxetics has been examined for cellular solids based on combination of re-entrant and hexagonal microstructures. In this paper we identify a type of rotating unit that gives positive Poisson's ratio so that a study can be made on rotating sub-structures that exhibit both positive and negative Poisson's ratio characteristics. A second type of rotating geometry, whose Poisson's ratio shifts from negative to positive as stretching increases, has also been identified. Based on kinematical studies we explore the relationship between the on-axis Poisson's ratios in terms of novel lattice geometry and the magnitude of deformation.

AB Developments in design and technology in the engineering and medical fields necessitate the use of smart and high-performance materials to meet higher engineering specifications. The general requirements of such materials include a combination of high stiffness and strength with significant weight savings, resistance to corrosion, chemical resistance, low maintenance, and reduced costs. Over the last three decades, it has been demonstrated that auxetic materials offer a huge potential for the fields of engineering, natural sciences, and biomedical engineering, and for many other industries, including the aerospace and defense industries, through their unique deformation mechanism and measured enhancements in mechanical properties. To meet future engineering challenges, auxetic materials are increasingly being recognized as integral components of smart and advanced materials. Although materials with a negative Poisson's ratio have been known since the early 1900s, they did not capture researchers' attention until the late 1980s. Since 1991, these materials have been known as auxetic materials. Since then, their benefits and applications have been expanded to all major classes of materials such as metals, ceramics, polymers, and composites, and they are also now being used in engineering applications. The goal of this review was to present the development of auxetic polymers, which were first fabricated in the form of polyurethane foam approximately three decades ago and are now used in the fabrication of non-woven nano/micropolymeric structures. This review could provide useful information for the future development of auxetic polymers.

AB A novel 2D cellular structure achieved by alternating rectangular surface indents on the vertical ribs of the unit cells was designed. And the Poisson's ratios of several structures were determined using the finite element method(FEM) as a function of geometric parameters. The simulation results showed that the Poisson's ratio of the 2D cellular structure was sensitive to the cell dimensional ratio, and the value can be tuned from positive to negative(the minimum can reach -1.05). Samples with identical geometric variables were fabricated via 3D printing, and their Poisson's ratios were measured and compared with the ones from simulation. Excellent agreement was found between the experimental results and the simulation. The stiffness of the model can be higher than honeycomb made of regular hexagons with appropriate geometric parameters.

AB Auxetic structures, due to their negative Poisson's ratios, should have a positive effect on the comfort of using seating furniture. The aim of this study was to develop numerical models of auxetic compression springs suitable for seat structures of office and home furniture. Analyses were conducted on real and numerical models of different spring structures having concave cell walls, subjected to uniaxial compression. By changing the modulus of elasticity for the material of the frame and geometry of the internal structure non-linear characteristics of rigidity and negative Poisson's ratios were established for designed springs. Based on numerical calculations structures best adapted to provide functionality for to the seats of resting and work furniture were identified. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Hydrogenation is a viable approach in transforming two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets into three-dimensional (3D) nanoarchitectures. The present work reported self-folding of 2D graphene into 3D graphene Miura origami assisted by hydrogenation, and studied its Poisson's ratio under external strain using molecular dynamics simulation and continuum modeling. It was found that the graphene Miura origami possesses negative Poisson's ratio, being largely insensitive to the chirality of the folding creases and side lengths of the constituting parallelograms. We further demonstrated the good agreement of Poisson's ratio between the continuum prediction and MD simulation, and identified the origin of their deviation as localized stress concentration at the quad-junction of the graphene Miura origami. The present study provides insights into designing novel 3D nanoarchitectures of programmable functionalities from 2D nanomaterials.

AB We show that under tension a classical many-body system with only isotropic pair interactions in a crystalline state can, counterintuitively, have a negative Poisson's ratio, or auxetic behavior. We derive the conditions under which the triangular lattice in two dimensions and lattices with cubic symmetry in three dimensions exhibit a negative Poisson's ratio. In the former case, the simple Lennard-Jones potential can give rise to auxetic behavior. In the latter case, a negative Poisson's ratio can be exhibited even when the material is constrained to be elastically isotropic.

AB In order to study the deformation behavior of double arrowhead (DAH) auxetic metamaterials under different forces with different directions as well as the effects of the geometry parameters on the Poisson's ratio, this paper assembled an advanced researching method by combining the industrial design of SolidWorks software, the finite element analysis of Abaqus software and three-dimensional printed technology. Results show that the DAH structure expanded in the direction perpendicular to the force first and contracted with the strain increasing when it was pulled by the uniaxial force, no matter which direction the force is applied. Besides, the auxetic effect of the DAH structure under the tensile force in the X direction is longer than that under the tensile force in the Y direction. It is more resistant to compression when the DAH structure is subjected to transverse tensile forces than when it is subjected to longitudinal tensile forces. The angle of the V-shaped short truss has a significant impact on the negative Poisson's ratio of the DAH structure, while the angle of the V-shaped long truss angle has little influence on its auxetic performance. Specifically, the smaller the angles, the better the auxetic effect.

AB The dynamic response of cylindrical sandwich panels with aluminum foam core, hexagonal honeycomb core, and auxetic honeycomb core are compared numerically. A novel curved auxetic honeycomb core is designed, and the finite element models are built by employing ABAQUS-Explicit. To calibrate the numerical models, the experiments of sandwich panels with honeycomb core and aluminum foam cores are modeled. And the numerical results have a good agreement with the experiment date. The calibrated numerical models are used to simulate the dynamic response of cylindrical panels subject to external blast loadings. It is found that the cylindrical panels with auxetic honeycomb cores have a better performance than that with aluminum foam cores and hexagonal honeycomb cores in resisting blast loadings. A material concentration effect was observed in the auxetic honeycomb core due to the negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) effect. According to parameter studies, it is concluded that with the increase of curvature and face sheet thickness the blast-resistance of panels with both auxetic honeycomb core, hexagonal honeycomb core, and foam cores increased obviously, especially the panels with auxetic honeycomb cores. For the panels with auxetic honeycomb cores, increasing the back face sheet thickness can improve the blast-resistance performance more efficiently than increasing the thickness of front face sheet, which is opposite for the panels with foam cores and hexagonal honeycomb cores. Auxetic cores with a smaller unit cell aspect ratio and a smaller unit cell length ratio has a larger Poisson's ratio, and achieves better blast resistance performance. These simulation findings can guide well the theoretical study and optimal design of cylindrical sandwich structures subject to external blast loading. (C) 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB Auxetic foams have a variety of unique properties due to their negative Poisson ratio such as high energy absorption and fracture toughness for applications such as sports safety equipment, packing material, and shoe soles. The viscoelastic behavior of this relatively new material has not been extensively studied and modeled. Better knowledge of the viscoelastic behavior over a broad range of deformation rates is critical when considering the mechanical properties of the material. Previous modeling for positive Poisson ratio materials has been completed successfully to characterize the behavior. This same modeling was applied to auxetic foams with less success. The influence of nonlinear compressibility effects greatly improved calibration and prediction. Model simulations across several orders of magnitude in deformation rates are validated against data. All results are statistically validated using maximum entropy methods to obtain posterior densities for the hyperelastic and fractional order parameters. Importantly, a maximum entropy algorithm is used such that heterogeneous data can be fused to inform and validate the model and quantify its uncertainty.

AB Auxetic structures and materials expand laterally when stretched. It has been argued that this property could be applied in the design of smart filters with tunable sieving properties. This work analyses the filtration properties of a class of auxetic structures which achieve their auxeticity through a rotating rigid unit mechanism, an archetypal mechanism known to be responsible for this behavior in a number of crystalline materials. In particular, mathematical expressions are derived for the space coverage of networks constructed from a variety of quadrilaterals, as well as the pore radius. The latter is indicative of the particle size that can pass through when the particle dimension is comparable to the pore size, whereas the space coverage is indicative of the rate of flow when the particles are of a much smaller dimension than the pore size. The expressions suggest that these systems offer a wide range of pore sizes and space coverages, both of which can be controlled through the way that the units are connected to each other, their shape and the angle between them.

AB Meta-biomaterials offer a promising route towards the development of life-lasting implants. The concept aims to achieve solutions that are ordinarily impossible, by offering a unique combination of mechanical, mass transport, and biological properties through the optimization of their small-scale geometrical and topological designs. In this study, we primarily focus on auxetic meta-biomaterials that have the extraordinary ability to expand in response to axial tension. This could potentially improve the longstanding problem of implant loosening, if their performance can be guaranteed in cyclically loaded conditions. The high-cycle fatigue performance of additively manufactured (AM) auxetic meta-biomaterials made from commercially pure titanium (CP-Ti) was therefore studied. Small variations in the geometry of the reentrant hexagonal honeycomb unit cell and its relative density resulted in twelve different designs (relative density: similar to 5-45%, re-entrant angle = 10-25 degrees, Poisson's ratio = -0.076 to -0.504). Micro-computed tomography, scanning electron microscopy and mechanical testing were used to respectively measure the morphological and quasi-static properties of the specimens before proceeding with compression-compression fatigue testing. These auxetic meta-biomaterials exhibited morphological and mechanical properties that are deemed appropriate for bone implant applications (elastic modulus = 66.3-5648 MPa, yield strength = 1.4-46.7 MPa, pore size = 1.3-2.7 mm). With an average maximum stress level of 0.47 sigma(y) at 10(6) cycles (range: 0.35 sigma(y)sigma(y) - 0.82 sigma(y)sigma(y)), the auxetic structures characterized here are superior to many other non-auxetic meta-biomaterials made from the same material. The optimization of the printing process and the potential application of post-processing treatments could improve their performance in cyclically loaded settings even further.
   Statement of Significance
   Auxetic meta-biomaterials have a negative Poisson's ratio and, therefore, expand laterally in response to axial tension. Recently, they have been found to restore bone-implant contact along the lateral side of a hip stem. As a result, the bone will be compressed along both of the implant's contact lines, thereby actively reducing the risk of implant failure. In this case the material will be subjected to cyclic loading, for which no experimental data has been reported yet. Here, we present the first ever study of the fatigue performance of additively manufactured auxetic meta-biomaterials based on the re-entrant hexagonal honeycomb. These results will advance the adoption of auxetic meta-biomaterials in load-bearing applications, such as the hip stem, to potentially improve implant longevity. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

AB Implications of the negative Poisson ratio with regard to the quasi-static and dynamic indentation compliances for isotropic homogeneous materials are considered. It has been shown that analogously to some solutions for three-dimensional stress or displacement fields concentrations, the indentation, vibrational, and impact compliances are significantly affected when Poisson's ratio of the material assumes negative values. It was observed that the friction at the contact interface between the indenter and the surface of an elastic medium strengthens the negative Poisson ratio effect. In the Hertzian contact problem, it was found out that the location of the maximum shear stress approaches the contact interface as Poisson's ratio is made sufficiently negative. In view of this fact, the local indentation of a coated elastic half-space, which is reinforced with an elastic plate, has been considered. It was shown that the reinforcement preserves the negative Poisson ratio effect, and the perfect bonding of the plate to the surface of an auxetic half-space significantly strengthens it. This theoretical work be considered as a first step towards an indentation and impact analysis of real auxetic materials. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We propose compliant cellular material (CCM), a mechanical metamaterial, with compliant porous structure (CPS) generated from a modified hexagonal topology. The objective of this study is to explore the synthesis of three-dimensional (3D) CCMs with CPSes and to understand the mechanical behaviors of CCMs. An orthotropic constitutive model of CCMs is constructed using the strain energy method, which uses the deformation of hinges around holes and rotation of links. Nonlinear behavior of a finite element (FE) based simulation is conducted to validate the analytical model. The moduli and yield strains of the 3D CCMs with an aluminum alloy are about 1.2 GPa and 0.4% in the longitudinal direction and about 0.08 MPa and 30% in the lateral direction. The CCMs have extremely high positive and negative Poisson's ratios (v(xy)* similar to +/- 30) due to the large rotation of the link member in the transverse direction caused by an input displacement in the longitudinal direction. This paper demonstrates that compliant mesostructures can be used for next generation's mechanical metamaterials design in tailoring mechanical properties such as modulus, strength, yield strain, and Poisson's ratios.

AB We describe here a heat-compression protocol used on needle-punched commercial nonwoven fabrics which induces an out-of-plane auxetic response in these treated fabrics. The as-received samples, however, are not auxetic and show a decrease in thickness when stretched uniaxially. Using micro-CT imaging it was found that the vertical fiber bundles/columns, produced in the needle punching step of fabric manufacture, are tilted and buckled as a result of the heat-compression treatment. It is suggested that it is likely the reorientation of these columns during subsequent uniaxial strain that drives thickness increase (auxetic response).

ID NEGATIVE POISSONS RATIO; OPEN-CELL FOAMS; TRANSFORMATION
AB In theory, a negative Poisson's ratio (i.e. auxetie) material has improved hardness, impact resistance, fracture toughness, and shear modulus over one with a positive Poisson's ratio and comparable stiffness. These enhanced properties make them attractive candidates for a wide range of applications, including ones in the biomedical industry. Over the past two decades there has been increasing interest in auxetie materials leading to the discovery and development of new auxetic materials at the micro- and macro-scales. It has been reported in the literature that some human trabecular bone is auxetic; however verification of this claim and measurement of the,Poisson's ratio of biological materials remains a challenge. This research need is the motivation for the current work.
   The central research objective of this project is to develop an approach to gain fundamental insight into the geometric characteristics of auxetic open cell materials by studying the underpinning mechanics behind the transition from positive to negative Poisson's ratio that takes place when open-cell foam is compressed and heat treated. The approach involves detailed image analysis and finite element modeling of the microstructure of polyurethane foam, which is commonly used as a test material to model the structure of human cancellous bone. By studying both conventional and auxetie foam, and the process by which conventional foams are transformed to auxetic, we seek to identify the critical features of auxetic open-cell structures. The results will lead to a better understanding of auxetic cellular materials in general, and will be used to develop a framework for use in determining the mechanical properties and potential auxeticity of human trabecular bone and to aid in the design of synthetic auxetic biomaterials. In this paper we report on preliminary results of our modeling efforts.

AB In this paper, a work to improve to the auxetic re-entrant cell is reported. This work aims to conserve the negative or zero Poisson?s ratio feature of the classical re-entrant cell with no degradation while amplifying the in-plane elastic moduli. To develop and control the stiffness of the cell a new cell was created using a circular wall element in the middle of the classical re-entrant cell. The analytical expressions of the new re-entrant cell were derived and validated by finite element models. Derived analytical expressions of this work can be used to model the classical cell. Using this feature, validation of analytical and numerical models of this work is also provided with a classical cell?s experimental works reported in the literature. In the linear region, both the analytical and the finite element models match very closely with the literature experiments. Because of the highly non-linearity of the re-entrant structures, after the linear examination, this work was expanded to model the non-linear behaviour of both the classical and new cells numerically. Literature experiments also verify the non-linear finite element models of this work in means of the classical re-entrant cell?s results. Detailed design graphs are given for tuning the rigidity and negative Poisson?s ratios. The presented new design in this paper grants an extra rigidity while providing the same negative Poisson?s ratios with those of the classical cells.

AB There are now different kinds of geometrical models for auxetic materials, such as re-entrant model, rotating model, nodule and fibril model, chiral model, liquid crystalline model, helical model and rod model for describing the angle-ply composites. Knitting technology, including plane and 3D warp knitting as well as weft knitting, is widely used in the manufacturing fields nowadays and has been adopted in fabric structure designing. Knitted fabrics with negative Poisson's ratio have great potentials in both apparel and industries. The present article reviews the auxetic principles in general and in the specific context of knitted textile structures with auxetic potential made from conventional fibers.

AB We review the results obtained for the 2D microscopic model of crystal having finite size particles proposed by Ishibashi and Iwata and later generalized in order to take into account deformability of particles. We focus on the elastic properties of the discrete model and also discuss various continuum analogues to the model, including the multifield continuum approximation. Several new results are reported, e.g., we describe the conditions of thermodynamic stability of the model and study the variation of Poisson ratio of the model as the function of model parameters in single-crystal and poly-crystal states. The role of the rotational degrees of freedom pertaining to the finite size particles is highlighted. Particularly we demonstrate that the microscopic rotations are responsible for auxetic behavior (i.e., exhibiting negative Poisson ratio) of the macroscopically isotropic poly-crystal.

AB Double-arrowed auxetic (DAA) structures with a negative Poisson's ratio have recently drawn increasing attention. This paper deduces the empirical formula of critical impact velocity to characterize the deformation modes of the DAA structures in two in-plane directions. A method is proposed to construct a theoretical model for predicting the dynamic crushing strength of DAA structure. The theoretical model is validated by numerical results to be sufficiently accurate to predict the dynamic crushing strength. It is also found that the dynamic crushing strength is only related to the relative density and impact velocity. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In recent years, as the development of additive manufacturing technology, 3D negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) materials attract many researchers' interest. In this paper, a novel 3D NPR material design method based on the tension-twist coupling effect has been proposed. A novel category of 3D NPR and positive Poisson's ratio (PPR) materials by linking multilayer 2D NPR materials through 3D chiral chains are proposed. The sign of the Poisson's ratio depends on the linkage pattern of the 3D chiral chain. Based on this method, 11 types of novel 3D NPR and PPR materials are presented. Experimental and numerical methods are adopted to study the mechanical properties of the proposed novel 3D NPR and PPR materials. Results show that the novel 3D materials present desirable NPR and PPR as we expected, which proved the effectiveness of the proposed design method.

ID AUXETIC MATERIALS
AB This article presents innovative work undertaken to evaluate the auxetic composite materials developed using weft-knitted fabrics with negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) produced from high-tenacity filaments of para-aramid (p-AR) and polyamide. The aim of this study is to develop polymeric composite materials reinforced with auxetic knitted fabrics and to evaluate the degree of transference of the auxetic behavior from the fibrous reinforcement to the composite produced. The results show that the NPR values remained in the composites. Regardless of the type of resin used, either epoxy or polyester, the highest values were obtained for samples produced with p-AR auxetic knitted fabrics. The NPR composites developed within this work present great potential for applications in industrial areas, including personal protection products, such as bulletproof vests, helmets, knee, and elbow protectors, and in all other areas where energy absorption is a key factor to be considered.

AB So far, negative Poisson's ratio foam (auxetic foam) is usually prepared by the transformation of conventional polymer foam, and it is a challenge to prepare auxetic foam directly from polymer resin. In this work, a novel method based on the synergism between the phase transition of water and the permeability rate difference of the CO2 blowing agent from air in the foaming process is put forward to prepare auxetic foam directly from the polymer resin. Using this method, herein, nylon elastomer (NE) foam with auxetic behavior is successfully prepared from NE resin by a one-pot CO2 foaming method inside an autoclave aided by water; the obtained auxetic foam has a Poisson's ratio value of -1.29 and has excellent tensile cycle stability and energy absorption performance. This method breaks through the bottleneck for preparing auxetic foams from the polymer resin directly, which is also green and environment-friendly. It is believed that the abovementioned method also applies to other thermoplastic polymers, which paves a way for designing and preparing multifunctional auxetic foam materials in the future via a one-pot CO2 foaming process. Furthermore, this work first demonstrates that the transformation between auxetic foam and positive Poisson's ratio foam is reversible due to the closed cell structure, which provides an opportunity to reversibly adjust the performance and the shape of polymer foam materials.

Polyurethane was synthesized and fabricated after changing the cellular structure of the foam using two methods. Scanning electron microscopy showed that the cellular structure was a more concave structure than in control foam. The Poisson's ratio of the experimental foam was negative. The average range of the Poisson's ratio was -3.4 similar to 0, versus 0.3 similar to 1.3 for the control foam.

ID RECTANGULAR PLATE; CIRCULAR PLATES; FREQUENCIES
AB Vibration study is of great practical importance, as vibration of continuous systems with constraints implies cyclic stresses and the inevitable fatigue damage. This chapter on vibration forms the first part of elastodynamics of auxetic solids, with special emphasis on plates (both circular and rectangular) as well as shells (both cylindrical and spherical). For circular plates with free and simply supported edges, the frequency parameter changes more rapidly in the auxetic region than in the conventional region; consequently the natural vibration frequencies of these plates can be effectively reduced by choosing auxetic materials. For rectangular plates, the effect of negative Poisson's ratio is evaluated for plates with all four sides and two sides being simply supported, as well as examples of rectangular plates with three sides being simply supported. In the case of cylindrical shells with simply supported edges, the results of frequency study imply that, when expressed in terms of flexural rigidity, the frequency is independent from the cylindrical shell radius at extreme auxetic behavior for isotropic case. In the case of spherical isotropic shells, the natural frequency diminishes as the Poisson's ratio of the shell material approaches 1 at constant flexural rigidity and at constant shear modulus. Finally, advanced topics on vibration damping, vibration transmissibility and acoustics of auxetic solids and structures are briefly reviewed.

AB Materials with a negative Poisson's ratio have been modelled largely by regular 2D networks. These models represent the conceptual features of the microscale of materials with a negative Poisson's ratio. To date they do not reflect the detail or exact structure of any known auxetic material. In this paper, 2D materials have been constructed whose microstructure is represented exactly by the auxetic models. These materials are subjected to an axial strain and the measured Poisson's ratio is compared to the predictions by the models. The models are also amended to fit better the observed deformation within the 2D materials. The models are found to predict some behaviour reasonably well but only when model parameters are measured from the experimental data. (c) 2005 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The occurrence of the NPR is directly caused by the fact that the decrease of Se-Se bond is larger than the increase of Se-Pd-Se bond when compressing the lattice along the x-direction. Our calculations exhibit that the electronic locality of Se-Se bond is strong and the orbit of the Se atom in the Se-Se bond has changed significantly. Consequently, our calculated results indicate that monolayer PdSe2 will have many potential applications in nanoelectronics and microelectromechanical devices.

AB Although most materials used in practice possess positive Poisson's ratio in the range 0 to 1/2, there has been increasing number of auxetic materials being developed and investigated. The counter-intuitive property of auxetic materials opens up the possibility of solids and structures that behave in ways that have been overlooked in the past but are nevertheless consistent with physical laws. This article investigates how the auxeticity of a plate material influences the stresses and moments arising from lateral loads. Using classical plate theories, the optimal Poisson's ratio of simply supported rectangular plates under lateral loads are obtained on the basis of (a) stress minimization from the maximum bending and shearing stresses, and (b) moment minimization from the maximum bending and twisting moments. Results from stress minimization shows that the optimal Poisson's ratio is strongly influenced by the relative plate thickness and plate aspect ratio. Using the example of a simply supported rectangular plate under sinusoidal load, the optimal Poisson's ratio becomes more negative for higher aspect ratio. In addition, the optimal Poisson's ratio becomes more negative, until a limit of -1 is reached, for decreasing relative plate thickness. Results from moment minimization reveal that the optimal Poisson's ratio is strongly influenced by the load distribution. For a square plate, the optimal Poisson's ratio is a negative value if the load distribution is more concentrated than a sinusoidal load or if the central square patch of uniform load takes up less than 43% of the plate area. These results suggest the usefulness of auxetic materials for lowering the stresses and moments in rectangular plates under most loading conditions.

AB In aerospace applications, variations of temperature caused by changing environmental conditions or generation of heat is a common problem. The resulting thermal strains cause separation and alignment errors in optical systems, and stresses due to mismatches of thermal expansion at material interfaces cause failure of components and structures. Because minimizing weight, cost, and lead time are also critical requirements, lightweight, easily machined metals are attractive for aerospace applications, but these materials all have substantial coefficients of thermal expansion. Previous work has shown that the superposition of two metals with dissimilar coefficients of thermal expansion in periodic cellular configurations can result in a composite material with zero effective thermal expansion. However, fabrication of these material architectures typically is either impossible or requires manual assembly. Here, we propose methods to design and fabricate cellular metal composites with tunable thermal expansion and optimized specific stiffness that can be manufactured at useful scales entirely with automated methods. Samples were manufactured with ultrasonic additive manufacturing and computer-controlled machining, and thermal expansion was measured optically. The results demonstrate the practical fabrication of cellular metal composites with zero or negative thermal expansion in one direction, tunable thermal expansion in a second direction, and structural performance indices competitive with the indices of conventional aerospace alloys.

Phys. 98, 053508 (2005)] for single crystals of the orthorhombic aluminosilicate zeolite NAT (natrolite, Na-2(Al2Si3O10)2H(2)O, Fdd2) throw valuable light on the potential of NAT as a material which exhibits single crystalline negative Poisson's ratios (auxetic). On performing an off-axis analysis of these elastic constants we confirm that the zeolite natrolite exhibits auxetic behavior in the (001) plane. This supports our preliminary report that NAT-type zeolites exhibit auxetic behavior through a mechanism involving microscopic rotation of semi-rigid structural units.

AB Hard homonuclear dimers, each consisting of two identical and tangent hard disks, exhibit a thermodynamically stable, aperiodic solid phase, known as a degenerate crystal. The elastic properties of this phase are determined by the box fluctuation Monte Carlo method in the NpT ensemble. The computed elastic constants are well described by the free volume approximation and the coefficients of the leading singularities are estimated in the close packing limit. Three mechanisms decreasing Poisson's ratio are indicated: one is based on increasing the pressure to temperature ratio, another comes from the constrains imposed on the disks forming a dimer, yet another, working in the close packing limit, arises from molecular motions. It is also shown that Poisson's ratio increases with increasing concentration of vacancies. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Graphene aerogel (GA) is a promising candidate for energy absorption purposes because of its very low density, high specific surface area and porous structure. GA samples, prepared by the Sol-Gel method, were tested under quasi-static compression, and characterized via surface area analyzer, as well as scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The results show that 98% (and above) porous GA samples, whose elastic modulus is 2.9 MPa, can support at least 35,000 times its weight. Scaling analysis shows that the mechanical properties of GA are superior to those of conventional polymeric open-cell foams. The GA samples exhibit a negative structural Poisson's ratio under the uniaxial compression test, which is most likely due to the bread-like microstructural evolution. Due to the mesopores of the GA sample as well as the negative structural Poisson's ratio, the GA has considerable toughness.

AB While the rule of mixture is applicable for addressing the overall Poisson's ratio of a concentrically aligned bi-layered rod under longitudinal loading, the same cannot be said for this rod under torsional loading due to the higher extent of deformation in the rod material further away from the torsional axis. In addition, the use of adhesives for attaching the solid inner rod to the hollow outer rod introduces an intermediate layer, thereby resulting in a tri-layered concentric rod if the adhesive layer is uniformly distributed. This paper investigates the effect of the adhesive properties on the overall auxeticity of a rod consisting of two concentrically aligned cylindrical isotropic foams with Poisson's ratio of opposite signs under torsional loads. An indirect way for obtaining Poisson's ratio of a concentrically tri-layered rod was obtained using a mechanics of materials approach. Results show that the auxeticity of such rods is influenced by the adhesive's stiffness, Poisson's ratio, thickness, and radius from the torsional axis.

AB The mechanical behavior of a two-dimensional structure with negative Poisson` s ratio (auxetic structure) was experimentally studied. The concave hexagon (re-entrant honeycomb) with straight sides is often an element of auxetic structures. In this paper, a new design of a concave hexagon in which a part of straight elements is replaced with curvilinear elements is suggested. The sample (110 x 20 x 0.7 mm plate with the central part of 26.2 x 20 x 0.7 mm) was made by the laser cutting method from nonauxetic polyethyleneterephthalate (PET-a amorphous) plates. The transverse size of elements of hexagons is equal to sample thickness. The sample was subjected to a monotonous uniaxial tension until the last moment when it still maintained its planarity. As a result of experimental data processing the tensile force - displacement diagram was calculated. Variability of Poisson` s ratio depending on engineering deformations was studied. The analysis showed that auxetic structure at tension attained the maximum longitudinal deformation (before loss of stability) of 99 %, and the maximum transverse deformation of 59 %. Elastic deformations reached 2 %. Poisson's ratio defined by analogy with elastic small deformations varies in the range from -0.19 to -0.60 with an increase of longitudinal and transverse deformations.

AB Many models describing the deformation of general foam or auxetic materials are based on the assumption of homogeneity and order within the materials. However, non-uniform heterogeneity is often an inherent nature in many porous materials and composites, but difficult to measure. In this work, inspired by the structures of auxetic materials, the porous PVA hydrogels with internal inby-concave pores (IICP) or interconnected pores (ICP) were designed and processed. The deformation of the PVA hydrogels under compression was tested and their Poisson's ratio was characterized. The results indicated that the size, shape and distribution of the pores in the hydrogel matrix had strong influence on the local Poisson's ratio, which varying from positive to negative at micro-scale. The size-dependency of their local Poisson's ratio reflected and quantified the uniformity and heterogeneity of the micro-porous structures in the PVA hydrogels. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Jounce bumpers in automotive suspension can absorb impact energy and improve Noise, Vibration and Harshness (NVH) performance of entire vehicle. In this paper, a negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) structure was introduced and applied on the jounce bumper. The NPR jounce bumper can be primarily described by few parameters and is convenient for design, analysis and optimization. Three NPR jounce bumper prototypes were manufactured and tested. The test results of prototype 1 indicated that the NPR jounce bumpers had excellent viscoelasticity characteristic to absorb impact energy owing to its high damping. Compared with traditional jounce bumper, the NPR jounce bumper can achieve similar mechanical behavior but with a smoother load-displacement curve, which is beneficial to the NVH performance. Moreover, numerical calculation was conducted. Its results were fairly reliable for the prediction of mechanical behavior of NPR jounce bumper. The numerical results implied the stress concentration areas and the displacement of failure. The deformation shapes of NPR jounce bumper were also discussed. Finally, prototypes 2 and 3 manufactured from 3D printing technology were tested to explore the possibility of the application of 3D printing technology on NPR structures. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Anisotropic elasticity drives negative thermal expansion in
   monocrystalline SnSe
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
LA English
DT Article
AB Negative thermal expansion (NTE) materials have been at the center of attention for the past few decades as thermal expansion compensators in the fields of engineering, photonics, electronics, and medicine. Numerous crystalline materials exhibit NTE, wherein a combination of positive and negative linear thermal expansion coefficients results from their highly anisotropic elasticity. In this study, we selected SnSe, an anisotropic uniaxial NTE material as a model system where theoretical studies have linked its NTE along the c direction to transverse phonons and to positive Gruneisen parameters along all crystallographic axes. However, the fundamental origin of NTE in SnSe have not been experimentally resolved. Here we performed temperature-dependent resonant ultrasound spectroscopy (between 295-773 K) on single-crystalline SnSe to experimentally measure all nine independent elastic constants (C-11, C-22, C-33, C-44, C-55, C-66, C-12, C-13, C-23). Our data revealed a high degree of anisotropy in the temperature-dependent elastic constants with shear anisotropic factors show a contrasting pattern with increasing temperature. From this data we also deduced its material compressibility and negative Poisson's ratios in the major crystallographic directions that could explain its colossal linear thermal expansion coefficient along the c direction, reaching similar to-12 x 10(-5) K-1 at 773 K as reported in this study. Furthermore, we confirmed positive Gruneisen parameters along all the crystallographic axes and observe that SnSe behaves like a semicompressible parallelepiped with elastically coupled a and b axes, with the NTE being driven by the displacement of Sn atoms in the c direction.

ID POISSONS RATIO; BEHAVIOR
AB This paper deals with the auxetic deformation behavior of periodically perforated aluminum sheets and their application for lightweight design. If commercially available metal sheets are provided with perforations, this can significantly change the mechanical properties of the sheets. For example, with certain perforation patterns, it is possible to achieve a negative Poisson's ratio in the sheet plane. Such material behavior is called auxetic. Macroscopic auxetic behavior can be explained by mechanisms that are based on the geometry of the perforation. Sheets are made of an isotropic aluminum alloy, provided with periodic perforation patterns and are mechanically characterized in tensile tests. The investigations focus on an exemplarily pattern with rectangular perforations leading to the auxetic behavior of the sheet. By means of passive thermography, highly stressed areas of the samples can be identified in situ and nondestructively during tests. The experimental results are verified in numerical simulations. The insights gained will help to better understand the mechanisms underlying the mechanical behavior of auxetically perforated sheet metal. Based on this, concepts for possible applications of auxetically perforated sheets in lightweight design can be developed for the future.

TI Auxetic honeycombs with lossy polymeric infills for high damping

SO JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT MATERIAL SYSTEMS AND STRUCTURES
LA English
DT Article
DE Auxetic; honeycombs; polymeric infills; damping
ID FOAM
AB Structural grade materials with Young's Modulus in the gigapascal range generally have very low damping, leading to requirement for auxiliary damping treatments in many applications. This article examines whether a high Young's Modulus and damping level can simultaneously be realized by introducing lossy polymeric infills into auxetic aluminum honeycombs. Using finite element analysis, auxetic honeycombs with varying cell geometry and infill stiffness, loaded in the x-and y-directions, are examined. From the results, it is observed that the best performance is achieved when auxetic honeycombs with shallow inclined walls and short vertical walls are loaded in the x-direction. Young's Modulus in excess of 10 GPa is achievable in combination with a loss factor of 5%. If a higher loss factor of 10% is required, Young's Modulus in the range of 5.5-6.5 GPa can still be realized. The high loss factors achieved are attributed to the very high local strain levels in the polymeric infill in the central region of the cell between the top and the bottom cell walls, which are in close proximity, further increased by the large negative Poisson's ratios of the configuration.

AB The human being has always been looking for optimal use of his surrounding materials and over the years, has managed to invent various structures with special properties. Lattice structures are widely used in various applications due to their lower weight and desirable compressive strength. An example of these structures is the honeycomb that is very popular and many studies have been done about it. A new type of lattice structures is auxetic structure that has negative Poisson's ratio due to its geometry. This characteristic has caused auxetic structures to have unique properties such as high shear strength, indentation resistance and energy absorption. Investigation of energy absorption of auxetic structures is a subject that has not been studied in researches. In this study, the ability of some auxetic structure for absorbing energy is investigated at quasi-static and low velocity impact transverse loading. Specimens with three types of geometries (re-entrant, arrowhead and anti-tetra chiral) are fabricated using additive manufacturing method (3D printing). Discussion about energy absorption and failure mechanisms of all three structures were carried out and compared in both types of loading. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study compared low strain rate material properties and impact force attenuation of auxetic foam and the conventional open-cell polyurethane counterpart. This furthers our knowledge with regards to how best to apply these highly conformable and breathable auxetic foams to protective sports equipment. Cubes of auxetic foam measuring 150 x 150 x 150 mm were fabricated using a thermo-mechanical conversion process. Quasi-static compression confirmed the converted foam to be auxetic, prior to being sliced into 20 mm thick cuboid samples for further testing. Density, Poisson's ratio and the stress-strain curve were all found to be dependent on the position of each cuboid from within the cube. Impact tests with a hemispherical drop hammer were performed for energies up to 6 J, on foams covered with a polypropylene sheet between 1 and 2 mm thick. Auxetic samples reduced peak force by similar to 10 times in comparison to the conventional foam. This work has shown further potential for auxetic foam to be applied to protective equipment, while identifying that improved fabrication methods are required.

TI Negative Poisson's ratios in anisotropic linear elastic media
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED MECHANICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME

AB Poisson's ratio for an anisotropic linear elastic material depends on two orthogonal directions n and m. Materials with negative Poisson ratios for all (n, m) pairs are called completely auxetic while those with positive Poisson's ratios for all (n, m) pairs are called nonauxetic. Simple necessary and sufficient conditions on elastic compliances are derived to identify if any given material of cable or hexagonal symmetry is completely auxetic or nonauxetic. When these conditions are not satisfied, the medium is auxetic for some (n, m) pairs. Several simple necessary conditions for completely auxetic or nonauxetic media are derived for a general anisotropic elastic material.

   Melting
AB Laser Freeform Fabrication allows additive manufacturing of functional parts from metallic powder materials. This yields potential for product innovations due to increased geometric degrees of freedom. Additional advantages are reduction of throughput time and economical manufacturing of small lot sizes. Hence, these processes are capable of producing structures of complex freeform geometry that cannot be manufactured at all with conventional processes [1]. This provides the possibility to manufacture designs that show a negative Poisson's ratio.. It gives the relation of the negative transverse strain to the longitudinal strain of a material exposed to uniaxial tension or compression. The longitudinal strain occurs in the load direction, whereas the transverse strain is found normal to this axis. Typically, the Poisson's ratio is greater than zero, i.e. in tension a material's volume can increase or remain constant while the behaviour in compression is vice versa. However, some materials can exhibit negative values between -1 and 0 meaning that they show unexpected behaviour by expanding transversely under tensile forces and vice versa under compression.
   This circumstance can be exploited in applications where parts are subject to compressive deformation but which are not allowed to expand laterally in order to not cause damage in adjacent components. Examples are crash impact absorbers and artificial intervertebral discs, etc. Experimental results were obtained from new honeycomb structures that were manufactured with Selective Laser Melting from stainless steel powder and tested in a universal testing machine under elastic, compressive deformation. Thus rules for successful design of honeycomb structures with negative Poisson's ratio were derived.

AB A 2D mechanical metamaterial exhibiting perfectly auxetic behavior, i.e., Poisson's ratio of -1, is proposed in this paper drawing upon inspiration from an Islamic star formed by circumferential arrangement of eight squares, such as the one found at the exterior of the Ghiyathiyya Madrasa in Khargird, Iran (built 1438-1444 AD). Each unit of the metamaterial consists of eight pairs of pin-jointed Y-shaped rigid elements, whereby every pair of Y-elements is elastically restrained by a spiral spring. Upon intermediate stretching, each metamaterial unit resembles the north dome of Jameh Mosque, Iran (built 1087-1088 AD), until the attainment of the fully opened configuration, which resembles a structure in Agra, India, near the Taj Mahal. Both infinitesimal and finite deformation models of the effective Young's modulus for the metamaterial structure were established using strain energy approach in terms of the spiral spring stiffness and geometrical parameters, with assumptions to preserve the eight-fold symmetricity of every metamaterial unit. Results indicate that the prescription of strain raises the effective Young's modulus in an exponential manner until full extension is attained. This metamaterial is useful for applications where the overall shape of the structure must be conserved in spite of uniaxial application of load, and where deformation is permitted under limited range, which is quickly arrested as the deformation progresses.

AB Auxetic mechanical metamaterials (AMMs), as an exciting paradigm of metamaterials, have attracted increasing attention due to their interesting mechanical properties (e.g. negative Poisson's ratio), as well as the emergence of advanced manufacturing technology (e.g. 3D printing). Although various reviews on AMMs, their structures, properties, and applications, have existed, it still lacks a comprehensive review in terms of manufacturing methods. Herein, the latest progress in AMMs is extensively reviewed, including AMMs' structures, characteristics, manufacturing methods, and applications. In addition, the current challenges and future works of AMMs are concluded and discussed. This Review aims to serve as a collection of knowledge that supplies more comprehensive understanding and inspiration to support further developments of AMMs from the perspective of design and manufacturing.

AB It is known that auxetic properties (for example, negative Poisson ratios, that is, when a solid experiences lateral expansion under stretching instead of lateral contraction) start showing themselves in materials where there is a certain kind of geometrical orientational correlations between "rigid" constituents. Properly arranged orientational degrees of freedom of building blocks govern the characteristic distances in auxetic materials and thus determine the way in which the materials contract or expand. Very often the building blocks are filamentous. We suggest a way to arrange filamentous objects into highly interwoven regular structures which may exhibit auxetic properties with negative Poisson ratio. Our purely geometrical consideration can be extended to an irregular positional arrangement. This implies that a solid of sufficiently dense "random" arrangements of filaments (for example, "wool" of nanowires or of carbon nanotubes) may become auxetic. (C) 2007 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB The auxetic tubular materials have attracted wide attention owing to their unusual mechanical properties and potential applications in designing foldable devices. However, most of auxetic tubular structures designed by incorporating re-entrant, chiral or penetrated microstructures remain great challenging in stress concentration because of the presence of shape corners in these structures. In this study, a novel auxetic tubular structure is designed by incorporating the smooth peanut-shaped hole pattern and then is fabricated via 3D printing technique. Subsequently its mechanical properties and deformation characteristics are investigated by uniaxial compression experiments and finite element simulation. Results reveal that the designed tube exhibits significant auxetic performance under compression and the stress level within the structure is significantly reduced, in contrast to the auxetic tubular structure with orthogonal elliptical hole pattern. Finally, the effect of controlling parameters of the designed auxetic tubular structure on Poisson's ratio is studied to better understand its auxetic behavior and also provide tunable design of auxetic tubular structures.

AB A negative Poisson's ratio refers to the phenomenon of a material expanding along the transverse direction upon uniaxial tension. Here, we show a negative Poisson's ratio observed directly by experiments in a single-crystal Heusler-type Cu-16.9Al-11.6Mn (at%) shape memory alloy, in addition to the alloy's superelasticity. When stretched along the vicinity of the [110] direction, the alloy expands along the [1 (1) over bar0] direction, showing a significant negative Poisson's ratio of -0.51, while shrinking along the [001] direction with a large positive Poisson's ratio of 1.36. These experimental results agree well with the values calculated from the elastic constants and elastic anisotropy. (C) 2019 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Two-component auxetic yarns with helical wrapping structure showed negative Poisson's ratio under axial tension. It was the interaction force, especially the normal force, between the two filaments that led to the outer contour diameter of the complex yarn being expanded. Both the deformation behavior of structure and cross section presented greater effect on Poisson's ratio and auxetic effect. However, the previous geometrical model that has been reported was without considering the interaction force between the two components. Mechanical model with axial tension and the normal force was carried out to theoretically calculate Poisson's ratio of the complex yarn. The results showed that the cross section of the filament was from circular shape to elliptical shape under the normal force. Theoretical value from the mechanical model with considering the effect of normal force on the radial strain was in good accordance with the experimental results of Poisson's ratio.

AB Focusing on the structural optimization of auxetic materials using data-driven methods, a back-propagation neural network (BPNN) based design framework is developed for petal-shaped auxetics using isogeometric analysis. Adopting a NURBS-based parametric modelling scheme with a small number of design variables, the highly nonlinear relation between the input geometry variables and the effective material properties is obtained using BPNN-based fitting method, and demonstrated in this work to give high accuracy and efficiency. Such BPNN-based fitting functions also enable an easy analytical sensitivity analysis, in contrast to the generally complex procedures of typical shape and size sensitivity approaches.

AB Auxetic material is a metamaterial engineered to achieve negative Poisson's ratios through special design of microstructure. As a typical 3D auxetic material, 3D cross-chiral structures (CCS) possesses significant auxetic behavior and the mechanical properties can be tuned over a wide range. In this paper, mechanical responses of CCS are systematically investigated by experiments, numerical simulations and theoretical analysis. Three typical failure modes are observed during the compression process. As the tilt angle of struts increases, the CCS shows a transition from the compression-dominated to the bending-dominated deformation mechanism. The Young's modulus of the CCS can be enhanced 8.5 times, simply by changing the angle of the strut by 20 degrees. The CCS can also show a higher energy absorption capacity with absorption efficiency of about 50%, which is higher than most previously reported cellular materials. Additionally, a new theoretical model based on large deformation theory is established to predict the plastic yield stress, and good agreement is obtained with the numerical simulations and experiments, which indicates that the present model can significantly improve the accuracy of the estimation. The results of this paper may be helpful for designing of energy absorbing devices and personal protection with 3D auxetic materials. (c) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Foam materials with negative Poisson's ratio can be made by transforming the cell structure from the convex polyhedral shape of conventional foam cells to a concave or ''re-entrant'' shape. Mechanical behavior of re-entrant foams differs from that of conventional foams. Most of the difference is attributed to the change in cell shape. In this study, Young's moduli of conventional and re-entrant open cell foams are obtained by modeling the three-dimensional unit cell as an idealized 14-sided unit cell. Young's modulus of re-entrant foams decreases with permanent volumetric compression ratio in both modeling and experiments.

AB In this study, a new vertical strut combined re-entrant auxetic structure was designed and its mechanical behaviors have been studied. An analytical model was established based on energy theorems considering bending, shearing and stretching. Numerical simulations and experiments were both carried out to confirm the validity of the analytical model based on beam theory. Results exhibited a good agreement between the refined analytical model, the numerical simulation and experimental study. Four deformation mechanisms were analyzed and the effect of deformation on the effective Poisson?s ratio (EPR) and elastic module were investigated. A parametric study was further performed to quantitatively illustrate the influences of the geometrical parameters on the effective elasticity properties of the designed structure. The results showed that the lightweight structures can significantly enhance the auxetic behavior and achieve a high degree of anisotropy with wide vertical strut lengths and internal angles compared with conventional re-entrant honeycomb configurations.

ID AUXETIC BEHAVIOR
AB To investigate the influence of auxetic behavior on thermally induced stresses, finite element analysis. simulations of the displacement and stress fields in locally heated three dimensional auxetic and cubic structures are compared. The simulations were carried out in Comsol for a cubic as well as a chiral array of 30 mm length in each spatial dimension (3 x 3 x 3 unit cells). The center cells of these arrays were heated for 20 s. For two boundary conditions (free and clamped), deformation mechanisms are analyzed. It is found, that the auxetic behavior can effectively reduce thermal stresses by internal node rotation and strut bending, especially for constrained (clamped) boundary conditions. A stress reduction of a factor of 3.3 in comparisons to a simple cubic cell array could be evaluated.

AB Background: The first-order shear deformation theory (FSDT) for plates requires a shear correction factor due to the assumption of constant shear strain and shear stress across the thickness; hence, the shear correction factor strongly influences the accuracy of the deflection solution; the third-order shear deformation theory (TSDT) does not require a correction factor because it facilitates the change in shear strain across the plate thickness.
   Methods: This paper obtains an improved shear correction factor for simply supported very thick rectangular plates by matching the deflection of the Mindlin plate (FSDT) with that of the Reddy plate (TSDT).
   Results: As a consequence, the use of the exact shear correction factor for the Mindlin plate gives solutions that are exactly the same as for the Reddy plate.
   Conclusions: The customary adoption of 5/6 shear correction factor is a lower bound, and the exact shear correction factor is higher for the following: (a) very thick plates, (b) narrow or long plates, (c) high Poisson's ratio plate material, and (d) highly patterned loads, while the commonly used shear correction factor of 5/6 is still valid for the following: (i) marginally thick plates, (ii) square plates, (iii) negative Poisson's ratio materials, and (d) uniformly distributed loadings.

AB The objective of this research is to understand more fully the out-of-plane auxetic behavior of paper. In the reported research, initial characterization of the auxetic properties of common, commercially available papers is described. The results of these experiments suggest that the auxetic response seen in paper structures is related to the cellulose fiber network structure, as previously suggested, and is related to inter-fiber bonding and fiber organization in the sheet. These results also indicate that further study is needed to understand how materials and processing variables influence auxetic behavior. A mathematical model, attempting to explain auxetic response in an idealized arrangement of fibers is included. Ultimately, the fundamental understanding resulting from this research should lead to new product development opportunities for forest product-based paper materials as well as to the establishment of predictive structure-property relations for auxetic materials using paper as a model system.

AB In this paper, we present a comparative analysis between the cyclic loading tensile behaviour of conventional and auxetic thermoplastic PU foams. While the two types of foam share the same base material (open cell PU-PE), one batch is transformed into an auxetic one (i.e., negative Poisson's ratio) using a special manufacturing process involving moulding and exposure to particular temperature profiles to stabilise the transformation of the microstructure. The effect of the stiffness degradation and accumulation of energy dissipation versus the number of cycles are discussed for different loading levels r. The results show that the fatigue behaviour until failure, subjected to cyclic loading depends on the loading levels and occur in three stages. The results obtained shows also that the auxetic foam have enhanced characteristics under static loading and tensile fatigue compared to the conventional parent phase form.

AB One of the leading contributors to assembly and reliability issues in electronic packaging arises from warpage and interfacial stresses stemming from coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) mismatch of the interfacing components. Trends toward miniaturizing and increasing density of the electronic packages exacerbate the assembly problems, leading to issues such as die cracking and board level assembly yield loss. One potential solution may be found in the inclusion of auxetic structures, which demonstrate negative Poisson's ratio through re-entrant geometries, which has been investigated for use in augmented structural mechanics for impact energy absorption. Because of the unique structural design, auxetics become thicker perpendicularly under an applied tensile load, unlike typical material loading responses. This interesting behavior has opportunity for integration into electronic packages for stress mitigation under thermal cycling since the structures can disrupt the typical expansion behavior. Here, auxetic trace geometries and structures were evaluated in various packaging implementations (die and substrate level) for warpage and stress reduction under thermal cycling conditions. By replacing standard Manhattan-style layouts and power and ground plane features with re-entrant trace geometries, reductions in thermomechanically induced interfacial stresses were observed, in addition to considering heat spreading properties within a package. Herein, deformation of silicon chip with addition of raised re-entrant Evans auxetics and raised ellipse shape auxetic traces as well as deformation of direct bonded copper (DBC) substrate with and without re-entrant auxetic patterned pads are estimated and compared using Finite Element Analysis (FEA) in ANSYS software. To demonstrate the benefits of passive auxetic traces, a planar transformer with re-entrant Evans auxetic patterns on PCB layers has been examined under full-load operating condition and compared with a traditionally patterned transformers. A better thermal distribution and lower maximum temperature in the device are achieved by including auxetic patterned features. FEA simulation results also show stress reduction in windings and lower deformation in PCB layers. Inclusion of auxetic structures in passive metal deposition layers which are not part of the circuit is shown to reduce maximum stress and warp deflection, as well as improve thermal gradient distribution and reduce overall temperature for 2D planar and 3D stacked packages. Consequently, use of auxetic features may extend package reliability significantly.

DE thermal stresses; cellular core; auxetic sandwich panel; finite elements
AB Sandwich panels are important components of advanced structures used in aerospace, automotive, railway, civil engineering etc. They are subjected to high and repeated variations of temperature which induce additional stresses as the core and the face sheets are from different materials having different coefficients of thermal expansion and moduli of elasticity. Therefore it is important to evaluate both mechanical and thermal stresses. In the literature one can find thermomechanical analyses of sandwich panels with metallic or composite face sheets and having a honeycomb or compact core made from polyurethane foam. In this paper was analysed a plane sandwich panel made from a cellular rigid polyurethane core, having a chiral configuration and auxetic properties (negative Poisson's ratio) exposed to a stationary temperature field with a linear variation from +25 degrees C on one sheet to -50 degrees C on the opposite sheet. Two boundary conditions were considered in the thermo-mechanical evaluation: the free panel and the panel simply supported around the edges.

AB Cellular materials have two important properties: structures and mechanisms. These properties have important applications in materials design; in particular, they're used to determine the modulus and yield strain. The objective of this study is to gain a better understanding of these two properties and to explore the synthesis of three-dimensional (3D) compliant cellular materials (CCMs) with compliant porous structures (CPSes) generated from modified hexagonal honeycombs. An orthotropic constitutive CCM model in the Cartesian coordinate system is constructed using the strain energy method, which uses the deformation of hinges around holes and the rotation of links. A finite element (FE) based simulation is conducted to validate the analytical model. The moduli and yield strains of the 3D CCMs with an aluminum alloy are about 1.2GPa and 0.4% in the longitudinal direction and about 0.08MPa and 30% in the lateral direction. The CCMs have extremely high positive and negative Poisson's ratios (43, 30) due to the large rotation of the link member in the transverse direction caused by an input displacement in the longitudinal direction. This paper demonstrates that compliant mesostructures can be used for next generation materials design in tailoring mechanical properties such as moduli, strength, strain, and Poisson's ratios.

AB When designing a flexible structure consisting of cellular materials, it is important to find the maximum effective strain of the cellular material resulting from the deformed cellular geometry and not leading to local cell wall failure. In this paper, a finite in-plane shear deformation of auxtic honeycombs having effective negative Poisson's ratio is investigated over the base material's elastic range. An analytical model of the in-plane plastic failure of the cell walls is refined with finite element (FE) micromechanical analysis using periodic boundary conditions. A nonlinear constitutive relation of honeycombs is obtained from the FE micromechanics simulation and is used to define the coefficients of a hyperelastic strain energy function. Auxetic honeycombs show high shear flexibility without a severe geometric nonlinearity when compared to their regular counterparts.

AB A series of polyphenylacetylene networks are predicted to exhibit the not so common property of a near-zero Poisson's ratio, a property which is highly desirable in various practical applications. This behaviour is explained qualitatively in terms of a simple honeycomb model involving flexure, hinging and/or stretching of acetylene chains. (C) 2010 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB It is widely assumed that disordered auxetic structures (i.e., structures with a negative Poisson's ratio) must contain reentrant polygons in two dimensions (2D) and reentrant polyhedra in 3D. Here, we show how to design disordered networks in 2D with only convex polygons. The design principles used allow for any Poisson's ratio -1 < nu < 1/3 to be obtained with a prescriptive algorithm. By starting from a Delaunay triangulation with a mean coordination < z > similar or equal to 6 and nu similar or equal to 0.33 and removing those edges that decrease the shear modulus the least, without creating any reentrant polygons, the system evolves monotonically towards the isostatic point with < z > similar or equal to 4 and v similar or equal to -1.

AB In this paper we study the effects of negative Poisson's ratios on elastic problems containing singularities. Materials with a negative Poisson's ratio are termed auxetic. We present a brief review of such materials. The elasticity problem of a bimateral wedge is presented, then two particular cases of this problem are investigated: the free-edge problem and the interface crack problem. We study the effect on the stress singularity due to one portion of the bimaterial becoming auxetic. We find that the auxetic material has a significant effect on the singularity order, even causing the singularity to vanish for certain values of the elastic constants. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A 3D numerical simulation of the mechanical behaviour of a chiral auxetic cellular structure subjected to multiaxial loading conditions is presented in this paper. The proposed computational models are used to study the geometry effect of the unit cell on the Poisson's ratio and deformation behaviour of the analysed chiral auxetic structure. A 3D computational model of a chiral auxetic structure is built using beam finite elements in the framework of LS DYNA software. Here, the lattice model is positioned between rigid plates and assembled in a way to simulate hydro-compression loading conditions. Between the contacting surfaces, interactions in normal (contact) and tangential (friction) directions are prescribed, with the node-to-surface approach. The developed computational model offers insight into the deformation (damage) behaviour of the analysed chiral auxetic cellular structure, and enables better understanding of its crushing behaviour under multiaxial loading.

AB Mechanical metamaterials with negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) effect possess important practical applications in aerospace, nanotechnology, and other fields. The microstructure and its deformation mode directly determine the NPR ability and mechanical performance of auxetic metamaterials. Herein, inspired by the double-negative-index ceramic aerogels, a novel NPR structural model is proposed in which symmetric reentrant oblique ligaments and short transversal ligaments constitute the main framework inside a square, which is different from the traditional reentrant structure due to the hyperbolic-like skeleton and deformation modes. The influence of structural parameters on the NPR effect is investigated using the Timoshenko beam model and finite element simulations. The structural model is then extended to design multiple reentrant structures and assembled structures, respectively. The multiple reentrant structures include multiple pairs of symmetrically hyperbolic-like skeletons, and the distribution of horizontal ligaments can be regulated to achieve a better NPR effect. For assembled structures under compression, the local rotational deformation and buckling result in structural instability, demonstrated by inflection points in the NPR curves. Moreover, one special assembled structure is found for which there is a linear relationship between the compressive strain and NPR value. The insights should be significant for designing mechanical metamaterials with the NPR effect.

AB This paper studies the optimization of converting process parameters of conventional foam into the auxetic. The control factors of converting process are heat temperature, pressure and time. The aim of this study is to achieve an optimum combination of these control factors for obtaining maximum stiffness and minimum negative Poisson's ratio as the desired responses. A series of experiments were implemented based on the Taguchi orthogonal array design. In order to determine the optimum control factors level, three different multi-objective optimization methods i.e. grey relational analysis, fitness function and desirability function were employed. The optimum combinations achieved form all methods were verified through the confirmation tests. Although outcomes of all these methods, in the case of both Poisson's ratio and stiffness, were in a good agreement with the confirmation tests, however the result of grey relational analysis had the minimum mean error percentage. Also, all these methods reported the pressure, heat temperature and time as the first, second and third level of significance, respectively. This study allows manufacturer to select the optimization procedure appropriately and produce the auxetic foam with minimum waste material.

AB Tailoring the dynamical behavior of wave-guide structures can provide an efficient and physically elegant approach for optimizing mechanical components with regards to vibroacoustic propagation. Architectured materials as pyramidal core kirigami cells combined with smart systems may represent a promising way to improve the vibroacoustic quality of structural components. This paper describes the design and modeling of a pyramidal core with auxetic (negative Poisson's ratio) characteristics and distributed shunted piezoelectric patches that allow for wave propagation control. The core is produced using a kirigami technique, inspired by the cutting/folding processes of the ancient Japanese art. The kirigami structure has a pyramidal unit cell shape that creates an in-plane negative Poisson's ratio macroscopic behavior. This structure exhibits in-plane elastic properties (Young's and shear modulus) which are higher than the out-of-plane ones, and hence this lattice has very specific properties in terms of wave propagation that are investigated in this work. The short-circuited configuration is first analyzed, before using negative capacitance and resistance as a shunt which provides impressive band gaps in the low frequency range. All configurations are investigated by using a full analysis of the Brillouin zone, rendering possible the deep understanding of the dynamical properties of the smart lattice. The results are presented in terms of dispersion and directivity diagrams, and the smart lattice shows quite interesting properties for the adaptive filtering of elastic waves at low frequencies bandwidths.

AB The advanced composites - laminates, composed of auxetic and non-auxetic layers, were developed and subjected to tensile loading tests to characterize their deformation behaviour. The two-layer laminates were composed of the polymer foam with auxetic cellular structure and the conventional knitted fabric bonded together by the rubber-based adhesive, based on polymer binder, resins, additives and flammable organic solvents. All base materials, structured foams and laminates were tested. The influence of the adhesive on mechanical properties of the knitted fabric was also evaluated. The results of the study show that the cheaply fabricated laminates of knitted fabric reinforced by structured Ethylene-Vinyl Acetate (EVA) foam offer stiffness enhancement and decrease of the Poisson's ratio of the conventional fabric. The laminates also limit fabric warping during the deformation, thus increasing its stiffness. This behaviour can be beneficial in many applications in the textile industry by enhancing properties in durability, comfort and support.

AB The paper describes the manufacturing and tensile testing of auxetic (negative Poisson's ratio) thermoplastic polyurethane and polyester urethane foams, under quasi-static and constant strain rate loading. The foams are produced from conventional flexible polyurethane basis following a manufacturing route developed in previous works. The Poisson's ratio behaviour over compressive strain has been analyzed using an Image Data processing technique based on Edge Detection from digital images recorded using camcorders and high speed cameras. The measurements indicate that higher strain rate loading implies stiffening effects on the stress-strain curves, and significant increase of the magnitudes of the Poisson's ratios with increasing compressive strains.

AB The Conway-Maxwell Poisson (CMP) distribution is a popular model for analyzing data that exhibit under or over dispersion. In this article, we construct bivariate CMP distributions with given marginal CMP distributions and range of correlation coefficient over (- 1, 1) based on the Sarmanov family of bivariate distributions. One of the constructions is based on a general method for weighted distributions. The dependence property is examined. Parameter estimation, tests of independence and adequacy of model and a Monte Carlo power study are discussed. A real data set is used to exemplify its usefulness with comparison to other bivariate models.

ID FABRICATION
AB Auxetic structures attain certain abnormal mechanical attributes such as negative Poisson's ratios due to the macro level structural forms. Achieving the auxetic responses is often the central focus of the design of any auxetic structural form. However, the stress distribution across the structures and in particular, the stress concentration aspects are often paid little attention. A numerical simulation analysis is conducted in this paper to establish the stress distribution patterns as well as the stress concentration effects based on variations in the filleting around the critical points of the structure. A square grid auxetic structural form is selected and finite element simulation of the stress fields indicated specific roles of the slight geometrical modifications in terms of filleting leading to variations in both peak stresses and the locations of the stress concentration points. Optimum fillet dimensions could be established based on the results of the numerical experiments. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this article, a novel re-entrant octagonal honeycomb (ROH) with negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) configuration is proposed owing to its superior energy absorption and lightweight design performances. Regarding the effects of adjacent unit cells, a mechanics-based homogenization approach is put forward and employed to derive static mechanical properties including elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio of two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) ROHs under axial loading. Based on above, the predominant compression failure mode is explored. Then, the static mechanical properties and finite element model of ROH are validated by experiment and demonstrate high accuracy. Subsequently, to obtain dynamic responses of the ROH under dynamic impact loading, the relations among dynamic plateau stress and quasi-static plateau stress, initial density, dense strain and impact velocities are established under the conditions of mass conservation and momentum theorem based on one-dimensional shock wave theory and ideal rigid-perfectly plastic material model. Besides, dynamic energy absorption models of the ROH under dynamic loading are acquired in consideration of the effects of impact velocities on dense strain, the results show that theoretical models agree quite well with simulation results. On this basis, the application of ROH on automotive energy absorber is studied with the purpose of acquiring superior energy absorption and satisfying lightweight requirements simultaneously. Based on the decoupling thought of stiffness and pedestrian protection, a new design method of carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP) hood with ROH is put forward in consideration of energy absorption and lightweight requirements. Of this, ROH is regarded as sandwich structure to meet the demands of energy absorption, CFRP plates are treated as outer and inner skins to satisfy the needs of stiffness. Firstly, multi-objective optimization models are set up under the constraints of reasonable structural parameters and negative Poisson's ratio. Then, the NSGA-IIalgorithm is adopted to achieve the optimal Pareto fronts with the targets for maximum unit mass energy absorption and minimum density. Afterwards, the optimization on thicknesses of CFRP layers is carried out to achieve minimum mass under the constraint conditions that the static stiffness of CFRP hood is larger than that of steel hood. In addition, the layering sequence of inner and lower skins are also optimized. Finally, improved overall stiffness, optimized HIC values and similar lightweight space of CFRP hood with ROH are achieved in comparisons with CFRP hood without ROH. Compared with steel hood, the pedestrian protection performance of CFRP hood with ROH is greatly enhanced, 1st free mode increases by 33.9%, and torsional stiffness and bending stiffness increase by 23.1% and 30.8%, respectively. While the weight decreases by 40.1%. The results indicate that the CFRP hood with ROH presents outstanding advantages of pedestrian protection and lightweight design in terms of HIC and stiffness performance.

AB Auxetics are structures and materials with a negative Poisson's ratio, meaning they contract in the direction perpendicular to the applied force under a compressive load. This phenomenon can lead to increased energy absorption, among other favourable parameters to protect against impulsive loadings. In this research, a structure with alternating oval perforations was investigated which gives rise to an auxetic geometry, referred to as an 'auxetic oval' design within this paper. Quasi-static (strain rate = 0.001/s) and dynamic (strain rate = 100/s) experiments have been conducted on small-scale specimens, manufactured using subtractive fabrication (laser cutting). Different design criteria were examined to understand the mechanisms behind the energy absorption of the auxetic structures. A modified version of the energy efficiency method was developed to determine the densification strain of the auxetics. A shift from strain-softening to strain-hardening behaviour is seen as the number of cell layers increases, with the perfectly-plastic response ideal for energy absorbing structures. Inertia effects are present in the dynamic tests, showing an increase in plateau stress for several of the designs. The quasi-static and dynamic responses are fundamentally identical, meaning that the performance of the auxetics do not change under the range of strain rates examined.
   Digital image correlation has been successfully utilised in the analysis process. This includes confirmation of the mechanism giving rise to the auxetic behaviour (rigid rotating squares) and the calculation of the negative Poisson's ratio. Strain fields have been examined showing the regions of energy dissipation. Based on these results the auxetic oval design experiences bending dominated behaviour. Finally, a unique design has been developed, dubbed the 'Hybrid Auxetic Oval', which shows favourable behaviour compared to the equivalent base auxetic oval design by mitigating the effects of fracture.

AB Metamaterials are defined as a family of rationally designed artificial materials which can provide extraordinary effective properties compared with their nature counterparts. This paper proposes a level set based method for topology optimization of both single and multiple-material Negative Poisson's Ratio (NPR) metamaterials. For multi-material topology optimization, the conventional level set method is advanced with a new approach exploiting the reconciled level set (RLS) method. The proposed method simplifies the multi-material topology optimization by evolving each individual material with a single level set function and reconciling the result level set field with the Merriman-Bence-Osher (MBO) operator. The NPR metamaterial design problem is recast as a variational problem, where the effective elastic properties of the spatially periodic microstructure are formulated as the strain energy functionals under uniform displacement boundary conditions. The adjoint variable method is utilized to derive the shape sensitivities by combining the general linear elastic equation with a weak imposition of Dirichlet boundary conditions. The design velocity field is constructed using the steepest descent method and integrated with the level set method. Both single and multiple-material mechanical metamaterials are achieved in 2D and 3D with different Poisson's ratios and volumes. Benchmark designs are fabricated with multi-material 3D printing at high resolution. The effective auxetic properties of the achieved designs are verified through finite element simulations and characterized using experimental tests as well. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Studies on designing polymeric fibres based helical auxetic yarn (HAY) to maximise their auxetic effect are yet to propose optimised design configurations for general impact mitigation applications. This study therefore presents optimal design parameters through analytical calculations and finite element (FE) method. Three main design parameters were considered which includes Poisson's ratio, core/wrap diameter ratio, and starting wrap angle. The Poisson's ratio of the HAY was calculated by measuring its total diameter at a given rate of strain. The investigation found here to be a starting wrap angle of a HAY (critical angle) that resulted in the highest possible exhibiting of the auxetic effect. The critical angle was determined to be 7, and a maximum NPR of - 12.04 was achieved with this design. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Auxetics (i.e. systems with negative Poisson's ratios) exhibit the unexpected feature of becoming fatter when stretched and narrower when compressed. This property is highly desirable as it imparts many beneficial effects on the material's macroscopic properties. Recent research suggests that in an idealised scenario, systems composed of connected 'rigid squares' can. exhibit auxetic behaviour (Poisson's ratio = - 1) due to a mechanism involving relative rotation of the squares. This paper shows through force-field based molecular modelling simulations that although 'rotating squares' are responsible for negative Poisson's ratios in various zeolite frameworks, in these real materials, the squares are not rigid and the auxeticity is not as pronounced as in the 'idealised' model. In view of this, a new model system made from connected,semi-rigid' squares is proposed and analytical equations for the mechanical properties of this new model system are derived and discussed. It will be shown that the Poisson's ratios in this new model are highly dependent on the extent of rigidity of the squares and the direction of loading. It will also be shown that this new model provides a better description for the behaviour of auxetic zeolite frameworks than the original 'rotating rigid squares' model.

AB It is generally acknowledged that the indentation resistance or hardness of auxetic materials is higher than that of their conventional counterparts under elastic deformation. However, this property of the auxetic material may not always be superior to that of the non-auxetic materials when the deformation is relatively large with plasticity considered. In this study, we come up with an index to quantitatively depict the indentation resistance of the hexagonal honeycombs under large deformation. The indentation resistance of both the auxetic and nonauxetic hexagonal honeycombs is compared and discussed. Results show that in the premise of honeycombs possessing the same relative density, the indentation resistance of auxetic hexagonal honeycombs is not always higher than that of the non-auxetic honeycombs. This phenomenon is verified by the numerical simulations. Further analysis shows that there is a critical value of the absolute value of Poisson's ratio, which is determined by the cell-wall length ratio, to estimate the higher indentation resistance between the auxetic and non-auxetic hexagonal honeycombs. The influence of indentation velocity is also analyzed based on numerical simulations. This present work is supposed to shed light on the design and evaluation of the indentation resistance for both auxetic and conventional honeycombs.

AB This study aims to provide fundamental understandings in several issues critical to the fabrication of auxetic polyurethane (PU) foams by thermal compression process: conversion and auxetic structure fixation mechanisms, materials characteristics essential for the successful auxetic conversion, and optimal conditions for auxetic conversion. Three flexible PU foams with similar morphology were selected for the study. First the commonalities as well as the differences between these foams in terms of their chemical composition, microstructure and thermomechanical properties were thoroughly analyzed. This is followed by the auxetic convertibility study of these three foams. Mechanisms for fixing the structure were elucidated and the windows for processing were interpreted in the context of polymer relaxation. Guided by these understandings, a series of auxetic foams were manufactured at a wide range of conditions. The processing conditions agreed very well with those suggested from the mechanistic investigation, validating the proposed auxetic conversion and structure fixation mechanisms. The mechanism was further confirmed by direct observation of the morphology of the fabricated auxetic foams. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In recent years, auxetic cellular materials such as auxetic reentrant honeycombs were widely studied due to its attractively negative Poisson's ratio. In this manuscript, the structure response of end-clamped sandwich beam with auxetic reentrant hexagonal aluminum honeycomb core locally subjected to foam projectile with high-velocity impact was experimentally and numerically studied. The reentrant honeycomb cores with different cell-wall thicknesses were fabricated by selective laser melting (SLM). According to experiment results, the failure modes of the sandwich beam were investigated. It was found that sandwich beam with different honeycomb cell's thicknesses could fail in different modes. Meanwhile, the local negative Poisson's ratio deformation was observed in the thin honeycomb core. Based on this, a finite element (FE) model was constructed to analysis the dynamic deformation evolution of two face sheets and auxetic reentrant honeycomb core. The local auxetic and expand deformations of honeycomb core were both found. Finally, the residual deflections of sandwich beam under impulsive loadings were discussed.

AB An auxetic design is proposed by soft-hard material integration and demonstrate negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) can be achieved by leveraging unique rotation features of non-connected hard particles in a soft matrix. A theoretical mechanics framework that describes rotation of hard particles in a soft matrix under a mechanical loading is incorporated with overall Poisson's ratio of the soft-hard integrated metamaterials. The theoretical analysis shows that the auxetic behaviour of the soft-hard integrated structures not only relies critically on geometry of particles, but also depends on their periodic arrangements in the soft matrix. Extensive finite-element analyses (FEA) are performed and validate the theoretical predictions of hard-particle rotation and overall Poisson's ratio of soft-hard integrated structures. Furthermore, uniaxial tensile tests are carried out on three-dimensional printed soft-hard integrated structures and confirm auxetic behaviour of soft-hard integrated structures enabled by the rotation of hard particles. Besides, Poisson's ratio varies nonlinearly with the thickness of specimens and reaches a maximum NPR far out of the bounds of plane stress and plane strain situations, which agrees well with FEA. This work provides a theoretical foundation for the design of mechanical metamaterials enabled by soft-hard material integration with auxetic deformation behaviour.

AB Exploring novel two-dimensional multifunctional materials with distinguished properties lies at the core of materials innovation. Here, we identify a hitherto-neglected single-layer PtI2, which can readily be exfoliated from its bulk experimentally, with appealing multifunctional properties through first-principles calculations. Single-layer PtI2 is an indirect-gap semiconductor with a band gap of 2.56 eV, and its band gap is extremely robust against external strain. We find that it is a promising two-dimensional photocatalyst, exhibiting outstanding catalytic performances toward oxygen evolution reactions, with the water oxidation reaction occurring spontaneously under light irradiation. Moreover, we unveil that single-layer PtI2 is a long-sought auxetic material with a negative Poisson's ratio of -0.54, arising from its particular puckered hinge crystal. Our findings highlight single-layer PtI2 as a promising multifunctional material for nanoscale mechanical and photocatalytic applications.

AB We report a three-dimensional instability-triggered mechanical metamaterial that simultaneously possesses negative stiffness, negative bulk modulus, and negative Poisson's ratio. This metamaterial is a periodic arrangement of binder-shell elements. Combining numerical simulation and micromechanics analysis, we show that the thin spherical shells dent inward under compression, which contributes to a negative Poisson's ratio. Snap-through instability is predicted by the Riks method-based simulation, revealing that the metamaterial exhibits negative incremental stiffness. Negative bulk modulus is an outcome of negative stiffness and negative Poisson's ratio. Interestingly, both incremental stiffness and incremental Poisson's ratio approach negative infinity under displacement-controlled loading when snap back takes place. We further show that a triply negative metamaterial can satisfy the strong ellipticity condition, providing a mechanism to prevent the formation of localized deformation bands even when material softening takes place. The proposed triply negative metamaterial can also serve as structural elements for applications such as extreme damping composites, extreme stiff composites, and mechanical actuators.

AB A novel carbon-rich B-C compounds B2C3 in orthorhombic phase is proposed in this work. Firstly, the stability of B2C3 has been demonstrated, the thermodynamic stability, dynamic stability, and mechanical stability of B2C3 are confirmed by the formation enthalpies, phonon spectra and elastic constants, respectively. As a semiconductor material with indirect band gap, B2C3 has a larger mechanical anisotropy in Poisson's ratio, Young's modulus, and shear modulus by three-dimensional distribution and two-dimensional representation, while in some main planes, the mechanical anisotropy in Poisson's ratio, Young's modulus, and shear modulus of B2C3 are slightly smaller than that of other B-C compounds. In addition, B2C3 shows negative Poisson's ratio in (111), (100), (010), and (001) planes, which can supply more potential areas to be used than other boron carbide compounds.

AB For the purpose of fabricating three kinds of auxetic weft knitted fabrics, three different geometrical structures namely rotational structure, foldable structure and double-headed arrow topological structures with three different knit loop lengths were produced using computerized flat knitting machine. Experimental results show that all three different weft knitted fabrics have auxetic effect. The Poisson's ratio values of the three fabrics are inversely proportional to knit loop lengths. However, differences exist between the curves of Poisson's ratio relative to strain. With regards to the rotational and double-headed arrow topological structures, the curves tend to be monotonic, whilst that of the foldable structure takes the form of a parabola. This research thus confirms the possibility of producing auxetic fabrics based on several geometrical structures using flat knitting technology

AB This paper treats the influence of auxetic foam on the crush response and energy absorption response of square-section tubes when subjected to uniaxial quasi-static loading. The study aims at quantifying the energy absorption capability of auxetic foam-filled square tubes for variations in wall thickness, initial height, aspect ratio and slenderness ratio of the tube. The capability of simulating the crush response of auxetic foam-filled tubes using the validated numerical models is also presented. Based on the experimental results, the influence of the auxeticfoam in the thin-walled square tubes was quantified in terms of energy absorption capacity, specific energy absorption and crush force efficiency. It is evident that a thicker tube filled with auxetic foam is preferable if the energy absorption level is the primary goal, yet this compromises the crush force efficiency. The outcome of this present study is the establishment of empirical models for estimating the quasi-static crushing response of auxetic foam-filled tubes with varying slenderness ratio and aspect ratio.

AB In the present work, a new design of honeycomb is proposed by embedding the rhombic configuration into the normal re-entrant hexagonal honeycomb (NRHH), in order to enhance the honeycomb's in-plane mechanical properties. Both theoretical analysis and numerical simulations are employed to calculate the in-plane mechanical properties of the new honeycomb under uniaxial compression, including Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio and critical buckling strength. The results show that the new honeycomb can maintain auxetic performance, while both the in-plane Young's modulus and the critical buckling strength are significantly improved compared to the NRHH. Comparisons between the present design and other exiting enhanced periodic topologies are also carried out. With respect to them, the present design features superior performances. For these outstanding properties, this layout may provide a new concept for the optimization and design of auxetic materials. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper is devoted to a category of metamaterials called auxetics, identified by their negative Poisson's ratio. Our work consists in exploring geometrical strategies to generate irregular auxetic structures. More precisely we seek to reduce the Poisson's ratio nu, by pruning an irregular network based solely on geometric criteria. We introduce a strategy combining a pure geometric pruning algorithm followed by a physics-based testing phase to determine the resulting Poisson's ratio of our structures. We propose an algorithm that generates sets of irregular auxetic networks. Our contributions include geometrical characterization of auxetic networks, development of a pruning strategy, generation of auxetic networks with low Poisson's ratio, as well as validation of our approach. We provide statistical validation of our approach on large sets of irregular networks, and we additionally laser-cut auxetic networks in sheets of rubber. The findings reported here show that it is possible to reduce the Poisson's ratio by geometric pruning, and that we can generate irregular auxetic networks at lower processing times than a physics-based approach.

AB Previous models for describing auxetic microporous polymers adopt 2D rectangular blocks with fibril interconnections. In this paper, spherical nodes are used in order to approximate the granular nodule shape and for taking into consideration the 3D nature of the nodes. Assuming curvilinear motion of the nodes as a result of fibril rotation, a quantitative description of the Poisson's ratio is given as a function of the nodule density packing factor. Comparison with the 3D rectangular model shows that the spherical model gives a more conservative description of the Poisson's ratio although both models exhibit similar trend. Results reveal the significance of the assumed node shape for modeling the Poisson's ratio of auxetic microporous polymers.

AB In recent years, auxetic metallic cellular material such as auxetic reentrant honeycomb is one of the research hotspot in metallic cellular materials due to its attractively negative Poisson's ratio. In this manuscript, the dynamic response of the end-clamped shallow sandwich arch with aluminum face sheets and auxetic reentrant hexagonal aluminum honeycomb core subjected to foam projectile with high-velocity impact was experimentally and numerically investigated. The reentrant honeycomb cores with different cell-wall thicknesses were fabricated by selective laser melting (SLM). The deformation processes of honeycomb core were captured by a high-speed camera. And deflection history of back face sheet was obtained using three-dimensional digital imaging correlation method (DIC) analysis system. Failure modes and deformation mechanisms of the sandwich arch were investigated. According to experiment results, the local negative Poisson's ratio deformation was found in honeycomb core. Then, a finite element (FE) model was established to study the dynamic deformation evolution of two face sheets and auxetic reentrant honeycomb core. The results showed that the honeycomb cells were not always undergoing shrinkage deformation and flowing into the loading center, while the local expand deformations of honeycomb core were also found.

AB This paper establishes the effect of auxeticity on stress wave transmission and reflection. Specifically, investigation was made on wave transmission across two perfectly bonded isotropic solids in which the Poisson's ratios ranged between -1 and 0.5. The results show that the combined use of auxetic and conventional solids at extreme Poisson's ratio is helpful to multiply or even to eliminate stress waves, under the prescribed density and modulus relations. These results suggest the usefulness of auxetic solids as smart materials and in smart structures for effective control of stress wave transmission.

AB A novel computational framework for designing metamaterials with negative Poisson's ratio over a large strain range is presented in this work by combining the density-based topology optimization together with a mixed stress/deformation driven nonlinear homogenization method. A measure of Poisson's ratio based on the macro deformations is proposed, which is further validated through direct numerical simulations. With the consistent optimization formulations based on nonlinear homogenization, auxetic metamaterial designs with respect to different loading orientations and with different unit cell domains are systematically explored. In addition, the extension to multimaterial auxetic metamaterial designs is also considered, and stable optimization formulations are presented to obtain discrete metamaterial topologies under finite strains. Various new auxetic designs are obtained based on the proposed framework. To validate the performance of optimized designs, a multiscale stability analysis is carried out using the Bloch analysis and rank-one convexity check. As demonstrated, short and/or long wavelength instabilities can occur during the loading process, leading to a change of periodicity of the microstructure, which can affect the performance of an optimized design.

DE Auxetic foam; epoxy foam; solid-state foaming; Poisson's ratio
AB Auxetic epoxy resin foams were produced by solid-state foaming thanks to the use of properly shaped precursors. In fact, a re-entrant hexagonal shape of the precursors is preserved during foaming and results in a foam with a complex structure: a thin macro-structure with the re-entrant geometry filled with foam. The auxetic behavior was observed by using tensile tests at different temperatures (room temperature, 80?, and 100?). Indentation tests were also carried out to evaluate the gradient properties across the lines of the thin re-entrant macro-structure. In order to show that the auxetic behavior depended on the internal macro-structure, tests were also performed on foam panels obtained by cylindrical tablets and, therefore, with a standard-hexagonal macro-structure. In conclusion, the auxetic behavior was observed only for the foam panels with re-entrant hexagonal structure at 80?. In this case, a negative Poisson's ratio is immediately achieved at small strains and tends to a zero plateau value for longitudinal strains up to 1%.

AB Graphene assembly, e.g. graphene aerogel, is an open-cell porous material with randomly distributed graphene sheets and voids. In this study, we propose a method to generate the 3D graphene assembly models which can reasonably display the structural properties of graphene aerogel. Our 3D graphene assembly models are firstly established by a Voronoi construction method that is usually used to build the polycrystalline materials. The optimization and relaxation are then conducted to obtain 3D graphene assembly with proper structures by using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. In order to explore the mechanical properties of graphene assembly, the tensile and compressive tests are carried out by MD simulations. The results show that the 3D graphene assembly reveals auxetic behavior under compression while it has positive Poisson's ratio under tension. We also find that the Poisson's ratios are specifically related to the grain sizes and mass densities. Furthermore, from our simulation the stress-strain relations for the compressive tests and tensile tests are also obtained. The compressive Young's modulus, tensile Young's modulus, compressive strength and tensile strength are found to follow the power law relation to the mass density with the exponential factors of 2.31756, 2.33005, 2.6243 and 1.5084, respectively.

AB Solids that exhibit negative Poisson's ratio are called auxetic materials. This paper examines the extent of transverse shear deformation with reference to bending deformation in simply supported auxetic plates as a ratio of Mindlin-to-Kirchhoff plate deflection for polygonal plates in general, with special emphasis on rectangular plates. Results for square plates show that the Mindlin plate deflection approximates the Kirchhoff plate deflection not only when the plate thickness is negligible, as is obviously known, but also when (a) the Poisson's ratio of the plate is very negative under all load distributions, as well as (b) at the central portion of the plate when the load is uniformly distributed. Hence geometrically thick plates are mechanically equivalent to thin plates if the plate Poisson's ratio is sufficiently negative. The high suppression of shear deformation in favor of bending deformation in auxetic plates suggests its usefulness for bending-based plate sensors that require larger difference in the in-plane strains between the opposing plate surfaces with minimal transverse deflection.

AB Auxetics comprise a rare family of materials that manifest negative Poisson's ratio, which causes an expansion instead of contraction under tension. Most known homogeneously auxetic materials are porous foams or artificial macrostructures and there are few examples of inorganic materials that exhibit this behavior as polycrystalline solids. It is now possible to accelerate the discovery of materials with target properties, such as auxetics, using high-throughput computations, open databases, and efficient search algorithms. Candidates exhibiting features correlating with auxetic behavior were chosen from the set of more than 67 000 materials in the Materials Project database. Poisson's ratios were derived from the calculated elastic tensor of each material in this reduced set of compounds. We report that this strategy results in the prediction of three previously unidentified homogeneously auxetic materials as well as a number of compounds with a near-zero homogeneous Poisson's ratio, which are here denoted "anepirretic materials".

ID BEHAVIOR
AB This research is aimed at proposing an enhanced re-entrant hexagonal structure and examining its auxetic behavior in compressive or tensile load conditions. An integrated experimental and finite element analysis (FEA) approach was used to investigate the behavior of the proposed structures in combination with polymeric materials (thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) materials such as Ninjaflex (R) and Semiflex (R)). We focused on the effect of nonlinearity of the structure on the overall stiffness and shock-absorption performance of the body protection pads. FEA models were used to examine how the stiffness and Poisson's ratio are affected by static load conditions and also how the dynamic loads are transmitted through the auxetic structure. The static FEA models were verified through experimental testing. Advanced additive manufacturing (3D printing) techniques such as Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) were used to build fixtures and prototypes of the auxetic polymeric structures. Structural stiffness and Poisson's ratio were examined not only in tensile loading condition but also in compression. Axial and lateral deformations were measured for given axial forces on the experimental model, and the measured values of Poisson's ratio were compared with the computational results. It was shown that the enhanced re-entrant hexagonal structures had nonlinear behavior, which could be a useful property for developing body protection pads and stiffness-varying structures.

AB The aim of this study was to design isotropic periodic microstructures of cellular materials using the bidirectional evolutionary structural optimization (BESO) technique. The goal was to determine the optimal distribution of material phase within the periodic base cell. Maximizing bulk modulus or shear modulus was selected as the objective of the material design subject to an isotropy constraint and a volume constraint. The effective properties of the material were found using the homogenization method based on finite element analyses of the base cell. The proposed BESO procedure utilizes the gradient-based sensitivity method to impose the isotropy constraint and gradually evolve the microstructures of cellular materials to an optimum. Numerical examples show the computational efficiency of the approach. A series of new and interesting microstructures of isotropic cellular materials that maximize the bulk or shear modulus have been found and presented. The methodology can be extended to incorporate other material properties of interest such as designing isotropic cellular materials with negative Poisson's ratio.

AB Auxetic structures are a special class of structural components that exhibit a negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) because of their constituent materials, internal microstructure, or structural geometry. To realize such structures, specialized manufacturing processes are required to achieve a dimensional accuracy, reduction of material wastage, and a quicker fabrication. Hence, additive manufacturing (AM) techniques play a pivotal role in this context. AM is a layer-wise manufacturing process and builds the structure as per the designed geometry with appreciable precision and accuracy. Hence, it is extremely beneficial to fabricate auxetic structures using AM, which is otherwise a tedious and expensive task. In this study, a detailed discussion of the various AM techniques used in the fabrication of auxetic structures is presented. The advancements and advantages put forward by the AM domain have offered a plethora of opportunities for the fabrication and development of unconventional structures. Therefore, the authors have attempted to provide a meaningful encapsulation and a detailed discussion of the most recent of such advancements pertaining to auxetic structures. The article opens with a brief history of the growth of auxetic materials and later auxetic structures. Subsequently, discussions centering on the different AM techniques employed for the realization of auxetic structures are conducted. The basic principle, advantages, and disadvantages of these processes are discussed to provide an in-depth understanding of the current level of research. Furthermore, the performance of some of the prominent auxetic structures realized through these methods is discussed to compare their benefits and shortcomings. In addition, the influences of geometric and process parameters on such structures are evaluated through a comprehensive review to assess their feasibility for the later-mentioned applications. Finally, valuable insights into the applications, limitations, and prospects of AM for auxetic structures are provided to enable the readers to gauge the vitality of such manufacturing as a production method.

AB We investigate the electromechanical properties of two-dimensional MoS2 monolayers with 1H, 1T, and 1T' structures as a function of charge doping by using density functional theory. We find isotropic elastic moduli in the 1H and 1T structures, while the 1T' structure exhibits an anisotropic elastic modulus. Moreover, the 1T structure is shown to have a negative Poisson's ratio, while Poisson's ratios of the 1H and 1T' are positive. By charge doping, the monolayer MoS2 shows a reversible strain and work density per cycle ranging from -0.68% to 2.67% and from 4.4 to 36.9 MJ m(-3), respectively, making them suitable for applications in electromechanical actuators. We also examine the stress generated in the MoS2 monolayers and we find that 1T and 1T' MoS2 monolayers have relatively better performance than 1H MoS2 monolayer. We argue that such excellent electromechanical performance originate from the electrical conductivity of the metallic 1T and semimetallic 1T' structures and also from their high Young's modulus of about 150-200 GPa.

AB This paper presents the out-of-plane mechanism of a laminated open-cell structure that is exerted by a simple control of the geometric configuration. We propose two types of structural units that are assembled with beam and column members in a tetragonal system, and with the geometric difference between them being the presence of a reinforced beam. For the two unit cells, we develop finite element models according to a homogenization method and analyze the macroscopic linear and nonlinear elastic properties. The numerical results show that the cellular structure, which is bridged by additional beams, exhibits strong auxeticity with high negative values of Poisson's ratio in the lamination direction, while retaining the in-plane negative Poisson's ratios. We assess the sensitivity of the linear and nonlinear out-of-plane response to changes in the component geometry. Finally, we discuss the large deformation behaviors of the out-of-plane mechanisms to quantify the amounts of three-dimensional rotations of the internal components.

AB Auxetic fabrics have gained an increasing attention in the auxetic material area in recent years. Especially, auxetic fabrics fabricated based on both weft-knitted and warp-knitted structures have made some important progress. However, all the knitted auxetic fabrics reported so far are fabricated based on 2D knitted structures, although some of the weft-knitted auxetic fabrics are finally formed into 3D forms. This paper reports a novel kind of 3D auxetic fabric fabricated based on a warp-knitted spacer structure with adoption of a special geometrical configuration which is formed with parallelograms. The auxetic behavior of these fabrics is discussed in terms of tensile direction, geometrical parameter, and repeated extension. The shape fitting ability on a spherical surface is also demonstrated. The results shows that the 3D auxetic fabrics have auxetic behavior in all the fabric plane directions and the highest auxetic effect is obtained when stretched in the weft direction of the fabric. The 3D auxetic fabrics also display an excellent shape fitting ability, which makes them very attractive for various applications where fitting to the human body's shape is highly required, such as bra cups, protectors for knees and elbows, shoes covers, etc. (C) 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

TI On the anisotropic and negative thermal expansion from dual-material
   re-entrant-type cellular metamaterials
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
ID RIGID UNIT MODES; DESIGN
AB Negative thermal expansion (NTE) and negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) are counterintuitive material properties that have gained popularity as the focus of many recent works. However, most of the structures previously studied only exhibit NTE or NPR exclusively. One important structure that has already been shown to exhibit NPR is the re-entrant triangle. In this work, the property of NTE in re-entrant triangular cellular structure composed of welded/bonded/brazed ribs of two different materials is investigated via analytical and finite element (FE) modelling. Based on analytical and FE analysis, the geometrical and material parameters for attaining NTE in the re-entrant metamaterial are established. The analysis and simulations reveal the dependence of NTE on the inclination of the longer chevron strut, the dimensionless rod coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), the ratio of thermal expansion coefficients of constituent struts but independent of scale and temperature. The extent of this property becomes more negative for higher values of the angle of the longer chevron strut with the vertical, higher ratios of CTE of the base to chevron strut material and for lower values of the non-dimensional re-entrant base material thermal expansion coefficient. The anisotropic and NTE behaviour is stretch-dominated. Effectively, combined with previous knowledge of NPR in the re-entrant triangle, NTE leads to further significance of such structures for many thermal and mechanical applications, such as composite materials, sensors and electronic components industries in both thermal and mechanical applications.

AB Sandwich panels composed of auxetic cellular cores and metal facets are presented for blast resistance applications. The performance of this hybrid composite structure under impulsive loading is numerically studied, taking into account the rate-dependent effects. The Johnson Cook law is used to model the behaviours of composite materials at high strain rates. Parametric analyses are performed to evaluate the performances of different designs of composite panels and compared with equivalent monolithic panels of identical areal masses in terms of deformations and dissipated plastic energy of the metal facets and auxetic crushable cores. Various design parameters are considered, including the auxetic unit cell effective Poisson's ratio, material properties, thickness of facet, and diameter of the unit cell truss member. To reduce the computational time, a quarter of the panel is modelled with shell elements for the facets and beam elements for the core. In blast events, auxetic composite panels are found to effectively absorb double the amount of impulsive energy via plastic deformation, and reduce up to 70% of the back facet's maximum velocity when compared with monolithic ones. The maximum back facet displacement is also noticeably reduced by up to 30% due to the densification and plastic deformation of the auxetic cores. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The behavior of the chiral S-shaped structure subjected to large tensile loads in bothXandYdirections is reported herein. The physical samples of stainless steel 316L are fabricated by the selective laser melting technique and experimental tests are conducted on a universal tensile testing machine. The results of tensile tests in the form of deformation patterns, tensile stress-strain curves, and Poisson's ratios are shown pictorially and graphically. The orientation of the S-shaped structure withX-direction loading is found to exhibit higher auxeticity over the large range of tensile loading. Nonetheless, the structure is also found auxetic when loaded fromY-direction albeit the values of negative Poisson's ratios are not as high as of theX-directional loading.

AB Studies concerning the relationship between the value of mu and a number of mechanical and thermal properties of amorphous polymers and glasses are analyzed with the aim to gain information about the origin of Poisson ratio mu in these systems. It is shown that the Poisson ratio features a more pronounced structure-sensitive behavior than the elastic modulus, although the Poisson ratio varies in a narrow range. The relationship between the Poisson ratio and the Gruneisen parameter is substantiated. In this context, the issue of the correlation between harmonic and anharmonic quantities is highlighted. The Poisson ratio is sensitive to lattice dynamics and atomic-molecular structures of polymers and glasses. When light atoms, for example, hydrogen atoms in polyethylene, are replaced with larger and heavier atoms on pendant chains of the macromolecular backbone, anharmonicity increases; that is, lattice Gruneisen parameter gamma (D) increases. As a result, the Poisson ratio increases because these quantities are related unambiguously. Conditions of preparing an isotropic material with a negative Poisson ratio (mu < 0) are discussed. The relative ultimate strain of the interatomic bond in glassy systems is a function of the Poisson ratio solely. The frozen elastic strain of amorphous polymers and glasses is likewise a single-valued function of the Poisson ratio. The discussed phenomena are interpreted in terms of the Kuz'menko and Pineda theories and the Berlin-Rothenburg-Bathurst model.

AB Chiral honeycombs are one of the main classes of mechanical metamaterials with the potential to exhibit auxetic behaviour. In this work, we propose a new class of chiral metamaterials based on uniform Euclidean tessellations and their dual counterparts. In total, ten new structures were designed and analysed using Finite Element analysis under periodic boundary conditions, with eight of these systems showing the capability of possessing a negative Poisson's ratio. The relationship between the various geometric parameters defining the systems and the resultant mechanical properties was also studied. We show that 'chiralisation', i.e. introduction of chirality and rotational elements within the system, has the ability to transform even complex geometries, which in their original state possess a high positive Poisson's ratio, into auxetic metamaterials and hope that this work can act as a blueprint for the design of auxetic structures with novel topologies.

AB In the present work, the mechanical properties, in particular, the Poisson's ratio of four two-dimensional silica structures, called here alpha, beta, gamma, and delta are studied by means of molecular dynamics simulations. The alpha structure has been synthesized experimentally and the others have been reported as the most stable low-energy structures that reveal in-plane negative Poisson's ratio based on the first principles calculations. Among these structures, beta-silica exhibits the largest in-plane negative Poisson's ratio which is 2-4 times higher than penta-graphene. Our results illustrate that the classical molecular dynamics simulation reproduces results in agreement with those of the first principles calculations. Consequently, it enables us to study the mechanical responses of considerably larger systems at finite temperatures in contrast to the ab initio simulations. Furthermore, we systematically study the temperature effects on the stability and mechanical properties of these two-dimensional silica structures, up to their rupture points. It is found that the mechanical properties of these structures vary significantly with temperature, and gamma-silica exhibits a switchable behavior in its Poisson's ratio with temperature.

AB A modelling method of auxetic yam (Helical Auxetic Yarn type) cooperating with the composite matrix was presented. The two component yarn surrounded by a flexible material is a fragment of composite, that consists of an auxetic fabric as a reinforcement and a flexible matrix. Such composite can be used in energy absorbing structures. The HAY as an auxetic material is characterized by a negative Poisson's ratio. The stiff fiber spirally wrapped around the elastic core with a larger diameter gives this structure anomalous behaviour during tensile. Stretching of such yarn increases its dimensions in transverse directions. Helical Auxetic Yams are sewn into fabric which is durable, flexible and light. The conducted analysis of the fragment of the composite reflecting one yarn allows for pre-adjustment of values of matrix material parameters. The purpose of the modelling is to determine the values of a composite matrix parameters that should allow the effective work of auxetic yam. If the matrix were too stiff, it would block the capability of bending the core fiber during stretching and the auxetic phenomenon would be cancelled. The key problem is performing these analyses with appropriate value of the Young's modulus of the composite matrix material to get the optimal composite structure. Finite Element Method analyses were conducted in LS-Dyna solver. Discrete model was build using hexagonal, solids elements. It was assumed that the matrix completely filled the spaces between the fibers, and at the outside it had the shape of the cylinder. The choice of such matrix shape allowed to carry out proper interpretation of the displacement values of nodes located at the boundary plane of the matrix model. The displacement of these nodes determines the proper work of the auxetic yarn. Relevant constitutive material models were used to reflect the work of the aramid wrap as well as the elastomeric core and matrix. Nodal displacement was applied to the one of the end of model to simulate tension under static conditions. FEM analyses were based on the implicit method, which is well suited for simulation of static processes, where final state is the most interesting. Based on the results of the conducted analyses, it was possible to choose the appropriate matrix material of the composite without preparation of many composite samples with various elastomer matrix and carrying out many experimental tests.

The full-potential linearized augmented plane-wave (APW) in the framework of the generalized gradient approximation as used as implemented in the Wien2k package. The temperature dependence of thermal expansion coefficient, bulk modulus and heat capacity in a wide range of temperature (0-1600 K) were investigated. The calculated elastic properties of the compounds show that both intermetallic compounds of AlNi and AlNi3 have surprisingly negative Poisson's ratio (NPR).

AB We systematically analyse the mechanical deformation behaviour, in particular Poisson's ratio, of floppy bar-and-joint frameworks based on periodic tessellations of the plane. For frameworks with more than one deformation mode, crystallographic symmetry constraints or minimization of an angular vertex energy functional are used to lift this ambiguity. Our analysis allows for systematic searches for auxetic mechanisms in archives of tessellations; applied to the class of one- or two-uniform tessellations by regular or star polygons, we find two auxetic structures of hexagonal symmetry and demonstrate that several other tessellations become auxetic when retaining symmetries during the deformation, in some cases with large negative Poisson ratios nu < -1 for a specific lattice direction. We often find a transition to negative Poisson ratios at finite deformations for several tessellations, even if the undeformed tessellation is infinitesimally non-auxetic. Our numerical scheme is based on a solution of the quadratic equations enforcing constant edge lengths by a Newton method, with periodicity enforced by boundary conditions.

ID FLEXURAL WAVES; SCATTERING
AB An effective medium theory for resonant and nonresonant metamaterials for flexural waves in thin plates is presented. The theory provides closed-form expressions for the effective mass density, rigidity, and Poisson's ratio of arrangements of isotropic scatterers in thin plates, valid for low frequencies and moderate filling fractions. It is found that the effective Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio are induced by a combination of the monopolar and quadrupolar scattering coefficient, as it happens for bulk elastic waves, while the effective mass density is induced by the monopolar coefficient, contrarily as it happens for bulk elastic waves, where the effective mass density is induced by the dipolar coefficient. It is shown that resonant positive or negative effective elastic parameters are possible, being therefore the monopolar resonance responsible for creating an effective medium with negative mass density. Several examples are given for both nonresonant and resonant effective parameters and the results are numerically verified by multiple scattering theory and finite element analysis.

AB In this paper, a discovery is reported that carbon nanotube (CNT) films can change in-plane Poisson's ratios from negative to positive during a uniaxial tensile loading. First, in situ experimental investigations of the deformation fields about the CNT films fabricated using vertically aligned CNT arrays are performed by digital speckle correlation method, the novel phenomenon for changing Poisson's ratio from negative to positive during the stretching process is discovered. Furthermore, the physical mechanisms for changing the Poisson's ratio from negative to positive are explained based on the interactions among CNTs. Finally, a potential engineering application for designing intelligent connector is proposed based on the intriguing Poisson's ratio of CNT films. (C) 2010 American Institute of Physics.

ID AUXETIC MATERIALS
AB The influences of the cell-wall angle on the indentation resistance of the re-entrant hexagonal honeycombs with negative Poisson's ratio are studied by employing both the numerical tests and the theoretical analysis. In the numerical tests, two groups of honeycombs are investigated, i.e. the same-density group and the same-cell-wall group. It is shown that the honeycomb's indentation resistance increases with the cell-wall angle in the same-density group, while the cell-wall angle plays a minor role in the same-cell-wall group. The theoretical analysis is employed to explain the phenomena. The effect of the negative Poison's ratio is calculated to increase with the cell-wall angle. The average stress of the re-entrant honeycomb during compression is deduced as a function of the cell-wall angle and the cell-wall size or the honeycomb's relative density. The analytical results are consistent with the numerical tests and give an explanation for the phenomena in tests.

AB Seeking novel materials with specific applications is always an attractive theme in developing two-dimensional (2D) materials. Herein, we predicted a series of 2D pentagonal transition metal dichalcogenides, namely penta-MS2 (M = Mn, Ni, Cu/Ag and Zn/Cd) monolayers with alpha and beta configurations, by means of systematic density functional theory (DFT) computations. Six alpha-MS2 monolayers (M = Mn, Ni, Cu/Ag and Zn/Cd) and four beta-MS2 monolayers (M = Ni, Ag, Zn and Cd) were found to have sound thermodynamic, dynamic, thermal, and mechanical stabilities, and the coexistence of covalent and ionic bonding contributes to the structural stability of the pentagonal frameworks. All these 10 stable monolayers have low in-plane Young's moduli (8-94 N m(-1)), among which pentagonal beta-MS2 (M = Ni, Zn and Cd) monolayers have negative Poisson's ratios (NPRs). Three monolayers (alpha-CuS2, alpha-AgS2, and beta-AgS2) are metallic, and seven penta-MS2 monolayers (M = Ni, Zn and Cd with both alpha- and beta-phases, and alpha-MnS2) are semiconducting with band gaps in the range of 2.45-3.32 eV, and these band gaps can be tuned to 1.70-3.05 eV under rather feasible external strains (-8% to 8%). Notably, two monolayers, namely, alpha-NiS2 and beta-ZnS2, are promising candidates for the photocatalysis of water splitting under neutral conditions. This work not only predicted 10 new 2D pentagonal transition metal dichalcogenides as synthesis targets, but also identified their promising applications for flexible nanomechanics, nanoelectronics and photocatalysis for water-splitting.

TI Negative Poisson's ratio in rippled graphene
SO NANOSCALE

DT Article
ID DESIGN; DYNAMICS; DEFECTS; FOAM
AB In this work, we perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study the effect of rippling on the Poisson's ratio of graphene. Due to the atomic scale thickness of graphene, out-of-plane ripples are generated in free standing graphene with topological defects (e.g. heptagons and pentagons) to release the in-plane deformation energy. Through MD simulations, we have found that the Poisson's ratio of rippled graphene decreases upon increasing its aspect ratio eta (amplitude over wavelength). For the rippled graphene sheet eta = 0.188, a negative Poisson's ratio of -0.38 is observed for a tensile strain up to 8%, while the Poisson's ratio for eta = 0.066 is almost zero. During uniaxial tension, the ripples gradually become flat, thus the Poisson's ratio of rippled graphene is determined by the competing factors of the intrinsic positive Poisson's ratio of graphene and the negative Poisson's ratio due to the de-wrinkling effect. Besides, the rippled graphene exhibits excellent fracture strength and toughness. With the combination of its auxetic and excellent mechanical properties, rippled graphene may possess potential for application in nano-devices and nanomaterials.

AB In this work, an analytical model of a 3D re-entrant auxetic cellular structure has been established based on energy method. In the model the overlapping of the struts as well as axial extension or compression (mostly neglected in former studies) were taken into consideration to make the model applicable when the struts are relative stubby which is common in engineering designs. Analytical solutions for the modulus and Poisson's ratios of the cellular structure in all principal directions were deduced. To validate the analytical model in present study, numerical calculations using brick elements were performed on unit cell models with periodic boundary conditions, and comparisons of the present model with analytical formulae and experimental results available in former literatures were also conducted. The results show that when the struts are slender enough, the bending of the struts play decisive role on the deformation of the structure and other mechanisms can be ignored; while when the struts become relative stubby, all the mechanisms including bending, shearing and axial loading need to be considered; The often-ignored axial extension or compression term may even play decisive role on determining the lateral Poisson's ratio of the structure when the struts are relative stubby.

It is shown that such honeycombs are designed to change their shape when subjected to a change in temperature or pressure and can be tailor-made to exhibit particular thermomechanical properties. It is also shown that the anomalous properties of negative thermal expansion/compressibility can be manifested from honeycombs built from common everyday conventional materials. Applications of such constructs are discussed including their role in the manufacture of smart grips which tighten upon heating.

AB Boron arsenate, BAsO4, is crystalline material (I4 over bar group) that was recently shown to be auxetic in its (001) plane for loading in any direction in this plane, and, which exhibits negative linear compressibility at elevated pressured in its [001] direction. This work presents and discusses the results of extensive density functional theory (DFT) based simulations aimed at studying deformations that such crystals undergo when subjected to shear loading in an attempt to obtain a better insight into the manner in which this material responds to mechanical loads. The deformations for shearing in the (001) plane are described in terms of the 'rotating squares' model, which was used to explain the auxeticity in the same plane where it was shown that shear loading results primarily in deformations which make the 'squares' become 'parallelogram-like' rather than rotate. This lack of rigidity in projected 'squares' was discussed by looking at changes in bond lengths and bond angles.

DE Metamaterial; 3D printing; shape memory polymer; buckling
AB As one of the most popular 3D printed metamaterials, the auxetic structure with its tunable Poisson's ratio has attracted huge amount of attention recently. In this study, we designed an auxetic shape-memory metamaterial, which showed designable buckling responses by using the thermomechanically coupled in-plane instability. The influence of viscoelasticity on in-plane moduli and Poisson's ratios of shape-memory auxetic metamaterial was experimentally investigated. Based on the generalized Maxwell model and finite-element method, the buckling behaviors and their main influence factors were studied. The analytical results and experimental ones showed a good agreement. Thermomechanical properties of the printed metamaterials govern the temperature and strain rate-dependent buckling, and a controllable transition from the negative to positive Poisson's ratio in the metamaterials can be achieved. Based on the shape memory effect, the buckled state and the Poisson's ratio of the metamaterials can be tuned by programmed thermomechanical processes. This study provides a simple and efficient way to generate morphing structures using the designable buckling effect.

AB In this study, a shape memory polymer (SMP) based syntactic foam was prepared and programmed by a two-dimensional (2-D) stress condition (tension in one direction and compression in a transverse direction). Thermomechanical properties and microstructures of the foam were characterized. The results show that the 2-D programming method leads the foam towards anisotropy from original isotropy. It is found that, depending on the strain levels in the post-programming uniaxial compression or uniaxial tension tests, the programmed foam exhibits negative Poisson's ratio in the two programmed directions, regardless of the loading direction during the uniaxial testing of the programmed foam. The negative Poisson's ratio may be beneficial for some applications such as sealant in expansion joint, car bumper, seat cushion, and crash helmet in auto industry, nose-cone and wing panel in aircraft, etc. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB A study of the mechanical properties of poly(ferrocenyldimethylsilane) [Fe(eta-C5H4)(2)SiMe2](n), 3, a novel organometallic polymer, has been performed on thin films of this material. The Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of film samples (15 x I x 1 mm) of 3 were measured in quasi-static tension using a video extensometer. For 3, the values of the Young's moduli (E) and Poisson's ratios W were similar between axes in the plane and independent of the splicing direction used during sample preparation. The mean and standard deviation of the Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio were 0.78 +/- 0.08 GPa and 0.37 +/- 0.06 GPa, respectively. Thermomechanical analysis of 3 revealed a steady decrease of E from a room temperature value of approximately 0.70 GPa. Additionally, it was found that at 150 degrees C, 3 was unable to support even small stresses, consistent with the onset of a melt transition (ca. 135 degrees C). A mathematical model based on molecular geometry is developed to describe the results. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB In this paper, a 3D augmented re-entrant cellular structure (ARCS) is proposed and its Poisson's ratios and elastic properties can bemodulated in a wide range. Based on the classical beam theory, the elastic properties on the principle directions are obtained as functions of the structural parameters and then are verified by finite element method (FEM) simulations. Compared with the classical 3D re-entrant cellular structure (RCS), the Young's moduli of the new 3D structure on the principal directions show a significant increase, and the Poisson's ratio can be tunable with the control of the internal parameters of cellular structure. In addition, the elastic properties on off-axis directions are obtained by analytical solutions, which show that the Young's moduli on the off-axis directions are much lower than the principle ones. In addition, the shear moduli also show strong dependence on the loading directions. Moreover, by stretching in the principal directions, the ARCS expands in all vertical directions when the moduli ratio is below 0.5. However, stretching in the off-axis directions, the Poisson's ratios are no longer negative in its vertical directions. The results suggest a possible approach to design new auxetic materials with tunable Poisson's ratios for engineering applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We experimentally determined the uniaxial compressive stress-strain responses of an auxetic polyurethane (PU) foam at quasi-static (0.01/s), intermediate (1/s, 10/s and 745/s) and high (1430/s, 1870/s and 2290/s) strain rates. A hydraulically driven materials testing system (MTS) was used to perform the experiments at the strain rate of 0.1/s, 1/s and 10/s, while higher intermediate (745/s) and high strain-rate compressive loadings were introduced using long and regular Kolsky bars, respectively. The Poisson effect of the auxetic PU foam was also investigated during the experiments using a precision LED optical micrometer system (OMS) (0.01/s-10/s) or an ultra-high speed camera (745/s-2290/s). Our results show that the compressive stress-strain curves of the auxetic PU foam are non-linear and strain-rate sensitive. In all the experiments, the Poisson's ratio, with an initial negative value at small strains, progressively increased toward 0 as the specimen was further compressed. The strain-rate effect on the material's Poisson's ratio is also evident in our study, as the specimens subjected to high strain-rate loadings exhibited smaller negative Poisson's ratios (NPR) in absolute sense at small strains in comparing with those at quasi-static and intermediate strain rates.

AB As high-temperature structural materials, L1(2) intermetallic compounds have attracted the strong interest from both fundamental and industrial aspects. Understanding of elastic property is a basis for the complete investigations of mechanical behavior of L1(2) alloys. In an effort to explore the electronic origin of elastic properties of L1(2) intermetallics, we have performed a systematic study on elastic constants for single crystals, and Young's modulus, shear modulus, bulk modulus and Poisson's ratio for poly-crystals of 22 known Al3X and X3Al-type (X= transition or main group metal) intermetallics using the ab initio calculations. Based on the calculations of elastic constants and extreme (both positive and negative) Poisson's ratios, we found a pronounced correlation between the extreme Poisson's ratio and the elastic anisotropy, i.e., approximate 40% of the investigated L1(2) intermetallics exhibit intrinsic auxetic behavior. Furthermore, based on the distribution of bonding charge densities, we revealed that the ductility and extreme Poisson's ratios were attributable to the directionality of bonds of these alloys. Our findings provide a new method to predict mechanical behavior of intermetallics. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Talc is a hydrous magnesium rich layered silicate that is widely disseminated in the Earth from the seafloor to over 100 kin depth, in ultra-high pressure metamorphism of oceanic crust. In this paper we determine the single crystal elastic constants at pressures from 0 to 12 GPa of talc triclinic(C (1) over bar) and monoclinic(C2/c) polytypes using ab initio methods. We find that talc has an extraordinarily high elastic anisotropy at zero pressure that reduces with increasing pressure. The exceptional anisotropy is complemented by a negative Poisson's ratio for many directions in crystal space. Calculations show that talc is not only one of very few common minerals to exhibit auxetic behaviour, but the magnitude of this effect may be the largest reported so far for a mineral. The compression (Vp) and shear (Vs) wave velocity anisotropy is 80% and 85% for the triclinic polytype. At pressures where talc is known be stable in the Earth (up to 5 GPa) the Vp and Vs anisotropy is reduced to about 40% for both velocities, which is still a very high value. Vp is slow parallel to the c-axis and fast perpendicular to it. This remains unchanged with increasing pressure and is observed in both polytypes. The shear wave splitting (difference between fast and slow S-wave velocities) at low pressure has high values in the plane normal to the c-axis, with a maximum near the a*-axis in the triclinic and the b-axis in the monoclinic polytype. The c-axis is the direction of minimum splitting. The pattern of shear wave splitting does not change significantly with pressure. The volume fraction of talc varies between 11 and 41% for hydrated mantle rocks, but the lack of data on the crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO) precludes a detailed analysis of the impact of talc on seismic anisotropy in subduction zones. However, it is highly likely that CPO can easily develop in zones of deformation due to the platy habit of talc crystals. For random aggregates of talc, the isotropic Vp, Vs and Vp/Vs ratio have significantly lower values than those of antigorite and may explain low-velocity regions in the mantle wedge. Vp/Vs ratios are more complex in anisatropic media because there are fast and slow S-waves, resulting in Vp/Vs1 and Vp/Vs2 ratios for every propagation direction, making interpretation difficult in deformed polycrystalline talc with a CPO. Talc on the subduction plate boundary can strongly influence guided wave velocity as CPO would develop in this region of intense shearing. The very low coefficient of friction (<0.1) of talc above 100 degrees C could also explain silent earthquakes at shallow depths (ca 30 km) along the subduction plate boundaries, frequently responsible for tsunami.

AB A novel mechanism for slithering locomotion of a snake-like soft robot is presented. A rectangular beam with an isotropic coefficient of friction of its contact surface with the flat ground can move forward or backward when actuated by a periodic traveling sinusoidal wave. The Poisson's ratio of the beam plays an important role in the slithering locomotion speed and direction, particularly when it is negative. A theoretical model is proposed to elucidate the slithering locomotion mechanism, which is analogous to the rolling of a wheel on ground. There are two key factors of slithering locomotion: a rotational velocity field and a corresponding local contact region between the beam and ground. During wriggling motion of the rectangular beam, a rotational velocity field is observed near the maximum curvature point of the beam. If the beam has a negative Poisson's ratio, the axial tension will cause a lateral expansion so that the contact region between the beam and ground is located at the outer edge of the maximum curvature (the largest lateral expansion point). The direction of the beam's velocity at this outer edge is usually opposite to the traveling wave direction, so the friction force propels the beam in the direction of the traveling wave. A similar scenario is found for the relatively large amplitude of wriggling motion when the beam's Poisson's ratio is positive. Finite element method (FEM) simulation was conducted to verify the slithering locomotion mechanism, and good agreement was found between the FEM simulation results and theoretical predictions. The insights obtained here present a simple, novel and straightforward mechanism for slithering locomotion and are helpful for future designs of snake-like soft robots.

AB Mechanical properties of a thin magnetic film subjected to an external, rotating magnetic field have been studied by computer simulations. The film is modeled by a two-dimensional bead-spring model of a nonmagnetic polymer matrix with inclusions of magnetic nanoparticles (nanograins) of uniaxial anisotropy, The isotropic polymer matrix is represented as a hexagonal structure with sites decorated with small hexagonal particles containing magnetic nanograins. The beads correspond to polymer segments and the springs between them imitate chemical bonds, approximated by harmonic interactions. The beads also interact by the Lennalcl-Jones potential whose role is to mimic the core of non-bonded polymer segments.
   The Poisson ratio of the constructed polymer matrix is negative, i.e. the system expands laterally under longitudinal stretching force. It is shown that the magneto-elastic coupling can be used to control the expansion and contraction of the polymer matrix. Depending on the applied magnetic field, the Poisson ratio of the magnetic film may assume positive or negative Values. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The current research concerns with the analysis of Stoneley waves propagation along an interface between two dissimilar homogeneous and isotropic halfspace having negative Poisson's ratios (auxetics). The main attention is paid to the case when both contacting media satisfy the Wiechert condition ensuring the existence of Stoneley wave. Closed form expressions are derived for derivatives of the Stoneley secular equation. The velocity of Stoneley waves is analyzed both theoretically and numerically in a broad range of the Wiechert parameter variation.

AB Fibre network mats composed of stainless steel exhibit an unusually large out-of-plane auxeticity (i.e. high negative Poisson's ratio v) when subjected to in-plane tensile loading. In situ observations in a scanning electron microscope suggest that this is attributable to fibre segment straightening. An investigation was carried out on the effects of fibre volume fraction and network thickness on the auxetic response. Weak inter-layer bonding, high fibre content and low network thickness were found to amplify the auxetic effect. (C) 2015 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Sandwich panels with auxetic lattice cores confined between metallic facets are proposed for localised impact resistance applications. Their performance under localised impact is numerically studied, considering the rate-dependent effects. The behaviour of the composite structure material at high strain rates is modelled with the Johnson-Cook model. Parametric analyses are conducted to assess the performance of different designs of the hybrid composite structures. The results are compared with monolithic panels of equivalent areal mass and material in terms of deformations and plastic energy dissipation. Design parameters considered for the parametric analyses include the auxetic unit cell effective Poisson's ratio, thickness of the facet, material properties and radius of the unit cell's struts. Significant reduction in computational time is achieved by modelling a quarter of the panel, with shell elements for facets and beam elements for the auxetic core. With projectile impacts up to 200m/s, the auxetic composite panels are found to be able to absorb a similar amount of energy through plastic deformation, while the maximum back facet displacements are reduced up to 56% due to localised densification and plastic deformation of the auxetic core.

AB Graphene-based materials with a negative Poisson's ratio have numerous potential applications in various fields. However, the modification of graphene is cumbersome and may worsen the mechanical properties. The scale limitation and structural instabilities of suspended graphene are also unfavorable for practical applications. In the present study, we design several nanolayered graphene/Cu composites and investigate their tensile behavior using molecular dynamics simulations. The nanolayered composites exhibit an apparent auxetic behavior without any modification of graphene, as the graphene/Cu interface can significantly enhance the surface effect and lead to an earlier phase transformation of the Cu component. A simultaneous occurrence of a positive and negative Poisson's ratio can be achieved in an asymmetric composite due to the good blocking effect of graphene on two separated Cu films. Materials with simultaneous negative/positive Poisson's ratio have potential applications in scaffold design, where it is necessary to tune the magnitude and polarity of the Poisson's ratio in tissue engineering. Furthermore, we propose a composite consisting of alternating multilayer graphene and thin Cu films to overcome the scale limitation, whose negative Poisson's ratio persists when the total thickness exceeds 100 nm. It is found that the change in the absolute value of Poisson's ratio becomes smaller with an increase in total thickness. Graphene/Cu composites with only a slight deformation under external loading may be suitable for the fabrication of telecommunication cables, whose dimensions should remain unchanged when subjected to high hydrostatic pressure in the deep ocean.

AB Auxetic materials have a negative Poisson's ratio, which can enhance other properties. Greater indentation resistance and energy absorption, as well as synclastic curvature, could lend auxetic materials well to protective sports equipment and clothing. Sheets of foam often form padding within protective equipment, but producing large homogenous auxetic foam samples is challenging. The aim of this work was to investigate techniques to fabricate large thin sheets of auxetic foam, to facilitate future production and testing of prototype sports equipment utilizing this material. A mold was developed to fabricate sheets of auxetic foam - with planar dimensions measuring 350x350mm - using the thermo-mechanical process. The mold utilized through-thickness rods to control lateral compression of foam. Sheets of auxetic foam measuring 10x350x350mmd were fabricated and characterized. Each sheet was cut into nine segments, with density measurements used to determine how evenly the foam had been compressed during fabrication. Specimens cut from corner and centre segments were subject to quasi-static extension up to 30% to obtain stress versus strain relationships, with Digital Image Correlation used to determine Poisson's ratio. Specimens cut from the corner tended to have a marginally higher density, lower stiffness and more consistent negative Poisson's ratio compared to those from the centre, indicating some inconsistency in the conversion process. Future work could look to improve fabrication techniques for large thin homogenous sheets of auxetic foam.

AB Sandwich structures have superior mechanical properties to be applied in civil, marine, mechanical and aerospace engineering fields. Auxetic structures with negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) can contract laterally when compressed axially to be excellent fillers for the sandwich structures to improve the energy absorption performance. In this work, a cylindrical sandwich filled with double arrowed auxetic structure is proposed. An analytical model is established to predict the dynamic responses of the sandwich structure under axial impact loading. The theoretical model is composed of three parts: energy dissipated due to the auxetic filler, the thin walled tubes, and their interaction. Numerical simulations are performed to validate the theoretical model and the results indicate that the theoretical model proposed is accurate to predict the crushing platform stress of the cylindrical sandwich under axial impact loading.

AB Mechanical behaviors of a new foam filled 2D re-entrant hexagonal honeycomb with negative Poisson's ratio under planar compression have been investigated in this paper. Re-entrant hexagonal unit cell specimens were fabricated by aluminum alloy and polyurethane foam. The deformation modes and force-displacement curves of the unit cell specimens under compression were carried out experimentally and numerically, and a good agreement was observed between experimental results and numerical simulation results. Subsequently, mechanical behaviors of foam filled and void re-entrant hexagonal honeycomb under planar compression were observed by numerical simulation. Compared to the void honeycomb, the foam filled honeycomb has a higher specific energy absorption capability due to a higher plateau stress. According to the mechanism of auxetic effect, the re-entrant honeycomb would move inward when subjected to compression along the orthogonal direction, which cause a biaxial compression of the foam and an increasing of stiffness/strength/energy absorption capability. The present investigations provide thorough insight into the strengthened re-entrant hexagonal cellular honeycomb, and could be used in the development of novel light weight smart functional structures.

Parametric analyses are performed for each of the three concurrent models (two 2-mode models where dilation acts with each rotation mechanism (the CTM1 and CTM2 models), and the model where all three mechanisms operate (CTM3)) to explore the Poisson's ratio dependency on the key model geometrical and deformation strength parameters. Predictions in good agreement with all experimental on-axis Poisson's ratios specifically for silica -cristobalite are possible for the new CTM3 model comprising two tetrahedral rotation mechanisms acting concurrently with tetrahedral dilation when direction-dependent strength parameters are employed. This is a significant improvement over the previous analytical model incorporating the tetrahedral dilation and first tetrahedral rotation mechanisms and which only achieved good agreement for loading along the longitudinal x(3) axis.

ID DESIGN
AB This paper reports a development of bi-stretch auxetic woven fabrics by using non-auxetic yarns and weaving technology. The fabric structure is first designed based on a re-entrant hexagonal geometry by combination of loose weave and tight weave in a woven fabric structure, and then fabricated on a rapier weaving machine by using both non-elastic and elastic yarns. Two variations of the fabric are produced by using different elastic yarn arrangement in weft direction. The designed auxetic geometry is finally achieved after a washing process due to creation of non-uniform contraction or shrinkage profiles within the fabric structural unit cell. The testing results showed that the developed fabrics exhibit negative Poisson ratio effect in both weft and warp directions in a large range of tensile strain.

AB Stress shielding and micromotions are the most significant problems occurring at the bone-implants interface due to a mismatch of their mechanical properties. Mechanical 3D metamaterials, with their exceptional behaviour and characteristics, can provide an opportunity to solve the mismatch of mechanical properties between the bone and implant. In this study, a new porous femoral hip meta-implant with graded Poisson's ratio distribution was introduced and its results were compared to three other femoral hip implants (one solid implant, and two porous meta-implants, one with positive and the other with a negative distribution of Poisson's ratio) in terms of stress and micromotion distributions. For this aim, first, a well-known auxetic 3D re-entrant structure was studied analytically, and precise closed-form analytical relationships for its elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio were derived. The results of the analytical solution for mechanical properties of the 3D re-entrant structure presented great improvements in comparison to previous analytical studies on the structure. Moreover, the implementation of the re-entrant structure in the hip implant provided very smooth results for stress and strain distributions in the lattice meta-implants and could solve the stress shielding problem which occurred in the solid implant. The lattice meta-implant based on the graded unit cell distribution presented smoother stress-strain distribution in comparison with the other lattice meta-implants. Moreover, the graded lattice meta-implant gave minimum areas of local stress and local strain concentration at the contact region of the implants with the internal bone surfaces. Among all the cases, the graded meta-implant also gave micromotion levels which are the closest to values reported to be desirable for bone growth (40 mu m).

AB We develop a lattice structure of a desired Poisson's ratio that is maintained when subjected to finite deformation. Using a gradient-based design optimization in an isogeometric computational framework, the representative unit cell is sophisticatedly tailored to attain the controlled Poisson's ratio of up to -2. The ligaments of the lattice structure are modeled using geometrically exact beams whose configuration and cross-sectional area are regarded as design variables, which are parameterized by the higher order B-spline basis functions. The obtained optimal design is fabricated using a PolyJet 3-D printing machine and validated by physical experiments. Excellent quantitative agreement is observed between the numerical and the experimental results measured from an optical deformation measurement system.

AB In this paper, a novel three-dimensional (3D) lattice honeycomb is developed based on a twodimensional (2D) accordion-like honeycomb. A combination of theoretical and numerical analysis is carried out to gain a deeper understanding of the elastic behavior of the new honeycomb and its dependence on the geometric parameters. The results show that the proposed new honeycomb can simultaneously achieve an in-plane negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) effect and an out-of-plane zero Poisson's ratio (ZPR) effect. This unique property may be very promising in some important fields, like aerospace, piezoelectric sensors and biomedicine engineering. The results also show that the geometric parameters, such as the slant angle, the strut thickness and the relative density, have a significant effect on the mechanical properties. Additionally, different dominant deformation models of the new honeycomb when compressed along the x (or y) and z directions are identified. This work provides a new concept for the design of honeycombs with a doubly unusual performance.

AB Materials or structures that contract in the transverse direction under uniaxial compression, or expand laterally when stretched are said to have negative Poisson's ratios. A theoretical approach to the prediction of negative Poisson's ratios of re-entrant honeycombs has been developed which is based on the large deflection model. The equations of the deflection curves of the inclined member of the re-entrant cell, strains and Poisson's ratios of re-entrant honeycombs in two orthogonal directions have been derived. The deformed shapes of the inclined members of the re-entrant cell are calculated. The negative Poisson's ratios of re-entrant honeycombs are no longer a constant at large deformation. They vary significantly with the strain. The effect of the geometric parameters of the cell on the Poisson's ratios is analyzed.

AB Auxetic materials and structures exhibit a negative Poisson's ratio while thick plates encounter shear deformation, which is not accounted for in classical plate theory. This paper investigates the effect of a negative Poisson's ratio on thick plates that are subjected to buckling loads, taking into consideration the shear deformation using Mindlin plate theory. Using a highly accurate shear correction factor that allows for the effect of Poisson's ratio, the elastic stability of circular and square plates are evaluated in terms of dimensionless parameters, namely the Mindlin-to-Kirchhoff critical buckling load ratio and Mindlin critical buckling load factors. Results for thick square plates reveal that both parameters increase as the Poisson's ratio becomes more negative. In the case of thick circular plates, the Mindlin-to-Kirchhoff critical buckling load ratios and the Mindlin critical buckling load factors increase and decrease, respectively, as the Poisson's ratio becomes more negative. The results obtained herein show that thick auxetic plates behave as thin conventional plates, and therefore suggest that the classical plate theory can be used to evaluate the elastic stability of thick plates if the Poisson's ratio of the plate material is sufficiently negative. The results also suggest that materials with highly negative Poisson's ratios are recommended for square plates, but not circular plates, that are subjected to buckling loads.

AB This study presents an application of the material topology optimization approach using Gauss point density as a design variable in order to mechanically investigate and then design material possessing structures constructed by materials with a negative Poisson's ratio. Materials with a positive Poisson's ratio are commonly utilized for structures. However, the materials are more fragile than those of negative Poisson's ratio with respect to impact resistance or tolerance. The topological optimal results provide basic and mechanical information to develop the materials with a negative Poisson's ratio. Numerical examples of cross-formed structures such as beam-to-column connections demonstrate the efficiency of topology optimization tool in order to analyze materials with positive and negative Poisson's ratios.

ID BIMATERIAL LATTICES; OPTIMIZATION; COMPOSITES; DESIGN
AB Low coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) lattices occupy a unique area of property space. With such a system, it is possible to achieve relatively high stiffness, with opportunities to combine low thermal expansion and with a range of advantageous properties. Possibilities include combinations that are not rivaled by any bulk material, e.g., low CTE and high melting temperature, and low CTE with low conductivity. One design in particular, the UCSB Lattice, has biaxial stiffness very near theoretical upper bounds when the joints are pinned. Bonded lattices are found to inherit the near optimal performance of the parent pin-jointed design. Despite near optimal performance, however, stiffnesses and strengths are limited to a few percent of the relative property of the constituents. The local deformations necessary to accommodate low net CTE are similar to those of auxetic lattices, with similar behavior, having a low, zero, or negative tunable Poisson's ratio. An investigative framework, including experiments, finite element, and analytical formulas, is used to construct these assessments.

AB The bumper system always directly causes the injury of the pedestrian leg in the car-pedestrian accidents. Therefore, it is of practical significance to optimize the bumper structure to enhance the protective effect of the pedestrian leg. Based on the original bumper system, this work proposes a novel negative Poisson's ratio energy-absorbing forepart with inner hexagonal cellular structure, which is designed at the lower leg impact zone between the bumper beam and the cover. The parametric model of the negative Poisson's ratio forepart, the lower legform impactor model, and the car-pedestrian collision model are firstly established. Then, through integrating the response surface method, second-order reliability method, and archive-based micro genetic algorithm, a reliability optimization design is further conducted for the negative Poisson's ratio forepart based on the deterministic optimization results. Simulation results show that the optimized negative Poisson's ratio forepart not only can significantly enhance the reliability and robustness, but also improve the protective effect of the pedestrian leg.

AB Using experimental data, it is shown that the Poisson's ratios of standard (untreated) open cell polyurethane foam vary when loading in different loading directions, since foam is inherently asymmetric and anisotropic. The loading direction which is in plane orthogonal to the rise direction of the foam constantly exhibited the most negative Poisson's ratio across foam samples of different types, even at moderate compressive strains. It was also shown that although the foam may become auxetic at very high values of compressive strain, it shows an incremental negative Poisson's ratio at moderate compressive strains. The results obtained are discussed in light of the deformation mechanisms, which have been proposed in literature to explain negative Poisson's ratios in foams. The effects of changing loading direction on the mechanical response of the foam are highlighted. (C) 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB Metamaterials with arbitrary negative Poisson's ratio(NPR) can be designed by functional element topology optimization method, but modelling theory of this method is not investigated thoroughly, including functional element, volume fraction ration, the definition of objective functions and NPR constraints. In this paper, functional element with different shapes (triangle and rectangle), method of evaluating macroscopic NPR value, and three categories of objective functions: maximum compliance, minimum mass, minimum compliance, are conducted. A series of metamaterials structures with arbitrary NPR (the ratio range is -0.3 to -6.0) are designed, and the NPR values of these metamaterials structures are verified. Static analysis shows that the Poisson's ratio between single functional element and macroscopic metamaterials structure are consistent with each other (error rate is 3.3%). Dynamic analysis to explore the vibration reduction performance of the metamaterials structure. All our works provide a method and theory for the design of novel metamaterials structure with arbitrary specified NPR.

AB Metamaterials are inherently advantageous in achieving designable auxeticity since their Poisson' ratios are determined by the geometry of their unit cells. A family of auxetic metamaterials was created by computer-aided design (CAD) and dual-material three-dimensional (3D) printing. The effects of material selections and stiff material fraction on the Poisson's ratio, equivalent Young's Modulus, and maximum volume reduction were investigated. The results from finite element analysis (FEA) and mechanical testing indicated that the auxeticity and mechanical properties of this dual-material auxetic metamaterial (DMAM) are distinctly different from those of traditional single-material auxetic metamaterials (SMAMs). The interesting properties of DMAMs could be valuable to various engineering applications such as smart materials, biomedical components, and shock-resistant components. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

SO SN APPLIED SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
DE Auxetic; Conventional; Metamaterials; Microstructural duality
ID AUXETIC MATERIALS; MECHANICS
AB Neither positive nor negative Poisson's ratio materials are fully advantageous across a wide range of load bearing applications. In some cases, it is advantageous for structures to possess duality in material properties so as to take advantage of auxetic behavior under one loading condition as well as conventional behavior when the loading condition changes. This paper proposes two metamaterials-the hybrid rhombic-re-entrant metamaterial and the hybrid kite-arrowhead metamaterial-in which the prescription of either compressive or tensile load always leads to lateral expansion. Specifically, the Poisson's ratio of these metamaterials range from negative infinity to zero upon tensile load, and from zero to positive infinity upon compressive load. This duality of auxetic and conventional behavior for each of these metamaterial is achieved by employing a simultaneous lock and slide mechanism that is interchangeable upon load reversal. When loaded in one direction, the locked part takes effect while the sliding part becomes redundant. Upon load direction reversal, the previously locked and sliding parts convert to sliding and locked parts, respectively, thereby activating the redundant part while deactivating the functional part. The change in effective microstructural components, therefore, facilitates Poisson's ratio sign toggling with load reversal. Due to the indiscriminate lateral expansion regardless of the axial loading direction, such behavior in a fiber is useful to resist both fiber pull-out as well as fiber push-out from the matrix material.

AB This paper investigates the suitability of auxetic materials for load-bearing circular plates. This herein shown that the optimal Poisson's ratio for minimizing the bending stresses is strongly dependent on the final deformed shape, load distribution, and the type of edge supports. Specifically, the use of auxetic material for circular plates is recommended when (a) the plate is bent into a spherical or spherical-like cap, (b) a point load is applied to the center of the plate regardless of the edge conditions, and (c) a uniform load is applied on a simply-supported plate. However, auxetic materials are disadvantaged when a flat plate is to be bent into a saddle-like shell. The optimal Poisson's ratios concept recommended in this paper is useful for providing an added design consideration. In most cases, the use of auxetic materials for laterally loaded circular plates is more advantageous compared to the use of materials with conventional Poisson's ratio, with other factors fixed. This is achieved through materials-based stress redistribution in addition to the common practices of dimensioning-based stress redistribution and materials strengthening.

AB The in-plane dynamic crushing behaviors and energy-absorbed characteristics of honeycombs with negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) have been studied by means of explicit dynamic finite element analysis (DFEA) using ANSYS/LS-DYNA. First, the honeycomb models filled with different reentrant cells by the variation of micro-cell configuration parameters (cell-wall angle and shape ratio) are established. The respective influences of micro-structure and impact velocities on the deformation behaviors, the dynamic plateau stresses and the absorbed energy of reentrant honeycombs are explored in detail. It is shown that owing to the variation of cell micro-structure, reentrant honeycombs display different macro-/micro- deformation properties during the crushing. For the given impact velocity, the dynamic plateau stresses are related to the shape ratio by a power law and to the cell-wall angle by least-square curves. And they are also proportional to the square of impact velocities for a high impact velocity. Based on the finite element simulated results and one-dimensional shock wave theory, an empirical formula for auxetic honeycomb to predict the dynamic plateau stress is derived in terms of relative density and impact velocity.

AB The comprehensive elastic properties of Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks (ZIF-1 to ZIF-4) have been computed using density functional theory (DFT). We employed the periodic CRYSTAL14 code to calculate the single-crystal elastic coefficients (C-ij) at the B3LYP level of theory. While the chemical compositions of ZIFs-1 to -4 are the same, each structure features a distinct network topology, crystal symmetry and porosity configuration, which translate into differential structure-function mechanical correlations. We elucidate the anisotropic mechanical response with respect to the directionally dependent Young's and shear moduli properties. Our theoretical results suggest that ZIF-3 adopting a dft topology has an extremely low shear resistance (G(min) = 0.1 GPa), which is also underpinning the flexible mechanism responsible for its negative Poisson's ratio (auxetic v(min) = -0.43). Interestingly, we identified that ZIF-1, ZIF-2, and ZIF-4 could exhibit a nearly zero Poisson's ratio for certain crystal orientations, which is reminescent of a rare "cork-like" phenomenon where there is practically no lateral deformation corresponding to an applied axial strain. Furthermore, we determined the bulk moduli and linear compressibilities, alongside the averaged elastic properties of the ZIF polycrystals.

AB The objective of the paper is to study the effect of negative Poisson's ratio on the crack tip field under the application of external mechanical load and temperature. Explicit and analytical expressions for the fracture mechanics parameters such as stress intensity factors and the energy release rate are obtained. The expressions for the thermal loads are derived in axisymmetric cylindrical coordinates under the framework of steady-state uncoupled linear thermoelasticity. Numerical results are presented graphically to demonstrate the effect of negative Poisson's ratio on the crack tip field. The results show that for the case of applied mechanical loads, materials with negative Poisson's ratio have higher energy release rate. However, if the applied are thermal loads, the crack tip fracture mechanics parameters are significantly decreased. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The multilayer orthogonal auxetic composites have been previously developed and tested to prove that they own excellent energy absorption and impact protection characteristics in a specific strain range under low-velocity impact. In this study, a three dimensional finite element (FE) model in ANSYS LS-DYNA was established to simulate the mechanical behavior of auxetic composites under low-velocity drop-weight impact. The simulation results including the Poisson's ratio versus compressive strain curves and the contact stress versus compressive strain curves were compared with those in the experiments. The clear deformation pictures of the FE models have provided a simple and effective way for investigating the damage mechanism and optimizing the material, as well as structure design.

AB The experimentally verified negative Poisson's ratio of black phosphorus allows the extension of the medical and defense applications to the nanoscale regime without any artificial engineering. With a structure analogous to monolayer black phosphorus, monolayer SiS, SiSe, SnTe, and W-phase antimonene are predicted to show auxetic behavior, while a W-phase antimonene does not by using first-principles calculations. By putting these systems into a collective perspective with other puckered two-dimensional (2D) materials, we further formulate a uniform mechanism that could explain the different types of out-of-plane Poisson's ratio in the puckered 2D materials including monolayer group V-enes (BP, As, and Sb) and group IV monochalcogenides (SiS, SiSe, GeS, GeSe, SnS, SnSe, and SnTe). We found that both the structure and composition of the puckered monolayers play important roles in the out-of-plane Poisson's ratio.

AB Auxetic textiles have been the focus of much attention due to their great promise for advanced protective clothing, flexible energy harvest devices, and functional textiles. Herein, plain fabric, basket fabric, and a derivative weave with the warp and weft yarns arrangement in a series of zigzags were prepared by incorporating different initial wrap density helical auxetic yarns in the weft direction using a commercial semi-automatic loom. The derivative weave using HAYs with a 150 m(-1) initial wrap density as the weft yarn not only possesses superior auxetic behavior but also has good performance in strength and elasticity-essential properties useful for textile daily application. This fabric exhibits a high auxetic effect (nu = -0.585), low elastic deformation (total deformation of 8.4% at 20% strain), excellent flexibility, and high break load. Moreover, by taking account of the key geometric parameters, a systematic discussion of the fabrics has been completed to evaluate the effect on the auxetic behavior; this clarified that changing the fabric structure and initial wrap density of a HAY is an effective strategy to tailor auxetic behavior without compromising the intrinsic properties of components. On the basis of our research, auxetic textiles can be considered a promising candidate for next-generation smart textiles and advanced functional textiles.

AB Auxetic materials are a class of materials possessing a negative Poisson's ratio. Here, we established a novel method for preparing auxetic foam from closed-cell polymer foam based on the steam penetration and condensation (SPC) process. Using polyethylene (PE) closed-cell foam as an example, the foams treated by the SPC process presented a negative Poisson's ratio during stretching and compression testing. The effect of steam-treated temperature and time on the conversion efficiency of negativePoisson's ratio foam was investigated, and the mechanism of the SPC method for forming a reentrant structure was discussed. The results indicated that the presence of enough steam within the cells was a critical factor for the negative Poisson's ratio conversion in the SPC process. The pressure difference caused by steam condensation was the driving force for the conversion from conventional closed-cell foam to the negative-Poisson's ratio foam. Furthermore, the applicability of the SPC process for fabricating auxetic foam was studied by replacing PE foam by polyvinyl chloride foam with a closed-cell structure or replacing water steam by ethanol steam. The results verified the universality of the SPC process for fabricating auxetic foams from conventional foams with a closed-cell structure. In addition, we explored the potential application of the obtained auxetic foams by the SPC process in the fabrication of shape-memory polymer materials.

AB A new 2D microstructure is proposed herein in the form of rigid unit cells, each taking the form of a cross with two opposing crossbars forming slots and the other two opposing crossbars forming sliders. The unit cells in the microstructure are arranged in a rectangular array in which the nearest four neighboring cells are rotated by 90 degrees such that a slider in each unit cell is connected to a slot from its nearest neighbor. Using a kinematics approach, the Poisson's ratio along the axes of symmetry can be obtained, while the off-axis Poisson's ratio is obtained using Mohr's circle. In the special case of a square array, the results show that the Poisson's ratio varies between 0 (for loading parallel to the axes) and -1 (for loading at 45 degrees from the axes). For a rectangular array, the Poisson's ratio varies from 0 (for loading along the axes) to a value more negative than -1. The obtained results suggest the proposed microstructure is useful for designing materials that permit rapid change in Poisson's ratio for angular change.

AB The low velocity impact resistance of auxetic carbon fibre laminates has been compared to that of laminates with matched through-the-thickness modulus, but with Poisson's ratios of near zero and positive values. Four impact loads corresponding to major events in the static indentation response were examined and damage was assessed by ultrasonic C-scans, detailed fractography and measurement of residual properties. It was found that enhancements were seen in resistance to low velocity for the auxetic laminates, but only at low energy levels, indicating some degree of rate dependency.

AB A cylindrical negative Poisson's ratio (CNPR) structure based on two-dimensional double-arrow negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) structure was introduced in this paper. The CNPR structure has excellent stiffness, damping and energy absorption performances, and can be applied as spring, damper and energy absorbing components. In this study, the CNPR structure was used as a jounce bumper in vehicle suspension, and the load-displacement curve of NPR jounce bumper was discussed. Moreover, the influences of structural parameters and materials on the load-displacement curve of NPR jounce bumper were specifically researched. It came to the conclusion that only the numbers of cells and layers impact the hardening displacement of NPR jounce bumper. And all parameters significantly affect the structure stiffness at different displacement periods. On the other hand, the load-displacement curve of NPR jounce bumper should be in an ideal region which is difficult to be achieved applying mathematical optimization method. Therefore, a parametric design strategy of NPR jounce bumper was proposed according to the parametric analysis results. The design strategy had two main steps: design of hardening displacement and design of stiffness. The analysis results proved that the proposed method is reliable and is also meaningful for relevant structure design problem.

ID POISSONS RATIO
AB This short brief develops a model for the velocity of longitudinal wave propagation in auxetic rods. Due to the large density change in auxetic solids and significant lateral deformation for Poisson's ratio between -1 and -0.5, this note takes into consideration density correction and lateral inertia. Results show that deviation from the elementary wave propagation model becomes more significant the more the Poisson's ratio of the rod material deviates from 1/4, in which the deviation of wave velocity is insignificant for Poisson's ratio in the positive range, but significant in the negative range. Specifically, the tensile and compressive wave velocity increases and decreases, respectively, for Poisson's ratio less than 1/4, but this trend reverses for Poisson's ratio greater than 1/4. In addition to showing that the elementary wave propagation model is invalid for describing the longitudinal wave velocity in auxetic rods, the results also suggest that auxetic materials are useful for applications that require slowing down and speeding up of compressive and tensile wave propagations, respectively.

AB We utilized molecular statics (MS) simulations to investigate the auxeticity of single layer black phosphorus (SLBP). Our simulation results show that the SLBP has a negative in-plane Poisson's ratio in the zigzag direction when the applied strain along the armchair direction exceeds 0.018. We show that the interplay between bond stretching and bond rotating modes determines the in-plane Poisson's ratio behavior. While the bond stretching mode always tends to increase the in-plane auxeticity, the bond rotating mode might increase or decrease the in-plane auxeticity. Furthermore, we show that graphite also exhibits an in-plane negative Poisson's ratio at finite strains due to a similar mechanism.

AB Auxetic materials, which have negative Poisson's ratio, show potential to be used in many interesting applications. Finite element analysis (FEA) is an important phase in implementing auxetic materials, but may become computationally expensive because simulation often needs microscale details and a fine mesh. It is also necessary to check that topological aspects of the microscale reflects not only micro but macromechanical behavior. This work presents a phenomenological approach to the problem using data-driven spline-based techniques to properly characterize orthotropic auxetic material requiring neither analytical constraints nor micromechanics, expanding on previous methods for isotropic materials. Hyperelastic energies of auxetic orthotropic material are determined from experimental data by solving the equilibrium differential functional equations directly, so no fitting or analytical estimation is necessary. This offers two advantages; (i) it allows the FEA study of orthotropic auxetic materials without requiring micromechanics considerations, reducing modeling and computational time costs by two to three orders of magnitude; (ii) it adapts the hyperelastic energies to the nature of the material with precision, which could be critical in scenarios where accuracy is essential (e.g. robotic surgery).

ID BEHAVIOR
AB This paper describes a modified manufacturing route involving a large change in density in auxetic negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) foams. Density change of auxetic foams after manufacturing is a common feature for this porous material. Samples of open cell PU-PE (i.e. the combination of polyurethane-polyethylene) foams with NPR are produced from two similar native materials using both the classical and the novel custom manufacturing methods. In the classical manufacturing route the cooling process is typically carried out with the foam in a confined state. Conversely, in the new manufacturing process it was substituted with a release process. Samples were subjected to both tensile and compressive loading, as well as density measurements. A thorough mechanical characterisation of the foams is described, linking the mechanical properties with their change in density after conversion into auxetic. (C) 2010 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Spectral analysis of the matrix dispersion equation for the longitudinal axially symmetric modes is performed. Analytical expressions for displacement fields are obtained. Variation of the wave polarization due to variation of Poisson's ratio for mild auxetics (Poisson's ratio is greater than -0.5) is analyzed and compared with the non- auxetics. It is observed that polarization of the waves for both considered cases (auxetics and non- auxetics) exhibits abnormal behavior in the vicinity of the bulk shear wave speed.

AB Large auxetic properties of iron-gallium and iron-aluminum alloys have been investigated with both theoretical and experimental approaches. Tensile tests of single-crystal iron-gallium alloys with compositions of 12%-25% gallium were conducted to determine the composition dependent values of the Poisson's ratio. Systematic density functional calculations revealed a simple correlation between the Poisson's ratio and tetragonal shear modulus. We attribute the auxetic properties of these intermetallic alloys to the drastic reduction in C' with the presence of metalloid atoms in the DO(3)-type structures.

AB In the current work we analyze the bulk and normal to shear properties of a wide range of two-dimensional artificial materials under small deformations. To that scope, we employ reentrant, chiral, triangular and rectangular-shaped based unit-cell arrangements. We characterize their mechanical response, using a homogenization analysis method. We identify inner material architectures of high and low relative resistance to pressure and to shear loads. We classify the metastructures' mechanical behavior with respect to the one expected for common isotropic engineering materials. We observe considerable differences for most of the analyzed structures for which we provide insights making use of symmetry analysis notions. What is more, we identify lightweight inner material designs for certain bulk and normal to shear behaviors to be obtained, while we unravel the role of the Poisson's ratio value on the retrieved effective attributes. We quantify the impact of alterations in the metamaterials' inner design parameters, such as in the slenderness ratio of its inner elements, reporting unit-cell designs that yield macroscopic relative mechanical properties (bulk and normal to shear attributes) that are insensitive to inner element slenderness changes.

AB Fully generalised analytical expressions for longitudinal Poisson's ratio are developed for armchair and zigzag Single-Walled Nanotubes (SWNTs) using an energy equivalent approach. Deformation is assumed due to simultaneous bond stretching and bond angle variation in response to an applied axial load. A parametric study is then performed to explore under what circumstances SWNTs may exhibit auxetic (negative Poisson's ratio) response. In principle, auxetic behaviour can be achieved by modifying the hexagonal cell shape to adopt a re-entrant geometry for the case of bond angle variation being the dominant deformation mechanism. Alternatively, altering the length of the characteristic bond oriented in an off-axis direction to below a critical. value or modifying the force constants governing the deformation modes so that bond stretching dominates for the conventional hexagonal cell shape can also lead to auxetic behaviour.

AB Force field-based simulations have been employed to model the mechanical properties of a range of undeformed molecular polymeric honeycombs having conventional and re-entrant hexagon pores. The conventional and re-entrant hexagon honeycombs are predicted to display positive and negative in-plane Poisson's ratios, respectively, confirming previous simulations. The structure, and mechanical and mass transport properties of a layered re-entrant honeycomb (( 2,8)-reflexyne) were studied in detail for a uniaxial load applied along the x(2) direction. The mechanical properties are predicted to be stress( strain-) dependent and the trends can be interpreted using analytical expressions from honeycomb theory. Transformation from negative to positive Poisson's ratio behaviour is predicted at an applied stress of sigma(2) = 2 GPa. Simulations of the loading of C-60 and C-70 guest molecules into the deformed layered (2,8)-reflexyne host framework demonstrate the potential for tunable size selectivity within the host framework. The entrapment and release of guest molecules is attributed to changes in the size and shape of the pores in this host - guest system.

AB The term "mechanical metamaterials" encompasses a wide range of systems whose anomalous mechanical properties arise primarily from their structure rather than composition. This unique characteristic gives the man edge over many conventional natural or readily available materials and makes them well-suited for a variety of applications where tailor-made mechanical properties are required. In this study, we present a new class of mechanical metamaterials featuring various star-shaped perforations, which have the potential to exhibit auxetic or zero Poisson's ratio (nu) properties. Using finite element modelling in conjunction with experimental measurements on 3D printed prototypes, we demonstrate that these star-shaped porous systems possess the potential to retain their unusual mechanical properties up to tensile strains exceeding 15%. By virtue of these exceptional properties, the proposed concept could be applied for engineering numerous potential applications in a wide range of fields. (c) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Materials with a negative Poisson's ratio, also known as auxetic materials, exhibit unusual and counterintuitive mechanical behaviour-becoming fatter in cross-section when stretched. Such behaviour is mostly attributed to some special re-entrant or hinged geometric structures regardless of the chemical composition and electronic structure of a material. Here, using first-principles calculations, we report a class of auxetic single-layer two-dimensional materials, namely, the 1T-type monolayer crystals of groups 6-7 transition-metal dichalcogenides, MX2 (M = Mo, W, Tc, Re; X = S, Se, Te). These materials have a crystal structure distinct from all other known auxetic materials. They exhibit an intrinsic in-plane negative Poisson's ratio, which is dominated by electronic effects. We attribute the occurrence of such auxetic behaviour to the strong coupling between the chalcogen p orbitals and the intermetal t(2g)-bonding orbitals within the basic triangular pyramid structure unit. The unusual auxetic behaviour in combination with other remarkable properties of monolayer two-dimensional materials could lead to novel multi-functionalities.

AB In the past decades, auxetic structures have received great attention because of their unique properties and outstanding performance over the traditional materials. However, the inherent porosity significantly reduce the moduli of the structures, making auxetic structures inappropriate for load-bearing components. This paper introduces a rounded re-entrant honeycomb (RH) pattern, in which the rounded corners stiffen the traditional RH pattern by suppressing the hinging mechanism. Four design parameters were identified to define a rounded RH unit cell, and the effect of each of them on structure properties was numerically studied. The results demonstrated the extended tunable range of mechanical properties and the possibility of building lightweight and stiffer structures, as well as significantly improved tensile and shear moduli. It is also noticed that the Poisson's ratio shifts towards positive as the radius of the rounded corner increases. Several design strategies were proposed for achieving different design goals. The proposed rounded RH pattern could be an alternative for the existing RH pattern design, especially in the applications requesting for the lightweight and rigid auxetic structure.

AB Finite Element (FE) modelling is used to investigate the effect of varying the rib thickness on the mechanical properties of conventional and re-entrant periodic honeycombs. The calculations confirm that the re-entrant honeycomb has a negative Poisson's ratio. The data show that the mechanical properties vary not only with honeycomb relative density, but also on how the relative density variation is achieved. Reducing the thickness of 'vertical' ribs, whilst maintaining constant 'diagonal' rib thickness, does not alter the Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio in the x direction (E-x and V-xv), but does lead to a decrease in the magnitude of the y-directed properties (E-v and V-vx). Reducing the diagonal rib thickness at constant vertical rib thickness leads to a more marked decrease in E-v as well as in E-x, whereas V-xv and V-vx both increase in magnitude. An analytical model is also developed to account for different vertical and diagonal rib thicknesses, and good agreement with the FE model data is achieved. The results have implications for applications in which maximising or maintaining mechanical properties with respect to relative density is important.

AB Auxetic materials offer potential to be applied to sports safety equipment. This work reports quasi-static and impact testing of auxetic open-cell polyurethane foam - fabricated with a compression and heat treatment process - in comparison to its conventional counterpart. The foam was compressed to 70% of its original dimension along each dimension during the conversion process. Quasi-static compression testing confirmed the converted foam to be auxetic, with a Poisson's ratio of -0.08. Impact testing was performed for energies up to 5.6 J with an instrumented drop rig and high-speed video. Peak accelerations were similar to 3 times lower for the auxetic foams, because they prevented bottoming. This work has shown further potential for auxetic foam to be applied to sports safety devices. Future work should look to optimise foam selection and the conversion process, while comparing auxetic foam with existing materials and products. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ID NEGATIVE POISSONS RATIO; PERFORMANCE
AB Auxetic fabrics with traditional filaments and auxetic structures have been provided by knitting method; however, the auxetic behavior and applicability of woven fabric with auxetic yarns remain to be studied. Thus, the paper aims to present the special characters of woven fabrics with heliacal auxetic yarns. Auxetic yarns with the maximum value of Poisson's ratio -0.88 were used as weft yarns to do the weaving by the semi-automatic loom. Then the properties of the fabrics have been tested and analyzed under tensions of different directions (warp, weft, and diagonal). The results indicated that the fabric presented auxetic effect with the maximum value of Poisson's ratio -0.3 under diagonal tension and also showed self-curling and self-folding behavior in natural state. Moreover, the relationship between properties and fabric weaves was also discussed and analyzed. It is expected that the study of fabrics with helical auxetic yarns could promote the practical applications of auxetic textiles such as the self-folding property for smart cladding materials.

AB Auxetic materials are characterized by getting thiner/larger in tension/compression. This counterintuitive behavior is advantageous in specific applications such as self-expandable stents. There are currently some stents that make use of this behavior, nevertheless there are still auxetic geometries that are not explored in this field. Additionally, Pure Magnesium is a promising material to manufacture bioabsorbable stents. This study presents the modelation of novel auxetic self-expanding stents based in Reentrant and Chiral geometries. They are simulated using Finite Element analysis to determine the presence of negative Poisson's ratios and if they are a possible solution for further stent development. It is concluded that such modelations show low values of Poisson's ratio and may be a viable possibility to obtain a new generation of self-expanding stents.

AB The present work reports the first attempt of developing auxetic structures using high performance fibres through knitting technology. Polyamide (PA) and para-aramid (p-AR) fibres and their combination were knitted in to purl structures using flatbed knitting machine, varying different structural (such as loop length, cover factor and yarn density) and machine parameters (such as take-down load). The influence of different parameters on negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) was thoroughly investigated. It was observed that NPR improved strongly with the increase in loop length of knitted structures. NPR also increased with the decrease in cover factor and increase in course density of knitted fabrics. An increase in take-down load also improved NPR for tightly knitted samples, but led to initial decrease and subsequent increase in NPR for medium and higher loop lengths; except for p-AR fabrics, which showed a decrease in NPR with take-down load for higher loop lengths. Tensile properties of the developed auxetic structures were also found to depend strongly on fibre type and loop length, and the highest tensile performance was achieved with lower loop lengths and p-AR yarns. The p-AR fabrics produced using lower loop length and lower take-down load resulted in the highest NPR of -0.713. Therefore, the developed knitted structures produced using high performance yarns and showing strong auxetic effects can have huge potential for industrial applications, especially in personal protection materials, such as cut resistance fabrics, bullet proof vest, helmets, and so on.

AB Jounce bumpers in automotive suspension are key components that can improve the noise, vibration, and harshness performance of entire vehicle. Traditional jounce bumper made of polyurethane usually cannot satisfy the mechanical performances required by noise, vibration, and harshness optimization. In addition, the application of hyperelastic material influenced the efficiency and reliability of numerical calculations of polyurethane jounce bumper. In this paper, an engineering negative Poisson's ratio structure was introduced and applied on the jounce bumper. The negative Poisson's ratio jounce bumper can be mainly defined by few structure parameters. The finite element analysis of the negative Poisson's ratio jounce bumper was conducted applied explicit method. The influences of loading velocity and material densities on computational time and numerical results were researched. The results indicated that enlargements of material densities and loading velocity can improve the computational efficiency and have limited influence on reliability. Furthermore, a negative Poisson's ratio jounce bumper prototype was manufactured and tested to verify the numerical results. It was proved that the finite element analysis of the negative Poisson's ratio jounce bumper was reliable both in load-displacement curve and deformation shapes. Compared to the traditional jounce bumper, the negative Poisson's ratio jounce bumper can achieve similar mechanical behavior but with a smoother load-displacement curve, which is beneficial to the vehicle's noise, vibration, and harshness performance.

AB We present a novel design of a honeycomb lattice geometry that uses a seamless combination of conventional and auxetic cores, i.e. elements showing positive and negative Poisson's ratio. The design is aimed at tuning and improving the band structure of periodic cellular structures. The proposed cellular configurations show a significantly wide band gap at much lower frequencies compared to their pure counterparts, while still retaining their major dynamic features. Different topologies involving both auxetic inclusions in a conventional lattice and conversely hexagonal cellular inclusions in auxetic butterfly lattices are presented. For all these cases the impact of the varying degree of auxeticity on the band structure is evaluated. The proposed cellular designs may offer significant advantages in tuning high-frequency bandgap behaviour, which is relevant to phononics applications. The configurations shown in this paper may be made iso-volumetric and iso-weight to a given regular hexagonal topology, making possible to adapt the hybrid lattices to existing sandwich structures with fixed dimensions and weights. This work also features a comparative study of the wave speeds corresponding to different configurations vis-a vis those of a regular honeycomb to highlight the superior behaviour of the combined hybrid lattice.

AB Contrary to isotropic materials, composites always show complicated mechanical behavior under external loadings. In this article, an efficient algorithm is employed to obtain the maximum negative Poisson's ratio for laminated composite plates. We try to simplify the problem based on normalization of parameters and some manufacturing constraints to overlook the additional constraint of the optimization procedure. A genetic algorithm is used to find the optimal thickness of each lamina with a specified fiber direction. It is observed that the laminated composite with the configuration of (15/60/15) has the maximum negative Poisson's ratio. (C) 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB The vibration and damping performances of carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) three-dimensional double-arrow-head (3D DAH) auxetic metamaterials are investigated in this paper. The negative Poisson's ratio effects of the CFRP 3D DAH auxetic metamaterials are analytically studied by the energy method. 3D finite element models based on Modal Strain Energy approach are developed to analyze their vibration and damping characteristics. To validate the numerical models in the present study, the CFRP 3D DAH auxetic metamaterials are designed and manufactured. The sine-sweep response tests are conducted to investigate their vibration performances. The influence of different inclined corrugated angles, and fiber orientations on the natural frequencies, loss factors and the nominal Young's modulus are plotted and discussed using validated numerical models. Meanwhile, the effect of Poisson's ratio on the nominal Young's modulus, natural frequencies and loss factors is also revealed explicitly. Furthermore, the comprehensive evaluation parameter that simultaneously characterizes the structural bearing capacity and vibration damping performance is further improved through parameter optimization.

AB Auxetic woven fabrics made of non-auxetic yarns have gained the interest of textile scientists in recent times. Such fabrics have already been produced and investigated for their negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) effect in two principle directions. However, the NPR effect of these fabrics in different biased tensile directions has not been studied. In particular, the influence of repeated tensile loading on the NPR effect retention ability of fabric has not been explored yet. Therefore, this paper aims to report the NPR effect of auxetic woven fabric in different tensile directions and the influence of repeating tensile cycle tests on its NPR effect retention ability. The auxetic woven fabric is firstly fabricated based on a re-entrant hexagonal geometrical structure by using elastic and non-elastic yarns, and then subjected to single and repeating tensile tests in five different tensile directions, which include two principle directions and three biased directions. It is found that the NPR effect is largely dependent upon the tensile direction and the number of repeating tensile cycles.

TI POISSON RATIO IN POLYMER GELS NEAR THE PHASE-TRANSITION POINT
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
LA English
DT Note
ID MODULUS
AB Poisson's ratio, which was obtained by measuring swelling curves of free and radially constrained gels, has been investigated as a function of temperature and ionic strength for N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPA) gels and as a function of acetone concentration for polyacrylamide gels. It was found that the Poisson ratio exhibits a negative dip near the transition temperature for both neutral and ionic NIPA gels. The dip becomes deeper and shifts to a higher temperature as the ionic strength increases. The negative Poisson ratio of NIPA gels suggests that the bulk modulus is much smaller than the shear modulus as gels undergo the phase transition. The Poisson ratio of acrylamide gel, however, was found to be positive throughout the measured region.

AB This paper reports a geometrical analysis of auxetic woven fabrics based on foldable geometry. Two fabrics having different geometrical parameters were first designed and fabricated and then subjected to tensile tests in two principal directions. Based on the experimental observations of the geometry of one fabric structural unit cell at different tensile strains, a geometrical model was first proposed and a relationship between the Poisson's ratio and tensile strain was then established for each principal direction. Two semi-empirical equations are subsequently obtained for both principal directions by fitting the established relationships with experimental results. After validation by the experimental results of the other fabric, the obtained semi-empirical equations were finally used to predict the auxetic behavior of the fabric with a given geometrical parameter. The calculated and experimental results are found to be in excellent agreement with each other. Therefore, the semi-empirical equations obtained in this study could be useful in the design and prediction of the auxetic behavior of auxetic woven fabrics made with the same type of materials and foldable geometry but with different values of geometrical parameters.

AB This paper reports a study on the geometrical analysis of bi-stretch auxetic woven fabric based on a re-entrant hexagonal geometry. The fabric was first designed and fabricated. Then, the fabric was subjected to tensile tests, and changes in the geometry of the fabric structural unit cell at different tensile strains were observed when stretched either in the warp or weft direction. Based on the observations, a geometrical model was proposed for each stretch direction and used to establish the relationship between Poisson's ratio and tensile strain. The semi-empirical equations for both stretch directions were finally obtained by fitting geometrical parameters with experimental results. It is expected that the semi-empirical equations obtained in this study could be used in the design and prediction of the auxetic behavior of bi-stretch auxetic woven fabrics made with the same type of materials and geometry, but with different values of geometrical parameters.

AB Auxetic perforated mechanical metamaterials (APMMs) with artificially designed architectures have attracted growing attention in recent years due to the relatively simple fabrication process and their unusual physical properties for broad ranges of potential applications. We present a new topological configuration of APMMs with low porosity that simultaneously exhibits the properties of negative Poisson's ratio and band gaps. The finite element method is employed to investigate the effects of the parameters of void porosity, aspect ratio and chord length on the Poisson's ratio and the range of band gaps. Our results demonstrate that a large range of Poisson's ratio can be achieved with low porosity, and interestingly, the Poisson's ratio and the frequency of lower band gap edge are decreased monotonically as the chord length increases. Furthermore, the comparison of stress-strain behaviors, tensile strength, and acoustic transmission characteristics between the proposed and the classical configurations of low porosity APMMs is given. The results show that the new configuration owns special underlying tensile deformation pattern and long ligament, which effectively alleviates the stress concentration caused by cusp and enhances the tensile strength of the structure. Moreover, compared to previous structural configurations, the proposed configuration shows lower bandwidth and better vibration control property.

AB The paper introduces a new alternative towards fabrication of auxetic metamaterials (materials with negative Poisson's ratio) controlled by geometric transformations. These transfoimations are derived from the theory of small (infinitesimal) elastic deformation superimposed on finite elastic deformations. By using this theory, a cylindrical region filled with initial deformed foam is transformed through deformation into a cylindrical shell region filled with auxetic metamaterial. As an example, the realization of the seismic cloak device becomes a practical possibility.

AB Materials with negative Poisson's ratio are characterized as auxetic materials. They arise quite rarely in nature, so that our engineering intuition can not help us understand their mechanical behaviour or, further, use them effectively for innovative products and processes. From a literature review and from analytical calculations confirmed with the use of numerical homogenization, it seems that some nonconvex-shaped (re-entrant) microstructure is the most understandable origin of the auxetic behaviour. The picture is quite clear in elastostatics, for which a quite large number of potential applications have been discussed in the engineering literature. Analogous problems in elastodynamics and in the area of viscoelasticity have not been discussed thoroughly in the open literature. The purpose of this article is to summarize the available knowledge in the area of auxetics and to point out interesting directions for further research and development work.

AB Auxetic materials with negative Poisson's ratios have important applications across a broad range of engineering areas, such as biomedical devices, aerospace engineering and automotive engineering. A variety of design strategies have been developed to achieve artificial auxetic materials with controllable responses in the Poisson's ratio. The development of designs that can offer isotropic negative Poisson's ratios over large strains can open up new opportunities in emerging biomedical applications, which, however, remains a challenge. Here, we introduce deterministic routes to soft architected materials that can be tailored precisely to yield the values of Poisson's ratio in the range from -1 to 1, in an isotropic manner, with a tunable strain range from 0% to similar to 90%. The designs rely on a network construction in a periodic lattice topology, which incorporates zigzag microstructures as building blocks to connect lattice nodes. Combined experimental and theoretical studies on broad classes of network topologies illustrate the wide-ranging utility of these concepts. Quantitative mechanics modeling under both infinitesimal and finite deformations allows the development of a rigorous design algorithm that determines the necessary network geometries to yield target Poisson ratios over desired strain ranges. Demonstrative examples in artificial skin with both the negative Poisson's ratio and the nonlinear stress-strain curve precisely matching those of the cat's skin and in unusual cylindrical structures with engineered Poisson effect and shape memory effect suggest potential applications of these network materials.

AB Irregular honeycomb structures occur abundantly in nature and in man-made products, and are an active area of research. In this paper, according to the optimization of regular honeycomb structures, two types of irregular honeycomb structures with both positive and negative Poisson's ratios are presented. The elastic properties of irregular honeycombs with varying structure angles were investigated through a combination of material mechanics and structural mechanics methods, in which the axial deformation of the rods was considered. The numerical results show that axial deformation has a significant influence on the elastic properties of irregular honeycomb structures. The elastic properties of the structure can be considered by the enclosed area of the unit structure, the shape of the unit structure, and the elastic properties of the original materials. The elastic properties considering the axial deformation of rods studied in this study can provide a reference for other scholars.

AB The results of studies on the influence of periodically stacked nanolayer inclusions, introduced into the face-centered cubic (f.c.c.) hard sphere crystal, on Poisson's ratio of the obtained nanocomposite system are presented. The monolayers are orthogonal to the [001]-direction. They are formed by hard spheres with diameter different from the spheres forming the matrix of the system. The Monte Carlo computer simulations show that in such a case the symmetry of the system changes from the cubic to tetragonal one. When the diameter of the inclusion spheres increases at certain range, a decrease of the negative Poisson's ratio in the [101][101]-directions is observed, i.e., the system enhances its partial auxeticity. The dependence of the maximal, average, and negative parts of the minimal Poisson's ratio on the direction of the applied load are shown in a form of surfaces in spherical coordinates, plotted for selected values of nanolayer particle diameters. The most negative value of the Poisson's ratio found among all studied systems was -0.11 (at pressure p*100, which is about ten times higher than the melting pressure) what is almost twice more negative than in the f.c.c. crystal of identical hard spheres. The observed effect weakens along with the decrease of pressure and becomes hardly noticeable near melting. This study indicates that modifying only the size of the inclusion particles one can change Poisson's ratio of nanocomposites at high pressures.

AB Auxetics (i.e. systems with negative Poisson's ratios) exhibit the unexpected feature of becoming fatter when stretched and narrower when compressed. A particular class of materials which has attracted significant attention in recent years in view of its potential for auxeticity is that of zeolites, in particular, the zeolite NAT where auxeticity has now been experimentally measured. Here we use molecular modelling to accurately reproduce through force-field based simulations the experimentally measured negative Poisson's ratios in NAT. We also simulate and measure the atomic level deformations that result when NAT is mechanically deformed and use these to evaluate whether existing models can be used to explain the negative Poisson's ratios in natrolite. In particular we show that existing 2D models involving 'rotating semirigid quadrilaterals' can explain some aspects of the behaviour of NAT and make, suggestions how such models can be improved so as to provide a better description of NAT in the auxetic (001) plane.

AB Different from conventional materials, materials with negative Poisson's ratios expand laterally when stretched longitudinally. Known as 'auxetic' materials, the effect means they possess particularly fascinating properties, which have recently attracted considerable attention in the literature. A range of auxetic materials has been discovered, theoretically designed and fabricated. Developments in additive manufacturing (AM) techniques enable fabrication of materials with intricate cellular architectures. This paper outlines recent progress in the development of auxetic materials and structures, and their mechanical properties under quasi-static and dynamic loading are analysed and summarised. Limited experimental studies on 3D printed auxetic materials and structures are given more attention, ahead of extensively finite element (FE) simulations. A special focus is dedicated to their large, plastic deformation behaviour and energy absorption performance, which should be stressed in their engineering applications; no review paper has yet been found regarding this. Finally, this paper provides an overview of current study limitations, and some future research is envisaged in terms of auxetic materials and structures, nano-auxetics and additive manufacturing.

TI Hierarchical Auxetic Mechanical Metamaterials
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS

DT Article
ID NEGATIVE POISSONS RATIO; ELASTIC PROPERTIES; ZEOLITES; BEHAVIOR; FOAM
AB Auxetic mechanical metamaterials are engineered systems that exhibit the unusual macroscopic property of a negative Poisson's ratio due to sub-unit structure rather than chemical composition. Although their unique behaviour makes them superior to conventional materials in many practical applications, they are limited in availability. Here, we propose a new class of hierarchical auxetics based on the rotating rigid units mechanism. These systems retain the enhanced properties from having a negative Poisson's ratio with the added benefits of being a hierarchical system. Using simulations on typical hierarchical multi-level rotating squares, we show that, through design, one can control the extent of auxeticity, degree of aperture and size of the different pores in the system. This makes the system more versatile than similar non-hierarchical ones, making them promising candidates for industrial and biomedical applications, such as stents and skin grafts.

AB Transition metal carbides include a wide variety of materials with attractive properties that are suitable for numerous and diverse applications. A most recent experimental advance could provide a path toward the successful synthesis of large-area and high-quality ultrathin Mo2C membranes with superconducting properties. In the present study, we used first-principles density functional theory calculations to explore the mechanical and optical response of singlelayer and free-standing Mo2C. Uniaxial tensile simulations along the armchair and zigzag directions were conducted and we found that while the elastic properties are close along various loading directions, the nonlinear regimes in stress-strain curves are considerably different. We found that Mo2C sheets present negative Poisson's ratio and thus can be categorized as an auxetic material. Our simulations also reveal that Mo2C films retain their metallic electronic characteristic upon uniaxial loading. We found that for Mo2C nanomembranes the dielectric function becomes anisotropic along in-plane and out-of-plane directions. Our findings can be useful for the practical application of Mo2C sheets in nanodevices.

AB Mechanical metamaterials have attracted significant attention due to their programmable internal structure and extraordinary mechanical properties. However, most of them are still in their prototype stage without direct applications. This research developed an easy-to-use mechanical metamaterial with tailorable large negative Poisson's ratios. This metamaterial was microstructural, with cylindrical-shell-based units and was manufactured by the 3D-printing technique. It was found numerically that the present metamaterial could achieve large negative Poisson's ratios up to -1.618 under uniaxial tension and -1.657 under uniaxial compression, and the results of the following verification tests agreed with simulation findings. Moreover, stress concentration in this new metamaterial is much smaller than that in most of existing re-entrance metamaterials.

AB Helical Auxetic Yarns (HAYs) can be used in a variety of applications from healthcare to blast and impact resistance. This work focuses on the effect of the use of different core materials (e.g. rubber, polyurethane, polytetrafluoroethylene/teflon, polypropylene, polyetheretherketone, polycarbonate, acetal) with a nitinol wire wrap component on the maximum Negative Poisson Ratio (NPR) produced and thus the auxetic performance of Helical Auxetic Yarns (HAYs). From the analytical model, it was found that an acetal core produced the largest NPR when compared to the other six materials. The trend obtained from the experimental tensile tests (validation) correlated closely with the theoretical predictions of the NPR as axial strain was increased. The experimental method presented a maximum NPR at an average axial strain of 0.148 which was close to the strain of 0.155 predicted by theory. However, the maximum experimental NPR was significantly lower than that predicted by the analytical model.

This results in the thinnest negative Poisson's ratio material at ambient conditions known so far, an effect achieved via a nanoscale de-wrinkling mechanism that mimics the behavior at the macroscale exhibited by a crumpled sheet of paper when stretched.

AB Auxetic materials are of great engineering interest not only because of their fascinating negative Poisson's ratio, but also due to the possibility to increase by design the toughness and indentation resistance. The general understanding of auxetic materials comes often from ordered or periodic structures, while auxetic materials used in applications are typically strongly disordered. Yet, the effect of disorder in auxetics has rarely been investigated. Here, we provide a systematic theoretical and experimental study of the effect of disorder on the mechanical properties of a paradigmatic two-dimensional auxetic lattice with a re-entrant hexagonal geometry. We show that disorder has a marginal effect on the Poisson's ratio until the point when the lattice topology becomes altered, and in all cases examined disorder preserves the auxetic characteristics. Depending on the direction of loading applied to these disordered auxetic lattices, either brittle or ductile failure is observed. It is found that brittle failure is associated with a disorder-dependent tensile strength, whereas in ductile failure disorder does not affect strength. Our work thus provides general guidelines to design and optimize elasticity and strength of disordered auxetic metamaterials.

AB We observe unexpected locally auxetic behavior in elastomeric polypropylene, a semicrystalline polymer with a natural microstructure and a low degree of crystallinity. Our series of scanning force microscopy images show the nanomechanical deformation processes that occur upon stretching a thin film of elastomeric polypropylene. Upon uniaxial stretching, the angle between epitaxially grown lamella branches remains constant and the lamellae elongate, resulting in locally auxetic behavior (negative Poisson's ratio) on the 100-nanometer scale. This mechanism causing auxetic behavior, which was previously proposed on the basis of geometric arguments, appears to be an intrinsic property of certain semicrystalline polymers.

AB We determine the Poisson ratio of self-avoiding fixed-connectivity membranes, modeled as impenetrable plaquettes, to be sigma = -0.37(6), in statistical agreement with the Poisson ratio of phantom fixed-connectivity membranes sigma = -0.32(4). Together with the equality of critical exponents, this result implies a unique universality class for fixed-connectivity membranes. Our findings thus establish that physical fixed-connectivity membranes provide a wide class of auxetic (negative Poisson ratio) materials with significant potential applications in materials science.

AB Either an in-plane or out-of-plane negative Poisson's ratio, nu, in continuous carbon fibre/epoxy resin composites can be achieved, providing the fibre volume fraction and anisotropy are high enough, by selecting suitable stacking sequences. This paper examines the use of specially designed software which allows the designer to match the mechanical properties of laminates with predicted negative nu to those with similar mechanical properties but positive nu. This has allowed auxetic and matched carbon fibre/epoxy resin laminates to be specifically designed. These laminates were then fabricated and tested, with good agreement found to theoretical predictions. This study, then, provides a route to evaluating the effect of a negative nu alone on properties such as fracture toughness and impact resistance.

Study presented within this paper is focused on manufacturing and testing auxetic polyurethane foams for potential introduction for seats in military helicopters. Firstly, a manufacturing process was developed which benefits from the well-known methods of processing conventional foams and allows preparing necessary test specimens for further tests. Secondly, a series of static and dynamic tests was performed during which the market available conventional foams used in transport are compared with processed auxetic foams.

AB This work describes the in-plane uniaxial tensile mechanical properties of two-dimensional graded rectangular perforations metamaterials using numerical homogenization finite element approaches benchmarked by experimental results. The metamaterial configuration is based on graded patterns of centre-symmetric perforated cells that can exhibit an auxetic (negative Poisson's ratio) behavior. Global and local equivalent mechanical properties of the metamaterial are measured using digital image correlation techniques mapped over Finite Element models to identify strain patterns and related stress distributions at different scales. The samples and their numerical counterpart are parametrized against the spacing and aspect ratios of the cells. The overall stiffness behavior of the graded perforated metamaterial plates features a higher degree of compliance that depends both on the geometries of the cells of the graded areas, but also on the graded pattern used. Local Poisson's ratio effects show a general constraint of the auxetic behavior compared to the case of uniform plates, but also interesting and controllable shape changes due to the uniaxial tensile loading applied.

AB Auxetics exhibit the unusual property of expanding when uniaxially stretched (negative Poisson's ratio), a property that is usually linked to particular geometric features and deformation mechanisms. One of the mechanisms which results in auxetic behavious is the one involving rotating rigid units, for which, systems made from triangles, squares or rectangles have already been considered. In this work we extend this study by considering systems which can be constructed from either connected rhombi or connected parallelograms. We show that various types of such systems can exist and we discuss in detail the properties of one type of 'rotating rhombi' and one type of 'rotating parallelograms'. We also show that the Poisson's ratio of these systems, while can be positive or negative, is anisotropic and dependent on the shape of the parallelograms/rhombi and the degree of openness of the system.

AB In this paper, the dynamic behavior of a three-layered sandwich beam with a metal foam core is investigated. Outer layers of the sandwich beam are made of AlSi12 alloy and the core is metal porous foam made of AlSi12. Numerical analysis is made for different parameters of the core - average damping loss factor, densities, Young modulus, and Poisson's ratio of core foam. The simulations are used to determine the mechanical impedance for a sandwich beam with the applied harmonic load. Numerical calculations are made with the use of finite element method. The results imply that the auxetic core of the composite beam can have a great impact on the dynamic behavior (mobility) of the system. Furthermore, it appears that there are ranges of frequencies in which the mobility of the system can be minimized by using the auxetic foam core.

AB Honeycombs based composites are applied in a wide spectrum of applications. In the present study, the performance of novel foam concrete filled auxetic aluminium honeycombs subjected to quasi-static and low velocity compression is experimentally and numerically investigated. The response mode, crushing resistance and energy absorption capacity of hollow and foam concrete filled auxetic honeycombs are experimentally studied under quasi-static and low velocity loading. Numerical models, validated with the test results, are employed in parametric study to further examine the performance. If properly designed, the interaction between the auxetic honeycomb and foam concrete reinforces each other, making the two components to work in synergy. It is found that the response modes of the composites change from compression failure with low peak stress and stable plateau stress to shear failure with high peak stress and severely fluctuated plateau stress with increasing foam concrete density. The response of foam concrete filled honeycombs gradually transforms from the quasi-static mode with global deformation to dynamic mode with localized crushing near loading end, and the effective Poisson's ratio of the composites decreases, both with increasing compression speed.

AB Two simple models of two-dimensional auxetic (i.e. negative Poisson's ratio) foams are studied by computer simulations. In the first one, further referred to as a Y-model, the ribs forming the cells of the foam are connected at points corresponding to sites of a disordered honeycomb lattice. In the second one, coined a Delta-model, the connections of the ribs are not point-like but spatial. For simplicity, they are represented by triangles centered at the honeycomb lattice points. Three kinds of joints are considered for each model, soft, normal and hard, respectively corresponding to materials with Young's modulus ten times smaller than, equal to and ten times larger than that of the ribs. The initial lattices are uniformly compressed, which decreases their linear dimensions by about 15%. The resulting structures are then used as reference structures with no internal stress. The Poisson's ratios of these reference structures are determined by stretching them, in either the x or the y direction. The results obtained for finite meshes and finite samples are extrapolated to infinitely fine mesh and to the thermodynamic limit, respectively. The extrapolations indicate that meshes with as few as 13 nodes across a rib and samples as small as containing 16 x 16 cells approximate the Poisson's ratios of systems of infinite size and infinite mesh resolution within the statistical accuracy of the experiments, i.e. a few per cent. The simulations show that by applying harder joints one can reach lower Poisson's ratios, i.e. foams with more auxetic properties. It also follows from the simulations performed that the Delta-model gives lower Poisson's ratios than the Y-model. Finally, the simulations using fine meshes for the samples are compared with the ones in which the ribs are approximated by Timoshenko beams. Taking into account simplifications in the latter model, the agreement is surprisingly good.

AB Auxetics are systems which get fatter when stretched and thinner when compressed i.e. they exhibit a negative Poisson's ratio. Here, we present an analysis of a novel class of structures (referred to as 'mata-chiral') which belong to the class of auxetics constructed using chiral building blocks. We show through analytical modelling that some of these systems can exhibit negative Poisson's ratios, the extent of which will depend, amongst other things, on the geometry of the system.

AB Equivalent sandwich panels composed of auxetic and conventional honeycomb cores and metal facets are analysed and compared for their resistance performances against impulsive loadings. The dynamic behaviours of these structures are numerically investigated, taking into account the rate-dependent effects. The Johnson-Cook model is employed to describe the dynamic responses of the composite sandwiches subjected to high strain-rate loadings. Analytical models are derived correlating unit cell geometrical parameters and crushing strengths of the representative panels at different impact velocities. Parametric studies are conducted to evaluate the performances of different sandwich panel designs under impulsive loadings. In particular, transmitted reaction forces and maximum stresses on the protected structure are quantified for various design parameters including the geometrical factors and the effective Poisson's ratios. A quarter of the panel is symmetrically modelled with shell elements and the CONWEP model is used to simulate the blast loading. Auxetic panels demonstrate interesting crushing behaviour, effectively adapting to the dynamic loading by progressively drawing material into the locally loaded zone to thereby enhance the impact resistance. Meanwhile, conventional honeycomb panels deform plastically without localised stiffness enhancement. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study presents the finite element-based micromechanical modeling approach to obtain the electromechanical properties of the piezoelectric metamaterial based on honeycomb (HC) cellular networks. The symmetry of the periodic structure was employed to derive mixed boundary conditions (MBCs) analogous to periodic boundary conditions (PBCs). Three classes of hexagonal HC cellular networks, namely, a conventional HC (CHC), a re-entrant HC (RE), and a semi-re-entrant HC (SRE) were considered. The representative volume elements (RVEs) of these three classes of cellular materials were created, and finite element analyses were carried out to analyze the effect of orientation of the ligament on their effective electromechanical properties and their suitability in specific engineering applications. The longitudinally poled piezoelectric HC cellular networks showed an enhanced behavior as compared to the monolithic piezoelectric materials. Moreover, longitudinally poled HC cellular networks demonstrated that, as compared to the bulk constituent, their hydrostatic figure of merit increased and their acoustic impedance decreased by one order of magnitude, respectively, indicating their applicability for the design on hydrophones. Moreover, results showed that cellular metamaterial with tunable electromechanical characteristics and a variety of auxetic behaviors such as negative, positive, or zero Poisson's ratios could be developed. Such novel HC network-based functional cellular materials are likely to facilitate the design of light-weight devices for various next-generation sensors and actuators.

AB An auxetic metamaterial is a type of mechanical metamaterial that has a negative Poisson's ratio. Most auxetic metamaterials are truss-based or originate from Boolean operations of simple geometries. Herein, we introduce a new 3D auxetic metamaterial that is mathematically generated from an implicit expression. Further, this metamaterial is fabricated by 3D printing using a flexible material, which allows it to recover from large deformations. The buckling-induced auxetic behavior of the metamaterial was first evaluated via compression tests and finite element analyses. A nickel layer was then plated onto the surface to enhance its stiffness, strength, and conductivity without loss of auxeticity and resilience. The integration of 3D printing and electroless plating enabled accurate control over the mechanical and conduction properties of the auxetic metamaterial; these properties are presented as contour maps for guidance in functional applications.

AB Auxetic materials and structures have a negative Poisson's ratio. When a tensile load is applied, they become thicker in lateral direction and vice versa. This paper presents a study on the mechanical behavior of a metallic re-entrant honeycomb auxetic structure manufactured by laser assisted Direct Metal Deposition (DMD) additive manufacturing technology. Effective modulus of the auxetic structure was estimated in tensile loading. The results of finite element analysis (FEA) were validated experimentally and show good agreement. Poisson's ratio of the given structure was also estimated by FEA and validated with the analytical equation. Results show that direct metal deposition is an effective technique for producing intricate auxetic structures for various engineering applications.

AB The article discusses the 2D problem of manufacturability of the minimum compliance designs of the structural elements made of inhomogeneous materials of local isotropic or square symmetry properties. The available isotropic material design (IMD) and cubic material design (CMD) methods deliver the optimal distribution of the elastic moduli within the design domain. Within the 2D setting, the cubic symmetry reduces to the symmetry of a square. The varying underlying microstructures corresponding to the optimal designs are recovered by matching the values of the optimal moduli with the values of the effective moduli of the representative volume elements (RVEs) computed by the asymptotic homogenization method for periodic media. The shape of the RVE and its internal symmetries are properly selected providing assumed isotropy or symmetry of a square of the homogenized constitutive tensor. The microstructure topology is described by parametric description of single (or several) fibers in RVE. The periodicity of the structure and the final topology of the material within RVE is ensured by multiplication of a single fiber in accordance with the symmetries adopted for RVE. The ability to model an auxetic behavior within the subdomains where the optimal Poisson's ratio assumes negative values is shown.

AB Following high profile, life changing long term mental illnesses and fatalities in sports such as skiing, cricket and American football-sports injuries feature regularly in national and international news. A mismatch between equipment certification tests, user expectations and infield falls and collisions is thought to affect risk perception, increasing the prevalence and severity of injuries. Auxetic foams, structures and textiles have been suggested for application to sporting goods, particularly protective equipment, due to their unique form-fitting deformation and curvature, high energy absorption and high indentation resistance. The purpose of this critical review is to communicate how auxetics could be useful to sports equipment (with a focus on injury prevention), and clearly lay out the steps required to realise their expected benefits. Initial overviews of auxetic materials and sporting protective equipment are followed by a description of common auxetic materials and structures, and how to produce them in foams, textiles and Additively Manufactured structures. Beneficial characteristics, limitations and commercial prospects are discussed, leading to a consideration of possible further work required to realise potential uses (such as in personal protective equipment and highly conformable garments).

AB A two-dimensional system of hard, cyclic tetramers has been investigated by constant pressure Monte Carlo (MC) simulations with variable shape of the periodic box. The molecules (tetramers) are composed of four identical hard disks (atoms) with centers forming a square with sides equal to the diameter of the disks. The elastic constants and the Poisson's ratio are determined by the analysis of strain fluctuations and the reference state of the system. The singular behavior of the elastic constants is in agreement with free volume theory. It has been found that the hard cyclic tetramer system is auxetic - that is, the Poisson's ratio of the tetramer system is negative. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Auxeticity (i.e. negative Poisson's ratios) is associated with particular geometrical features and deformation mechanisms of a system. Among the potential systems that may exhibit such behaviour are rotating rigid units. Here we discuss how rigid rhombi of the same shape and size can be connected in two different ways to give rise to two distinct systems: the Type alpha and Type beta rotating rhombi. We derive the mechanical properties, for the Type beta system and compare it to those of the Type alpha to highlight the differences between the two systems namely that Type alpha systems are highly anisotropic and can exhibit both negative and positive Poisson's ratios which depend on the shape of the rhombi and the angle between them whereas Type beta systems are isotropic with a constant in-plane Poisson's ratio of -1. Furthermore we show that by constructing the rhombi from five truss-type elements, where the one forming the diagonal has a different thermal expansion than the other four identical trusses, the Poisson's ratios for the Type alpha systems can also be made temperature dependent, in contrast with Type beta systems which remain unaffected by temperature changes.

AB Silicon dioxide or silica, normally existing in various bulk crystalline and amorphous forms, was recently found to possess a two-dimensional structure. In this work, we use ab initio calculation and evolutionary algorithm to unveil three new two-dimensional (2D) silica structures whose thermal, dynamical, and mechanical stabilities are compared with many typical bulk silica. In particular, we find that all three of these 2D silica structures have large in-plane negative Poisson's ratios with the largest one being double of penta graphene and three times of borophenes. The negative Poisson's ratio originates from the interplay of lattice symmetry and Si-O tetrahedron symmetry. Slab silica is also an insulating 2D material with the highest electronic band gap (>7 eV) among reported 2D structures. These exotic 2D silica with in-plane negative Poisson's ratios and widest band gaps are expected to have great potential applications in nanomechanics and nanoelectronics.

ID MODEL
AB The present paper was conducted to calculate Young's modulus and Negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) of a warp and woof (WAW) 3D auxetic structure in three perpendicular directions using an analytical method under uniaxial loading and considering the elastic-plastic behavior of materials. Due to the periodic pattern of the auxetic structure, a unit cell was chosen as a representative volume element (RVE) and its mechanical properties were assessed by developing analytical formulations in the elastic region. To this end, the principle of virtual work along with the concept of lumped plasticity (plastic hinges) were utilized. For validating the proposed analytical model, the 3D finite element (FE) simulations were used. Fairly good correlations were found between the present analytical results and the results of FE simulations. Subsequently, the effects of parameters, such as the initial re-entrant (IRE) angle, the cell thickness, and the auxetic cell aspect ratio on the mechanical properties were investigated. The obtained results revealed that with the increase in the IRE angle, NPR increases in the vertical direction and decreases in two other horizontal directions; it also increases the cell stiffness in three perpendicular directions. The thickness of cell walls does not alter NPR, yet relatively increases the cell stiffness. Furthermore, it was found that the cell aspect ratio has an important role in the mechanical properties of WAW auxetic structures.

AB First-principles calculations within the framework of density functional theory (DFT) are performed to investigate the elastic and thermodynamic properties of DO3-type Fe3Ga alloy. The obtained lattice constants and the bulk modulus are in good agreement with available experimental data. In terms of the calculated formation energy and Poisson's ratio, the Fe3Ga alloy is mechanically stable and exhibit a negative Poisson's ratio of -0.81 along the < 110 > direction. The thermodynamic properties such as the Gibbs free energy, thermal expansion, and the specific heat are obtained by the first-principles phonon calculations with the quasiharmonic approximation method. The predicted coefficient of linear thermal expansion and specific heat may provide a helpful reference for experimental work. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Preliminary results on the influence of periodically distributed cylindrical nanoinclusions introduced into the f.c.c. hard sphere crystal on its elastic properties and the Poisson's ratio are presented. The nanoinclusions are oriented along the [001]-direction and filled with hard spheres of diameter different from the spheres forming the matrix crystal. The Monte Carlo simulations show that symmetry of the crystal changes from the cubic to tetragonal one. In the case when spheres inside the inclusion are smaller than spheres forming the crystal, the changes of Poisson's ratio are qualitatively similar to the changes observed earlier in the Yukawa sphere crystal, that is, the introduction of nanochannels causes simultaneous decrease of the Poisson's ratio in the [110][11 over bar 0]-direction, and its increase in [110][001]-direction. Filling the nanochannel with spheres having diameters greater than that of the spheres in the crystalline matrix, causes a decrease of the Poisson's ratio value from 0.065 down to -0.365 in [111][112 over bar ]-direction. The dependence of the minimal Poisson's ratio on the direction of the applied load is shown in a form of surfaces in spherical coordinates, for selected values of nanochannel particle diameters. The most negative value of the Poisson's ratio found amongst all systems studied was as low as -0.873.

DE Auxetic fabric; knitted fabric; negative Poisson's ratio; repeating

ID POLYETHYLENE
AB In our previous study, a novel class of auxetic warp knitted fabrics were developed and their auxetic behaviors were studied under a single tensile test. However, during daily use, the fabrics are usually subjected to repeating tension rather than single tension. Therefore, the durability of the fabrics' auxetic performance is of great importance. So far, the auxetic behavior of fabrics under repeating tension has not systematically been investigated. In this paper, we report a study on the auxetic behavior of warp knitted fabrics under repeating tension. All the fabric samples were subjected to a repeating tensile test within a tensile strain of 25% until 100 tensile cycles. The results show that the fabrics can keep their auxetic effect in both course and wale testing directions after 100 tensile cycles, and the auxetic effect in the wale direction is retained longer under higher tensile strains than that under lower tensile strains with the increase of tensile cycles. The results also indicate that auxetic stability in the course direction is much better than that in the wale direction. We hope that this study can offer useful information to improve the auxetic stability of auxetic fabrics for practical use.

AB Auxetic warp-knitted spacer fabric composite is famous for its excellent mechanical properties and has been applied in many potential fields, such as automobile industry, aerospace field, and so on. Four kinds of composites with different negative Poisson's ratios were used for low-velocity impact tests. The influence of different negative Poisson's ratio effect and initial impact energy on the impact resistance and energy absorption ability of composites are studied. Result shows that the peak impact load, energy absorption, and impact resistance of composites increase with an increase in the auxetic effect of reinforcement. The composite with better auxetic effect shows lower damage level after low-velocity impact. And the higher initial impact energy can easily weaken the impact resistance ability of composites.

AB This work illustrates the manufacturing and tensile testing of a novel concept of honeycomb structures with hexagonal and auxetic (negative Poisson's ratio) topology, made of shape memory alloy core material. The honeycombs are manufactured using Nitinol ribbons having 6.40 mm of width and 0.2 mm of thickness. The ribbons were inserted in a special dye using cyanoacrilate to bond the longitudinal strips of the unit cells. Tensile tests at room temperature (full martensite) were performed on the honeycombs. Finite element models of the honeycomb assemblies under tensile loading have been developed using nonlinear beam elements from a commercial code. Good agreement is observed between numerical nonlinear simulations and the experimental results.

AB Although lots of impact protective materials reported exhibited better impact protective performance thanking to their excellent mechanical performance, their applications were still seriously impeded due to absence of soft-stiffness switch smartness. Herein, a novel impact hardening polymer (IHP) with negative Poisson's ratio was synthesized via a condensation polymerization, followed by a simple thermal annealing to achieve a perfect soft-stiffness switch characteristic and self-healing capacity. Its soft-stiffness switch ability sigma, defined as G'(max)/G'(min) in rheological analysis, can reach 9000, which is never reported so far. The result of laser speckle scatter measurement elucidates that IHP has negative Poisson's ratio, which is the root cause why IHP exhibits soft-stiffness switch capacity. Finally, 3D composite anti-impact fabrics were prepared by dip-coating IHP dispersion onto a 3D porous polyester fabric. Not only the impact protective performance of anti-impact fabrics finished with the IHP is significantly improved, but also the flexibility and hand feeling of anti-impact fabrics finished with the IHP are obviously very good because the IHP is flexible without impact.

AB Mechanical metamaterials have generated considerable interest due to their unique attributes such as light weight, high strength, enhanced energy absorption, high impact, and fracture resistance. However, most of the design methodologies in literature are predominantly computational and provide limited user-insight (especially for three-dimensional designs). This paper presents an alternative two-phase design methodology for the conceptual synthesis of three-dimensional tunable mechanical metamaterials. In the first phase, we obtain a kinematically feasible conceptual topology using a building block-based design approach. In the second phase, the conceptual topology is refined using shape/size optimization to meet specific elastic properties and conform to manufacturing requirements. The building block-based approach uses a unique visualization formulation that represents the deformation behavior as 'load flow' in the constituent members. An immersive virtual reality tool is developed to mitigate the visual difficulty in the design of three-dimensional microstructures. Furthermore, the load flow formulation is used to propose a qualitative classification scheme for negative Poisson's ratio elastic metamaterials based on relative values of shear moduli and bi-axial elastic stiffnesses. The efficacy of the framework is illustrated through the design of microstructures with negative Poisson's ratios in spatial directions and the ability to achieve isotropic microstructures from a qualitative understanding of the conceptual designs. Such a framework can lead to the design of synthetic materials that have potential applications in multifunctional structures, shape morphing structures, and soft robotics.

ID NEGATIVE POISSON RATIOS; ELASTIC PROPERTIES; STRENGTH
AB Two dimensional (2D) auxetic materials with large negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) are highly desirable for applications in medicine, tougher composites, defense, and so on. In this paper, by using first-principles calculations, we identify that the CaAs3 monolayer is an excellent auxetic material with large NPR value up to -0.36 along the hinges direction. The relatively small Young's modulus ranging from 23.61 to 40.50 N/m and the moderate critical strain ranging from 0.06 to 0.16 guarantee its extraordinary flexibility and moderate ductility. Owing to its unique crystal structure, the anisotropy of basic mechanical parameters, electrical conductance, and optical absorption are concentrated on the CaAs3 monolayer. Moreover, the electric field-induced tunability of optical absorption also emerged in the CaAs3 monolayer. All of these extraordinary properties allow 2D CaAs3 to have great potential applications in designing electromechanical devices and photoelectric devices as well.

AB The influence of impulse load applied for different duration on the distribution of normalised dynamic radial stresses in positive and negative Poisson's ratio medium was investigated in this study. For solving the non-stationary problem in the case of plane deformation for structurally inhomogeneous materials, the model of Cosserat continuum was applied. This model enables accounting for the influence of shear-rotation deformation of micro-particles of the medium. In the framework of Cosserat elasticity, on applying the Fourier transforms for time variable and developing the boundary integral equation method, solving of the non-stationary problem reduces to the system of singular integral equations, where the components that determine the influence of shear-rotation deformations are selected. The numerical calculations were performed for the foam medium with positive and negative Poisson's ratio for different values of time duration of impulse. Developed approach can be used to predict the mechanical behaviour of foam auxetic materials obtained at different values of a volumetric compression ratio under the action of time variable load based on analysis of the distribution of radial stresses in foam medium.

AB Auxetic cellular structures are advanced materials with negative Poisson's ratios, which exhibit some unique features which are useful for various applications. The objective of this paper is the numerical simulation and experimental analysis of evolution propagation under quasi-static loading conditions in selected auxetic cellular structures with different geometries and orientations of unit cells that is: (i) honeycomb structure, (ii) re-entrant structure, and (iii) rotated re-entrant structure. The failure modeling capability of Simulia Abaqus code for ductile materials is used for the numerical simulation. The paper presents in detail the calculation methodology for determination of ductile damage material parameters that, are used for further numerical simulations of the damage initiation and evolution. Standard Compact Tension (CT) specimens are selected for the numerical simulation and experimental testing. Here, the specimens are made from 7075-T651 aluminum plate, cut using water jet cutting technology. Using a numerical approach, the fracture behavior of the selected auxetie structures is estimated first. Experimental testing is also carried out to validate the numerical results. The comparison between computational and experimental results regarding crack propagation path and force-displacement diagrams showed a reasonable agreement.

AB In this paper, a quantitative optimization of a modified re-entrant negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) structure whose overhanging struts were replaced with inclined ones to avoid the support structures which were generally required in the selective laser melting (SLM) process was carried out using finite element analysis (FEA) method. Poisson's ratios of models with inclined links of different strut inclination angles were calculated. The optimal simulated inclination angle of struts was 9 degrees and the corresponding optimum re-entrant angle was 79 degrees while the thickness of the strut was 0.9 mm. The influence of fillet radii on Poisson's ratio and stress concentration was also discussed and the Poisson's ratio decreased and the stress concentration phenomenon remitted to some extent with increased fillet radii. In order to verify the improvement of the manufacturability of structures with inclined links, AlSi10Mg specimens were fabricated by SLM process using different scanning speeds and compression tests were also developed. Experimentally obtained results and simulation predicted ones were in good agreement. Therefore, the custom-tailor service could be accomplished in this way and the modified NPR structure with better surface quality could be obtained. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID AUXETIC BEHAVIOR; STRAINS; SQUARES
AB Auxetic materials, characterised by a negative Poisson's ratio, have properties that are different from most conventional materials. These are a result of the constraints on the kinematics of the material's basic structural components, and have important technological implications. Models of these materials have been studied extensively, but theoretical descriptions have remained largely limited to materials with an ordered microstructure. Here we investigate whether negative Poisson's ratios can arise spontaneously in disordered systems. To this end, we develop a quantitative description of the structure in systems of connected basic elements, which enables us to analyse the local and global responses to small external tensile forces. We find that the Poisson's ratios in these disordered systems are equally likely to be positive or negative on both the element and system scales. Separating the strain into translational, rotational and expansive components, we find that the translational strains of neighbouring basic structural elements are positively correlated, while their rotations are negatively correlated. There is no correlation in this type of system between the local auxeticity and local structural characteristics. Our results suggest that auxeticity is more common in disordered structures than the ubiquity of positive Poisson's ratios in macroscopic materials would suggest.

DE compliant micromechanism; fast prototyping; negative Poisson's ratio
AB This paper describes a new way to design and fabricate compliant micromechanisms and material structures with negative Poisson's ratio (NPR). The design of compliant mechanisms and material structures is accomplished in an automated way using a numerical topology optimization method. The procedure allows the user to specify the elastic properties of materials or the mechanical advantages (MA's) or geometrical advantages (GA's) of compliant mechanisms and returns the optimal structures. The topologies obtained by the numerical procedure require practically no interaction by the engineer before they can be transferred to the fabrication unit. Fabrication is carried out by patterning a sputtered silicon on a plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) glass with a laser micromachining setup. Subsequently, the structures are etched into the underlying PECVD glass, and the glass is underetched, an in one two-step reactive ion etching (RIE) process. The components are tested using a probe placed on an x-y stage. This fast prototyping allows newly developed topologies to be fabricated and tested within the same day. [188]

AB Honeycomb structures are increasingly being used in many important fields. A novel combined embedded enhanced honeycomb (CEEH) in developed in this paper based on the two existing embedded enhanced honeycombs, the single rib embedded enhanced honeycomb (SREEH) and the rhombic grid embedded enhanced honeycomb (RGEEH). Analytical model related to the in-plane Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio is built and validated by using two different finite element (FE) models (3D beam model and 3D solid model). The in-plane elastic behavior of the honeycomb is also investigated against the geometrical parameters by using the numerically validated analytical solutions. The results show that the new CEEH can achieve a wide range value of Poisson's ratio and Young's modulus by tailoring geometric parameters. The results also show that the new CEEH exhibits higher x- directional specific stiffness than SREEH while higher y- directional specific stiffness than RGEEH. Moreover, the new CEEH can weaken even eliminate the difference between the two principal directions which can be hardly achieved by the SREEH and RGEEH. Given these advantages, this new design may be promising in some applications. This work provides a new insight into the designs of embedded enhanced honeycombs.

ID AUXETIC BEHAVIOR; COMPOSITE-MATERIALS; SOFT
AB In this study, we report a novel periodic material with negative Poisson's ratio (also called auxetic materials) fabricated by denting spherical dimples in an elastic flat sheet. While previously reported auxetic materials are either porous or comprise at least two phases, the material proposed here is nonporous and made of a homogeneous elastic sheet. Importantly, the auxetic behavior is induced by a novel mechanism which exploits the out-of-plane deformation of the spherical dimples. Through a combination of experiments and numerical analyses, we demonstrate the robustness of the proposed concept, paving the way for developing a new class of auxetic materials that significantly expand their design space and possible applications.

AB Auxetic materials (negative Poisson's ratio) are of exceptional importance for nanomechanical applications. Using first-principles calculations, we propose two-dimensional delta-phase carbon monochalcogenides (delta-CS, delta-CSe, and delta-CTe) with very strong auxeticity. In contrast to the known two-dimensional materials, we find that Poisson's ratio is negative in all crystal directions. In addition, the d-phase carbon monochalcogenides turn out to be direct or quasi-direct bandgap semiconductors with impressive absorption of solar radiation.

AB A novel set of auxetic (negative Poisson's ratio) open cell polyurethane foam has been developed and tested under dynamic loading conditions to assess the viscoelastic response under white noise random excitation and compressive cycling. Foam pads normalized to standard ISO 13753 have been tested at room temperature and frequency bandwidth 10-500 Hz to assess transmissibility characteristics for possible antivibration glove applications. The results show that the ISO 13753 normalized transmissibility for these foams falls below 0.6 above 100 Hz, with lower peak maximum stresses under indentation compared to conventional open cell solids. These results suggest possible use of the auxetic foam for pads or linens against << white fingers >> vibration applications. Further tests have been conducted on cyclic compressive loading up to 3 Hz and loading ratios of 0.95 for loading histories up to 100000 cycles. The damping capacity of the auxetic foams showed and increase by a factor 10 compared to the conventional foams used to manufacture the negative Poisson's ratio ones, and stiffness degradation stabilized after few tens on cycles.

AB Auxetic warp-knitted spacer fabrics have gained increasing interest due to their excellent properties, such as shear resistance, indentation resistance, synclastic curvature and so on. Soft composites made from auxetic warp-knitted spacer fabrics and A/B two-component silicone rubbers were studied in this paper. The stabbing resistance of composites made by different auxetic fabrics (Fabrics 1-4#) and at different filling rates (0%, 20%, 40%, 70%, 100%), respectively, were tested using a universal Material Testing System. The results show that the peak load, energy absorption and deformation displacement of the composites increase with an increase of auxetic performance and filling rate. In addition, a better auxetic effect and larger filling rate can result in less damage. The composites with a higher filling rate are more like an elastomer. The auxetic effect also has an important role in stabbing resistance, which is due to fabrics with a larger negative Poisson's ratio value having a denser face layer structure and more deformable units, which can lead to better stabbing resistance for the composites.

AB Porous materials are efficient structures in respect to optimizing strength and stiffness for a given weight. A new means of improving the characteristics of the samples may be realized using abnormal deformation properties of auxetic porous materials having a negative Poisson's ratio v. Auxetic porous materials are suitable for creating adaptive contact joints and for replacing damaged biotissue. It is known that the inverted or re-entrant cell structure of porous auxetics may be obtained by isotropic permanent volumetric compression of conven(t)ional foam, resulting in microbuckling of the cell walls. There is interest in compression-driven self-assembly as a means to create auxetic porous structures on a nanoscale. To predict the deformation behaviour of porous materials under various types of loading, corresponding mathematical models should be developed. The possibility of compression-driven self-assembly of the auxetic nanostructures has been predicted. (C) 2008 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB Two-dimensional (2D) auxetic materials with exceptional negative Poisson's ratios (NPR) are drawing increasing interest due to their potential use in medicine, fasteners, tougher composites and many other applications. Improving the auxetic performance of 2D materials is currently crucial. Here, using first-principles calculations, we demonstrated giant in-plane NPRs in MX monolayers (M = Al, Ga, In, Zn, Cd; X = P, As, Sb, S, Se, Te) with a unique V-shaped configuration. Our calculations showed that GaP, GaAs, GaSb, ZnS and ZnTe monolayers exhibit exceptional all-angle in-plane NPRs. Remarkably, the AlP monolayer possesses a giant NPR of -1.779, by far the largest NPR in 2D materials. The NPRs of these MX monolayers are correlated to the highly anisotropic features of the V-shaped geometry. The exotic mechanical properties of the V-shaped MX monolayers provide a new family of 2D auxetic materials, as well as a useful guidance for tuning the NPR of 2D materials.

AB A new auxetic structure, re-entrant chiral auxetic (RCA) structure, is proposed for the first time in this paper. The RCA structure combines the topological features of hexagonal re-entrant and anti-tetrachiral honeycombs. Additive manufacturing technique, stereolithography (SLA), and traditional waterjet machining (WJM) were employed to fabricate six samples made from photopolymer (VisiJet SL Flex) and aluminum alloy (6061), respectively. Quasi-static uniaxial tensile tests were conducted in the X and Y directions, respectively. Numerical models were developed using ANSYS/LS-DYNA and verified by experimental data. Deformation modes, stress-strain curves, and Poisson's ratios were considered to examine the effects of loading directions and material types. A comparative study was conducted experimentally and numerically between the well-known hexagonal re-entrant honeycomb, and this newly developed RCA structure. The proposed RCA structure presented here was found to display lower density compared with re-entrant honeycomb. Moreover, it shows higher tensile properties and auxetic effect compared with re-entrant honeycomb when loaded in the X direction. The validated FEA models were employed to investigate the effect of friction on the deformation pattern and mechanical properties of the RCA structure when it is loaded in both directions.

AB This paper evaluates the elastic stability and vibration characteristics of circular plates made from auxetic materials. By solving the general solutions for buckling and vibration of circular plates under various boundary conditions, the critical buckling load factors and fundamental frequencies of circular plates, within the scope of the first axisymmetric modes, were obtained for the entire range of Poisson's ratio for isotropic solids, i.e., from -1 to 0.5. Results for elastic stability reveal that as the Poisson's ratio of the plate becomes more negative, the critical bucking load gradually reduces. In the case of vibration, the decrease in Poisson's ratio not only decreases the fundamental frequency, but the decrease becomes very rapid as the Poisson's ratio approaches its lower limit. For both buckling and vibration, the plate's Poisson's ratio has no effect if the edge is fully clamped. The results obtained herein suggest that auxetic materials can be employed for attaining static and dynamic properties which are not common in plates made from conventional materials. Based on the exact results, empirical models were generated for design purposes so that both the critical buckling load factors and the frequency parameters can be conveniently obtained without calculating the Bessel functions.

AB To improve vehicle side crashworthiness, this paper first introduces the negative Poisson's ratio structure to the traditional B-pillar and proposes a negative Poisson's ratio B-pillar. Then, the performance of the negative Poisson's ratio B-pillar is studied in detail by comparison with a traditional B-pillar and honeycomb B-pillar. Aiming at the problem that the side crashworthiness is also significantly affected by the side structure parameters of vehicle body, the factorial analysis theory is adopted to screen out the side structure parameters with significant effect. Based on this, by combining the optimal Latin hypercube design and response surface model, a multi-objective optimization design is conducted for those structure parameters based on non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II. Finally, the normal boundary intersection method is adopted to seek the Pareto optimal solution, and the simulation results show that compared with the traditional B-pillar, the negative Poisson's ratio B-pillar optimized by non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II has better comprehensive crashworthiness. The results of this paper can provide some basis for the design and optimization of vehicle side crashworthiness.

AB Materials with negative Poisson ratios are known to have high shear rigidities - a useful property for many types of structural and functional materials. To improve upon relatively low Young's modulus of existing auxetics, one may consider embedding such components in an elastic material with sufficiently high modulus. We show theoretically that such composite materials do exhibit auxeticity when the inclusion volume fraction exceeds a critical value and the ratio of Young's modulus of inclusion to that of a matrix falls within a definite interval. The existence of these auxeticity windows, once verified experimentally, opens up a new avenue of auxetics research. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Mechanical metamaterial composed of chiral honeycomb structure is high performance engineering materials developed in recent years. They have the advantages of light weight, high specific stiffness, negative Poisson' s ratio, adjustable structural parameters and stable mechanical properties. It not only can realize the dual mechanical functions of in-plane deformation and out-of-plane load-bearing, but also has excellent engineering application performance such as vibration isolation and sound absorption and noise reduction and control of elastic wave propagation. It has great potential in the fields of intelligent structure, vehicle, ship, aerospace and so on. Two mechanical aspects of its elastic properties and impact resistance were reviewed. First, the progress of theoretical analysis and research on the elastic properties such as the surface poplar modulus, negative Poisson's ratio, and elastic properties of external shear modulus of mechanical metamaterials were reviewed and commented. Further, in the aspect of impact resistance, the overall deformation and impact resistance of the existing chiral honeycomb mechanical metamaterials under impact load were reviewed based on perspectives of model establishment and finite element analysis. Finally, it was pointed out that in the further research of elasticity and impact properties, the mechanical model of internal ligament deformation and force transmission can be further established and the energy absorption mechanism of the impact process to be further explored so as to provide the reference for the optimization design of the internal structure of ligaments and node rings in this type of metamaterial.

AB Materials with specific microstructural characteristics and composite structures are able to exhibit negative Poisson's ratio. This result has been proved for continuum materials by analytical methods in previous works of the first author, among others [1]. Furthermore, it also has been shown to be valid for certain mechanisms involving beams or rigid levers, springs or sliding collars frameworks and, in general, composites with voids having a nonconvex microstructure. Recently microstructures optimally designed by the homogenization approach have been verified. For microstructures composed of beams, it has been postulated that nonconvex shapes with re-entrant corners are responsible for this effect [2]. In this paper, it is numerically shown that mainly the shape of the re-entrant corner of a non-convex, star-shaped microstructure influences the apparent (phenomenological) Poisson's ratio. The same is valid for continua with voids or for composities with irregular shapes of inclusions, even if the individual constituents are quite usual materials. Elements of the numerical homogenization theory are reviewed and used for the numerical investigation.

ID DISPERSION; BEHAVIOR; PHYSICS; PHASE
AB The modes of vibrations of conventional and auxetic honeycomb structures are studied by means of models where lattices are represented by planar networks, in which rodlike particles are linked by strings. In these structures, the translational and rotational degrees of freedom are strongly coupled. The auxetic network is obtained by modifying a model proposed by Evans in 1991 [Nature (London) 353, 124 (1991)], and is used to explain the negative Poisson's ratio of auxetic materials. Auxetics are materials with a negative Poisson elastic parameter, meaning that they have a lateral extension, instead of shrinking, when they are stretched. The phonon dispersions obtained in the case of the auxetic model are compared with those of a conventional honeycomb network, where rigid rodlike particles are inserted. The behavior of the rotational dispersions can explain some experimental observations on the properties of sound propagation in the auxetic materials.

AB Auxetic foams have been widely studied in view of their superior properties and many useful applications and various models have been developed to help explain the auxetic behavior in such foams. One such model involves the description of auxetic foams in terms of rotating units (e.g. the joints where different cell walls meet), a mechanism, which has also been observed experimentally. In the models, the rotating units are taken, to a first approximation, to be representable through rotating rigid triangles, which correspond to the 2D projection of these rotating units and although this model has been improved significantly since it was first proposed, current models still do not fully capture all the deformations that may occur in real foams. In this work, we propose an extended model which not only allows for relative rotation of the units (joints), represented by non-equilateral triangular units, but also for differing amount of material at the joints as well as deformation of the joints themselves, a scenario that is more representative of real auxetic foams. This model shows that, by permitting deformation mechanisms other than rotation of the triangles, the predicted extent of auxeticity decreases when compared to the equivalent idealized rotating rigid triangles model, thus resulting in more plausible predictions of the Poisson's ratios. Furthermore, it is shown that in the manufacturing process, a minimum compression factor, which is dependent on the amount of materials at the joints, is required to obtain an auxetic foam from a conventional foam, as one normally observed in experimental work on foams.

AB The effects of fiber arrangement on the negative through-the-thickness Poisson's ratios of angle-ply carbon fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP) laminates are investigated based on a homogenization theory. First, angle-ply CFRP laminates are modeled three-dimensionally with +theta- and -theta-laminae in which carbon fibers are distributed in a hexagonal arrangement. Then, a homogenization theory for nonlinear time-dependent composites is applied to the laminates. Using the present method, the elastic-viscoplastic Poisson's ratios of angle-ply carbon fiber/epoxy laminates are analyzed. The analysis results are then compared with those of the previous study, in which a square fiber arrangement in each lamina was assumed. It is shown that the fiber arrangement affects the negative through-the-thickness Poisson's ratios of the laminates in both elastic and viscoplastic regions, though they have little effect on the macroscopic stress-strain relationships of the laminates.

ID HOMOGENIZATION THEORY; COMPOSITES; BEHAVIOR
AB In this study, a multiscale analysis for the negative through-the-thickness Poisson's ratio of angle-ply CFRP laminates in the viscoplastic region is performed. First, an angle-ply CFRP laminate with the [+/-theta] laminate configuration is fully modeled as heterogeneous materials composed of fibers and a matrix. A multiscale elastic-viscoplastic analysis method for the laminate is then proposed based on the homogenization theory for nonlinear time-dependent composites with point-symmetric internal structures. The substructure method is used to enhance computational efficiency. The method proposed is then applied for the analysis of the elastic-viscoplastic Poisson's ratios of angle-ply carbon fiber/epoxy laminates subjected to macroscopic uniaxial tension. The analysis results obtained are used to demonstrate the negativity of through-the-thickness Poisson's ratios in the viscoplastic region and their variation with the degree of viscoplastic deformation.

AB A novel design for the geometric configuration of honeycombs using a seamless combination of auxetic and conventional cores- elements with negative and positive Possion ratios respectively, has been presented. The proposed design has been shown to generate a superior band gap property while retaining all major advantages of a purely conventional or purely auxetic honeycomb structure. Seamless combination ensures that joint cardinality is also retained. Several configurations involving different degree of auxeticity and different proportions auxetic and conventional elements have been analyzed. It has been shown that the preferred configurations open up wide and clean band gap at a significantly lower frequency ranges compared to their pure counterparts. In view of existence of band gaps being desired feature for the phononic applications, reported results might be appealing. Use of such design may enable superior vibration control as well. Proposed configurations can be made isovolumic and iso-weight giving designers a fairer ground of applying such configurations without significantly changing size and weight criteria.

Honeycomb geometry (bond lengths and angles), and bond-stretch and bond-angle force constants are considered as variable parameters and deformation is assumed due to simultaneous bond stretching and bond angle variation in response to an applied axial load. A parametric study is then performed to explore the structure-property relationships in auxetic (negative Poisson's ratio) nanotube.

AB This paper presents five different auxetic warp-knitted spacer fabrics and discusses their energy absorption under uniaxial tension through integrals of stress on strain. Structures of auxetic fabrics are designed based on rotating hexagonal models and knitted for experimental tests, including Poisson's ratio tests and tensile tests. Results show that energy absorption of auxetic warp-knitted spacer fabric is mainly determined by its structural deformation capacity and yarn loading capacity, between which the yarn loading capacity of fabrics plays the dominant part in energy absorption, while the structural deformation capacity, which is affected by Poisson's ratio, has relatively little influence. With equivalent yarn loading capacity, the energy absorption of fabrics with negative Poisson's ratios are relatively better.

AB Cellular materials have two important properties: structures and mechanisms. These properties have important applications in materials design; in particular, they are used to determine the modulus and yield strain. The objective of this study is to gain a better understanding of these two properties and to explore the synthesis of compliant cellular materials (CCMs) with compliant porous structures (CPSes) generated from modified hexagonal honeycombs. An in-plane constitutive CCM model is constructed using the strain energy method, which uses the deformation of hinges around holes and the rotation of links. A finite element (FE) based simulation is conducted to validate the analytical model. The moduli and yield strains of the CCMs with an aluminum alloy are about 5.8 GPa and 0.57% in one direction and about 2.9 MPa and 20% in the other direction. CCMs have extremely high positive and negative Poisson's ratios (v(xy)*similar to +/- 40) due to the large rotation of the link member in the transverse direction caused by an input displacement in the longitudinal direction. CCMs also show higher moduli after contact of slit edges at the center region of the CPSes. The synthesized CPSes can also be used to design a new CCM with a Poisson's ratio of zero using a puzzle-piece CPS assembly. This paper demonstrates that compliant mesostructures can be used for next generation materials design in tailoring mechanical properties such as moduli, strength, strain, and Poisson's ratios. The proposed mesostructures can also be easily manufactured using a conventional cutting method. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This article contains an analytic study of Poisson's ratio of re-entrant foam materials with negative Poisson's ratio.  These materials get fatter when stretched and thinner when compressed.  The Poisson effect is so fundamentally important to the properties of a material that a large change in the value of the ratio will have significant effects on the material's mechanical performance.  Isotropic foam structures with negative Poisson's ratio have been fabricated through a permanent volumetric transformation.  The cells were converted from the convex polyhedral shape of conventional foam cells to a concave or ''re-entrant'' shape.  Mechanical behavior of a re-entrant open cell foam material will differ from that of a conventional foam in ways not addressed by existing theoretical treatment.  Poisson's ratio as a function of strain is obtained by modeling the three-dimensional unit cell as an idealized polyhedron unit cell.  Poisson's ratio is predicted to approach the isotropic limit of -1 with increasing permanent volumetric compression ratio of idealized cells, in comparison with experimental values as small as -0.8.

AB Cellular plastics have been widely used in transportation, aerospace, and personal safety applications owing to their excellent mechanical, thermal, and acoustic properties. It is highly desirable to impart them with a complex porous structure and composition distribution to obtain specific functionality for various engineering applications, which is challenging with conventional foaming technologies. Herein, it is demonstrated that this can be achieved through the controlled freezing process of a monomer/water emulsion, followed by cryopolymerization and room temperature thawing. As ice is used as a template, this method is environmentally friendly and capable of producing cellular plastics with various microstructures by harnessing the numerous morphologies of ice crystals. In particular, a cellular plastic with a radially aligned structure shows a negative Poisson's ratio under compression. The rigid plastic shows a much higher energy dissipation capability compared to other materials with similar negative Poisson's ratios. Additionally, the simplicity and scalability of this approach provides new possibilities for fabricating high-performance cellular plastics with well-defined porous structures and composition distributions.

AB A re-entrant chiral auxetic (RCA) structure is a new structure, which comprises three topologies: re-entrant, trichiral and anti-trichiral. The aim of this study is to numerically investigate the influences of geometrical parameters of a RCA unit cell on the in-plane tensile properties. Finite element (FE) models were developed using commercial software, ABAQUS 6.11-2, and verified by experimental results. Based on the verified FE models, a parametric study was performed to examine the effects of geometrical parameters on the stress-strain curve and Poisson's ratio of a RCA structure. In order to reduce the variables studied, three dimensionless groups of geometrical parameters were proposed. Results showed that the RCA structure predominantly deformed by bending and stretching of walls as well as rotation of cylinders. The RCA structure displayed high stress, low strain and large negative Poisson's ratio when it was loaded in the X direction. On the other hand, the RCA structure exhibited low stress, high strain and a transition from negative to positive Poisson's ratio when it was loaded in the Y direction. The geometrical parameters of the RCA structure had significant effects on its stress-strain curves and Poisson's ratios. The findings of this study provide an insight into the mechanical response of the RCA structure under uniaixal tensile loading.

AB This chapter opens with a discussion on flexural rigidity of auxetic plates vis-a-vis conventional ones, followed by an analysis of circular auxetic plates. Bending moment result from uniform loading of circular plates suggests that the optimal Poisson's ratio is 1/3 if the plate is simply-supported at the edge. Based on bending and twisting moment minimization on a rectangular plate under sinusoidal load, the optimal Poisson's ratio for a square plate is 0, and this value reduces until 1 for a rectangular plate with aspect ratio 1 + root 2. Auxetic materials are not suitable for uniformly loaded and simply supported square plates, as moment minimization study suggests an optimal Poisson's ratio of 0.115, but are highly suitable for central point loaded and simply supported square plates, as moment minimization study suggests an optimal Poisson's ratio of -1. In the study of auxetic plates on auxetic foundation, the plotted results suggest that, in addition to selecting materials of sufficient strength and mechanical designing of plate for reduced stressed concentration, the use of plate and/or foundation materials with negative Poisson's ratio is useful for designing against failure. The investigations on width-constrained plates under uniaxial in-plane pressure by Strek et al. (J Non-Cryst Solids 354(35-39):4475-4480, 2008) and Pozniak et al. (Rev Adv Mat Sci 23(2):169-174, 2010) exhibit a remarkable and surprising result at extreme negative Poisson's ratios the displacement vector has components which are anti-parallel to the direction of loading. In the study of spherical shells under uniform load, the use of auxetic material reduces the ratio of maximum bending stress to the membrane stress, thereby implying that if the shell material possesses a Poisson's ratio that is sufficiently negative, such as 1, and the boundary condition permits free rotation and lateral displacement, then the use of membrane theory of shell is sufficient even though the shell thickness is significant. Results also recommend the use of auxetic material for spherical shells with simple supports because the bending stress is significantly reduced. However the use of auxetic material as spherical shells, with built-in edge, is not recommended due to the sharp increase in the bending stress as the Poisson's ratio of the shell material becomes more negative.

AB This paper presents an experimental study on impact behaviour and plastic evolution of chiral structure subjected to in-plane impact loading using a Split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB). The finite element (FE) model developed in ABAQUS/Explicit was validated and utilized for parametric study, and further developed as an extension of experimental work. The impact scenarios from both structure itself and external input are considered, including relative density, topology parameter r/R and initial impact energy. Results indicate that chiral structure exhibits three critical failure modes corresponding to various impact velocities ranging from 5 m/s to 50 m/s. Interestingly, chiral structure occurs with two densification stages induced by ligaments-dominated and nodes-dominated crushing deformation, respectively, proving the capability of independent energy management mechanism. Increasing the value of relative density from 0.19 to 0.39 contributes to a maximum of 250% increase in the specific energy absorption (SEA). Although increasing the value of r/R from 0.04 to 0.2 can dramatically decrease Poisson's ratio (PR) from 0.07 to - 0.63 (significant negative PR), high strainrate dependence of PR is also observed. In addition, the impact displacement is mostly influenced by initial impact energy but not by impact velocity and mass. The obtained results of this study provide a new insight into the impact performance of chiral structure, which contributes to the optimal design of auxetic crashworthiness system.

AB The Poisson's ratio, a property which quantifies the changes in thickness when a material is stretched and compressed, can be determined as the negative of the transverse strain over the applied strain. In the scientific literature, there are various ways how strain may be defined and the actual definition used could result in a different Poisson's ratio being computed. This paper will look in more detail at this by comparing the more commonly used forms of strain and the Poisson's ratio that is computable from them. More specifically, an attempt is made to assess through examples on the usefulness of the various formulations to properly describe what can actually be observed, thus providing a clearer picture of which form of Poisson's ratio should be used in analytical modelling.

AB Auxetics are novel counterintuitive materials that grow thicker perpendicularly to the applied force when stretched and therefore are described by a negative Poisson's ratio. We show that a regular lattice of individual multipods properly assembled in three dimensions has the ultimate negative Poisson's ratio -1: the lattice expands or contracts uniformly in all directions. Our ball-and-stick working model verifies the mathematical construction. Application of the model to real materials is discussed. Our result is important for understanding the ways to create entangled materials with interesting mechanical properties. (C) 2009 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB We describe in this work a composite metamaterial with a hierarchical topology made by tessellating perforations that exhibit an auxetic (negative Poisson's ratio) behaviour. We perform an analysis of the hierarchical structure by evaluating the fractal order of the topologies associated to the perforated composites. The periodic hierarchical lattice configuration shows negative Poisson's ratio characteristics at higher levels of hierarchy, even when the baseline configuration has a topology not exhibiting an auxetic behaviour. We investigate the wave propagation characteristics of these particular hierarchical lattices by using a Bloch wave approach applied to detailed Finite Element geometries of the unit cell configurations. We show that the level of hierarchy creates new band gaps with large relative widths, and it also shifts the same bandgaps towards lower frequencies. We correlate the mechanical properties, fractal order and the dispersion characteristics of the multiscale auxetic perforated metamaterial with the parameters defining the geometry of the lattice and the hierarchy levels, and discuss the results in a nondimensional form to provide a performance map of the mechanical and dynamic properties.

ID SPLINE FUNCTIONS; LIKELIHOOD; FIT
AB The negative binomial (NB) is frequently used to model overdispersed Poisson count data. To study the effect of a continuous covariate of interest in an NB model, a flexible procedure is used to model the covariate effect by fixed-knot cubic basis-splines or B-splines with a second-order difference penalty on the adjacent B-spline coefficients to avoid undersmoothing. A penalized likelihood is used to estimate parameters of the model. A penalized likelihood ratio test statistic is constructed for the null hypothesis of the linearity of the continuous covariate effect. When the number of knots is fixed, its limiting null distribution is the distribution of a linear combination of independent chi-squared random variables, each with one degree of freedom. The smoothing parameter value is determined by setting a specified value equal to the asymptotic expectation of the test statistic under the null hypothesis. The power performance of the proposed test is studied with simulation experiments.

ID AUXETIC MATERIALS; BEHAVIOR; CRYSTALS; GRAPHANE; RANGE; MODEL
AB We perform molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the effect of hydrogenation on the Poisson's ratio of graphene. It is found that the value of the Poisson's ratio of graphene can be effectively tuned from positive to negative by varying the percentage of hydrogenation. Specifically, the Poisson's ratio decreases with an increase in the percentage of hydrogenation, and reaches a minimum value of -0.04 when the percentage of hydrogenation is about 50%. The Poisson's ratio starts to increase upon a further increase of the percentage of hydrogenation. The appearance of a minimum negative Poisson's ratio in the hydrogenated graphene is attributed to the suppression of the hydrogenation-induced ripples during the stretching of graphene. Our results demonstrate that hydrogenation is a valuable approach for tuning the Poisson's ratio from positive to negative in graphene.

AB Although high heels are known to affect the biomechanics of human movement, most notably by increasing forefoot plantar pressure, it is commonly worn due to the influence of fashion. To deal with the resulting clinical issues, some prescriptions include the use of cushioning pads to redistribute the plantar loads and increase comfort. This preliminary study has sought to investigate whether auxetic foam would be a good candidate for the redistribution of plantar loafing in the forefoot when compared to a more traditional material. From the results obtained, it was shown that auxetic foam demonstrated a decrease in forefoot peak plantar pressure while a commercial product, a material traditionally used for plantar cover paddings, increased pressure in the region of the second-fourth Metatarsophalangeal Joint. This demonstrates the potential for auxetic materials to become the material of choice for such applications, especially since it can be further remodeled until its properties can produce a significant forefoot pressure reduction.

AB This paper presents modelling and simulation results on 1-3 piezoactive composites comprising a range of ferroelectric ceramics, which are assumed to have variable properties and an auxetic polymer (i.e. a material with a negative Poisson ratio) that improves the hydrostatic piezoelectric response of the composite. Dependences of the effective piezoelectric coefficients and related parameters of the 1-3 composites on the degree of poling, mobility of the 90 degrees domain walls within ceramic grains, on the volume fraction of the ceramic component and on the Poisson ratio of the polymer component have been calculated and analysed. The role of the piezoelectric anisotropy and domain-orientation processes in improving and optimising the effective parameters, piezoelectric activity and sensitivity of 1-3 ferroelectric ceramic/auxetic composites is discussed.

AB This work proposes the complete design cycle for several auxetic materials where the cycle consists of three steps (i) the design of the micro-architecture, (ii) the manufacturing of the material and (iii) the testing of the material. We use topology optimization via a level-set method and asymptotic homogenization to obtain periodic micro-architectured materials with a prescribed effective elasticity tensor and Poisson's ratio. The space of admissible micro-architectural shapes that carries orthotropic material symmetry allows to attain shapes with an effective Poisson's ratio below - 1. Moreover, the specimens were manufactured using a commercial stereolithography Ember printer and are mechanically tested. The observed displacement and strain fields during tensile testing obtained by digital image correlation match the predictions from the finite element simulations and demonstrate the efficiency of the design cycle.

AB We propose two types of perforation layout by introducing hole rotation based on regular configuration for effective band gap generation and mechanical properties improvement in low porosity. The design is characterized by redistribution of the substrate materials, and reduction connector thickness. Our analysis not only shows that the proposed layouts obtain broad and multiple band-gaps in low-frequency ranges and exhibit extreme Young's modulus variations, but also reveals how the reduction of connector thickness and geometric symmetry contribute to the unusual response. This study provides a perspective to design auxetic perforated metamaterials of low porosity with wide and low-frequency band gaps.

AB A two-dimensional model of an anisotropic crystalline material with cubic symmetry is considered. This model consists of a square lattice of round rigid particles, each possessing two translational and one rotational degree of freedom. Differential equations that describe propagation of elastic and rotational waves in such a medium are derived. A relationship between three groups of parameters is found: second-order elastic constants, acoustic wave velocities, and microstructure parameters. Values of the microstructure parameters of the considered anisotropic material at which its Poisson's ratios become negative are found.

AB A new method is presented for evaluating the performance of 1-3 polymer/piezoelectric ceramic composites for hydrophone applications. The Poisson's ratio effect, i.e., the enhancement of the hydrostatic performance which can be achieved by mixing piezoelectric ceramics with polymers, is studied in detail. Using an "effective medium" approach, algebraic expressions are derived for the composite hydrostatic charge coefficient d(h), the hydrostatic figure of merit d(h)g(h), and the hydrostatic electromechanical coupling coefficient k(h) in terms of the properties of the constituent materials, the ceramic volume fraction, and a microstructural parameter p. The high contrast in stiffness and dielectric constants existing between the two phases can be exploited to derive simple, geometry-independent approximations which explain quantitatively the Poisson's ratio effect. It is demonstrated that the stiffness and the Poisson's ratio of the polymer matrix play a crucial role in enhancing hydrophone performance. Using a differential scheme to model the parameter p, we evaluate d(h), d(h)g(h), and k(h) for polymer/piezoelectric ceramic systems at varying compositions. Several examples involving Pb (Zr, Ti)O-3 and (Pb, Ca)TiO3 piezoelectric ceramics are given to illustrate the theory. (C) 1998 Acoustical Society of America. [S0001-4966(97)00506-7].

AB Diffusion-induced stress is one of the critical challenges in developing lithium ion battery technologies, which may lead to the huge volume expansion, nucleation of cracks, electrode mechanical degradation and even pulverization. It has been testified nanostructured electrodes with the consideration of surface effect and property of negative Poisson's ratio can restrain volumetric expansion generation and relieve the hazard of stress-induced crack nucleation. In this paper, an analytical model of diffusion-induced stress for nanowire electrode under different operations is established and a relationship between stress and the nanowire radius is formed. Through changing the morphology of nanowire electrode, the stress equations for negative Poisson's ratio electrode can be obtained. By comparing surface effect influence on diffusion-induced stress between the nanowire and negative Poisson's ratio electrodes under different operations, it is found diffusion-induced stress, especially the tensile stress, can be decreased greatly and even converted to compressive one by the nanostructured electrode and the mechanism of negative Poisson's ratio, which may improve the mechanical property of battery and be in good agreement with experimental observations. Our work provides reference conditions for the improvement of battery to mitigate the mechanical degradation and prolong the cycle life as well as avoid failure.

AB 'Negative mechanical materials / metamaterials' refer to materials and/or engineered systems that exhibit anomalous macroscopic thermo-mechanical properties that emerge due to the structure of their subunits, rather than the specific chemical composition. As a result of their design/construction, they may exhibit anomalous macroscopic properties such as zero or negative Poisson's ratios (auxetic), moduli and/or indices. Such zero/negative properties are not normally manifested by their conventional counterparts and may thus potentially be used in applications where typical materials cannot. This work will look into some of the more recent developments made in this field, focusing on how existing materials (e.g. crystals) are providing the blueprint for the design and manufacture of novel 'negative materials'. In particular, this work looks at how wine-rack like crystalline materials which are typically studied for their negative thermal expansion and/or negative compressibility properties can be modified so as to generate negative Poisson's ratio through a novel mechanism involving forcing elements to move out-of-plane to generate giant out-of-plane auxeticity.

AB Auxetic materials are solids that exhibit negative Poisson's ratio. The effect of material auxeticity (i.e., negativity of Poisson's ratio) is investigated herein on the maximum deflection of sectorial plates with Simply-Supported straight edges and Free curve edge (SSF). To aid the designer, an accurate and conveniently executable semi-empirical model has been developed herein, which is valid for the entire range of Poisson's ratio of isotropic solids and for the plate's sectorial angle from 30 to 90 degrees. Results from exact solution reveal that the maximum deflection reduces sharply with the reduction of Poisson's ratio from positive to mildly negative, but deflection reduction is marginal when the sectorial plate's Poisson's ratio changes from moderately negative to highly negative value. It is therefore suggested that (a) the use of auxetic materials is useful to limit the extent of SSF sectorial plate deflection, and that (b) the use of the developed semi-empirical model herein as a design equation gives greatly simplified but highly accurate maximum deflection prediction for SSF plates made from both conventional (positive Poisson's ratio) and auxetic (negative Poisson's ratio) materials.

AB This paper is categorized into two parts. (1) A frame work to design the aircraft wing structure and (2) analysis of a morphing airfoil with auxetic structure. The developed design frame work in the first part is used to arrive at the sizes of the various components of an aircraft wing structure. The strength based design is adopted, where the design loads are extracted from the aerodynamic loads. The aerodynamic loads acting on a wing structure are converted to equivalent distributed loads, which are further converted point loads to arrive at the shear forces, bending and twisting moments along the wing span. Based on the estimated shear forces, bending and twisting moments, the strength based design is employed to estimate the sizes of various sections of a composite wing structure. A three dimensional numerical model of the composite wing structure has been developed and analyzed for the extreme load conditions. Glass fiber reinforced plastic material is used in the numerical analysis. The estimated natural frequencies are observed to be in the acceptable limits. Furthermore, the discussed design principles in the first part are extended to the design of a morphing airfoil with auxetic structure. The advantages of the morphing airfoil with auxetic structure are (i) larger displacement with limited straining of the components and (ii) unique deformation characteristics, which produce a theoretical in-plane Poisson's ratio of-1. Aluminum Alloy AL6061-T651 is considered in the design of all the structural elements. The compliance characteristics of the airfoil are investigated through a numerical model. The numerical results are observed to be in close agreement with the experimental results in the literature.

AB Using Finite Element computer simulations, Poisson's ratio (PR) is determined for anti-chiral structures built on rectangular lattices with disorder introduced by stochastic distributions of circular node sizes. The investigated models are parameterized by the lattice anisotropy, the rib thickness, and the radii distribution of circular nodes. Three approaches are developed. The first approach, exact in the limit of infinitely large system and infinitely dense mesh, uses only planar elements (CPS3). Two other approaches are approximate and exploit one-dimensional elements utilizing the Timoshenko beam theory. It is shown that in the case of sufficiently large anisotropy of the studied structures PR can be highly negative, reaching any negative value, including those lower than -1. Thin ribs and thin-walled circular nodes favor low values of PR. In the case of thick ribs and thick-walled circular nodes PR is higher. In both cases the dispersion of the values of circular nodes radii has a minor effect on the lowest values of PR. A comparison of the results obtained with three different approaches shows that the Timoshenko beam based approximations are valid only in the thin rib limit. The difference between them grows with increasing thickness. (C) 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB This paper is focused on the identification of the in-plane elastic constants of a new design of auxetic (negative Poisson's ratio) honeycomb configuration with curved cell walls by using analytical and numerical homogenization techniques. The sensitivity of the elastic constants is determined against the various cell geometry parameters. Good agreement between the analytical and numerical simulations is observed. We show that the specific curved wall honeycomb configuration proposed in this paper possesses a high in-plane shear compliance, tailored anisotropy and the possibility of inducing a negative Poisson's ratio behaviour in baseline honeycomb configurations that would have otherwise positive in-plane Poisson's ratios.

AB This paper presents the results of the numerical simulation of negative corona discharge in SF6 at 0.4 Mpa for a point-plane configuration. A 2D axisymmetric model considering three charged species has been investigated with an applied voltage equal to -25 kV. Three drift-diffusion equations coupled with Poisson's equation were solved simultaneously to obtain the temporal and spatial properties of Trichel pulses. The distributions of charged species at different instants of time and the time-dependent total number of charged species have been determined. The characteristics of current pulses with voltages varying from -24 kV to -27 kV were compared and it has been found that the characteristics of the current magnitude and frequency are similar to those in air. The effects of the model coefficients-the ionization coefficient, the attachment coefficient, the mobility of charged species and the secondary emission coefficient-on the characteristics of current pulses have also been studied to investigate the sensitivities of the pulse parameters to these coefficients.

AB In this study, the negative through-the-thickness Poisson's ratios of [+/-theta] woven laminates were analyzed based on the homogenization theory for elasto-viscoplastic materials. A [+/-theta] woven laminate model with the fiber bundle cross angle +/-theta was considered and its diamond-shaped domain of analysis was defined. The elasto-viscoplastic homogenization analysis was performed to investigate the negativity of the through-the-thickness Poisson's ratios for the [+/-theta carbon fiber/epoxy and glass fiber/epoxy woven laminates. The through-the-thickness Poisson's ratio of the [+/- 30 degrees] carbon fiber/epoxy woven laminate was negative in both the elastic and viscoplastic regions. However, that of the [+/- 30 degrees] glass fiber/epoxy woven laminate was positive in the elastic region but became negative in the viscoplastic region. The negative through-the-thickness Poisson's ratios of the [+/- 30 degrees] woven laminates were caused by the compressive stress with respect to the in-plane direction and the viscoplastic deformation of the matrix.

AB In this note it is shown that the combination of conventional laminas (possessing positive Poisson's ratio) and auxetic laminas (possessing negative Poisson's ratio) gives rise to effective in-plane composite laminate Young's modulus that surpasses the rule-of-mixture formula. To enable comparison between the developed model with the rule-of-mixture, the former is presented in such a way that two correction functions exist distinctively for multiplication into the two terms of the rule-of-mixture formula. Each of the two correction functions reduces to a minimum of 1 when all laminas possess equal Poisson's ratio, and the correction functions are greater than one when there exists mismatch in the Poisson's ratios among the laminas in the laminate. Plotted results show that the overshooting of the laminate's effective in-plane modulus is significant for semiauxetic laminates but not for conventional and fully auxetic materials.

AB Auxetic woven fabrics made with special geometrical structures have gained the interest of textile scientists in recent years. This paper reports a study on auxetic woven fabric based on a double-directional parallel in-phase zig-zag foldable geometrical structure. Such a fabric has been already produced and investigated for its negative Poisson's ratio effect in two principal directions (weft and warp directions). However, its negative Poisson's ratio effect in biased tensile directions as well as under repeated tensile loading conditions has not been studied yet. Therefore, in this paper, these two limitations are addressed. The auxetic woven fabric was firstly fabricated, and then subjected not only to tensile tests in different tensile directions, including two principle directions and three biased directions, but also to repeated tensile loading. It was found that both the negative Poisson's ratio effect and the resistance to tensile deformation are dependent upon the tensile direction, and the highest negative Poisson's ratio effect and higher resistance to tensile deformation are obtained in two principal directions.

AB Hyperelastic auxetic cellular materials are negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) and show transverse expansion when stretched and lateral contraction when compressed. The influence of the direction of force on the auxetic property, effect of cell angle on Poisson's ratio, buckling property of RH structures has been discussed in this article. The results show that: re-entrant hexagon (RH) structure never shows non-auxetic behaivour when it is subjected to load vertical force while it shows non-auxetic performance when the force reach a certain value when it is subjected to load transverse force. When stretched in the vertical direction and within a certain displacement, RH structures with smaller angle requires smaller force. Meanwhile, RH structure with smaller angle has more obvious auxetic property. When the RH model was stretched, its Poisson's ratio first decreases and then increases. Buckling occurs when RH is subjected to load longitudinally, and as the total width of the simple increases, the number of buckling curves increases.

AB The tensile behaviour of standard and auxetic polyurethane foams are contrasted by digital volume correlation of 3D images collected by in situ X-ray computed tomography (CT). It was found that subset sizes of 32 and 64 voxels for the auxetic and standard foams were optimal for strain resolutions in the order of 0.1%. For the standard foam, good uniformity of strain was observed at low strains giving a tangent Poisson's ratio of 0.5. Some heterogeneity of strain was observed at higher strains, which may be related to the fixtures. The behaviour of the auxetic foam was totally different, with strain being spatially heterogeneous with transverse strains both positive and negative but giving a negative Poisson's ratio on average. This suggests that the unfolding tendency of some groups of cells was higher than others because of the complex frozen starting microstructure. Further different methods of deriving Poisson's ratio gave different results. Besides revealing interesting microstuctural mechanisms of transverse straining, the study also shows digital volume correlation of tomography sequences to be the perfect tool to study complex mechanical behaviour of cellular materials.

ID NEGATIVE POISSONS RATIO
AB Graphene is an active element used in the design of nano-electro-mechanical systems (NEMS) owing to its excellent in-plane physical properties on mechanical, electric and thermal aspects. Considering a component requiring negative Poisson's ratio in NEMS, a graphene kirigami (GK) containing periodic re-entrant honeycombs is a natural option. This study demonstrates that a GK with specific auxetic property can be obtained by adjusting the sizes of its honeycombs. Using molecular dynamics experiments, the size effects on the auxetic behaviour of GK are investigated. In some cases, the auxetic difference between the hydrogenated GK and continuum kirigami (CK) is negligible, in which the results from macro CK can be used to predict auxetic behaviour of nano kirigami. Surface effect of GK is demonstrated from two aspects. One is to identify the difference of mechanical responses between the pure carbon GK and the hydrogenated GK at same geometry and loading condition. Another is from the difference of mechanical responses between the GK model and the CK model under same loading condition and geometric configuration. Generally, surface energy makes the GK possess higher variation of auxetic behaviour. It also results in higher modulus for the GK as comparing with that of the CK.

AB Base isolation is a widely-used method used to minimise the harmful effects of earthquakes on buildings. Unlike a fixed base building, a building with a base isolation system essentially decouples the superstructure from the substructure resting on the ground. Then, during earthquakes, the superstructure's relative displacement is significantly reduced, minimising the structural damage. Auxetics, which are materials with a negative Poisson's ratio, are known for possessing properties such as high energy absorption. Based on the energy absorbing capabilities of auxetic materials, it is proposed that incorporating them into base isolation structures would positively impact on the performance of the system. Therefore, the article aims to investigate the response of structures under seismic loading incorporating re-entrant hexagon layers into the base isolation system. This is assessed by defining and numerically testing the system using finite element analysis. The models developed for this study represent multi-story structural steel frames combined with fixed base, conventional lead-rubber bearing and auxetic composite base isolation. Differences in the response obtained from the mentioned systems are highlighted. Results indicate that the auxetic base isolation may improve the dynamic response of structures, although a unique performance is not recorded.

AB Recent theoretical work suggests that systematic pruning of disordered networks consisting of nodes connected by springs can lead to materials that exhibit a host of unusual mechanical properties. In particular, global properties such as Poisson's ratio or local responses related to deformation can be precisely altered. Tunable mechanical responses would be useful in areas ranging from impact mitigation to robotics and, more generally, for creation of metamaterials with engineered properties. However, experimental attempts to create auxetic materials based on pruningbased theoretical ideas have not been successful. Here we introduce a more realistic model of the networks, which incorporates angle-bending forces and the appropriate experimental boundary conditions. A sequential pruning strategy of select bonds in this model is then devised and implemented that enables engineering of specific mechanical behaviors upon deformation, both in the linear and in the nonlinear regimes. In particular, it is shown that Poisson's ratio can be tuned to arbitrary values. The model and concepts discussed here are validated by preparing physical realizations of the networks designed in this manner, which are produced by laser cutting 2D sheets and are found to behave as predicted. Furthermore, by relying on optimization algorithms, we exploit the networks' susceptibility to tuning to design networks that possess a distribution of stiffer and more compliant bonds and whose auxetic behavior is even greater than that of homogeneous networks. Taken together, the findings reported here serve to establish that pruned networks represent a promising platform for the creation of unique mechanical metamaterials.

ID NEGATIVE POISSON RATIO; DESIGN; HONEYCOMB; GLASSES
AB Auxetic materials are characterized by a negative Poisson's ratio, nu. As the Poisson's ratio approaches the lower isotropic mechanical limit of nu = -1, materials show enhanced resistance to impact and shear, making them suitable for applications ranging from robotics to impact mitigation. Past experimental efforts aimed at reaching the nu = -1 limit have resulted in highly anisotropic materials, which show a negative Poisson's ratio only when subjected to deformations along specific directions. Isotropic designs have only attained moderately auxetic behavior or have led to solutions that cannot be manufactured in 3D. Here, we present a design strategy to create isotropic structures from disordered networks, which result in Poisson's ratios as low as nu = -0.98. The materials conceived through this approach are successfully fabricated in the laboratory and behave as predicted. nu depends on network structure and bond strengths; this sheds light on the motifs which lead to auxetic behavior. The ideas introduced here can be generalized to 3D, a wide range of materials, and a spectrum of length scales, thereby providing a general platform that could impact technology.

AB This paper reports a study on the large amplitude nonlinear vibration of carbon nanotube-reinforced composite (CNTRC) laminated plates with negative Poisson's ratios in thermal environments. The constituent materials of CNTRCs are temperature-dependent and the plate is functionally graded (FG) in a piece-wise pattern in the thickness direction of plate. An extended Voigt (rule of mixture) model is adopted to quantify the CNTRC material properties of the laminated plate. The governing motion equations for the large amplitude vibration of FG-CNTRC laminated plates are based on the Reddy's third order shear deformation theory and the von Karman-type kinematic nonlinearity framework, and the thermal effects and the reaction from elastic foundation are taken into account. The nonlinear solution of the motion equation can be obtained by applying a two-step perturbation approach. The effects of material property gradient, the temperature variation, stacking sequence as well as the foundation stiffness on the vibration characteristics of CNTRC laminated plates are examined and discussed in depth through a parametric study. The results show that negative Poisson's ratio has a significant effect on the linear and nonlinear vibration characteristics of CNTRC laminated plates.

AB In this paper, a novel auxetic weft-knitted fabric was firstly designed, which was based on the rhombus-shaped grid re-entrant structure. Then the fabric was fabricated using Kevlar filament yarn with 200D fineness on a computerized flat knitting machine. And the Poisson's ratio values in weft, warp, and diagonal directions of this weft-knitted fabric were measured. The results showed that it exhibits the negative Poisson's ratio effect in all three directions. Then the quasi-static stab resistance tests at five different puncture speeds were carried out on this auxetic weft-knitted fabric and the plain weft-knitted fabric with same raw material and similar loop length. The experimental results show that the auxetic weft-knitted fabric has higher peak load and energy absorption capacity at quasi-static loading. The results also show that the quasi-static stab resistance of the auxetic weft-knitted fabric strengthens with the increase of the puncture speed, but changes little after the puncture speed reaches a certain value (50 mm/min).

AB Epitaxy and misfit strain imposed by underlying substrates have been intensively used to tailor the microstructure and electronic properties of oxide films, but this approach is largely restricted by commercially limited substrates. In contrast to the conventional epitaxial misfit strains with a positive Poisson's constant, we show here a tunable Poisson's ratio with anomalous values from negative, zero, to positive. This permits effective control over the out-of-plane lattice parameters that strongly correlate the magnetic and transport properties in perovskite mixed-valence La1-xSrcMnO3 thin films. Our results provide an unconventional approach to better modulation and understanding of elastic-mediated microstructures and physical properties of oxide films by engineering the Poisson's ratios.

AB The influence of the Poisson's ratio of the foam on the energy absorption of the foam-filled tube is investigated in this paper. Firstly, the relationship between the mechanical properties and the structural parameters of the 3D lattice structure is calculated by using the theory of material mechanics. The finite element analysis software ABAQUS is used to simulate the axial dynamic response of cylindrical tubes filled with conventional and negative Poisson's ratio foams. Based on this, the interaction between the tube wall and foam is analyzed in detail. Combining the structural properties of both the positive and negative Poisson's ratio foams, a new foam model with mixed Poisson's ratio (MPR) is proposed, and the crashworthiness of three different types of tubes, namely the sandwich double tubes filled with positive, negative and mixed Poisson's ratio foams, is analyzed. The results show that the interaction between the foam and the tube wall has a significant effect on the energy absorption performance. The sandwich double tube filled with MPR foam has better specific energy absorption (SEA) and stronger interaction than those filled with pure positive or negative Poisson's ratio foam. This study provides a new insight into crashworthiness design of foam-filled structures.

AB To investigate the performance of gypsum rock softened by water in the tunneling, gypsum rocks from Lower Triassic Jialing River Group were immersed by fresh water within different times for softening tests. The variations of uniaxial compressive strength, shear strength, elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio of gypsum rocks with increasing immersion time were analyzed. The study indicated that, with the increase of the immersion time, the uniaxial compressive strength, shear strength and elastic modulus of gypsum rock exhibited a decline trend as a negative exponent, while Poisson's ratio presented a linear increase trend under certain conditions. On the basis of damage mechanics, a softening damage evolution equation was deduced by considering time effect of gypsum rock. The relationship between the brittleness coefficient and softening-damage variable was revealed, and the softening-depth model at different immersion time was established. This study can be used to identify the softening area of surrounding rock caused by groundwater in the tunneling through gypsum layer.

ID DEFORMATION
AB Various polyethylene foams were subjected to thermo-mechanical processing with the aim of transforming them into re-entrant materials exhibiting negative Poisson's ratio. Following transformation, large cell foams (cell sizes of 1 and 2 mm) exhibited re-entrant cell structure and negative Poisson's ratio over a range of processing times and temperatures. Poisson's ratio vs. strain for these foams was similar to prior results for reticulated polyurethane foams. Following processing, microcellular polyethylene foam was densified but cells remained convex; it did not exhibit a substantial negative Poisson's ratio. This foam had a different transition temperature as determined via DSC than the large cell foams. (C) 2001 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

ID OPTIMAL BOUNDS; ELASTICITY
AB A FAMILY of two-dimensional, two-phase, composite materials with hexagonal symmetry is found with Poisson's ratios arbitrarily close to -1. Letting kappa*, kappa-1, kappa-2 and mu*, mu-1, mu-2 denote the bulk and shear moduli of one such composite, stiff inclusion phase and compliant matrix phase, respectively, it is rigorously established that when kappa-1 = kappa-2/r and mu-1 = mu-2/r there exists a constant c depending only on kappa-2, mu-2 and the geometry such that kappa*/mu* < c square-root s for all sufficiently small stiffness ratios r (specifically for r < 1/9). This implies that the Poisson's ratio approaches -1 as r --> 0 and in this limit it is conjectured that the material deforms conformally on a macroscopic scale. By introducing additional microstructure on a smaller length scale a second family of composites is obtained with substantially lower Poisson's ratios, each satisfying kappa*/mu* < c'r. These two families provide conclusive proof that isotropic materials with negative Poisson's ratio exist within the framework of continuum elasticity. It is also shown that elastically isotropic two- and three-dimensional composites with Poisson's ratio approaching -1 as r --> 0 can be generated simply by layering the component materials together in different directions on widely separated length scales.

AB An exciting paradigm in the ongoing development of materials is the development of auxetic mechanical metamaterials, which can be flexibly designed to exhibit a unique range of physical and mechanical properties. Inspired by nonuniform or nonhomogeneous metamaterials and structures, annular cellular structures composed of auxetic metamaterials with graded negative Poisson's ratios (NPRs) are studied, and the considered models are divided into two types of configurations: models with graded decreasing NPRs and models with graded increasing NPRs along the radial direction. The spectral element method (SEM) is applied to accurately predict the structural dynamic responses with a limited number of elements and the system scale for arbitrary frequencies. The static stiffness and vibro-acoustic performance of the proposed structures are investigated and compared. The computational results show that the bending stiffness, vibrating mode shapes and deformations, and sound transmission loss (STL) of the considered cellular structures are strongly affected by the arbitrarily patterned graded auxetic metamaterials. Within the studied STL frequency range from 1 to 1500 Hz, optimal designs of the conventional and graded configurations for the maximum STL are obtained for specified tonal and frequency band cases under cylindrical incident sound waves. The results show that the graded configurations have more potential than the conventional ones for optimal acoustic performance and that compared with the graded decreasing NPR models, the graded increasing NPR models exhibit STL increases of 6.73 dB, 1.22 dB, and 2.06 dB for the studied cases. Both the STL and optimal design results indicate the advantages of the graded increasing NPR models for use in acoustic attenuation applications. Thus, graded auxetic metamaterials offer a great opportunity for achieving unusual vibro-acoustic performance and extending the route to obtain an optimized set of physical properties for cellular metamaterials and structures.

AB This paper presents an investigation on the nonlinear flexural vibrations of carbon nanotube-reinforced composite (CNTRC) laminated cylindrical shells with negative Poisson's ratios in thermal environments. The material properties of the CNTRCs are temperature-dependent and the functionally graded (FG) in a piece-wise pattern in the thickness direction of the shell. An extended Voigt (rule of mixture) model is employed to estimate the CNTRC material properties. The motion equations for the nonlinear flexural vibration of FG-CNTRC laminated cylindrical shells are based on the Reddy's third order shear deformation theory and the von Karman-type kinematic nonlinearity, and the effects of thermal environmental conditions are included. The nonlinear vibration solutions for the FG-CNTRC laminated cylindrical shells can be obtained by applying a singular perturbation technique along with a two-step perturbation approach. The effects of material property gradient, the temperature variation, shell geometric parameter, stacking sequence as well as the end conditions on the vibration characteristics of CNTRC laminated cylindrical shells are discussed in detail through a parametric study. The results show that negative Poisson's ratio has a significant effect on the linear and nonlinear vibration characteristics of CNTRC laminated cylindrical shells. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

ID POISSONS RATIO
AB In modern technologies searching materials of peculiar features is of a fundamental interest for many researchers and engineers. Negative Poisson's ratio materials and structures expand transversely when stretching axially. Nowadays, there is an increasing interest in the development of these novel materials called auxetics. We are interested not only in their mechanical properties, but also in their interaction with external physical fields, e. g. electromagnetic field. It is expected that magnetoelastic surface waves propagation has essential meaning in many other physical and biomechanical applications. The paper aims at investigating propagation of magnetoelastic surface waves along an auxetic elastic halfspace in the presence of an external magnetic field of various orientations related to the limiting plane. Dispersion and existence conditions of those waves have been calculated and analyzed in order to present new features of described interactions. It has occurred that the dispersion properties in the case of the Rayleigh-like magnetoelastic surface waves are significantly different for the auxetic material compared to materials of positive Poisson's ratio.

AB Metamaterials are man-made, usually periodically microstructured materials with at least one uncommon property, e.g., auxeticity. Often, their properties are due to their specific microstructural layouts in addition to their constituent materials. In this work, we explore the influence of constituent materials on the effective elasticity of a two-phase composite consisting of a infilled re-entrant honeycomb microstructure. We show that the composite with non-auxetic constituent materials becomes auxetic if the Young's modulus contrast between the two phases exceeds a certain critical value. We reveal the existence of a phase contrast mediated switch of auxetic mechanism - a finding reported for the first time in this paper. If the re-entrant honeycomb phase is stiffer than the filling phase, the auxeticity stems from the conventional re-entrant mechanism, similar to re-entrant honeycomb structures. However, if the re-entrant honeycomb phase is softer than the filling phase, the auxeticity originates from the relative microscopic sliding between adjacent fillings under macroscopic axial loading. Our results provide guidelines on tuning the effective elasticity and the auxeticity of such composites by educated choices of the constituent materials and the underlying microstructural geometry.

AB A rectangular-cells with triangular array and a triangular-cells with rectangular array composite microstructures are introduced herein, which can exhibit Poisson's ratio sign switching upon reversal of applied stress direction. Each of these microstructures consists of short rigid rods and long flexible rods held together by pin joints. The choice of microstructures permits them to be converted into either conventional or auxetic microstructural geometries depending on the collective deflection patterns of the long flexible rods. Specifically, the micro-structures convert into conventional and auxetic ones when loading causes the long flexible rods to deflect outward and inward, respectively. The same consideration applies in the case of thermal expansion analysis, which leads to positive and negative thermal expansivities under constraint condition. Generated results were made on the basis of moderately large deflection analysis and buckling analysis. A greater range of applications can be made on a single structure when it can exhibit greatly differing, or even opposing, properties under loadings of opposite directions.

AB The intrinsic negative Poisson's ratio effect at the level of molecule in two-dimensional nanomaterials, especially in the perfect planar nanostructures with a single atom thickness, is really rare and has attracted a lot of research interests because of its unique mechanical properties in the nanoscale and extensive applications in mechanical nanodevices. In this work, a novel ideal planar carbon nanostructure (PCNS) framework with a single atom thickness composed by carbon and hydrogen atoms is proposed and studied by means of first-principles density functional calculation. The results showed that the PCNS is, simultaneously, of excellent thermodynamic, molecular dynamic and mechanical stabilities. In addition, the electronic structure, mechanical characters, and optical-electronic characteristics of PCNS are also explored. Excitedly, it is found that the PCNS has a significant negative Poisson's ratio effect in plane, and the maximum value of Poisson's ratio is as high as - 2.094. Meanwhile, the material has a wide range of elastic mechanics. Moreover, the PCNS presents an ideal UV absorption performance. It is hoped that this work could be a useful structural design strategy for the development of the ideal 2D carbon-based nanomechanical devices with the intrinsic negative Poisson's ratio effect and other electronic functions.

AB This research presents an investigation of the compressive behavior of auxetic cementitious cellular composites (CCCs) using a combination of experiments and finite element (FE) simulations. Typical auxetic centrosymmetric geometry was used as unit cells for the cellular structure and fiber reinforced cementitious mortar were used as constituent material. By varying the cellular geometry, three CCCs (P0, P25 and P50) were prepared then experimentally and numerically tested under uniaxial compression with different boundary conditions. Good agreement can be found between experimental and FE simulated results: Only CCCs with chiral section (P25 and P50) exhibited auxetic behavior and a typical compressive stress-strain response with two peaks was found; Under restrained boundary condition, different from the cone confinement zone observed in bulk cementitious materials, re-entrant confinement zone was found in the auxetic CCCs. More importantly, a cracking initiated section rotation mechanism is identified for the CCCs' auxetic behavior which is distinct from the elastic instability mechanism of polymeric auxetic materials with the same cellular structure. In terms of density, energy dissipation ability and Poisson's ratio, the auxetic CCCs shows excellent properties making them promising in various civil engineering applications.

AB This short communication investigates the effect of negative Poisson's ratio on the natural frequency of thick plates of arbitrary shape. Using the Mindlin plate theory, it was generally found that as the plate's Poisson's ratio becomes more negative, the Mindlin-to-Kirchhoff natural frequency ratio increases with decreasing rate. Upon comparing (a) the use of the simplified constant shear correction factor and the more accurate variable shear correction factor, (b) with and without rotary inertia, it was found that all the four combinations stated in (a) and (b) do not give appreciable difference when the Poisson's ratio of the plate is positive. However in the case of plates with negative Poisson's ratio, results reveal that when at least one of the simplifying assumptions is used, the Mindlin-to-Kirchhoff natural frequency ratio is overestimated, and that the overestimation further increases when both the simplifying assumptions are used. When benchmarked against Reddy plate theory, the use of variable shear correction factor has almost the same effect as the inclusion of rotary inertia. Hence the use of either variable shear correction factor or rotary inertia is proposed for modeling the vibrational frequencies of conventional and auxetic isotropic plates. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Negative Poisson's ratio in two-dimensional honeycomb structures

DT Article
ID THERMAL-CONDUCTIVITY; GRAPHENE; CARBON
AB Negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) in auxetic materials is of great interest due to the typically enhanced mechanical properties, which enables plenty of novel applications. In this paper, by employing first-principles calculations, we report the emergence of NPR in a class of two-dimensional honeycomb structures (graphene, silicene, h-BN, h-GaN, h-SiC, and h-BAs), which are distinct from all other known auxetic materials. They share the same mechanism for the emerged NPR despite the different chemical composition, which lies in the increased bond angle (theta). However, the increase of theta is quite intriguing and anomalous, which cannot be explained in the traditional point of view of the geometry structure and mechanical response, for example, in the framework of classical molecular dynamics simulations based on empirical potential. We attribute the counterintuitive increase of theta and the emerged NPR fundamentally to the strain-modulated electronic orbital coupling and hybridization. It is proposed that the NPR phenomenon can also emerge in other nanostructures or nanomaterials with similar honeycomb structure. The physical origin as revealed in our study deepens the understanding on the NPR and would shed light on future design of modern nanoscale electromechanical devices with special functions based on auxetic nanomaterials and nanostructures.

AB Metamaterials with negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) have a broad range of application background, such as aerospace engineering, automotive engineering, medical instrument engineering, and wearable engineering. Herein, a novel strategy for constructing 3D dislocated chiral metamaterial is proposed that can achieve NPR effect in three directions. According to this strategy, a new dislocated chiral metamaterial composed of dislocated tetrachiral honeycombs and inclined rods is designed and selected as an example to investigate the effectiveness of the strategy. Experiments and numerical simulations are carried out to study the mechanical properties of the new metamaterial, confirming that this metamaterial exhibits NPR effect. The influence of geometric parameters on the elastic constants of the metamaterial is discussed based on experimental and numerical results. Meanwhile, the local loading performances of this dislocated chiral metamaterial and the previous aligned chiral metamaterial are studied and compared. Results show that this dislocated metamaterial possesses a stronger damage resistance capacity than the aligned one. By adjusting the rotational direction of ligaments in honeycombs and the arrangement of inclined rods, more special 3D dislocated chiral metamaterials with advanced properties are available, such as metamaterial with both positive and NPRs, metamaterial with compression-torsion effect.

AB Such advantages of auxetic structures like scalability, large volume expansion could be used to produce components with deployability and multifunctional characteristics. Kirigami allows cutting patterns that make possible the production of 3D complex structures (mainly cellular) using state-of-the-art manufacturing processes typical of thermosets and thermoplastics composites. New types of mechanical and EM responses can be obtained combining auxetics and kirigami within antennas/reflectors.

ID NEGATIVE POISSONS RATIO; FABRICS
AB This paper examines a novel approach to designing auxetic textiles. Knit design techniques are used to create auxetic weft-knitted textiles. Development of the appropriate fabrics addresses aesthetic, tactile and subjective design qualities alongside questions of auxetic functionality and testing considerations. The auxetic fabrics produced exhibit expansion in the X- or Y-axis (aligning axes to direction of knitting). The results range from neutral Poisson's ratio to those with a marked expansion in relation to their extension. The fabric discussed uses relief stitch structures and transferred stitches. Variant auxetic knitted fabrics have been produced including related stitch structures and spacer fabrics using the same design processes. The auxetic effects are inspired by common auxetic geometries from the literature. This research aims to combine the methodologies used in knit design and knit engineering to create functional auxetic textiles by using the methods innate to a more traditionally aesthetic design subject. Using quantitative methods to measure the auxetic effect in the samples and qualitative personal reflections on samples, results are kept simple in order to promote dissemination amongst practitioners in different fields. Utilising focus groups with practitioners from various design fields it is also possible to assess the visual, tactile and commercial appeal of the auxetic fabrics whilst they are still in the developmental stage. Using these different methods of feedback into the design stage the theoretical outcome remains simple in terms of language and results stated. The importance of knowledge transfer between disciplines of design and engineering is key to this study. Data capture is imperative encompassing qualitative and quantitative perspectives in conjunction with the use of generically specified terminology. The knowledge transfer afforded by these collaborations is a key output to support the methods chosen for fabric development, those which cross disciplines and appeal to a wide market. Along with an open and experimental approach to conceiving product applications, this will help to place auxetic materials in public view in areas that are novel to the field of auxetic research.

AB Nanocomposite materials, such as carbon nanotube-reinforced composites (CNTRCs), have emerged as a novel engineering material. They have received growing attentions in various engineering sectors. The fabrication process has also offered the possibility to design and make this type of material to have desired features, such as being functionally graded (FG) or/and having negative Poison's ratio. This paper reports an investigation on the nonlinear flexural behavior of auxetic laminated beams with each layer is made of CNTRC. Each layer may have different CNT volume fractions and the functional grading occurs in the thickness direction of the beam in the piece-wise pattern. The extended rule of mixture model is used to evaluate the temperature-dependent material properties of CNTRCs. The governing equations for the nonlinear bending of FG-CNTRC laminated beams are derived based on the high order shear deformation beam theory. These equations include the geometrical nonlinearity in the von Karman sense and take into account the thermal effect and the beam-foundation interaction. The nonlinear bending solutions can be obtained by employing a two-step perturbation approach. The nonlinear flexural responses of FG-CNTRC laminated beams under a uniform pressure in thermal environments are revealed and examined in details through a parametric study. Results showed that the negative Poisson's ratio has a significant impact on the nonlinear flexural behavior of CNTRC laminated beams.

AB This paper reports a finite element (FE) analysis of three-dimensional (3D) auxetic textile composite by using commercial software ANSYS 15 under compression. The two-dimensional (2D) FE model was first developed and validated by experiment. Then, the validated model was used to evaluate effects of structural parameters and constituent material properties. For the comparison, 3D non-auxetic composite that was made with the same constituent materials and structural parameters, but with different yarn arrangement in the textile structure was also analyzed at the same time. The analysis results showed that the auxetic and non-auxetic composites have different compression behaviors and the auxetic composite has better the energy absorption capacity than the non-auxetic composite under the same compression stress. The study has provided us a guidance to design and fabricate auxetic composites with the required mechanical behavior by appropriately selecting structural parameters and constituent materials.

AB Herein, the effect of symmetric carbon fiber composites laminates with angle-ply stacking sequences ([+/-beta/+/-theta](S)) in the design of composite piezoelectric energy harvesters (PEHs) is evaluated. Some of those specific stacking sequences also feature negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) or near zero Poisson's ratio (NZPR) through the thickness for ply angles theta < 45 degrees. Six different architectures with similar in-plane elastic modulusE(1)and different positive Poisson's ratio and NPRv(13)values are considered here. Finite element models are developed to understand the distribution of the voltage density of the laminates with the different stacking sequences and their bending properties. Experimental tests (three-point bending and vibration) are also performed. Both the simulations and the experimental results show that the PEH with the stacking sequences of near zerov(13)generate the highest power compared with the other composite energy harvesters. The maximum voltage frequency response function (FRF) happens at the fundamental resonance, and the PEH with near zerov(13)has also the lowest resonance frequency compared with the other stacking sequences.

AB An innovative three-dimensional (3D) auxetic structure based on 2D re-entrant honeycombs was developed in this article. A sample of the proposed structure made of acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) was fabricated through 3D printing technology, and a compression test was performed on it. Meanwhile, the unit cell required for the finite-element (FE) analysis was determined to simulate the auxetic behavior of the proposed structure. Both experimental and numerical results showed that the 3D structure can achieve a negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) in two principal orthogonal coordinate directions when it was compressed along the other principal axis. A systematic numerical simulation was performed through the experimentally validated finite element models to analyze the effects of structural parameters (i.e., top-view reentrant angle and lateral-view re-entrant angle) and deformation on the auxetic behavior. Numerical results revealed that this structure can achieve a negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) under large deformation and the structural parameters and compression strain have significant effects on the auxetic behavior. Our structure, with large flexibility in design, is based on very simple initial geometric shapes. This analysis can provide useful information for the design, fabrication of this kind of 3D auxetic structure, which is promising in some technical applications. (C) 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB Mines, specifically as Anti-Tank (AT) mines are a significant threat for defence vehicles. While approaches such as v-shaped hulls are currently used to deflect the blast products from such threats, such a solution is not always usable when hull standoff is limited. As such the development of a low profile, energy absorbing solution is desirable. One approach that has potential to achieve these requirements are sandwich panels. While sandwich panel cores can be constructed from various materials, one material of particular interest are auxetics. Auxetic are materials that exhibit a negative Poisson's ratio. This material has potential to be an efficient an impact energy absorber by increasing stiffness at local deformation by gathering mass at the impact location. This study investigates the effectiveness of novel auxetic core infills alongside three other panel types (monolithic, air gap, polymer foam sandwich) against buried charges. 160 grams of PE4 were buried in 100 mm depth and 500 mm stand off the target. Laser and High Speed Video (HSV) system were used to capture the deflection-time profile and load cell sensors were used to record the loading profile received by the panels. Experimental works were compared with numerical model. Explicit model were generated in LSDYNA software as 'initial impulse mine' keyword. The result found that the auxetic and foam core panels were effective in reducing peak structural loading and impulse by up to 33% and 34% respectively. Air-filled panels were the most effective to reduce the deflection of the rear of the plate, however variation between capture methods (HSV and Laser system) were reported, while numerical modelling provided comparable plate deflections responses. When normalised against panel weight, the air filled panels were experimentally the most efficient per unit mass system with the auxetics being the least effective.

AB A novel 3D re-entrant chiral auxetic (RCA) structure has been proposed for the first time in this study. The unit cell has been developed with solid cubes and struts based on the topological features of both re-entrant honeycomb and chiral honeycomb. A recently developed powerful 3D printing process, Multi Jet Fusion (MJF), has been employed to print six samples from polyamide 12 (PA 12). Uniaxial quasi-static compressive tests have been performed in the X, Y and Z directions to investigate the deformation, Poisson's ratio and energy absorption of the proposed structure. Finite element (FE) models have been developed using ANSYS/LS-DYNA and verified by the respective experimental data. The experimental microscopic measurements reveal high accuracy of MJF process to produce robust parts with smooth internal morphology. The designed cubes are found to demonstrate a similar rotation function to that of cylinders of the corresponding 2D RCA structure. The plastic bending and buckling are found to be the dominated deformation mechanisms for the samples compressed in the Y direction, while plastic bending is the dominated deformation mechanism for the samples compressed in the X and Z directions. The proposed structure displays auxetic feature under uniaxial compression in all three directions, which facilitates a more severe compaction of the structure and results in an improved load carrying capacity. It is also found that the compressed RCA structure when loaded in the X direction outperforms in terms of auxeticity and energy absorption compared with the other (Y and Z) directions. The proposed 3D RCA structure has anisotropic properties.

AB Cellular core structures with a negative Poisson's ratio, also known as auxetic core structures, are gaining attention due to their unique performance in sandwich panel systems for protecting critical infrastructures and military vehicles that are at high risk of blast and impact loads due to accidental and deliberate events. To help develop a high-performance protective system, this article outlines the performance evaluation of five different auxetic cell configurations based on a quantitative/qualitative review of an experimental load-deformation relationship of three-dimensional-printed auxetic panels from nylon plastics and the overall performance evaluation of metallic re-entrant honeycomb core sandwich panels as one type of lightweight protective system under static and dynamic loads via experimental testing and numerical simulations. The re-entrant honeycomb design displayed the most consistent auxetic behaviour. Quasi-static compression and drop hammer impact tests were performed using the proposed full-scale sandwich panel design with two different configurations as a protective system for concrete wall structures in combination with plastic face plates. The effect of the internal angle of the re-entrant honeycomb design and the effect of the core material under static and dynamic loads were evaluated using full-scale sandwich panels. Furthermore, two separate materials - acrylonitrile butadiene styrene and low-density polyethylene - were used as face plates, and the low-density polyethylene was effective for lightweight and smooth load transferring and distribution into the auxetic core. Auxetic panel deformation under static and dynamic load was examined using a normal speed camera and high-speed video recording data and all auxetic panels indicated excellent systematic crushing behaviour with drawing materials into the load path to effectively resist the impact load. Numerical simulations were performed using LS-DYNA and indicated good agreement with the experimental results. Finally, protective systems utilising sandwich panels with a re-entrant honeycomb core indicated strong potential for the development of high-performance lightweight impact-resistant protective systems.

AB Force field based simulation has been employed to predict the deformation mechanisms of auxetic nano-materials having tetrahedral framework. The structure of alpha-quartz was studied in detail for subjecting to uniaxial loading along the Z direction. The cooperative dilation and rotation of tetrahedra acting concurrently were demonstrated to be the main deformation mechanism of alpha-quartz, confirming previous analytical model. Slight tetrahedral distortion also existed for undeformed and deformed structure.

AB Composites with auxetic effect have been drawing more attention in recent years due to their unique features and wide applications. In this study, a kind of novel multilayer orthogonal structural composite with auxetic effect was fabricated for energy absorption and impact resistance. Non-auxetic composite with the same raw materials but with different reinforcement structure was also fabricated for comparison in order to better understand the effect of reinforced structure on the deformation mechanism and mechanical responses of the composites. Since the quasi-static compressive properties and Poisson's ratio effect of composites had been investigated previously, this paper only focused on the study of the low velocity drop-weight impact tests of composites under impact energies from 7.25 J to 65.25 J. It was shown that both auxetic and non-auxetic composites were strain rate sensitive from 34.23 s(-1) to 111.48 s(-1), but they exhibited totally different mechanical responses due to different deformation and damage mechanism. Pull out tests demonstrated that strong interfacial bonding between the reinforcements and matrix could ensure the desired deformation of structural reinforcements and auxetic effect of the composite. It was also concluded that the auxetic composite had better energy absorption performance in medium strain range. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The conventional magnetostrictive strain sensor suffers from low detection sensitivity. In this study, a wireless and passive magnetostrictive strain sensor with improved sensitivity was proposed, modelled, analyzed, and tested. A hollow plate with a negative Poisson's ratio structure was taken as the substrate, substituting this for the conventional positive Poisson's ratio material. An analysis model was established for the negative Poisson's ratio substrate. Finite element method (FEM) analysis was conducted to verify the negative Poisson's ratio model. Experiments were carried out to prove the sensitivity enhancement principle. Parametric studies were conducted to investigate the influence of the geometry dimension on the output of the electric signal. We show that the proposed sensor has an improved strain test sensitivity of up to 176.3%. The experimental results further indicate that different geometry dimensions of the negative Poisson's ratio have different influences on the sensitivity of the magnetostrictive strain sensor. The proposed magnetostrictive strain sensor shows the advantages of high sensitivity, easy implementation, convenient fabrication, and low cost.

ID NEGATIVE POISSONS RATIO; MICROPOROUS MATERIALS
AB Auxetic materials have a negative Poisson's ratio, that is, they expand laterally when stretched longitudinally. Negative Poisson's ratio is an unusual property that affects many of the mechanical properties of the material, such as indentation resistance, compression, shear stiffness, and certain aspects of the dynamic performance. The unusual mechanical properties of auxetic foams are attributed to the deformation characteristics of re-entrant microstructures. One way of obtaining negative Poisson's ratio is by using a re-entrant cell structure. Auxetic foam was fabricated from a conventional polymeric foam. The fabrication method for making both small and large auxetic foam specimens is described.

AB A necessity is shown for new reasoning of procedures for estimating the values of elastic moduli of the classical linear isotropic theory of elasticity, in which an existence of the materials with negative values of the Poisson ratio (auxetic materials) is allowed. The new estimates of values of elastic moduli are offered, which are based on only the necessary condition of positivity of the internal energy. It is proven that this condition allows an existence of arbitrary negative values of Poisson ratio sigma, which is accompanied by the negative values of the Lame modulus lambda as well as the bulk modulus k and Young modulus E, just as the new mechanical effects-expansion of the standard sample rod under unilateral tension and expansion of the standard sample cube under hydrostatic pressure.

AB We propose that wave propagation through a class of mechanical metamaterials opens unprecedented avenues in seismic wave protection based on spectral properties of auxetic-like metamaterials. The elastic parameters of these metamaterials like the bulk and shear moduli, the mass density, and even the Poisson ratio, can exhibit negative values in elastic stop bands. We show here that the propagation of seismic waves with frequencies ranging from 1 Hz to 40 Hz can be influenced by a decameter scale version of auxetic-like metamaterials buried in the soil, with the combined effects of impedance mismatch, local resonances and Bragg stop bands. More precisely, we numerically examine and illustrate the markedly different behaviors between the propagation of seismic waves through a homogeneous isotropic elastic medium (concrete) and an auxetic-like metamaterial plate consisting of 4(3) cells (40 m x 40 m x 40 m), utilized here as a foundation of a building one would like to protect from seismic site effects. This novel class of seismic metamaterials opens band gaps at frequencies compatible with seismic waves when they are designed appropriately, what makes them interesting candidates for seismic isolation structures.

AB A numerical analysis using the finite element (FE) method was conducted to investigate the deformation behavior of a novel three-dimensional (3D) textile structure made by a special arrangement of the weft and warp yarns in a 3D orthogonal structure to achieve negative Poisson's ratio (NPR). The minimum number of unit cells required for the FE analysis was first determined by comparing the calculating results of Poisson's ratio values based on the FE models built with fixed structural parameters and yarn properties. Then Poisson's ratio values of the 3D textile structure with different structural parameters and yarn properties under compression were calculated using the FE models built with the determined unit cells. The calculating results show that the 3D structure can achieve NPR in one direction if the weft and warp yarns used have different bending stiffness and radii. This numerical analysis can provide useful information for the design and fabrication of this kind of 3D textile structure, which has high potential applications in composite reinforcement and other technical areas.

AB The unique physical properties of auxetic compounds make them very attractive materials. Nevertheless, no synthesised materials known to exhibit negative Poisson's ratio at the molecular level have been made. One way to explore such compounds is to predict potential candidates prior to their synthesis. To achieve it, multi-atom simulation is a powerful predicting tool. However, the lack of existing systems means that the crucial step of validation cannot be carried out. This paper aims to provide a procedure to predict the auxeticity of proposed molecular systems. The strategy is based on first revealing the determinant step in reaching the mechanical equilibrium of existing isotropic compounds such as polymers, or organic glasses, to compute efficiently mechanical properties. The Poisson's ratio is found in good agreement with experimental data. The procedure is thus modified to be applied to anisotropic compounds, liquid crystals. The agreement with experimental behaviour allowed us to extrapolate the procedure to potentially auxetic compounds, thus offering great opportunities to reveal auxetic properties prior to the synthesis of the molecules.

AB Recently, beta-Te [atomically two-dimensional (2D) tellurium] with rectangular crystal structure has been synthesized successfully on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite substrates by using molecular beam epitaxy [Z. Zhu et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 119, 106101 (2017); Chen et al., Nanoscale 9, 15945 (2017)]. It has been found to possess remarkable properties such as ultralow lattice thermal conductivity and high thermoelectric efficiency. Based on first-principles calculations, we study the thermal expansion and thermodynamic properties of the experimental phase monolayer beta-Te, using the quasiharmonic approach. It is found that beta-Te shows large positive thermal expansion at elevated temperature, while the linear thermal expansion coefficient is negative along the a direction at very low temperature. The linear thermal expansion coefficient along the b direction is 4.9 x 10(-5) K-1 at 500 K, which is considerably large in 2D materials. beta-Te exhibits strong in-plane anisotropy, including thermal expansion, 2D elastic moduli, and Poisson's ratios. However, the elastic moduli, Poisson's ratios and the in-plane anisotropy are weakened with increasing temperature, and the variations are dominated by the generalized mode Gruneisen parameters.

AB This paper investigates the nonlinear flexural vibration of sandwich beams with functionally graded (FG) negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) honeycomb core in thermal environments. The novel constructions of sandwich beams with three FG configurations of re-entrant honeycomb cores through the beam thickness direction are proposed. The temperature-dependent material properties of both face sheets and core of the sandwich beams are considered. 3D full-scale finite element analyses are conducted to investigate the nonlinear vibration, and the variation of effective Poisson's ratio (EPR) of the sandwich beams in the large deflection region. Numerical simulations are carried out for the sandwich beam with FG-NPR honeycomb core in different thermal environmental conditions, from which results for the same sandwich beam with uniform distributed NPR honeycomb core are obtained as a basis for comparison. The effects of FG configurations, temperature changes, boundary conditions, and facesheet-to-core thickness ratios on the nonlinear vibration ratio curves and EPR-deflection curves of sandwich beams are discussed in detail.

AB Wire-woven Kagome is a kind of Periodic Cellular Metal, which is known to have high strength, stiffness for its weight, and potential for mass production. In this work, we developed a new structure that mimics alpha-cristobalite. First, an ordinary wire-woven Kagome was fabricated using metallic wires, and the tetrahedral cells were then filled with metal balls and epoxy. The wire-woven Kagome was transformed to have a negative Poisson's ratio by carrying out a specified amount of initial deformation. The fabrication possibility and kinematic behavior were checked by using FEA simulation. Finally, the mechanical properties were measured using compressive tests.

AB Natrolite (NAT) is a zeolite which exhibits negative Poisson's ratios (auxetic) in its (001) plane (i.e. expands laterally when uniaxially stretched and becomes narrower when compressed), a property which has now been verified experimentally. It was recently shown that the empty SiO2 equivalent of the NAT framework is more auxetic if it is tested in conditions of positive external hydrostatic pressures. Here, we report results of additional simulations which show that the extent of auxetic behaviour of NAT having the standard composition (i.e. Na-2(Al2Si3O10)center dot 2H(2)O) is also highly dependent on the magnitude of external pressure where it is tested. However, in contrast with the behaviour of its empty silica equivalent, NAT exhibits maximum auxetic behaviour at negative external hydrostatic pressures (i.e. partial vacuum conditions). This is very significant as it highlights the fact that auxetic behaviour may be more prominent in materials if they are tested at non-ambient pressure conditions. An attempt is made to explain this behaviour. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Stishovite, a mineral which is estimated to be abundant in the Earth's mantle, exhibits negative Poisson's ratios for a range of loading directions at specific ambient pressure ranges. Here, we investigate the deformation mechanisms which lead to auxetic behaviour in the (001) plane in further detail, and show that the two-dimensional projection of the structure is auxetic by the type dilating rhombi mechanism. This corroborates the distorting octahedra three-dimensional mechanism described previously [Azzopardi et al., RSC Adv. 5, 8974 (2015)]. (C) 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB A novel negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) foam-filled corrugated tube, made up of a corrugated tube and NPR isotropic foam core, is established by the finite element method. The 3D NPR isotropic foam core is achieved by using the triaxial compression method on a cubic Voronoi model, which is created based on the Voronoi tessellation technique. The triaxial compression ratio is defined as eta. The Poisson's ratio of Voronoi foam decreases sharply and then increases gradually with an increasing eta. A minimum Poisson's ratio, -0.076, is obtained when eta = 0.2. Moreover, the Voronoi foam-filled corrugated tube with minimum Poisson's ratio foam core exhibits the highest energy absorption capacity, which is 10.8% higher than that of the Voronoi foam-filled corrugated tubes with uncompressed foam core.

AB Recent frontiers in material development are represented by a class of so-called auxetic metamaterials that, thanks to their structure rather than composition, are characterized by a negative Poisson's ratio. In the present paper a two-dimensional auxetic plate, made by structural straight elements forming a lattice periodic structure with re-entrant cells, is considered. A thorough discussion on the linear and geometrically nonlinear deformability of the auxetic plate is presented. The key geometric parameters governing the deformability of the plate are identified, and some analytical expressions for calculating the Poisson's ratio, as a function of the applied strain, are given. Numerical (finite element) analyses and experimental tests on 3D printed specimens are carried out to verify the theoretical findings. For the latter ones, full field strain maps are obtained by means of a suitable interpolation of the sampled displacement field measured by digital image techniques.

AB Although a negative Poisson's ratio ( that is, a lateral extension in response to stretching) is not forbidden by thermodynamics, for almost all common materials the Poisson's ratio is positive. In 1987, Lakes first discovered negative Poisson's ratio effect in polyurethane (PU) foam with re-entrant structures, which was named anti-rubber, auxetic, and dilatational by later researchers. In this paper, the term 'auxetic' will be used. Since then, investigation on the auxetic materials has held major interest, focusing on finding more materials with negative Poisson's ratio, and on examining the mechanisms, properties and applications. Therefore, more materials were found to have the counter-intuitive effect of auxeticity due to different structural or microstructrual mechanisms. The present article reviews the latest advances in auxetic materials, their structural mechanisms, performance and applications. (C) 2004 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB The behavior of Rayleigh surface waves and the first mode of the Love waves in isotropic media with positive and negative Poisson's ratio is compared. It is shown that the Rayleigh wave velocity increases with decreasing Poisson's ratio, and it increases especially rapidly for negative Poisson's ratios less than -0.75. It is demonstrated that, for positive Poisson's ratios, the vertical component of the Rayleigh wave displacements decays with depth after some initial increase, while for negative Poisson's ratios, there is a monotone decrease. The Rayleigh waves are characterized by elliptic trajectories of the particle motion with the change of the rotation direction at critical depths and by the linear vertical polarization at these depths. It is found that the elliptic orbits are less elongated and the critical depths are greater for negative Poisson's ratios. It is shown that the stress distribution in the Rayleigh waves varies nonmonotonically with the dimensionless depth as (positive or negative) Poisson's ratio varies. The stresses increase strongly only as Poisson's ratio tends to -1. It is shown that, in the case of an incompressible thin covering layer, the velocity of the first mode of the Love waves strongly increases for negative Poisson's ratios of the half-space material. If the thickness of the incompressible layer is large, then the wave very weakly penetrates into the half-space for any value of its Poisson's ratio. For negative Poisson's ratios, the Love wave in a layer and a half-space is mainly localized in the covering layer for any values of its thickness and weakly penetrates into the half-space. For the first mode of the Love waves, it was discovered that there is a strong increase in the maximum of one of the shear stresses on the interface between the covering layer and the half-space as Poisson's ratios of both materials decrease. For the other shear stress, there is a stress jump on the interface and a more complicated dependence of the stress on Poisson's ratio on both sides of the interface.

AB A novel two-dimensional (2D) semiconducting carbon allotrope is proposed by inserting alkyne into tetrahexcarbon. This new carbon allotrope consists of tetra-rings and acetylenic linkages and is called TAL-carbon. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first 2D carbon allotrope composed of sp-sp(2)-sp(3) hybridized carbon atoms. Due to its unique puckered structure, TAL-carbon is the fourth 2D carbon material with an intrinsic in-plane negative Poisson ratio (NPR) reported after graphene, penta-graphene, and tetrahexcarbon. Materials with NPR exhibit a wide range of potential applications in biomedicine, aerospace industries, and precision instruments. TAL-carbon has an indirect band gap of 1.614 eV. At room temperature, it exhibits high in-plane electron mobility of up to similar to 3.5 x 10(4) cm(2)V(-1)s(-1), which is 30 times higher than monolayer black phosphorus and two orders of magnitude higher than monolayer MoS2. The phonon dispersion curves and in-plane elastic constants indicate that TAL-carbon is dynamically and mechanically stable. Its equibiaxial strain limit reaches 13.7%, similar to that of graphene. An ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulation demonstrates that TAL-carbon is thermally stable at 300 K and 1000 K. The results show that TAL-carbon is a promising 2D auxetic material for applications in nanomechanics and nanoelectronics.

AB In the current work, the concept of auxetic structures design is introduced into carbon nanotube-reinforced composite (CNTRC) laminate. Larger values of negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) of CNTRC laminate are obtained by setting the optimal orientation. Meanwhile, a theoretical model is presented for the nonlinear dynamic response of functionally graded (FG) CNTRC beam with NPR. Using Reddy's higher order shear deformation plate theory with von Karman's strain-displacement relations, the motion equations are obtained A two-perturbation approach and the fourth-order Runge Kutta method are then used to obtain the time-deflection curve of the auxetic FG-CNTRC beam. The effects of factors such as the CNT distribution, thermal field and foundation stiffness on the dynamic characteristic of the auxetic FG-CNTRC beam are studied in details. Numerical results indicate that the thermal-mechanical behavior of FG-CNTRC beams might be significantly improved by determining a proper distribution of CNTs. Furthermore, the results show that the change of temperature and foundation stiffness have a significant effect on the dynamic characteristic of FG-CNTRC laminated beams with NPR.

AB This paper discusses a helical auxetic structure which has a diverse range of practical applications. The mechanical properties of the system can be determined by particular combinations of geometry and component material properties; finite element analysis is used to investigate the static behavior of these structures under tension. Modeling criteria are determined and design issues are discussed. A description of the different strain-dependent mechanical phases is provided. It is shown that the stiffnesses of the component fibers and the initial helical wrap angle are critical design parameters, and that strain-dependent changes in cross-section must be taken into consideration: we observe that the structures exhibit nonlinear behavior due to nonzero component Poisson's ratios. Negative Poisson's ratios for the helical structures as low as -5 are shown. While we focus here on the structure as a yarn our findings are, in principle, scaleable.

However, the traditional jounce bumpers cannot achieve ideal mechanical performance and are difficult for parametric optimization due to its various shapes which are hard for parameterization. In this paper, a cylinder auxetic structure was introduced and applied as the suspension jounce bumper. Auxetic jounce bumper can be primarily defined by several variables. With tunable structure parameters, a large region of mechanical performances can be realized. In order to evaluate and optimize the performance of auxetic jounce bumpers, they were assembled into vehicle models to conduct virtual ride comfort tests under bump road. The maximum vertical acceleration of vehicle was defined as the objective function of the optimization problem of auxetic jounce bumper. On the purpose of improving optimization efficiency, Gaussian process regression method was employed to establish the metamodel of auxetic jounce bumper based on the sample set created by orthogonal design of experiments method. A series hybrid GA-SQP (Genetic algorithm-Sequential quadratic programming) algorithm, provided with both global and fast local searching abilities, was used for the optimization of auxetic jounce bumper. For comparison, GA algorithm was also applied for auxetic jounce bumper optimization alone. It is proved that the proposed optimization process is accurate and can improve optimization efficiency. Then the optimized design through hybrid algorithm was compared with original design. The maximum vertical acceleration of vehicle when travelling through bump was reduced with optimized design, and the vehicle ride comfort performance was improved.

AB Size effects are explored experimentally in a tetragonal lattice structure. Size dependence of rigidity is nonclassical elastic and is interpreted via Cosserat elasticity. The characteristic lengths are about a third the cell size. The Cosserat characteristic length for torsion is t=5.6mm. The characteristic length for bending is b=5.4mm. The size effect in torsion was a factor 4.5 in rigidity. The ratio of characteristic length to cell size is larger than in fully stretch dominated lattices but smaller than in bend dominated honeycombs or foams.

AB Masonry buildings constructed along busy roads are vulnerable to vehicular impacts resulting in damage to property and harm to occupants. This paper presents two strategies that use either carbon fibre or auxetic composite render for mitigating the adverse effects of such impacts and compares the merits of the two strategies. As masonry is a relatively low strength brittle material, the rendering material should possess high energy absorption characteristics (as in auxetic composite) or high strength (as in carbon fibre composite) properties for impact damage mitigation. Towards this end, finite element models incorporating material and contact nonlinearities and (recently developed) carbon fabric and auxetic fabric composite renders possessing positive and negative Poisson's ratios respectively are developed and applied. These models are validated using experimental datasets and then applied to masonry walls impacted laterally at velocities ranging from 6 km/h to 100 km/h. Results show that the failure mechanism of masonry walls varies from global to local with the increase in the impact velocity and that the auxetic composite render significantly minimises debonding risks, enhances energy dissipation characteristics, reduces the impact force and the impact damage on the masonry walls, compared to carbon fibre composite render.

ID TOPOLOGY OPTIMIZATION; SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; BEHAVIOR
AB Using a continuum-based design sensitivity analysis (DSA) method, a configuration design optimization method is developed for curved Kirchhoff beams with shape memory polymers (SMP), from which we systematically synthesize lattice structures achieving target negative Poisson's ratio. A SMP phenomenological constitutive model for small strains is utilized. A Jaumann strain, based on the geometrically exact beam theory, is additively decomposed into elastic, stored, and thermal parts. Non-homogeneous displacement boundary conditions are employed to impose mechanical loadings. At each equilibrium configuration, an additional nonlinear analysis is performed to calculate the Poisson's ratio and its design sensitivity of the SMP material. The design objectives are twofold: for purely elastic materials, lattice structures are designed to achieve prescribed Poisson's ratios under finite compressive deformations. Also, SMP-based lattice structures are synthesized to possess target Poisson's ratios in specified temperature ranges. The analytical design sensitivity of the Poisson's ratio is verified through comparison with finite difference sensitivity. Several configuration design optimization examples are demonstrated.

AB Auxetic cellular materials are modern materials which have some unique and superior mechanical properties. As a consequence of the structural deformation of their internal cellular structure they exhibit a negative Poisson's ratio, i.e. they significantly increase in volume if stretched and vice versa. The effect of negative Poisson's ratio is use full in many applications to enhance certain physical properties such like the density, stiffness, fracture toughness, energy absorption and damping. These properties can be further tailored by using variable cell geometry and density distribution, which can be achieved with functionally graded porosity of auxetic materials. This review paper provides the state-of-the-art overview of the auxetic materials, their development, most common geometries, fabrication methods, mechanical properties, applications and further possibilities for their development.

AB In this paper, the design, manufacturing and characterization of two-dimensional warp-knitted textiles with auxetic performance is reported. Four warp-knitted structures based on a rotational hexagonal structure are produced, and these structures can lead to a negative Poisson's ratio mathematically. The testing results have confirmed that the knitting structure of the front bar, as well as let-off values of the front bar's chain parts, has a great effect, and auxetic properties of the warp-knitted textiles have a complicated relationship with the rotation angle. These novel structures can expand the applied area of auxetic structures.

AB Materials with negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) effects have been studied for decades. However, the studies have mainly focused on 2D periodic structures which only have NPR effects in certain in-plane directions. In this paper, a novel concept is proposed to develop composite structures with isotropic NPR effects using NPR random inclusions. The study starts from a finite element analysis of deformation mechanisms of two 2D representative cells which are embedded with a re-entrant square and a re-entrant triangle. respectively. Based on the analysis results, the re-entrant triangles are selected as random inclusions into a matrix to form 2D composite structures. Four such composite structures are built with different numbers of inclusions through a parametric model, and their NPR effects and mechanical behaviors are analyzed using the finite element method. The results show that the isotropic NPR effects of composites can be obtained with high random re-entrant inclusions. Thus, the novel concept proposed is numerically proved by this study.

AB This paper investigates the nonlinear bending behavior of sandwich beams with functionally graded (FG) negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) honeycomb core in thermal environments. The novel constructions of sandwich beams with three FG configurations of re-entrant honeycomb cores through the beam thickness direction are proposed for the first time. The temperature-dependent material properties of both face sheets and core of the sandwich beam are considered. 3D full scale finite element analyses are conducted to investigate the nonlinear bending behavior and the variation of effective Poisson's ratio (EPR) of the sandwich beam in the large deflection region. The numerical simulations are carried out for the sandwich beams with FG-NPR honeycomb core, from which results for the same sandwich beam with uniform distributed NPR honeycomb core are obtained as a comparator. Finite element results showed that the thickness change of sandwich beams with NPR honeycomb cores are distinctly out of ordinary, and the NPR sandwich beams have significantly lower load-bending moment curves compared with those with positive Poisson's ratio cores. The effects of functionally graded configurations, load distribution types, boundary conditions, temperature changes and length-to-thickness ratios on the bending load-deflection curves and EPR-deflection curves of sandwich beams are discussed in detail.

ID MICROSTRUCTURE; BEHAVIOR
AB There is a growing interest in using additive manufacturing to produce smart structures, which have the capability to respond to thermal and mechanical stimuli. In this report, Selective Laser Melting (SLM) is used to build a Negative Poisson's Ratio (NPR) TiNi-based Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) structure, creating a multi-functional structure that could be used as reusable armour. The study assesses the influence of SLM process parameters (laser power, scan speed, and track spacing) on the microstructural and structural integrity development in a Ti-rich TiNi alloy, as well as the impact of the post-process homogenisation treatment on the microstructure and phase transformations. The builds generally shows stress-induced cracks and residual porosity, which could be minimised through process optimisation. Nonetheless, the homogenisation treatment is essential to reduce the fraction of Ti2Ni intermetallics, which are known to disturb the B19'-chemistry, and hence the required phase transformation temperatures. The optimum process parameters are finally used to fabricate NPR structures, which were mechanically tested to validate the Poisson's ratio predictions. A higher ductility was observed in the structures that have undergone the homogenisation treatment. (C) 2016 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Auxetics with negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) can expand dimensions along the direction perpendicular to the tensile direction, such as rigid rotation, reentrant and chiral structures, etc. The mechanical performances of chiral metastructures are closely related to internal defects and interactions between defects. In this paper, two types of irregular chiral structures with Gaussian dispersion of circular node positions and missing ligaments are designed, namely: anti-tetrachiral metastructure and tetrachiral hybrid metastructure. These two types of chiral metastructures are characterized by node radius, ligament thickness, ligament length, the circular node center dispersion range, and missing ligament percentages. Effects of random node distribution range and cell wall missing percentage on the elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio of chiral metastructures are investigated through experimental tests and finite element (FE) simulation systematically. Through dimensionless analysis, it is found that ligament thickness has remarkable influence on the negative Poisson's ratio. Effect of missing ligament on the mechanical properties of the structure is greater than effect of random node center dispersion. With the increase of ligament missing percentage, the resultant modulus of chiral metastructures decreases, and the corresponding NPR increases.

AB X-ray microtomography has been used to study in situ the uniaxial tensile response of low-density polyurethane foam. Two variants have been examined, one before and one after treatment to generate auxetic behaviour. For both variants, microstructurally faithful finite element (FE) models have been constructed from the initial tomographs. For each variant a series of tomographs have been collected during progressive straining. Poisson's ratios of 0.30 (conventional, non-auxetic) and -0.22 (auxetic) have been measured for the two variants by digital image correlation (DIC) between successive images. By comparison, the FE models exhibited Poisson's ratio's of 0.5 and -0.3, respectively. Key micromechanical mechanisms responsible for the auxetic effect have been observed during straining, such as the straightening of bent ribs and rotation of nodes (joints), compared to changes in the angles between essentially straight struts for the non-auxetic variant. The microstructurally faithful FE models confirm the mechanisms observed in the experiments and enable characteristic rib and node behaviour to be followed in greater detail.

AB Currently, available results for the large deflection of circular isotropic membranes are valid for Poisson's ratio of 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 only. This paper explores the deflection of circular membranes when the membrane material is auxetic, i.e., when they possess negative Poisson's ratio and compared against conventional ones. Due to the multistage calculations involved in the exact method, a generic semi-empirical model is proposed to facilitate convenient and direct computation of the membrane deflection as a function of the radial distance; additionally, a specific semi-empirical model is given to provide a more accurate maximum deflection. Comparison of deflection distributions verifies the validity of the semi-empirical model vis-a-vis the exact model. The deflection of circular membrane increases with the diminishing effect as the Poisson's ratio of the membrane material becomes more negative.

ID NEGATIVE POISSON RATIO; MICROPOROUS MATERIALS; COMPOSITES
AB A novel molecular network structure that has the unusual property of a negative Poisson's ratio has been modelled. This network is a combination of acetylene bonds and benzene rings that can be designed to have a range of different elastic constants and anisotropy. Molecular modelling techniques have been used to predict the elastic constants. The Young's moduli range between 20 and 117 GPa and Poisson's ratios between - 0.94 and 1.4 are predicted, depending on the exact details of the network geometry, These values are within die limits for an orthotropic elastic material.    Alternative analytical and finite-element models have also been used to try to simplify the calculations needed to predict the properties of the network. It is shown that considerable reductions in computational complexity, without an undue loss of accuracy, can be achieved. This method represents a new approach that is of use where complex network structures are built up from relatively simple, predictable sub-units.

AB Poisson's ratio (PR) is defined as the negative ratio between the lateral strain and the longitudinal strain of a material under tensile or compressive loading condition. Auxetic fabrics are those having a negative PR, which means that when their longitudinal strain is positive, their lateral strain is also positive, and vice versa. In this work, tensile and forming properties of auxetic warp-knitted spacer fabrics were investigated and compared with those of the conventional warp-knitted spacer fabrics. Both uniaxial tensile tests and hemispherical compression experiments were conducted, and the relationships of the tensile and forming properties with the auxetic effect were discussed in terms of different fabric structural parameters. The results show that the auxetic warp-knitted spacer fabrics have a prolonged low stress stage in the wale direction, indicating that they are more prone to undergo deformation along the wale direction, and fabric with a longer low stress stage has a better auxetic effect. The results also show that the formability of auxetic warp-knitted spacer fabrics is much better than that of conventional warp-knitted spacer fabrics, due to the much low forming energies required under hemispherical compression, which can be affected by many factors such as auxetic effect, fabric thickness and stiffness, yarn materials and the structure of the spacer layer. When all other parameters are similar, auxetic fabric with a better auxetic effect will have better formability. The study has provided useful information for the design and application of this type of nonconventional spacer fabrics.

AB Auxetic metamaterials have unique structural designs exhibiting zero or negative Poisson' ratios during stretch/compression processes, which enable many critical applications such as sensing technology, wearable devices, and weight reduction parts. However, it is difficult to achieve ideal performance of various structural designs through geometry manipulation due to the beam/wall buckling under large strain. One way to minimize the occurrence of buckling is by introducing the high elasticity on the joints, but trade-offs exist among different mechanical behaviors. To this end, this study proposes to use a multi-material combining with the structure optimization to design an auxetic structure. The basic re-entrant structure is employed due to its simplicity, and finite element method (FEM) is adopted to demonstrate the effectiveness of this newly proposed strategy regarding the auxetic behaviors. For this multi-material structure, a different Young's modulus is designed to apply on the additional arch structure. A series of simulations, which consider the influence of the mechanical properties, are conducted to investigate the change of auxetic behaviors such as stress distribution, Poisson's ratio, and equivalent Young's modulus against the applied material properties. The results indicate that the mechanical properties are strongly affected by the geometry design and the applied materials properties. Meanwhile, the buckling effect of the beam/wall could be eliminated if the hinge strength is small enough. The trade-off between equivalent mechanical properties and Poisson's ratio could also be tuned through this newly material-based design.

AB Carbon-based nanomaterials have attracted significant attention due to their unique physical properties. In this study, various multi-dimensional graphitic architectures are constructed by spanning fullerenes with carbon nanotube (CNT) super-bonds. The mechanical properties of these novel architectures are systematically investigated by full atomistic simulations. The stress and strain of 1D nano-bamboo structures upon the onset of instability are almost constant, about 1/5 and 1/2, respectively, of those of a perfect CNT. The deformation and fracture behavior of 2D and 3D periodic graphitic nanostructures are largely dictated by the inter-fullerene distance and loading orientation. Surprising negative Poisson's ratio observed in 2D and 3D networks is revealed to originate as a result of curvature-flattening or rigid mechanical model. The magnitude of Poisson's ratio is strongly dependent on the level of strain, CNT length as well as temperature. The insight on the deformation mechanism of these periodic graphitic nanostructures will facilitate the integration of low-dimensional materials towards high-dimensional organized structures to realize targeted multi-functional properties.

AB With the generalized gradient approximation, our work presents a comparative research for elastic properties, carrier mobility and thermodynamic properties of InX (X = O, S, Se, Te) monolayers using first principles computational density functional theory (DFT). Among the four indium compounds of the same main group, they all show isotropic Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio. Among them, the Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of InO are the largest, reaching 79.1 Nm(-1) and 0.44, respectively. At the same time, we also calculated the cohesive energy of each primitive cell to explain their relationship. For the sake of studying the thermodynamic properties, the Helmholtz free energy in various area, area change, two-dimension bulk moduli, heat capacity of constant pressure and constant volume in different temperature are analyzing in detail. The heat capacity of both constant pressure and constant volume and thermal expansion coefficient adhere to the trend of InTe > InSe > InS > InO in the same temperature. Moreover, InO, InS and InSe have the negative thermal expansion coefficient at the low temperature. Furthermore, we used the deformation potential theory to calculate the carrier mobility, analyzing their elastic constants, deformation potential constants, and the effective mass of electrons and holes, and found that the effective mass of electrons is isotropic.

AB Negative through-the-thickness Poisson's ratios are investigated macroscopically and microscopically in the elastic-viscoplastic behavior of angle-ply carbon fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP) laminates. For this purpose, an analysis method is proposed based on a homogenization theory for nonlinear time-dependent composites with point-symmetric internal structures. This method is able to efficiently analyze both the macroscopic and microscopic elastic-viscoplastic properties of angle-ply CFRP laminates fully modeled with microstructures consisting of fibers and a matrix. Using the proposed method, the elastic-viscoplastic analysis of angle-ply carbon fiber/epoxy laminates with various laminate configurations is performed to investigate their Poisson's ratios in the viscoplastic region. It is revealed that, for a range of laminate configurations, the through-the-thickness Poisson's ratios exhibit negative values which become increasingly negative as the viscoplastic deformation progresses in the laminates. The effect of strain rate on this increasing negativity is also demonstrated, and microscopic mechanisms are investigated to explain this trend. It is further shown that the increasing negativity significantly affects microscopic interlaminar stress distributions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this study we present an improved approach for the development of auxetics based on the use of deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) after a high-precision mask fabrication procedure. The whole process stands out for its precision (reaching nanometric detail), for the high aspect ratio (AR) attainable and for the possibility of promoting mass production. The quality of the proposed strategy is verified by the manufacture of an auxetic cantilever and bridged structures using two common planar auxetic geometries. The present process significantly increases the precision and AR of the micro-auxetics obtained when compared to state-of-the-art micromachining procedures and solves common challenges linked to structure adhesion to the substrate. The potential of the manufactured structures for the development of resonant structures is analyzed by means of finite-element-method-(FEM) based simulations, showing resonances in the megahertz range. A final application example, linked to monitoring cell culture processes upon auxetic scaffolds, is also proposed and analyzed by computational procedures. The initial cell culture results are also included and help to validate the scaffolds obtained and the materials used for future tissue engineering studies.

AB We perform molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the Poisson's ratio of graphene oxide. We find that the Poisson's ratio can be effectively tuned by increasing the degree of oxidation of graphene oxide. More specifically, the Poisson's ratio decreases linearly from positive to negative with increasing oxidation, turning negative at room temperature for a degree of oxidation of 0.27, and reaching a value of -0.567 for fully oxidized graphene. The oxidation dependence of the Poisson's ratio is attributed to the tension-induced suppression of the ripples resulting from the oxidation, whose amplitude increases with increasing oxidation. Finally, we also demonstrate the temperature dependence of the Poisson's ratio in the graphene oxide.

AB A nontrivial periodic network of contacting infinite rigid cylinders is given. It is shown that the mutual contact constraints can exhaust all the degrees of freedom of the network but one, which is the primary cell size. In effect, the network can only expand or shrink uniformly, exhibiting the extreme Poisson ratio of -1. This may explain why inorganic and biological fibrous materials often have negative Poisson ratios and shows a way to design tubular or fibrous structural units for auxetic materials.

The different D-functions which denote the generalized distance between the equivalent elastic tensor of the base cell and the prescribed elastic tensor can be used as the minimization objective in this optimization model. The proposed effective elastic properties are obtained through the homogenization method. Then these optimization problems are solved using the method of moving asymptotes. As demonstrated by examples, this numerical model can be used to design single length scale materials with prescribed elastic properties, including negative poisson's ratio material and material with bulk modulus on the upper Hash in-Shtrikman(HS) bound.

AB Auxetic materials and structures are increasingly used in various fields because of their unusual properties. Auxetic tubular structures have been fabricated and studied due to their potential to be adopted as oesophageal stents where only tensile auxetic performance is required. However, studies on compressive mechanical properties of auxetic tubular structures are limited in the current literature. In this paper, we developed a simple tubular structure which exhibits auxetic behaviour in both compression and tension. This was achieved by extending a design concept recently proposed by the authors for generating 3D metallic auxetic metamaterials. Both compressive and tensile mechanical properties of the auxetic tubular structure were investigated. It was found that the methodology for generating 3D auxetic metamaterials could be effectively used to create auxetic tubular structures as well. By properly adjusting certain parameters, the mechanical properties of the designed auxetic tubular structure could be easily tuned.

AB In the presented paper, three types of auxetic structures were produced with direct 3D printing and their compressive mechanical properties were tested. Samples were prepared from acrylic material suitable for high-resolution direct printing. Three different structures exhibiting in-plane and volumetric negative strain-dependent Poisson's ratio were selected for the analysis: two-dimensional missing-rib cut, two-dimensional inverted (re-entrant) honeycomb and three-dimensional inverted (re-entrant) honeycomb. The samples were subjected to quasi-static compression, from which stress-strain relationships were established. For a proper strain evaluation, digital-image correlation was applied to measure full-field displacements on the sample surfaces. From the displacement fields, true strain/true stress curves were derived for each sample. Furthermore, for each structure a three-dimensional FE model was developed using beam elements and subjected to identical loading conditions. Then, experimentally obtained stress-strain relationships were compared with numerically obtained results. For all the tested auxetic structures, the compressive behaviour was predicted well by the FE models. This demonstrates that parametric FE models can be used to tune the design parameters of the structures with a negative Poisson's ratio to optimize their overall properties.

AB General properties of the theoretic creep curves for volumetric, longitudinal, and lateral strains generated by the Rabotnov physically nonlinear constitutive equation for non-aging viscoelastic materials under uniaxial loading are studied analytically assuming four material functions of the relation are arbitrary. The expressions for Poisson's ratio via the strain state parameter and via four material functions of the model are derived. The Poisson ratio dependence on time, stress level and material functions are examined. General two-sided bound for its range is obtained. It is proved that the Rabotnov relation is able to simulate non-monotone behavior and sign changes of lateral strain and Poisson's ratio. The restrictions on material functions providing negative Poisson's ratio values are found and the criterion for its nondependence on time is formulated.

AB A novel composite structure with isotropic negative Poisson's ratio has been presented in our previous paper [1]. However, the previous study has only focused on the effects of random inclusions. In this work, an extended numerical study on the effects of materials properties and geometry features of inclusions is conducted in order to better understand the deformation mechanism and mechanical properties of this kind of composites. Using finite element method, the overall negative Poisson's ratio effects and mechanical properties of the composites are analyzed in terms of different factors including thickness and stiffness of inclusions with uniform and non-uniform struts. The structure optimization of the composites with better negative Poisson's ratio effect and mechanical performance are discussed based on the numerical calculated results. The study shows that the Poisson's ratio effects and mechanical properties of the composites are significantly affected by geometrical features, stiffness and boundary conditions of inclusions.

AB The linear thermal expansion coefficients (LTEC) and thermomechanics of single-layer black and blue phosphorus are systematically studied using first-principles based on quasiharmonic approximation. We find the thermal expansion of black phosphorus is very anisotropic. The LTEC along zigzag direction has a turning from negative to positive at around 138 K, while the LTEC along armchair direction is positive (except below 8 K) and about 2.5 times larger than that along zigzag direction at 300 K. For blue phosphorus, the LTEC is negative in the temperature range from 0 to 350 K. In addition, we find that the Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of black phosphorus along zigzag direction are 4 to 5 times larger than those along armchair direction within considered temperature range, showing a remarkable anisotropic in-plane thermomechanics property. The mechanisms of these peculiar thermal properties are also explored. This work provides a theoretical understanding of the thermal expansion and thermomechanics of this single layer phosphorus family, which will be useful in nanodevices. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this paper, a sandwich panel composed of two metal face sheets and a three-dimensional (3D) isotropic foam core with negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) was established via FEM. The 3D NPR isotropic foam core was achieved by using triaxial compression method on a cubic Voronoi model, which was created based on Voronoi tessellation technique to achieve different randomness for the core (beta). The Poisson's ratio of the Voronoi core dropped rapidly at first, and then increased with an increasing triaxial pre-compression ratio eta. A minimum Poisson's ratio, -0.12, was obtained when the randomness of the Voronoi core beta = 0.29 and the triaxial pre-compression ratio eta = 0.4. The blast resistance of the proposed composite sandwich panel (CSP) with cores that have different beta and eta under 300 g equivalent TNT explosion was analyzed. Results show that with an increase of eta, the maximum stress on the foundation surface of CSP5 gradually decreased, and then slightly increased. The maximum stress on the foundation surface of CSP5 can reach a minimum value when beta = 0.29 and eta = 0.4. The proposed CSP with the minimum Poisson's ratio core exhibited the highest blast resistance performance, which was approximately 1.5 times higher than CSP with traditional re-entrant NPR structure core.

AB Honeycomb structure containing curved reentrant sides with negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) was designed and the impact dynamics behaviors were studied by finite element method. The Poisson's ratio and the energy absorption capacity of the honeycomb structure with different arc angle were studied under different compression velocities. The results show that the Poisson's ratio of the honeycomb structure can reach -0.373 with arc angle of 180 degrees. The energy absorption capacity of the honeycomb structure increased with an increasing compression velocity, and the deformation mode changed from X type to V type and I type. When the compression velocity is low, the dynamic response curve of the honeycomb structure with arc angle of 180 degrees has the characteristics of two-stage plateau region. When the compression velocity is high, the energy absorption capacity of the honeycomb structure increased with an increasing arc angle. When the arc angle is higher than 120 degrees, the honeycomb structure has NPR effect, and the energy absorption capacity of the honeycomb structure is better than the honeycomb structure with other arc angles.

AB Auxetic fabrics made of nonauxetic yarns have gained increasing interest of textile scientists. Most recently, single-layered bistretch auxetic woven fabrics made of nonauxetic yarns based on parallel in-phase zigzag foldable geometry have been reported to have auxetic behavior when stretched along both principal directions. It is also reported that this geometry can possibly be realized into double-layered woven fabrics. In addition, it is suggested that the phenomenon of differential shrinkage can be exploited to realize another variation of foldable geometry such as out-of-phase zigzag foldable structures into woven fabrics. Therefore, herein, two possibilities aimed to be explored are double-layered auxetic woven fabric based on parallel in-phase zigzag foldable geometry and single-layered fabrics based on out-of-phase zigzag foldable geometry that are developed using the phenomenon of differential shrinkage to realize these geometries into the woven fabric structures. Five different auxetic woven fabric samples are fabricated using elastic and nonelastic yarns on a conventional weaving machine and tested along two principal directions. The testing results show that all the developed fabrics have auxetic behavior in both principal directions, and the placement of weaves and weft yarn arrangements has an obvious effect.

AB This present study investigates experimentally and numerically the crush response and energy absorption performances of auxetic foam-filled square tubes under quasi-static axial loading. Three different structures: empty, conventional and auxetic foam-filled square tubes have been compared and examined with respect to the deformation modes and load-displacement curves. Standard compression tests were conducted on the tubes to evaluate the influence of auxetic foam in the energy absorption of empty tubes. Moreover, results from computer simulation have also been supplemented to further examine the abovementioned effect It is discovered that the auxetic foam-filled square tube is superior to empty and conventional foam-filled square tubes in terms of all studied crashworthiness indicators.

AB A two-dimensional triangular finite element formulation including an extra degree of freedom was derived on the basis of Eringen's micropolar elasticity theory. The linear triangular element and a corresponding computer program were developed to investigate the relation between the Poisson's ratio of re-entrant honeycomb structure using various structural geometric parameters.. According to Pur numerical results, the honeycomb structure can exhibit a negative Poisson's ratio with the appropriate ' re-entrant angle. We also found that the Poisson's ratio values varied when changing the honeycomb structure cell rib length and width. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Auxetic materials have unique properties which still require further evaluation. One of the least researched topics in terms of auxetics is their fatigue strength. In this article, high-cycle fatigue life of auxetic re-entrant structure unit cell was calculated using Finite Element Analysis. A fully reversed cycle consisting of alternating compressive and tensile loads was applied. Also, stress-life data had to be defined as approximated Wohler's curve. Result in form of cycles to failure contour plot was compared with corresponding contour plot obtained for regular hexagonal honeycomb lattice unit cell. It was observed that re-entrant cell has significantly higher fatigue strength than non-auxetic honeycomb cell. The test was also carried out for the models of the structure made of array of unit cells. Their results confirmed the previous observations which bring the conclusion that auxetic materials exhibit superior fatigue life properties compared with regular microstructures.
